00:00.000 --> 00:04.960
 The following is a conversation with Ryan Hall, one of the most insightful minds and systems

00:04.960 --> 00:09.920
 thinkers in the martial arts world. He's a black belt in Jiu Jitsu, accomplished competitor,

00:09.920 --> 00:16.800
 an MMA fighter undefeated in the UFC, and truly a philosopher who seeks to understand

00:16.800 --> 00:22.160
 the underlying principles of the martial arts. Jiu Jitsu is such an important part of who I am,

00:22.160 --> 00:25.920
 and I was hoping to share that with folks who might know me only as a researcher.

00:25.920 --> 00:32.800
 I think there is no better person to do that with than Ryan, who somehow, remarkably, I can say is a

00:32.800 --> 00:40.240
 friend, and also a modern day warrior philosopher of the Miyamoto Masashi line of especially dangerous

00:40.240 --> 00:47.600
 and brilliant humans. Also, his amazing wife, Jen Hall, was there as well, so if you hear a

00:47.600 --> 00:53.200
 kind of voice of wisdom coming from above, you know who it is. Quick summary of the sponsors,

01:07.280 --> 01:12.000
 gave me intellectual freedom that I really didn't anticipate was so empowering,

01:12.000 --> 01:16.720
 especially for someone who's trying to find their voice. I hope you'll allow me the chance to really

01:16.720 --> 01:22.480
 try and do that, to step outside of AI, and even science, engineering, history, and so on,

01:22.480 --> 01:31.040
 and on occasion, talk to athletes, musicians, writers, and maybe even comedians who inspire me,

01:31.600 --> 01:36.400
 especially up and coming comedians and musicians like Eric Weinstein, who yes,

01:36.400 --> 01:41.600
 will do a third conversation with soon. I think if I allow myself to expand the range of these

01:41.600 --> 01:46.400
 conversations on occasion, when I do return to science and engineering, I'll bring you perspective

01:46.400 --> 01:54.480
 and also a little bit more fun, and a few extra listeners that may not otherwise realize how

01:54.480 --> 02:01.200
 fascinating artificial intelligence, robotics, mathematics, and engineering truly is. All that

02:01.200 --> 02:06.720
 said, please skip the episodes that don't interest you. You don't have to listen to all of them.

02:06.720 --> 02:13.520
 Trust me, as someone who is a bit or a lot OCD, that idea is quite unpleasant, but life,

02:13.520 --> 02:20.160
 friends, is full of unpleasant things. But as Hunter S. Thompson suggested, and I suggest as

02:20.160 --> 02:25.760
 well, you should still buy the ticket and take the ride. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on

03:04.880 --> 03:11.360
 use it to build muscle, endurance, or even just warm up. In fact, I first heard about this kind of

03:11.360 --> 03:17.920
 electrical muscle stimulation device in reading that Bruce Lee used it. He was an inspiration to me

03:17.920 --> 03:22.800
 as someone who practices first principles thinking, especially in a discipline where

03:22.800 --> 03:28.080
 conventional thinking is everywhere. He created a martial art called Jeet Kune Do that is in many

03:28.080 --> 03:33.280
 ways, at least philosophically in his hybrid approach, a precursor to modern day mixed martial

03:33.280 --> 03:38.960
 arts. There's a special kind of deep philosophical thinking that combat athletes or Jiu Jitsu

03:38.960 --> 03:45.440
 practitioners do that is unlike any other. I think it's grounded in the humbling process of

03:45.440 --> 03:51.200
 getting your ass kicked a lot that removes any illusion of intellectual superiority. I think

03:51.200 --> 03:57.120
 the journey towards wisdom starts when you humbly admit to yourself that you know very little or

03:57.120 --> 04:04.400
 almost nothing. Anyway, go to power.com slash Lex and use go Lex at checkout to get 20% off

04:24.160 --> 04:29.920
 me read a few lines from a Russian song by Vladimir Vesotsky called Annabella in Paris,

04:29.920 --> 04:34.880
 that you'll start to understand if you sign up to Babel.

04:45.520 --> 04:50.720
 This song always made me smile because it resonates with my own life. It translates loosely to

04:50.720 --> 04:56.560
 she's been to Paris. Paris for a Russian I suppose symbolizing a fancy life and that the guy can

04:56.560 --> 05:01.200
 never quite fit into that kind of life. Expensive things, nice restaurants, cars, all of that.

05:01.760 --> 05:07.040
 I was thinking about what song is equivalent in English. Maybe Uptown Girl by Billy Joel is

05:07.040 --> 05:13.520
 similar in spirit but very different in style. I just watched the video on YouTube for Uptown Girl

05:13.520 --> 05:19.760
 and it's basically Billy Joel dressed up as a mechanic but dancing in a way that I'm pretty

05:19.760 --> 05:26.400
 sure no mechanic has ever danced. Turning the old cringe factor up to 11. Anyway, I always felt like

05:26.400 --> 05:31.520
 I didn't really fit in with the fancy people and that's what this song represents. But back to

05:31.520 --> 05:37.920
 Babel. Get started by visiting babel.com and use colex to get three months free. This show is

05:37.920 --> 05:42.800
 presented by the great, the powerful, the OG sponsor named unofficially after one of my favorite

05:42.800 --> 05:48.800
 musicians, the man in black Johnny Cash. That's Cash App, the number one finance app in the app

05:48.800 --> 05:55.840
 store. When you get it use colex podcast. The Cash App folks are truly amazing people and

05:55.840 --> 06:01.040
 are teaming with ideas for cool contest giveaways and all that kind of stuff. I've been thinking of

06:01.040 --> 06:07.840
 doing some kind of little contest and giving away 42 bucks to a bunch of people who win. It's not so

06:07.840 --> 06:14.800
 much about the money but the glory and the delicious taste of victory. If you have ideas for a contest

06:14.800 --> 06:19.680
 let me know. I was thinking of something like asking people to submit funny inspiring photos or

06:19.680 --> 06:26.720
 videos or audio of using Cash App or any of the sponsors of this podcast really or maybe even just

06:26.720 --> 06:32.240
 funny things related to the podcast like different weird places you might be watching and listening

06:32.240 --> 06:38.320
 to me right now. I'm pretty sure there's somebody out there right now sitting in a hot tub with

06:38.320 --> 06:46.080
 some wine watching me say this. I salute you sir or madam. I may be opening up some floodgates.

06:46.080 --> 06:51.280
 I deeply regret later so please make sure you're wearing clothes and whatever you sent me. There

06:51.280 --> 06:58.400
 will be no naked people in the hot tub as part of this podcast. I have integrity and standards.

06:59.680 --> 07:03.840
 Let me know in the comments what ideas for contest you might have. Again if you get Cash App from

07:03.840 --> 07:09.920
 the App Store or Google Play and use the colex podcast you get $10 and Cash App will also donate

07:09.920 --> 07:15.680
 $10 to FIRST. An organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young

07:15.680 --> 07:23.120
 people around the world. And now here's my conversation with Ryan Hall. Who in your view

07:23.120 --> 07:29.200
 is the greatest warrior in history? Ancient or modern? That's a tough question and again I'm

07:29.200 --> 07:34.160
 no historian by any measure so I'll probably do the worst. Like what are your best bands ever? I'm

07:34.160 --> 07:39.200
 like Metallica and you know so I'll pick the... Metallica just came out with a new album by

07:39.200 --> 07:44.960
 the way. The entire orchestra. That's kind of cool support. Metallica will always be one of the

07:44.960 --> 07:49.120
 greatest. Yeah that's why they were that example. They were a well known yet awesome band. Let me

07:49.120 --> 07:52.480
 say it's like Nickelback or something like that. But that feels cheap because everyone

07:52.480 --> 07:56.720
 makes fun of Nickelback. I don't know. I guess it depends on how you want to define warrior.

07:56.720 --> 08:02.320
 Something that I think about when it comes to trying to evaluate various people or situations

08:02.320 --> 08:07.760
 or things that I've read about or heard about are the circumstances that they were involved in

08:07.760 --> 08:12.160
 because I think a lot of times it's easy to look at the outcomes and obviously we live in an

08:12.160 --> 08:19.040
 outcome driven world and outcomes do matter but at the same time like you look at let's say what

08:19.040 --> 08:23.840
 Cuba has been able to pull off from a combat sports perspective. It's staggering. Like the

08:23.840 --> 08:30.000
 amount of successful Olympic level competitors they have in wrestling, boxing, judo. I mean

08:30.000 --> 08:35.040
 they're a tiny little island with no money and no people. That's shocking. When you think about

08:35.040 --> 08:38.560
 the Olympics in the United States doing well, of course we should do well. I mean Russia should

08:38.560 --> 08:43.120
 do well. China should do well. India should do better than they do. Honestly, obviously it means

08:43.120 --> 08:46.960
 like they're not into it as much or at least certain sports because they have the resources

08:46.960 --> 08:53.200
 people wise. So talent's not going to be an issue. So there's something to like where the starting

08:53.200 --> 08:58.080
 point is. Like that's the argument with like why people say Maradona if I don't know if you're

08:58.080 --> 09:04.320
 into soccer. Oh yeah, big soccer. Okay. They say Maradona is better than Messi because he basically

09:04.320 --> 09:08.960
 carried the team and won the World Cup with a team that wouldn't otherwise win the World Cup.

09:08.960 --> 09:16.080
 And then Messi was only successful in Barcelona because he has like superstars. He's playing

09:16.080 --> 09:20.640
 with other superstars. Right. Yeah, that's fair to say. I mean like you know there's a lot of

09:20.640 --> 09:24.800
 factors that go into let's say winning a soccer game and you know obviously Barcelona you know

09:24.800 --> 09:29.600
 particularly for various points in time at a ridiculous all star squad of world class players.

09:29.600 --> 09:34.000
 But you know let's say for instance maybe they didn't have the creative players in Argentina.

09:34.000 --> 09:38.400
 They needed to get the ball up to Messi. You know they didn't have like the NES and you know

09:38.400 --> 09:43.680
 the you know the again the backing there in the midfield. But because obviously Argentina's always

09:43.680 --> 09:48.000
 had ridiculous attacking players like even alongside Messi but they're like the three killers up front

09:48.000 --> 09:54.000
 and then a little less behind. So it's interesting you say that it depends how you define warrior

09:54.000 --> 09:58.640
 because you can probably take like some of the civil rights leaders. You can go into that

09:58.640 --> 10:03.280
 direction like leaders in general. But if we just look at like the greatest martial artists in

10:03.280 --> 10:07.840
 history in that direction. Do you have somebody in mind? I would say at least three that pop into

10:07.840 --> 10:15.840
 my head and would be Hannibal, Alexander the Great and then maybe Miyamoto Musashi you know

10:15.840 --> 10:22.240
 the two commanders and then one you know guy. But so it's interesting and then again you mentioned

10:22.240 --> 10:27.680
 warriors being able to make a lot out of a little you know Musashi's famous for winning duels you

10:27.680 --> 10:34.480
 know that were oftentimes one on one. You know the Alexander and Hannibal were you know military

10:34.480 --> 10:39.200
 commanders and one of them faced Rome and that was an interesting thing. Oftentimes you know coming

10:39.200 --> 10:44.400
 up with novel tactics, different strategies sometimes under resourced doing having to do

10:44.400 --> 10:48.240
 novel and crazy things. There's skin in the game. That's an interesting thing too. I think a lot

10:48.240 --> 10:51.840
 of times you know it's a if you're playing a video game I don't think you can be a warrior

10:51.840 --> 10:56.400
 because there's just no skin in the game. You get hurt, you lose, that's a bummer. It stings a

10:56.400 --> 11:03.040
 little bit maybe makes you feel slightly disappointed but you know Musashi loses, he loses. Hannibal

11:03.040 --> 11:08.400
 loses, he loses. Alexander loses, he loses and they lose. I guess the people around them lose so

11:08.400 --> 11:13.120
 that's almost like you could use even from a combat sports perspective of Muhammad Ali.

11:13.120 --> 11:17.200
 I mean you consider also their quality of opposition. Musashi was fighting high quality

11:17.200 --> 11:21.120
 opposition obviously Hannibal and Alexander particularly Hannibal were fighting unbelievable

11:21.120 --> 11:26.640
 opposition. Muhammad Ali fought phenomenal opposition but he had skin in the game both in the ring

11:26.640 --> 11:30.640
 and out and that actually meshes with as you mentioned like a civil rights you know type of

11:30.640 --> 11:36.320
 situation where you are under resourced, you're pushing the stone uphill and that was a neat thing

11:36.320 --> 11:41.120
 I think about Muhammad Ali was how much you know personal conviction the man had to have in order

11:41.120 --> 11:46.160
 to pull off what he was able to pull off both in and outside of the ring and that reminds me of

11:46.160 --> 11:48.720
 again some of the other great leaders or great fighters throughout history.

11:48.720 --> 11:55.200
 So what do you make of the kind of very difficult idea that some of these conquerors like Alexander

11:55.200 --> 12:03.600
 the Great and somebody that if you listen to Hardcore History, Odin Carlin who apparently Elon

12:03.600 --> 12:14.480
 Musk is also a big fan of is the Genghis Khan episode. You know a large percent of the world

12:14.480 --> 12:24.080
 is a can call Genghis Khan an ancestor. So the difficult truth is about some of these conquerors

12:24.080 --> 12:30.720
 is that there's a lot of murder and rape and pillage and stealing of resources and all that

12:30.720 --> 12:38.400
 kind of stuff and yet they're often remembered as quite honorable. I mean in the case of Genghis Khan

12:38.400 --> 12:42.880
 there's a lot of people who argue if you look at the historically the ways described

12:42.880 --> 12:54.320
 in full context is he was ultimately like given the time he was a liberator. He was a progressive

12:55.200 --> 13:01.680
 I should say. You know like in terms of the violence and atrocities he committed

13:02.320 --> 13:08.480
 he at least in the stories has always provided the option of not to do that. It's only if you

13:08.480 --> 13:15.760
 resist. You basically have the option do you want to join us or do you want to die and die horribly.

13:17.920 --> 13:23.920
 That's the progressive sort of that's the Bernie Sanders of the era. Nice. So what do you make of

13:23.920 --> 13:31.200
 that that there's so much of these great conquerors there's so much murder that to us now would just

13:31.200 --> 13:37.600
 seem insane. It's funny you mentioned it I think that maybe it's a human nature thing that we want

13:37.600 --> 13:43.360
 to or you know maybe or maybe a misunderstanding thing that we want to cast all of our characters

13:43.360 --> 13:49.120
 and ourselves maybe is entirely good or is entirely negative when you know I guess the

13:49.120 --> 13:55.360
 phrase or the saying you know one man's freedom fighter is another person's terrorist is accurate

13:55.360 --> 14:00.160
 and a lot of times I think you can understand as long as you're able to look from various people's

14:00.160 --> 14:04.560
 perspective. Like if you look at the TV show The Wire which was obviously you know widely

14:04.560 --> 14:08.960
 everybody loves The Wire. I thought that there were everyone I'm not saying anything that's

14:08.960 --> 14:12.320
 that's not been said before compelling characters from all angles whether you like the character

14:12.320 --> 14:17.200
 dislike the character you were able to understand the motivations of people doing various things

14:17.200 --> 14:23.280
 even if they did wrongly they did rightly you know we want to cast all of the demons throughout

14:23.280 --> 14:28.000
 history as completely inhuman when I think that makes it difficult for us to understand them and

14:28.000 --> 14:34.160
 we want to look back at the people that we think of as great and entirely great and I think that

14:34.160 --> 14:38.240
 we're you know we're experiencing the problems with this you know even right now socially and

14:38.240 --> 14:41.280
 politically as we're trying to look back and decide that people we thought were good or not

14:41.280 --> 14:45.360
 good or people we thought were bad are now good rather than going hey there's there's good and

14:45.360 --> 14:50.640
 bad to all things and there are as you mentioned the gang is con thing you don't have to fight back

14:52.080 --> 14:56.160
 you do I respect you for it but then we're going to have a conflict and then we'll see what happens

14:56.160 --> 15:00.000
 and if you lose you're going to be sorry that you did because I have to make it that way if I want

15:00.000 --> 15:05.920
 to continue utilizing this this kind of MO because I need to discourage the next guy from doing what

15:05.920 --> 15:10.640
 you're doing right now and ultimately though I guess that's an interesting thing imagine you

15:10.640 --> 15:17.200
 put every single person on planet earth in a cage crime drops you know also there are certain

15:17.200 --> 15:24.000
 positives to that and I it's just things are as they are it's difficult but that is ultimately

15:24.000 --> 15:28.960
 more the law of the jungle and I think that we're able to supersede some of that now in modern times

15:28.960 --> 15:34.240
 and I think we're fortunate but as you mentioned we look back and say oh this is horrible say no that

15:34.240 --> 15:39.520
 that just is what it is that's how life is at a base level and you know again if you're a lion

15:39.520 --> 15:44.160
 and I'm a gazelle I don't I don't really like it very much but we don't call the lion the bad guy

15:44.800 --> 15:49.520
 we don't sanctify the gazelle or the other way around so it's just it's interesting when you

15:49.520 --> 15:54.800
 pull back some of the controls that we put on our behavior and you know in modern life which I think

15:54.800 --> 16:00.720
 are generally speaking positive you know we get down to how things often are and at the same time

16:02.880 --> 16:08.960
 modern life was built by people like Genghis Khan so then you get down to the ends just to find

16:08.960 --> 16:12.400
 the means it's a tough question these aren't things with easy answers or at least if they are I

16:12.400 --> 16:18.160
 certainly don't have the the smarts to figure out the answers to them but it's difficult I would just

16:18.160 --> 16:21.760
 say people in the world are complicated and layered and depending upon which side of the

16:21.760 --> 16:27.120
 line you're standing on at various times you know you may like or dislike someone but I can't

16:27.120 --> 16:32.000
 remember it's I can't remember whose whose idea was this killing me but it's the veil of ignorance

16:32.000 --> 16:38.400
 I guess the philosophical you know you know idea of the veil of ignorance where I go is is sticking

16:38.400 --> 16:43.760
 everyone in the cage the right thing to do and I say or everyone me and I say well no why well

16:43.760 --> 16:46.960
 it would make my life easier if I just went over and took all of your stuff as long as you couldn't

16:46.960 --> 16:50.640
 stop me I mean of course that's a great idea that's what everyone does in every video game

16:50.640 --> 16:56.640
 but in Skyrim you steal stuff when people aren't around but ultimately you go well this isn't the

16:56.640 --> 17:00.960
 right thing to do because if I were on the other side of it I would I would not appreciate it it's

17:00.960 --> 17:05.760
 it's inherently not a good thing to do I'm only doing it because I think I'm gonna win and that's

17:05.760 --> 17:11.120
 a fine way to be but you don't have the white hat on I guess I would say so I think without those

17:11.120 --> 17:16.880
 philosophical underpinnings to rein us in you know I guess morally speaking it's very difficult to say

17:16.880 --> 17:21.360
 what's right or wrong and you'd say certain actions have a reaction almost like a physics sense

17:21.920 --> 17:28.560
 if you kill everyone in your way for as long as you're able to your life will be easier I mean

17:28.560 --> 17:32.000
 you're setting the table for someone doing the same to you when you're no longer the tough guy but

17:32.000 --> 17:38.080
 it is what it is yeah if you look at like the Instagram channel nature is metal it hurts my

17:38.080 --> 17:49.040
 heart to watch to remind me a comfortable descendant of ape how vicious nature is just unapologetically

17:50.640 --> 17:57.040
 uh just I mean there's a there's a process to it where the bad guy always wins

17:58.640 --> 18:07.520
 the the violence is the solution to most problems or the flip side of that running away from violence

18:07.520 --> 18:13.360
 is the solution depending on your skill set and it's funny to think of us humans with our extra

18:13.360 --> 18:18.480
 little piece of brain that we're somehow trying to figure out like you said in the philosophical

18:18.480 --> 18:26.160
 way how to supersede that how to like move past the viciousness the cruelty the just the cold

18:28.080 --> 18:35.120
 exchange of nature but perhaps it's not so maybe that is nature maybe that's the way of life maybe

18:35.120 --> 18:43.840
 we're trying too hard to uh we're we're being too egotistical and thinking we're somehow separate

18:43.840 --> 18:47.920
 from nature we're somehow distant from that very thing I couldn't agree with you more in fact I

18:47.920 --> 18:53.920
 think actually orson scott card you know was the writer of a great book called enders game um was

18:53.920 --> 18:58.960
 this was a statement that that the main character you know ender uh made in the book his brother

18:58.960 --> 19:05.280
 was brilliant um his brother was like kind of sociopathic brilliant kid that was ended up kicked

19:05.280 --> 19:09.360
 out of the school that they were all into for battle commander dealing with his brother taught him

19:09.360 --> 19:14.480
 that ultimately strength courage the ability to do violence for all the good and the bad of that is

19:15.120 --> 19:18.640
 one of the fundamental most important things to be able to do in life because if you can't

19:18.640 --> 19:23.440
 cause destruction if you can't cause pain you will be forever subject to those who can and I

19:23.440 --> 19:28.160
 think that you mentioned egotism I think that that that's a disease that could obviously strike any

19:28.160 --> 19:32.720
 of us but it's something that we're looking at now we're you know I think we should be unbelievably

19:32.720 --> 19:38.000
 thankful as people that live in the world that that we do um that we can walk down the street

19:38.000 --> 19:42.880
 without having to worry that I'm like well don't worry that that's six foot six 270 pound person

19:42.880 --> 19:47.040
 over there is just gonna leave me alone and I have a Rolex on but whatever and I'll be fine

19:47.040 --> 19:52.000
 because that person's decided to leave me alone because we've all agreed to live in this relatively

19:52.000 --> 19:56.640
 you know sane and or you know constrained society because it benefits all of us and we're doing it

19:56.640 --> 20:01.120
 because of a philosophical underpinning not because nature dictates it be that way because

20:01.120 --> 20:04.720
 nature dictates it going a very very different direction and the only person the only thing

20:04.720 --> 20:10.240
 stopping that person from doing something to me is either me that person or someone else

20:10.240 --> 20:14.720
 that will stand in between us and if I can't do it and there's no one that would stand in between

20:14.720 --> 20:19.600
 us then the only thing stopping that person is that person and I have to hope that they're either

20:19.600 --> 20:25.520
 disinterested or disinclined to do that sort of thing and I think that uh you know it's keeping

20:25.520 --> 20:31.280
 in mind that that that is the fundamental nature of the world whether we like it or not um is

20:31.280 --> 20:37.120
 important and I think the the quest to fundamentally alter human nature is going to be ultimately

20:37.120 --> 20:41.760
 fruitless and then also it's it's a little bit egotistical the lion does what a lion does you

20:41.760 --> 20:47.280
 know we we can try to box it in and we can try to you know guide this direction that direction but

20:47.280 --> 20:53.040
 you know nature is as it is and as it always will be unless we want to start to constrain it

20:53.040 --> 20:57.920
 significantly but now I'm starting to get into individual rights who put me in charge who says

20:57.920 --> 21:01.440
 that I should be the one to make the choices constraining because many of the most awful

21:01.440 --> 21:05.840
 things that have happened throughout history one group or one person has decided to constrain others

21:06.720 --> 21:11.120
 and we don't like Genghis Khan doing that well I'll do that on a little level

21:11.120 --> 21:16.000
 are there going to be benefits and beneficiaries absolutely but there'll be losers in that too

21:16.000 --> 21:18.960
 so I guess it's a it's a dangerous game it's almost like putting on the one ring you know

21:18.960 --> 21:24.160
 we remember when Frodo offered the one ring to Gandalf and Gandalf said no no I would take it away

21:24.160 --> 21:28.720
 I would put it on I would use it out of the desire to do good but through me it would wield

21:28.720 --> 21:33.280
 a power so terrible you can't imagine I think that's that's the big question for anyone that

21:33.280 --> 21:38.960
 decides that's able to have reach and able to have power I mean obviously I can't speak to that

21:38.960 --> 21:44.560
 but imagine you did have national level global level power how would you use it would you try

21:44.560 --> 21:50.800
 to change the world would you be glad that you did down the line I don't know yeah there's I mean

21:50.800 --> 21:55.040
 that's the thing we're struggling now as a society maybe it'd be nice to get your quick comment on

21:55.040 --> 22:03.280
 that which is the people who have traditionally been powerless are now you know seeking a fairer

22:03.280 --> 22:15.440
 society a more equal society and in in attaining more power justly there's also a realization at

22:15.440 --> 22:24.240
 least from my perspective that power corrupts everyone even if you're even if the flag you wave

22:24.240 --> 22:33.520
 is that of of justice right and so you know not to overuse the term but it'd be nice if you have

22:33.520 --> 22:41.120
 thoughts about the whole idea of cancel culture and the internet and and twitter and so on where

22:41.120 --> 22:51.760
 there's a nuanced difficult discussions of race of gender of fairness equality justice all of

22:51.760 --> 22:58.960
 these kinds of things there's a shouting down oftentimes of nuanced discussion of kind of

23:00.560 --> 23:06.160
 trying to reason through these very difficult issues through our history through what our

23:06.160 --> 23:11.360
 future looks like do you have thoughts about the internet discourse that's going on now

23:11.360 --> 23:16.800
 is there something positive yeah I mean we can pull out of this it's an interesting thing to see

23:16.800 --> 23:24.240
 I guess as you mentioned anytime you're wielding power whomever you are doing so carefully is

23:24.240 --> 23:30.160
 important and it's very very easy to look at the people that have power and that are using it poorly

23:30.160 --> 23:35.440
 or have used it poorly and go hey you're the bad guy and then go well of course if I had power

23:35.440 --> 23:41.040
 I'll use it properly and I may intend to use it properly and maybe I will but at the same time

23:41.040 --> 23:49.520
 we see a lot of times people are people are people I think that a lot of the I think if

23:49.520 --> 23:54.400
 you if you believe that that human beings are all one which I do you know no matter whether

23:54.400 --> 23:59.760
 you're here you're there you're you got two arms two legs a heart a brain we all live a similar

23:59.760 --> 24:05.520
 experience you know and obviously with variations on a theme but you know you're no less a human

24:05.520 --> 24:11.600
 being if I you're a person I've never met from China then then some person in Virginia it's we're

24:11.600 --> 24:16.000
 all we're all people and I guess ultimately if I believe that human beings are corruptible and

24:16.000 --> 24:21.760
 that power corrupts and that we're all fallible and we say and do things that either intentionally

24:21.760 --> 24:30.480
 or unintentionally that we wish would not I think that the I have to allow for a space of I guess

24:30.480 --> 24:34.160
 with the word it's almost a religious term but I guess it would just say grace and that's something

24:34.160 --> 24:39.360
 that I see disappearing from discourse in the public or maybe it wasn't there I'm not sure but

24:39.360 --> 24:44.400
 it's interesting you know watching this occur on the internet because also now no longer are you

24:44.400 --> 24:49.200
 and I just having a talk sitting on a on a bus stop it's now in writing everything's in writing

24:49.200 --> 24:52.560
 the old the old saying like don't put that in writing you're like don't put anything in writing

24:52.560 --> 24:57.200
 that's how you get in trouble and basically you know with with the degree to which everything

24:57.200 --> 25:01.600
 is recorded but recorded in tiny little bites it's very very easy for me to wave every less

25:01.600 --> 25:07.040
 little foolish ignorant incorrect or correct thing that someone has ever said or done in their face

25:07.040 --> 25:13.120
 to support whatever argument that I'm trying to make about them or a situation and I think that

25:13.120 --> 25:17.520
 you mentioned cancel culture or you know as it seems to exist obviously this is poisonous on its

25:17.520 --> 25:23.760
 face this is poisonous it's it's the sort of thing that doesn't incentivize proper behavior

25:23.760 --> 25:29.120
 I mean you look at let's say one of the great monsters of history Adolf Hitler obviously who's

25:29.120 --> 25:33.840
 done awful awful things but also for anyone that's a even a minor student of history did

25:33.840 --> 25:39.440
 some positive things as well we don't have to I don't have to embroider this person's crimes I

25:39.440 --> 25:45.280
 don't have to act as if there was nothing good a monster has ever done and nothing bad that that

25:45.280 --> 25:49.360
 a great person throughout history has ever done but imagine the ghosts of Adolf Hitler were to

25:49.360 --> 25:55.120
 pop up and go oh my gosh guys I'm so sorry I I know what I've done but I'd like to apologize

25:55.120 --> 25:59.360
 and start to make it right well I mean you'd hope that you know if he popped up over here you go

25:59.360 --> 26:03.840
 well I don't really like what you've done and I don't like you but at the same time I'm glad to

26:03.840 --> 26:07.520
 hear that you're attempting to make this right and push in a positive direction even if you can't

26:07.520 --> 26:13.040
 make it right because otherwise what am I doing I'm disincentivizing change for the better I'm

26:13.040 --> 26:18.960
 looking to wield whatever power I have in a punitive fashion which does not encourage people to do

26:18.960 --> 26:23.440
 anything other than double down on on the wrongs that they've made knowing that at least they're

26:23.440 --> 26:29.040
 going to have some support from the people that support that and I guess I want to you would

26:29.040 --> 26:34.240
 hopefully look at the use of the internet as a tool that can educate and I guess that I don't

26:34.240 --> 26:38.640
 like the word empower but empower people to do various things extend their reach but uh but

26:38.640 --> 26:44.560
 educate and learn rather than to further solidify little tribal things that exist which I think

26:44.560 --> 26:48.640
 everyone in humanity and human history is vulnerable to me look at the course of human

26:48.640 --> 26:53.840
 history it's deeply tribal and the tribes or the groups that have been on top at various points in

26:53.840 --> 26:58.960
 time have done a lot of times bad things to the ones that have not and you'd hope that we could

26:58.960 --> 27:04.160
 learn lessons from the past and rather than you know committing the crimes that were you know that

27:04.160 --> 27:10.400
 were committed against us recommitting them when we slide into the top position say you know I could

27:10.400 --> 27:15.440
 do this now but I'll not you know I understand the urge to to seek vengeance is strong of anyone

27:15.440 --> 27:20.960
 that says differently I don't I wouldn't trust you know but at the same time we go we have enough

27:20.960 --> 27:25.600
 experience in history enough experience in life enough hopefully wisdom you know time in to go

27:26.480 --> 27:30.640
 this isn't the right answer this is only going to replay the things the the worst parts of our

27:30.640 --> 27:36.320
 history not the best and I want to encourage positive behavior and if I just again further

27:36.320 --> 27:41.600
 lash out at people although understandably done done understandably I'm simply just going to

27:41.600 --> 27:45.920
 just perpetuate the cycle that's gone on to this point so you hope that even though we're seeing

27:45.920 --> 27:51.520
 a lot of a lot of turmoil societally at the moment and globally at the moment that I guess our

27:51.520 --> 27:55.520
 better angels can prevail at a certain point but it's going to take a great deal of leadership and

27:55.520 --> 28:00.080
 I think that we're we're sorely missing like a Martin Luther King style character at the moment

28:00.080 --> 28:07.120
 or a great leader and I just I'm hoping that one will show up for sure and by the way a word I don't

28:07.120 --> 28:11.760
 hear often and I think it's a beautiful one which is grace that's a really interesting word I'm

28:11.760 --> 28:16.880
 gonna have to think about that it is there is a religious component to it but it's exactly right

28:17.600 --> 28:25.600
 it you have to somehow walk the line between you know you mentioned Hitler I've been reading

28:26.800 --> 28:30.640
 the rise and fall of the Third Reich I'm really thinking about the 1930s

28:30.640 --> 28:39.440
 and what what it's like to have economic my concern is the economic pain that people

28:39.440 --> 28:48.400
 are feeling now quietly is really a suffering that's not being heard and there's echoes of that

28:48.400 --> 28:54.560
 in the in the 20s and the 30s with the Great Depression and there's a hunger for a charismatic

28:54.560 --> 29:03.200
 leader like you said there's a leader that could walk with grace could inspire could could bring

29:03.200 --> 29:12.240
 people together with with sort of dreams of a better future that's positive but Hitler did

29:12.240 --> 29:18.480
 exactly everything that I just said except for the word positive which is he did give a dream

29:18.480 --> 29:26.480
 to the German people who were a great people who are great people of of a better future it's just

29:26.480 --> 29:37.600
 that a certain point that quickly turned into the better future requires literally expansion

29:37.600 --> 29:44.160
 of more land it started with well if we want to build a great Germany we need a little bit more

29:44.160 --> 29:53.040
 land and so we need to kind of get Austria then we need to kind of get France mostly because

29:53.840 --> 29:57.520
 France doesn't understand that more land is really useful so we need to get rid of them

29:57.520 --> 29:59.360
 and look what they did to us in Versailles anyway

30:01.920 --> 30:10.560
 but so the jew the jewish uh the holocaust is a separate thing I don't know

30:10.560 --> 30:17.120
 well I don't know I don't know what to think of it because so me being Jewish and having a lot of

30:19.120 --> 30:26.160
 the echoes of the suffering is in my family or the people that are lost I don't know because

30:26.160 --> 30:32.160
 Hitler wrote all about it in Mein Kampf so I don't know if the evil he committed was there all along

30:32.800 --> 30:37.760
 I mean and that that's where the question of forgiveness I mean Hitler is such a difficult

30:37.760 --> 30:46.400
 person to talk about but it's the question of on cancer culture who is deserving of forgiveness

30:46.400 --> 30:52.640
 and who's not like the holocaust survivors that I've read about that I've heard the interviews with

30:53.360 --> 31:02.720
 they've often spoken about the fact that the way for them to let go to overcome the atrocities that

31:02.720 --> 31:12.400
 they've experienced is to forgive like forgiveness is the way out for them it's interesting to think

31:12.400 --> 31:18.080
 about I don't know I don't know I don't know if we're even a society ready to even contemplate

31:18.080 --> 31:24.080
 an idea of forgiveness for Hitler it's it's an interesting idea though it was it's a good

31:24.080 --> 31:30.160
 thought exercise at the very least to think about like all these people that are being cancelled

31:30.160 --> 31:37.840
 for doing bad things of different degrees think of like Louis C.K. or somebody like that for being

31:37.840 --> 31:43.520
 not a good person but like what is the path for forgiveness and also what's a good person

31:43.520 --> 31:48.800
 what is the good person if that's a sliding scale that we could all find ourselves looking at

31:48.800 --> 31:52.880
 the uncomfortable end of a gun on you know particularly down the line I mean you hope for

31:52.880 --> 31:57.040
 the best but these definitions I guess like you said are important and who's doing the

31:57.040 --> 32:02.480
 canceling who's being cancelled I'm not necessarily as you said saying that that's entirely unjustified

32:02.480 --> 32:06.720
 or certainly not it's certainly understandable and particularly you mentioned like a monster

32:06.720 --> 32:11.040
 like an Adolf Hitler but it's also interesting I couldn't help but notice like you mentioned

32:11.040 --> 32:17.520
 as a society us being able to apply forgiveness to someone who's done so much horror but people

32:17.520 --> 32:21.200
 who are personal I mean of course many that so many people in person affected but directly

32:21.200 --> 32:26.080
 personally affected someone a survivor of the Holocaust being able to let go on that I'm

32:26.080 --> 32:31.120
 nowhere near big enough person for that sort of thing but I guess that's that's an interesting

32:31.120 --> 32:39.440
 thing you know being the person who was physically there potentially able to able to let go I don't

32:39.440 --> 32:43.680
 know that's that's unbelievably powerful it's it's interesting I guess you have to wonder sometimes

32:43.680 --> 32:49.280
 and this isn't obviously in regards to that to the Holocaust but why I'm holding on to various

32:49.280 --> 32:55.040
 things have I what is it doing for me and what is it doing to me is it facilitative is it not

32:55.040 --> 32:58.880
 and I guess that's something else that I really enjoy when I was on Ultimate Fighter

32:58.880 --> 33:03.360
 they they don't let you have any music or any books out in religious text so I've brought a

33:03.360 --> 33:07.360
 Bible and I brought a Koran and I started to read them side by side and it was it was really

33:07.360 --> 33:11.120
 interesting reading the Bible's a little drier Koran's the Koran's more interesting at least

33:11.120 --> 33:19.840
 written but I think something that that was consistently brought up was the way most merciful

33:19.840 --> 33:24.720
 people want I don't think any of us want justice we think we want justice but I don't think we want

33:24.720 --> 33:30.080
 justice justice is dangerous dangerous dangerous game because maybe this person's wronged me deeply

33:30.080 --> 33:33.440
 and I want justice I want to balance it out because what is justice is not a balancing of

33:33.440 --> 33:37.120
 the scales and sometimes you can understand it and on a societal level I think it's fine I mean

33:37.120 --> 33:42.400
 there's crime and punishment and we can go for the benefits and the drawbacks of that but I think

33:42.400 --> 33:48.000
 what any of us want is mercy within reason you know grace as you mentioned because justice is a

33:48.000 --> 33:53.520
 very very very dangerous thing and it's a valuable and important thing but who gets to decide what's

33:53.520 --> 33:58.000
 just what justice is actually needed out maybe I get to meet out justice but it's not I don't get

33:58.000 --> 34:03.600
 my comeuppance well that sounds great but what happens when it's pointed back at me and I guess

34:03.600 --> 34:08.000
 that comes back to the veil of ignorance you know the idea that that one day I will have to live in

34:08.000 --> 34:12.640
 the world in which I've envisioned and the world in which I've created I think that a lot of times

34:12.640 --> 34:19.040
 people love the idea of they're a judge for your crimes and a lawyer for theirs and I heard that

34:19.040 --> 34:23.680
 the other day I thought it was great and I think that's it that's a dangerous thing and hopefully

34:23.680 --> 34:28.640
 it gives us all pause before rightly or wrongly but always understandably you know wielding

34:30.000 --> 34:35.360
 serious power. Yeah justice is a kind of drug so if you look at history it's also been reading a

34:35.360 --> 34:42.960
 lot about Stalin I mean all those folks really I don't know I don't know what was inside Hitler's

34:42.960 --> 34:49.360
 head actually that he's a tricky one because I think he was legitimately insane Stalin was not

34:49.360 --> 34:57.120
 and Stalin was like he literally thought he's doing a good thing he literally thought for the

34:57.120 --> 35:03.360
 entirety of the time that communism is going to bring like that's the utopia and he's going to

35:03.360 --> 35:14.800
 create a happy world and in his there in his mind were ideas of justice of fairness of happiness of

35:15.840 --> 35:22.320
 of yeah human flourishing and that's that's a drug and it's somehow sadly

35:23.200 --> 35:28.800
 pollutes the mind when you start thinking like that what's good for society and believing that

35:28.800 --> 35:35.360
 you have a good sense of what's good for society that's intoxicating especially when others around

35:35.360 --> 35:40.720
 you're feeling the same way and then you start like building up this movement and you forget

35:41.440 --> 35:47.120
 that you are just like a you're you're like barely recently evolved from an ape like you

35:47.120 --> 35:51.440
 don't know what the hell you're doing and then you start like killing witches or whatever like

35:51.440 --> 35:55.040
 you start you start doing they did math let's be honest though I mean sometimes you got a

35:55.040 --> 36:01.440
 witch has to go I wish yeah we can all agree that which a witch has to go if it floats or sinks

36:01.440 --> 36:05.280
 which one I forget which which whichever one we need at the time is it floating it should have

36:05.280 --> 36:13.600
 sunk yeah but yeah we can definitely agree that witches have to go because you brought it up I

36:14.480 --> 36:20.240
 tweeted recently but also just I'm one of the things I'm really ashamed of in my life is

36:20.240 --> 36:27.520
 is I haven't really read almost any of the sci fi classics really yeah so like I my whole journey

36:27.520 --> 36:36.080
 through reading was through like the literary philosophers I would say like Camus, Hesse,

36:36.080 --> 36:45.040
 Dostoevsky, Kafka like that place like that's a kind of sci fi world in itself but it's it just

36:45.040 --> 36:54.240
 it creates a world in which the the deepest questions about human nature can be explored

36:55.600 --> 37:03.120
 I didn't realize this but the sci fi world is the same it just puts it in a it like removes it

37:03.120 --> 37:08.400
 from any kind of historical context where you can explore those same ideas in like space somewhere

37:08.400 --> 37:13.200
 elsewhere in a different time in different place it allows you almost like more freedom to like

37:13.200 --> 37:19.760
 construct these artificial things where you can just do crazy crazy kind of human experiments so

37:19.760 --> 37:27.840
 I'm now working through it the books on my list are the foundation series by Isaac Asimov, Dune,

37:30.240 --> 37:36.560
 Snow Crash by Neil Stevenson and Ender's Game like you mentioned that's just kind of and then

37:36.560 --> 37:42.320
 so I posted that and then of course like Elon Musk, John Carmack I don't know if you know him

37:42.320 --> 37:48.240
 creator of doom and quake oh cool see they all pitched in these nerds these alternate just started

37:48.240 --> 37:55.120
 like going like these uh you need to read this that and and the other so I've like started working

37:55.120 --> 38:03.920
 out okay but it seems like the list I've mentioned holds up somewhat is there a book is there sci fi

38:03.920 --> 38:12.640
 by books or series or authors that that you find are just amazing maybe another way to ask that is

38:12.640 --> 38:18.000
 like what's the greatest sci fi book of all time well I'd like to start by uh sharing something that

38:18.000 --> 38:24.560
 I I'm embarrassed about yeah is that I haven't read anything other than uh you know Orson Scott

38:24.560 --> 38:33.680
 Card jr Tolkien uh Frank Herbert Tolkien yeah yeah yeah I'm aware through Wikipedia and through through

38:33.680 --> 38:38.960
 surface reading of things that like a book called the Republic was written once um there were some

38:38.960 --> 38:46.960
 other good ones so you're a prolific reader of Wikipedia articles well or occasional okay exactly

38:46.960 --> 38:52.720
 and in between uh whatever else it is that I waste my time on but but yeah so I also I should say I

38:52.720 --> 38:59.680
 posted on reddit questions for uh Ryan Hall and there's like a million questions but like uh half

38:59.680 --> 39:04.880
 of them have to do with dune no not really but like people bring up dune I don't understand why I

39:04.880 --> 39:08.560
 I did you mention dune before home well actually we actually have a show you're all actually made

39:08.560 --> 39:13.280
 us a gi a dune themed gi one time which I thought was kind of cool I'll send you I'll give you one

39:13.280 --> 39:18.640
 we got extra but uh actually to your to your point actually this is uh Orson Scott card quote

39:18.640 --> 39:22.720
 actually the writer of Ender's Game um fiction because it's not about somebody who actually lived

39:22.720 --> 39:27.840
 in the real world always has the possibility about of being about oneself and I think that's a

39:27.840 --> 39:33.360
 neat thing because I have heard you know other very people whom I respect and very sharp people

39:33.360 --> 39:36.880
 actually every now and then dig their heels and go in I don't like fiction I only like nonfiction

39:36.880 --> 39:40.960
 it's more it's more instructive and I would go I completely disagree with that I think we have a

39:40.960 --> 39:46.240
 hard enough time figuring out what happened at 7 11 3 hours ago that let me tell you what happened

39:46.240 --> 39:51.200
 600 years BC I'm like hey I'm interested but don't tell me this isn't a story too yeah there's

39:51.200 --> 39:56.880
 there's there's actually there's factual components I have no doubt but we struggle sometimes to

39:56.880 --> 40:02.000
 like I guess what I like about fiction is that you can tell me a story it's all about people

40:02.000 --> 40:06.800
 I mean every now there's more and less believable things and I think dune would be an unbelievably

40:06.800 --> 40:11.280
 well written in my opinion for to run you know what do I know but I really like dune I'll say that

40:11.280 --> 40:16.400
 well written example of you know human beings interacting with one another the political

40:16.400 --> 40:21.120
 component to that the emotional the intellectual the relationship components all of that and

40:21.920 --> 40:26.640
 I think that dune is neat because it's a sci fi novel but only in the only in the loosest sense

40:26.640 --> 40:33.040
 it's it's really a story about religion about group dynamics about human potential about

40:33.040 --> 40:44.320
 belief learning politics governance ecology it's the best stories remind me of history the same

40:44.320 --> 40:50.640
 way history hopefully is not just a list of facts that I try to be able to recall or factoids that

40:50.640 --> 40:57.520
 I try to recall but a story that I can understand and and see how how the threads of time kind of

40:57.520 --> 41:01.440
 came together and created certain things and a lot of times like we say I'm like I have the heck is

41:01.440 --> 41:04.960
 what's going on right now or a hundred years from now or a hundred years in the past happened

41:04.960 --> 41:09.120
 and you can look back far enough if we had accurate knowledge if we had that like that

41:09.120 --> 41:14.080
 hypothetical perfect pool shot you know at the beginning of time we would see an unbroken chain

41:14.080 --> 41:18.400
 of events that led us to where we are and and where we are will potentially lead us to where

41:18.400 --> 41:22.800
 we're going which is again why hindsight's helpful but I think it's neat like I guess I really enjoy

41:22.800 --> 41:26.560
 for instance a book like dune and they're actually making a movie out of it which I'm

41:26.560 --> 41:30.640
 skeptical of to be honest because it's it's going to be difficult to to bring that to the screen

41:30.640 --> 41:35.120
 for a variety of reasons but there's at least a hundred questions ask Ryan what do you think

41:35.120 --> 41:39.280
 about the new dune movie I am not enough of an authority to have any sort of decent opinion

41:39.280 --> 41:42.720
 but I guess what I would say is so much of it goes on in the character's mind like how much of any of

41:42.720 --> 41:49.200
 our days is any lived experience as it were is internal that the majority how many times are

41:49.200 --> 41:53.200
 people walking around and you know they can be like hey what do you see right now I'm like oh

41:53.200 --> 41:57.840
 well I see this picture I see a wall hey there's legs but really what was what I was paying attention

41:57.840 --> 42:01.680
 to it was what was going on inside of my head for a moment and almost the rest of the world

42:01.680 --> 42:09.360
 tuned out and kind of dimmed and I guess that I think that's going to be a struggle to to anytime

42:09.360 --> 42:14.480
 you want to bring that type of a written story to to a visual medium I think it's going to be more

42:14.480 --> 42:19.360
 difficult but it'll it'll be interesting it's definitely my one of my favorite stories and

42:19.360 --> 42:24.160
 it's been it's honestly helped me become better at life in my opinion better than martial arts

42:24.160 --> 42:27.760
 and I think the the writer I think Frank Herbert was absolutely brilliant whether those were all

42:27.760 --> 42:32.320
 his ideas which in reality none of us are all of our good ideas aren't ours were a combination

42:32.320 --> 42:35.760
 maybe came up with something you're a curator of other good ideas and some things you borrowed

42:35.760 --> 42:40.640
 from somewhere without even realizing it but I think the the way the message is in the themes

42:40.640 --> 42:45.360
 and the ideas that were conveyed particularly in the original novel are just absolutely brilliant

42:45.360 --> 42:52.480
 is that the is that to you one of the greats and and the flip side of that like or another

42:52.480 --> 42:56.960
 way to ask that is like if somebody's new to sci fi is that something you would recommend

42:56.960 --> 43:00.960
 that that is an entry point I'm not well read enough in the sci fi world I haven't written a

43:00.960 --> 43:05.920
 lot of like Isaac Asimov or anything like that but I just I'll recommend dune I'll be an obnoxious

43:05.920 --> 43:11.120
 like evangelist for dune to anyone who'll listen so I yeah I would strongly recommend it so the

43:11.120 --> 43:15.520
 other thing you mentioned now I should probably be talking to you about much more important things

43:15.520 --> 43:22.960
 but the other thing you mentioned is Skyrim do you play video games what's your favorite game what's

43:22.960 --> 43:26.720
 what would you say is the greatest video game of all time because I'm a huge fan of elder scrolls

43:26.720 --> 43:31.680
 oh cool yeah I I mean I play a little bit um at this point you know a little little less

43:32.320 --> 43:38.000
 finally moves into a new house so you're like an adult no oh no no I'm like a better funded 12 year

43:38.000 --> 43:45.600
 old um yeah that's yeah that's entirely that's entirely accurate better funded 12 year old but um

43:46.320 --> 43:50.320
 somewhat better funded 12 year old not as well fun as I wish but whatever please you play video

43:50.320 --> 43:54.240
 games oh yeah I played as a kid I was you know again I've always liked playing sports and and

43:54.240 --> 43:58.400
 liked reading and I always enjoyed video games but my favorite video game I think I've ever played

43:58.400 --> 44:04.880
 was nights at the old republic it was a star wars game a huge star wars fan until it become less so

44:04.880 --> 44:11.760
 so recently Disney um you don't like the I haven't watched it yet oh medallori oh don't go

44:11.760 --> 44:15.680
 oh actually like medallorian that was that was actually pretty cool yeah waving this off yeah

44:15.680 --> 44:20.640
 canceled yeah I will if I could cancel one thing I would cancel Disney Star Wars I'm gonna edit

44:20.640 --> 44:26.000
 that part out okay let's go to the next but uh this is where if people are wondering if you're

44:26.000 --> 44:31.680
 watching this on YouTube and like the dislike amount is like 80% that's because of that comment so

44:31.680 --> 44:38.160
 so good job good job for making the internet I regret nothing now what about uh baby Yoda

44:39.040 --> 44:43.440
 yeah I guess he's like he's little he's got ears and he uses the force sometimes and he

44:43.440 --> 44:47.440
 passes out again nope no qualms of baby Yoda yeah you don't have a heart okay

44:50.400 --> 44:57.840
 let's go to jiu jitsu if it's okay uh so the audience of this podcast may not know much about

44:57.840 --> 45:03.360
 jiu jitsu or they do because it's really part of the culture now but they don't really know much

45:04.480 --> 45:08.480
 they see that so many people have fallen in love with it have been transformed through it but they

45:08.480 --> 45:14.880
 don't know much about like what is this thing is there a way you could sort of try to explain the

45:14.880 --> 45:21.120
 what is jiu jitsu what is the essence of this martial art that's captured the minds and hearts of

45:21.120 --> 45:28.560
 so many people in the world I think that jiu jitsu is is a philosophy that's expressed physically

45:28.560 --> 45:37.360
 and that it's the kind of development of the mental capacity and physical capacity working in in

45:37.360 --> 45:50.320
 unison to uh move efficiently and almost flowingly unresistingly with with a given situation with a

45:50.320 --> 45:56.560
 with a physically resisting opponent um learning how to generate force on your own and how to

45:56.560 --> 46:01.440
 steal force from the floor how to steal force from the other person and move in concert with it as

46:01.440 --> 46:05.840
 opposed to clash against which if you watch two untrained people fight it's almost entirely a

46:05.840 --> 46:12.080
 clash it's a runaway and clash a runaway and clash um if you watch jiu jitsu done well it's

46:12.080 --> 46:18.080
 it it looks like water moving around a solid structure and and I think that that is expressed

46:18.080 --> 46:23.840
 physically and I think that all of the things that anyone has really been able to do very very well

46:23.840 --> 46:28.640
 in jiu jitsu end up kind of exemplifying that but I think that that's true of martial arts in

46:28.640 --> 46:34.560
 general I think that a lot of times like the clashing that we see going on um and working well

46:34.560 --> 46:39.040
 is just the fact that you know you get very very physically powerful people every now and then

46:39.040 --> 46:42.800
 they're able to get away with this but I don't think that that's and that's that's fantastic

46:42.800 --> 46:46.560
 because ultimately it's a results driven thing but I think that the essence of the martial arts

46:46.560 --> 46:51.120
 is learning how to make more out of less and how to move with and be yielding you know almost like

46:51.120 --> 47:01.520
 real life aikido and uh so you think of martial arts uh jiu jitsu as uh like water or flowing so

47:01.520 --> 47:12.000
 aikido so moving around the the force as opposed to sort of maybe the wrestling mindset is finding

47:12.000 --> 47:17.520
 a leverage where you can apply an exceptional amount of force so like so like maximizing the

47:17.520 --> 47:21.760
 application of force I guess maybe that's a better way to I'd like to marry the two ideas you know

47:21.760 --> 47:25.920
 because I think you flow until the point at which you are the greater force at which point in time

47:25.920 --> 47:30.640
 you can apply but uh if you look at the best wrestlers and then when I say best I don't necessarily

47:30.640 --> 47:35.600
 mean most successful although of course most successful are always very very good um throughout

47:35.600 --> 47:42.880
 the course of history in boxing in wrestling in judo um they they're magical they they disappear

47:42.880 --> 47:47.680
 and reappear it's like fighting a ghost that that is like incorporeal when you want to find it but

47:47.680 --> 47:52.640
 then when you don't want it to find it when you don't want to find it it finds you and uh I think

47:52.640 --> 47:59.120
 that we see that in the like the buvaisar cites use of wrestling um and you know I guess you could

47:59.120 --> 48:05.840
 look at uh Floyd Mayweather or willy pep or uh you know pernell whitaker in boxing um as brilliant

48:05.840 --> 48:11.520
 examples of disappearing and reappearing and when you're strong it's almost like a real warfare

48:11.520 --> 48:15.600
 when you're strong I'm nowhere to be found when you're weak you can't get rid of me

48:15.600 --> 48:19.840
 and I think that's what we're looking for yes the tier brothers are incredible at that they just

48:19.840 --> 48:29.840
 they look like uh skinny starbucks baristas and uh they just manhandle everybody like effort effortlessly

48:29.840 --> 48:35.200
 they look like they just kind of woke up yeah rolled out of bed fighting for like the the

48:35.200 --> 48:42.000
 the gold medal at the olympics and just effortlessly throw uh like there's a match against you I guess

48:42.000 --> 48:48.720
 yola maro yeah so like you you know if you look at like who is the guy who's like intimidating in

48:48.720 --> 48:55.360
 this case uh and the terrifying looking it's uh it's it's the over maro just like a physical

48:55.360 --> 49:00.480
 specimen obviously like a super accomplished wrestler I think this is for the gold medal yeah

49:00.480 --> 49:06.320
 and 2000 2000 yes and then there this is the year you all took silver

49:08.400 --> 49:14.160
 and what you like just to just show you like there's a inside trip effortless

49:14.160 --> 49:22.400
 uchi and he does it again you know you know it's a really creative kind of wrestling where

49:22.960 --> 49:28.080
 it's organic yeah you throw in all of these kinds of things there's just a mix of judo a mix of

49:28.880 --> 49:36.800
 like weird kind of moves it's not like as funky as uh ben askern it's it's just like legitimate

49:38.080 --> 49:43.120
 basic well it's not funky for funky sake and i'm not poking ben askern to imply that that's

49:43.120 --> 49:47.120
 what he's doing but it's like it's funny it's like a lot of times it's almost like a musashi

49:47.120 --> 49:52.480
 talked a lot about that you know that the only goal of combat is to win is the outcome is it's

49:52.480 --> 49:57.600
 outcome driven versus like flourishing you know cool looking movements it's like unless that had a

49:57.600 --> 50:02.320
 utilitarian purpose like what are you wasting your time with that both in the fight and also

50:02.320 --> 50:06.080
 you know in practice but but as you mentioned it's almost like it looks like judo it looks

50:06.080 --> 50:10.400
 like wrestling it looks like jujitsu it's almost like I guess that reminds me all of the martial

50:10.400 --> 50:15.120
 arts is again deeply tribal as well I I want to learn lex fridman martial arts and then I want to

50:15.120 --> 50:20.000
 learn another you know I guess transcendent person's martial arts and it just happened to be the set

50:20.000 --> 50:24.160
 of movements that you tended to do most of the time thanks to your body type and your opposition

50:24.160 --> 50:28.640
 and whatnot but then I try to codify that and force those to work as opposed to going I want to

50:28.640 --> 50:34.640
 understand how the body works in concert and in congress with something else and other forces

50:34.640 --> 50:38.800
 and move appropriately and that's why it's like it always struck me that the Scythe Brothers are

50:38.800 --> 50:44.000
 great examples of just moving like water but they used Bruce Lee which is a little trite but again

50:44.000 --> 50:48.080
 he's brilliant it's like water can flow or water can crash and they would crash when they needed to

50:48.080 --> 50:51.040
 crash and they would flow when they needed to flow but they would flow for the purpose of

50:51.040 --> 50:55.520
 dissipating and then crash when they would win and at the right moment then go back to flowing the

50:55.520 --> 50:59.840
 second that the other person found them and it's just it's beautiful to watch it's artistic and I

50:59.840 --> 51:04.240
 think that that great expression of anything physical is ultimately studied as a science but

51:04.240 --> 51:07.280
 expressed as an art and I think that that's something that gets lost in jujitsu a lot of

51:07.280 --> 51:11.040
 times when it gets a little bit a little nerdy like do this hand to your hand here like if

51:11.040 --> 51:16.080
 like the more details I have the better one in reality that's just not not in my experience how

51:16.080 --> 51:25.600
 it's done. It might be a fun exercise of saying like what are the main positions and submissions

51:25.600 --> 51:31.120
 in the art of jujitsu. You don't have to be complete that's a ridiculously I apologize for

51:31.120 --> 51:35.600
 putting on a spot like this but it might be a nice exercise to think through it. Sure I mean I

51:35.600 --> 51:40.880
 would just say that you have your arms bend in various ways. You have key lock americana,

51:40.880 --> 51:44.960
 straight arm locks, kimoa plata, kimoa plata is a kimoa or kimoa is a kimoa plata. It's just

51:44.960 --> 51:49.440
 executed. Submissions. So like. Submissions. Breaking off your arm in all kinds of ways.

51:49.440 --> 51:53.680
 But ultimately the question is let's say you were a terminator like a robot that I which of

51:53.680 --> 52:00.480
 course you are. Go on. Go on. It's like it's a work being completely literal. And I couldn't

52:00.480 --> 52:05.040
 harm you with any of these things. Would I still use these positions? The answer is yes. They create

52:05.040 --> 52:09.680
 leverage. They create control. They create shapes that I can affect and that can affect me. And

52:09.680 --> 52:13.600
 they can be affected through other forces than other objects or structures like the ground

52:13.600 --> 52:17.520
 or the wall. I really enjoy mixed martial arts because there's another component rather than

52:17.520 --> 52:21.360
 just me and you and the floor. There's me, you, the floor and the wall. And it's another player

52:21.360 --> 52:27.600
 in the game that doesn't exist in a grappling context with a non enclosed you know I guess area

52:27.600 --> 52:35.440
 of combat. But you can strangle me or choke me. What do you call it? Without my arms being

52:35.440 --> 52:40.320
 involved or you can use one of my shoulders to pin one side of my one carotid artery off and you

52:40.320 --> 52:45.040
 can enclose the other. You can turn my knee in the exact same ways that you can turn my arm

52:45.040 --> 52:50.000
 straight this way and that way. You can add a rotation to that or it can be directly linear

52:50.000 --> 52:54.320
 against the joint. So I guess what I would say is the more that I've been able to understand

52:54.320 --> 53:01.120
 jujitsu the more that I've been it's given me a look into how we learn language where rather

53:01.120 --> 53:05.520
 than learning five bazillion adjectives I go I understand what an adjective is and of course

53:05.520 --> 53:12.080
 we are all read into some degree of vocabulary. I understand what an adverb does and I understand

53:12.080 --> 53:16.320
 what an adverb is. I know what a noun is. I know what the component parts of a sentence are. I know

53:16.320 --> 53:20.720
 what you know I guess a clause, a contraction, any of these things and it allows you to be

53:20.720 --> 53:26.320
 interesting and artistic with your language to the extent that you can but I can't like I can

53:26.320 --> 53:31.360
 speak a degree of Spanish but I'm not even slightly artistic in Spanish. I would be something. I

53:31.360 --> 53:38.080
 speak like a child with a head injury and anyway the basic understanding of the English language

53:38.080 --> 53:43.920
 allows you to then be a student of Spanish. 100% but I'm limited by my experience. I'm limited by

53:43.920 --> 53:48.320
 my understanding of techniques. I'm limited by my understanding almost like let's say techniques

53:48.320 --> 53:54.720
 are like vocabulary. So even if I kind of sort of grasp the sentence structure and the thought

53:54.720 --> 53:59.840
 process and the thought patterns of Spanish which it's interesting because just even the

53:59.840 --> 54:02.880
 orientation and the organization of a language and I've thought about this a great deal,

54:03.600 --> 54:07.760
 you know the way that I perceive the world is affected deeply by the language that I learned.

54:07.760 --> 54:11.520
 Do you know the again if I learned I have no idea how the Chinese language structures

54:11.520 --> 54:15.200
 but I can only imagine that it would be that it would affect it's like a different lens. We're

54:15.200 --> 54:21.440
 looking at the same thing but I have a different set of sunglasses on than you do and that's very

54:21.440 --> 54:25.440
 very interesting. I'll use the Quran as an example. You know apparently it's unbelievably poetic

54:25.440 --> 54:31.440
 and in Arabic still neat and was interesting reading in English but I'm told by people that I

54:31.440 --> 54:35.520
 trust that it just one doesn't bear resemblance to the other and I think that's a very interesting

54:35.520 --> 54:41.120
 thing that you may be able to say the same thing but in a more I guess in a different way in a

54:41.120 --> 54:47.520
 more artistic way that that may not translate on a one for one kind of fidelity but the more

54:47.520 --> 54:51.920
 that we're able to understand about how the body works the more examples of the body working this

54:51.920 --> 54:55.520
 way the body working that way the body working that way the more that I'm able to eventually

54:55.520 --> 54:59.040
 become an artist but it has to be studied as a science first and it does start with technique

54:59.040 --> 55:04.080
 collection vocabulary collection the same way we learn in school where you remember how to say

55:04.080 --> 55:11.840
 quickly 17 different ways and let's say I speak Spanish I'm only I only know three so you might use

55:11.840 --> 55:16.000
 quickly you might use an adjective like quickly in Spanish but use one of the many many options

55:16.000 --> 55:21.120
 to describe that that I don't understand and now I sit there and go like wait what I can't be artistic

55:21.120 --> 55:25.120
 I can't be as organic with the languages I like so I believe that jujitsu a lot of times starts

55:25.120 --> 55:30.320
 with the acquisition of a lot of hey do this this this drill this technique here's an Americana

55:30.320 --> 55:35.920
 Americana to an arm lock arm lock to a triangle but the problem with that is oftentimes we get

55:35.920 --> 55:41.760
 stuck in that phase and I people eventually become move collectors or sequence collectors and I

55:41.760 --> 55:46.160
 noticed this when I'm trying to do dbd or I guess like an instructional series now or even teaching

55:46.160 --> 55:51.440
 in class I don't believe in that form of learning anymore not that it's not valuable but I don't

55:51.440 --> 55:55.360
 believe I don't understand jujitsu on that level anymore so what I'm trying to do is get across

55:55.360 --> 56:01.040
 the basic ideas to people and say hey you need to fill in the gaps with going to class all the time

56:01.040 --> 56:04.400
 you need to go hey learn this move learn that technique learn that technique because otherwise

56:04.400 --> 56:08.640
 I'm basically just throwing at you like 75 different words that you could use but that

56:08.640 --> 56:13.360
 hasn't really taught you how to how to speak a language whereas if you give me the language

56:13.360 --> 56:18.240
 structure you can fill in these pieces on your own and then eventually speak organically in

56:18.240 --> 56:22.800
 lex form which will be ultimately unique to you because otherwise you just end up being like a

56:22.800 --> 56:29.360
 weird facsimile of whatever it is that I'm doing for mostly the worst I'd say but uh yeah that's

56:29.360 --> 56:33.680
 what people I mean people comment like is this especially people haven't listened to me before

56:34.480 --> 56:43.280
 is this guy drunk or high does he does does MIT really allow slow people to uh to be like what's

56:44.320 --> 56:50.240
 quote is it like what's what's wrong with him is he getting sleep are you okay and does he need help

56:50.240 --> 56:55.920
 so that that's similar with my jiu jitsu is like is this guy is this guy really whatever rank I was

56:55.920 --> 57:02.720
 throughout I remember just like is this guy really this rank I just have a very kind of certain way

57:02.720 --> 57:08.800
 of sitting and being slow and lazy looking that there was ultimately the language that I had to

57:08.800 --> 57:17.120
 discover and it was uh it was yeah it was a very liberating moment I think of probably a few years

57:17.120 --> 57:22.800
 of getting my ass kicked especially with open guard and butterfly to where you really allow yourself

57:22.800 --> 57:29.760
 to take in the entirety of the language and realize that um that I'm not I'm different I'm a unique

57:30.480 --> 57:37.680
 I'm unique and like I have a very um I have a language I have a set of techniques a way I move

57:37.680 --> 57:44.240
 my body that needs that I'm the one to discover like it's you can only you can learn specific

57:44.240 --> 57:48.240
 techniques and so on but you really have to understand your own body and that's the beautiful

57:48.240 --> 57:54.960
 thing about jiu jitsu like you said is like the the connection about your philosophy your view of

57:54.960 --> 58:01.040
 the world with the physical and like connecting those two things how you perceive the world how

58:01.040 --> 58:07.840
 you interpret ideas of the world about exhaustion about force about effortlessness like what it

58:07.840 --> 58:13.840
 really means to relax all these kinds of loose concepts and then actually teach your body to

58:13.840 --> 58:20.720
 like do those things and like you know and be able to apply force and spurts be able to relax

58:20.720 --> 58:26.640
 and spurts and like figure all that stuff out for my for your my individual body but it's as you

58:26.640 --> 58:30.160
 mentioned that's I couldn't agree with you more it's a discovery process and no one can cheat that

58:30.160 --> 58:34.560
 process which is at the same time it's almost imagine I want to start writing books in second

58:34.560 --> 58:39.520
 grade unless maybe I'm like staggeringly brilliant like which I can only conceptualize someone being

58:39.520 --> 58:43.600
 able to do that but maybe a moat start of the English language where you're out there doing it

58:43.600 --> 58:48.000
 but for most of us we don't have enough knowledge enough information enough experience to be able to

58:48.960 --> 58:57.120
 be to express ourselves so we have to basically input repeat which is important but it's the

58:57.120 --> 59:00.320
 process as you say of going through that of getting your ass kicked to just like well that

59:00.320 --> 59:03.280
 didn't work well that didn't work that felt right but I don't know nobody else does that I guess I

59:03.280 --> 59:07.680
 don't believe in that versus eventually going I don't know I'll just try going my own way and

59:07.680 --> 59:10.960
 see what happens and now I'll get yelled at and people won't like me and if it works they'll

59:10.960 --> 59:15.520
 say I got lucky and if it doesn't work they'll say I was dumb but which one maybe all is right but

59:15.520 --> 59:21.280
 basically you know going through that iterative process that allows you to eventually find yourself

59:21.280 --> 59:25.200
 expression and find your voice so that you you fight the same way that you speak the same way

59:25.200 --> 59:29.520
 that you write the same way that you think in a way that that is uniquely you that will also

59:29.520 --> 59:34.800
 ultimately allow you to understand other people being uniquely them because even if you can only

59:34.800 --> 59:38.560
 conceptualize and I think about this a lot for society stuff where I go well this is how I feel

59:38.560 --> 59:43.520
 about this but am I objectively right maybe about a couple things but that's a small box

59:43.520 --> 59:47.360
 that I have to be very very careful about what I think is objective versus what's not and I have

59:47.360 --> 59:51.120
 to be open to the possibility of all the things that I think are objectively correct may or may

59:51.120 --> 59:56.880
 not be and that should allow me to have some degree of compassion or consideration for other people

59:56.880 --> 1:00:01.920
 both in their martial arts journey and in their journey you know as people as human beings because

1:00:01.920 --> 1:00:08.640
 I understand that they're on a it's a we're all on a path where it's all in again an iterative process

1:00:08.640 --> 1:00:14.080
 of eventual self expression but I think that's one of the things that we see having trouble when we

1:00:14.080 --> 1:00:19.120
 see tribalism which I mean racism expression of that political affiliation to expression of that

1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:23.120
 all of these things that can go in really uncomfortable directions people are looking for

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:26.800
 hey where do I plant my feet over here where's where's the thing that I know is right and

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:31.440
 that we can all agree on the following and I think that we see that in martial arts we're like oh I

1:00:31.440 --> 1:00:35.600
 do this style why do that style I do that stuff it's like hey man we're all just pushing forward

1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:38.800
 in a certain direction here trying to do our best and I understand why you feel the way you do I may

1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:44.240
 have felt like that at one point too but uh you know we're I'm just trying to learn and understand

1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:49.280
 versus I've already acquired enough knowledge let me cross my arms and start to to look who's

1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:55.360
 fucking up around here and and I think that uh that's an it's an interesting trap that I think

1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:59.440
 it's very human trap to fall into but it definitely happens early on it's I mean it's a joke in the

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:03.200
 jujitsu world right like on the blue belt that that knows everything well initially it's like what I

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:06.720
 know nothing and I at least think I know nothing then I'd learn a little bit and I think it's a

1:01:06.720 --> 1:01:10.320
 lot bit and then you know the more you learn the more you go like I don't even know what I'm doing

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:16.960
 yeah that's exactly right we kind of talked about it a little bit but uh once again a lot of people

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:21.600
 that listen to this have never been on the mat have never tried jujitsu but are really curious

1:01:21.600 --> 1:01:27.600
 about it everybody at all positions like uh I think you know mosques kids are not doing jujitsu

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:34.080
 Andrew Yang is like they're all you know the world is curious it's uh it's a nice it seems to be

1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:40.160
 a nice methodology by which to humble your ego which to grow intellectually and physically so

1:01:40.720 --> 1:01:44.320
 people are curious about it so the natural question is if they're curious about it

1:01:44.880 --> 1:01:51.760
 how would you recommend they get started maybe like what do you recommend the first day week

1:01:51.760 --> 1:01:57.520
 month year first couple years look like like how do you ease into it and make sure that it's

1:01:57.520 --> 1:02:04.560
 a positive experience and you progress in the most optimal and positive way the first thing you can do

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:09.360
 is is simply ask yourself why why you want to be involved and you know I remember the first day

1:02:09.360 --> 1:02:14.560
 that I walked into ronin athletics in uh in new york city to train under my godfather my son now

1:02:14.560 --> 1:02:20.480
 christian montes um and I didn't know what I was getting myself into I played baseball through

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:25.920
 high school and I wanted I was at Manhattan college um in the Bronx and I wanted to go

1:02:25.920 --> 1:02:29.760
 and learn martial arts because it was always something that was interesting to me but it was

1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:34.800
 never something that that was I that I knew was accessible and it definitely wasn't really around

1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:39.040
 in northern virginia where I grew up whereas then you stick yourself in in Manhattan and there's

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:44.160
 stuff everywhere so anyway I guess I didn't know what to expect um I didn't know if I was

1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:48.480
 going to get beat up if people were going to be nice if people were not going to be nice um but

1:02:49.440 --> 1:02:54.160
 what I began with was I think expectation management and I think that that's something

1:02:54.160 --> 1:03:00.320
 that uh I would that'd be the first thing that I would start is almost imagining what is it that

1:03:00.320 --> 1:03:04.640
 I'm getting myself into because I love the martial arts with with the martial arts has given me

1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:10.080
 everything in life and I'm so thankful I wouldn't be sitting here um without without that that

1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:14.320
 experience of the journey of the people that I've met the place that I got I could never ever have

1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:20.960
 ever imagined um and I'm just unbelievably thankful for that but I think that the thing that

1:03:20.960 --> 1:03:27.840
 um that helped me most of all was starting with going you know my mom said something to me one

1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:32.160
 time and she said uh you know there's two types of people in various situations there's why and

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:37.520
 there's why not and you know it's understandable to have questions concerns things like that um

1:03:37.520 --> 1:03:41.440
 but and maybe sometimes it's a little bit easier when you're when you're younger to just trust

1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:46.640
 people or just say I don't know you know um but uh we go hey you want to climb that rock I'm like

1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:51.920
 yeah why not let's go hey you want to jump in that river yeah why not sure versus if I have to reason

1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:56.320
 my way into everything I have I have to be talked into everything a lot of times I'll talk myself

1:03:56.320 --> 1:04:00.480
 out of it and I think that a lot of times this is the thinkers disease um you want to figure out

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:06.400
 what's going to happen and what you should expect to have happen before you get involved versus going

1:04:06.400 --> 1:04:10.160
 using the old Bruce Lee saying again it's like no amount of thinking or training on the on the

1:04:10.160 --> 1:04:14.880
 side of the river will teach you how to swim you have to jump in and there are risks associated

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:20.640
 with that and so uh I guess uh psychological are usually the biggest ones that's the biggest hurdle

1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:25.920
 and physical um but the biggest thing that I guess I would suggest anyone to say why do you

1:04:25.920 --> 1:04:29.920
 want to do this you're like well I want to challenge myself I want to learn I would like to learn to

1:04:29.920 --> 1:04:33.520
 fight I want to learn to fight so that I could protect myself and if and if anything else other

1:04:33.520 --> 1:04:40.080
 people if only when the norms reach I perceive that if I had some small degree of power um I

1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:43.760
 generally wouldn't use it which is why I was like yeah I'll give it a try I'll try to be reasonable

1:04:43.760 --> 1:04:48.080
 and hopefully if I make a mistake I'll apologize to people but basically uh I said yeah I'd like

1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:54.320
 to have that and I want to I know this is gonna be challenging and we'll see what happens and that

1:04:54.320 --> 1:04:58.880
 means that getting beat up and I didn't get like hurt but getting roughed up getting my arm bent

1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:02.240
 this way or that way getting choked I was like well this is all supposed to happen that's no big

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:07.360
 deal it would be like going and joining the army during peacetime and then going oh I'm just doing

1:05:07.360 --> 1:05:11.280
 this for a college education you're like okay that's cool man and then all of a sudden war breaks

1:05:11.280 --> 1:05:14.320
 out and they want to send me somewhere and I'm like whoa whoa whoa whoa I didn't sign up for that

1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:18.720
 kick actually you did whether you realize it or not you may not have thought that you did

1:05:18.720 --> 1:05:24.560
 but you did so getting your mind right and and just going what are my expectations this activity

1:05:24.560 --> 1:05:28.720
 what is it that I'm looking to do and of course you know you're you're going into a gym you're

1:05:28.720 --> 1:05:32.080
 going into a place that you don't know people or you probably don't know people and you don't know

1:05:32.080 --> 1:05:37.040
 the coach and even if you do want to hey how you do and shake your hand type of level you know 95%

1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:40.400
 of my students don't know me not really you know I'll try to be polite and not annoy them too much

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:45.600
 but they don't know me and I don't know them I understand if they don't trust me I wouldn't

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:51.120
 trust trust me either if I were them but at the same time someone has to take that leap and one

1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:54.720
 of the things that I've noticed as a martial arts instructor that's the biggest struggle

1:05:55.680 --> 1:05:59.600
 with dealing with adults which is why a lot of people like to teach kids is kids kids don't ask

1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:04.640
 don't argue now that also means there's there's all sorts of pitfalls or that sort of thing and

1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:08.800
 that can be an issue but you know I guess a lot of times people get to a point in their life you

1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:14.000
 know in their 20s early 30s where now I'm a manager now I know what I'm doing no one talks to me

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:17.680
 like that versus like hey man you go join boot camp I don't care if you are Elon Musk they're going

1:06:17.680 --> 1:06:23.920
 to shut up and do push ups and that's what's great about it so you are taking a leap of faith

1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:29.280
 into a world that you're going to be a tiny fish and you got to hope that the people who are who

1:06:29.280 --> 1:06:33.680
 are guiding you in that in that journey are going to have I can't say even say your best

1:06:33.680 --> 1:06:36.720
 interest at heart because they don't even know you but they'll they'll try to do no harm and

1:06:36.720 --> 1:06:40.560
 they'll try to help you in the way that they would understand and I guess that's for instance that's

1:06:40.560 --> 1:06:45.600
 what I would try to do with anyone that that comes into my gym I would try to help them in the way

1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:51.840
 that I understand they need as best I can and as safe and reasonable a way as possible but sometimes

1:06:51.840 --> 1:06:55.760
 in a way that's going to make them uncomfortable particularly if physical combat and and it's

1:06:55.760 --> 1:07:00.800
 not something they've done before if they've a lot of people go in without even having played

1:07:00.800 --> 1:07:05.600
 you know contact sports and so that can be a big jump and you have to understand if that's where

1:07:05.600 --> 1:07:09.600
 you're starting from no worries but you're going to have to kind of work your way to it and it's

1:07:09.600 --> 1:07:13.280
 going to be uncomfortable and and it'll and that's okay it's part of the process and you're going to

1:07:13.280 --> 1:07:16.720
 have some bumps and bruises and you're not going to want to roll with that guy in the corner because

1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:20.800
 that that person's rough and they beat you up and they're like okay but is this a big hurt or is it

1:07:20.800 --> 1:07:26.720
 a little hurt if it's a big hurt okay if it's a little hurt I need you to draw up a little bit

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:32.400
 yeah it's such an interesting balance because to find I think one of the most important things

1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:39.520
 as in anything I think in life is the selection of the people that you put around you I mean

1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:45.600
 that's true with like getting married that's true with like if you go to if people ask me like

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:53.600
 graduate students like your PhD advisor can can be the difference it's everything it's like you

1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:59.520
 spend five years with somebody they're going to basically define the more impact on you than

1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:03.840
 anybody you marry anybody you hang out with is a huge impact and the same with the the coach

1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:11.920
 selection which is like the school selection is it's going to be really important about in terms

1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:19.520
 of like who you select will define how happy like the trajectory of your growth and how happy you

1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:26.640
 are with the entirety of the experience and yet like the the flip side of that is especially if

1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:31.520
 you have an ego especially if you are the manager then you still let go some stuff you're going to

1:08:31.520 --> 1:08:37.520
 feel like shit with the good with the best kind of coach that's that's what you need right but

1:08:37.520 --> 1:08:42.480
 there's in the night there's a weird balance there to find like I mean like and everybody

1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:50.560
 needs a different thing like I'm much more I enjoy being sort of like sounds weird but like

1:08:50.560 --> 1:08:57.120
 I'm you know from the wrestling background I enjoy feeling like crap in a sense like the coach

1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:03.280
 like getting beat up I don't actually enjoy it it's not like some masochistic thing or whatever

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:13.360
 it's the growth like I like the anxiety I like feeling like like shit when I go home like

1:09:13.360 --> 1:09:18.480
 emotionally physically it's a growth it's like it's growth it's a sign of growth right like

1:09:18.480 --> 1:09:22.560
 if you're not having to feel those things you're probably in your comfort zone which is fine but

1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:29.280
 that's not your growth zone right and everybody has a different threshold for that I mean the

1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:34.800
 beautiful thing about jiu jitsu is like it's also has like a yoga feel to it like you're

1:09:34.800 --> 1:09:40.960
 learning about your body so depending on the gym and depending on in fact the coaches the people

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:45.920
 around you within the gym you can select little groups too kind of like the people with who you

1:09:45.920 --> 1:09:50.880
 roll like if you're a smaller person it doesn't mean you have to go against big people you can go

1:09:50.880 --> 1:09:55.360
 against the people who like smoke a lot of weed and they're chill or you can go against like that

1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:00.480
 crazy ripped blue belt competitor who's like out to destroy everybody and depending on like

1:10:01.120 --> 1:10:07.760
 what your mindset is you can kind of select that it's such a fascinating journey of like

1:10:07.760 --> 1:10:12.240
 basically self discovery I couldn't agree with you more it's and what you need may change over

1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:16.160
 time right you maybe what you needed what you need today could change six months from now or

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:20.160
 a year from now and that's something that I experience I'll use my my first coach Christian

1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:24.880
 again as a great example of someone who I really look up to and respect and someone who helped me

1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:28.880
 a lot like at a time when I really needed some guidance and I needed to learn martial arts but

1:10:28.880 --> 1:10:33.360
 get into I the Hensel Gracie's gym was right down the street from where Christian was teaching

1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:37.040
 and Christian was a blue belt at the time it was he was teaching at a place called fight house which

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:45.200
 was this awesome like you know like 90s early 2000s you know warehouse area down on fashion avenue

1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:50.880
 in Manhattan off of like between 7th and 8th and it was like like two basketball courts wide but

1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:54.080
 like there's the sombo guys over here there was the collie guys over there there was a wing chun

1:10:54.080 --> 1:10:58.480
 over there was Jiu Jitsu in the corner and Hensel's was one of the most famous academies in the world

1:10:58.480 --> 1:11:03.920
 at that time still is and I just didn't know what Hensel Gracie was and I mean it's a great gym

1:11:03.920 --> 1:11:08.720
 and it's a fantastic place for people to train but I think what was right for me at the time was to

1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:14.240
 I stumbled into you know like a two person elevator up and found a place where six people

1:11:14.240 --> 1:11:19.360
 trained at that time and I had someone that that I could that could give me some like in addition

1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:23.760
 to martial arts advice like personal guidance and that made a that made a big difference and then

1:11:23.760 --> 1:11:29.360
 when initially we would have like competitions or like intra intra you know gym competitions with

1:11:29.360 --> 1:11:33.200
 the sombo guys we would compete we would roll with them and like again it was great because they were

1:11:33.200 --> 1:11:36.800
 just a bunch of like like Russian dudes from like Brighton Beach and they would come down

1:11:36.800 --> 1:11:40.960
 and then we would all fight and then everyone would train and we'd all drink tea and then go home

1:11:40.960 --> 1:11:47.280
 and anyway what was Russian it was super super tough and they were like again just a tough group

1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:52.560
 of people it was great and then I remember when I decided after like four or five months my men

1:11:52.560 --> 1:11:55.440
 I really want to try to take this seriously and I told Christian about that and he's like well hey

1:11:55.440 --> 1:11:59.280
 I think you need to do the following and it was you know like hey here's there was a guy named

1:11:59.280 --> 1:12:03.200
 Jeff Ruth who was a purple belt at the time which was a much bigger deal than there's now but was

1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:08.240
 10 and 0 as an MMA fighter a lot of amateur box spirit super tough dude and Jeff was the was the

1:12:08.240 --> 1:12:11.680
 best person at that time that I'd ever trained with and I just got squashed Christian used to beat

1:12:11.680 --> 1:12:16.480
 me up too but like Jeff would just absolutely kick the crap out of me and I was like this is awesome

1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:20.000
 and this was back when I was at home I went home for the summer for that and Chris was like hey I

1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.680
 think you should stay because I told him that's what I was thinking and this was a coach that

1:12:24.240 --> 1:12:28.320
 you know when it's like when initially was exactly what I needed and then he's like well hey that's

1:12:28.320 --> 1:12:32.560
 not what I'm doing here maybe they're going to be able to help you onto a path that's that's kind

1:12:32.560 --> 1:12:36.800
 of commensurate with what your goals are at the moment and then you know that was an that was an

1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:41.520
 interesting thing and I really got I feel that I was fortunate to start um at a place where my

1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:47.520
 coach was able to transition role and and and do so comfortably and I think that that also was

1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:51.680
 probably a factor the fact that you know where he'd done some of his training prior like there

1:12:51.680 --> 1:12:56.000
 have been issues with with the coach there we're like not supporting not having the support you

1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:59.280
 know feeling like hey like I'm going to hold on to my students I'm going to hold on to my best

1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:04.960
 guy or my best girl even if I can't take them where they need to go um so that was an interesting

1:13:04.960 --> 1:13:09.680
 thing and just recognizing also though that the people like the same way you're an individual

1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:13.600
 going into a gym and you don't know what you're getting into your coach is a person too and and

1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:18.240
 he or she you know they may have been doing this activity longer than you but they're not they're

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:22.320
 not some weird little you know all knowing god they don't know anything they're gonna they may

1:13:22.320 --> 1:13:26.880
 say something that pisses you off they may bum they may yell at you they may help you they may

1:13:26.880 --> 1:13:32.640
 inadvertently cause you some sort of you know some sort of issue and just being able to recognize

1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:36.240
 that even though I say this to people and I've said this to people in my gym I'm like

1:13:36.240 --> 1:13:39.920
 you know we're in the service industry man but I'm not at your service like don't get it twisted

1:13:39.920 --> 1:13:46.400
 like I will absolutely do my best to help people I'm there to do my best as a martial arts coach

1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:49.760
 but I'm here to do my best as a martial arts coach and I'll do my best and periodically I make

1:13:49.760 --> 1:13:54.240
 mistakes and I own apology or two and I'll try to give them out when I can but we're not McDonald's

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:57.520
 it's not oh you gave me a hundred bucks so you do whatever you want in here this is my house this is

1:13:57.520 --> 1:14:01.360
 my gym this is my dojo this is this is a martial arts this is not a basketball team yeah there's

1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:07.920
 something beautiful about martial arts like exactly as you said is the coach like in wrestling and at

1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:14.720
 least collegiate like high level wrestling is like there's a dictatorship aspect to a coach

1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:21.120
 that is very important to have like this this ridiculous sometimes nature of like master

1:14:21.120 --> 1:14:26.240
 and so on and bowing all these traditions there's something it seems ridiculous from the outside

1:14:26.240 --> 1:14:31.360
 perhaps but there's something really powerful to that because that process of you said why not of

1:14:31.360 --> 1:14:37.440
 letting go of the leap of faith requires you to believe that the coach has your best interest

1:14:37.440 --> 1:14:45.200
 in mind and just give yourself over to their ideas of how how you should grow and that's an

1:14:45.200 --> 1:14:53.440
 interesting thing I mean I've never been able to really see coaches I've had as human they're always

1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:59.520
 you always it's like a father figure or like this you always put them in this position of power and

1:14:59.520 --> 1:15:06.400
 I think that's I think at least for me it's been a very it's been a very useful way to see the

1:15:06.400 --> 1:15:12.400
 coach because it allows you to not think and let go and really allow yourself to grow and

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:17.040
 emotionally deal with all the beatings they'll push you were passed oftentimes where you would

1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:21.360
 have stopped yourself right which is great and then hopefully they know they if they're paying

1:15:21.360 --> 1:15:24.480
 attention and they're they're still a person they can make mistakes but they'll push you

1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:28.720
 further than you would have gone but not so far that it's not facilitative right right that's

1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:32.880
 something that I can say like for us a hobby the head coach at tri star what my head coach for

1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:37.760
 MMA Kenny Florian one of the head coaches for MMA have both been phenomenal influences Paul Schreiner

1:15:37.760 --> 1:15:42.640
 who's the one of the assistants at Marcelo Garcia's Academy coached me in jiu jitsu for a long time

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:47.040
 brilliant instructor they've all been able to do that and I think what's interesting about all of

1:15:47.040 --> 1:15:51.600
 those guys they're very sharp but they they're very intuitive as well and I think that for us

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:56.720
 actually you know told me about some of the John Wooden said John Wooden the legendary UCLA basketball

1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:03.360
 coach just a simple philosophical idea just he said some people's life is a bowl of shit it needs

1:16:03.360 --> 1:16:07.280
 some whipped cream in it some people's life is a bowl of whipped cream needs a little bit of

1:16:07.280 --> 1:16:11.680
 shit in it just to balance it out and it's an interesting thing coaching everyone the same way

1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:15.200
 doesn't work you know that's I think the difference between a coach and an instructor and a lot of

1:16:15.200 --> 1:16:18.560
 times people think they want to coach but they really want an instructor I'm like hey like tell

1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:23.680
 me what to do not how to do it and then other times people think they want you know an instructor

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:27.600
 and they really want to coach and I'm like man this guy's just giving me information a coach is

1:16:27.600 --> 1:16:31.600
 so much more than an instructor and that's a huge leap and that's something that I think that people

1:16:31.600 --> 1:16:34.880
 need to understand when they're going into martial arts and I understand I can totally grasp why

1:16:34.880 --> 1:16:40.720
 they don't because how would they know but uh I think about this a lot like me giving you $150

1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:45.120
 for a month which is not nothing that's for sure that does not that pays for instructor really

1:16:45.760 --> 1:16:49.120
 coach is a relationship that gets developed because can you imagine like just the amount of

1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:53.600
 emotional investment and time thinking away from from like oh Alex isn't here anymore what can I

1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:57.920
 do to help him what does he need like that's that's serious and that's the difference between

1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:03.680
 that's that's often times the difference that getting getting over the hump in various situations

1:17:03.680 --> 1:17:08.160
 so it's uh it's an interesting you know bargain that's being made like commitment by the by the

1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:12.320
 instructor who becomes a coach commitment by the student you know like there's a financial

1:17:12.320 --> 1:17:15.840
 transaction there's a lot of things going on there but I feel very fortunate to have had

1:17:16.400 --> 1:17:20.800
 not just instructors in my time but coaches and that means sometimes we butted heads and

1:17:20.800 --> 1:17:23.840
 sometimes I look back and I think I was right and other times look back in my own no they were

1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:28.880
 definitely right but there was always the trust with the exception of one time that I feel that

1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:35.440
 trust was greatly betrayed that rightly or wrongly whether mistakes mistakes will be made but

1:17:35.440 --> 1:17:40.560
 everyone is attempting to do do the right thing under no circumstances would I intentionally

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:44.640
 do anything malicious you know versus hey I might have done I might have burnt your house down but

1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:49.120
 you can be darn sure it wasn't on purpose and I think that as long as there's that mutual understanding

1:17:49.120 --> 1:17:54.480
 and mutual belief of goodwill which again doesn't just magic up out of nowhere I understand I think

1:17:54.480 --> 1:17:58.480
 that that's when then great things can happen and I look at all the athletes that I know you know

1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:03.200
 the guys and girls that I've watched become fantastic in various places almost invariably

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:09.680
 they it never happened alone yeah yeah I'm really torn about that like um maybe you can help have

1:18:09.680 --> 1:18:17.040
 you seen the movie whiplash so it's uh I would say from an outsider's perspective people should

1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:25.440
 watch it's a I guess jazz band of it's a movie about a drummer and the instructor and he it's

1:18:25.440 --> 1:18:30.560
 a basically I would say from the outsider's perspective it's a toxic relationship but he's

1:18:30.560 --> 1:18:39.040
 really the coach whatever we call him pushes the the musician the drummer to his limits like to where

1:18:40.480 --> 1:18:46.480
 he just feels like shit emotionally it's it it looks like a toxic relationship but it's one

1:18:46.480 --> 1:18:53.200
 that ultimately is very productive for the improvement of the musician I have the same

1:18:53.200 --> 1:19:00.960
 like in my own experience I had um I got a chance to train at a couple places regularly and so one

1:19:00.960 --> 1:19:08.640
 of my coaches uh who is a great human being a lot of people love him but when I was a blue belt he

1:19:08.640 --> 1:19:17.680
 was pushing me a lot for competition and every time I stepped on the mat I was uh uh anxious and

1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:26.960
 almost afraid of training because of like the places I'm gonna have to go and then the I can't

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:33.760
 I don't know what's good or bad because I think I've become a better person because of that experience

1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:41.440
 like I needed that and on the flip side like the place I got my black belt from balance studios

1:19:41.440 --> 1:19:48.000
 I remember also a blue belt uh the coach sitting down and I was going to competition and he saw

1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:58.080
 something in me where he said um you know like good luck but win or lose we always love you

1:19:58.080 --> 1:20:04.640
 like I I really I remember that because I really needed that at that time like I was putting so

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:11.280
 much pressure on myself like I'm not an actual professional competitor you know I just competed

1:20:11.280 --> 1:20:16.800
 like I'm a PhD student like but like it was clearly having a psychological effect on me

1:20:16.800 --> 1:20:23.200
 and that's what a great coach does is like you know it's like life is more important than jujitsu

1:20:23.200 --> 1:20:29.120
 since it's bigger so they find you use jujitsu when you need it to grow as a person

1:20:29.840 --> 1:20:35.520
 and when it overwhelms you you you have to pull that person out like look at the bigger picture

1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:40.400
 always look at the bigger picture it's fascinating and I don't know what to make of it I don't think

1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:47.280
 I would have it any other way is both the anxiety and the and the love yeah I think that I couldn't

1:20:47.280 --> 1:20:51.920
 that's a really interesting thing that you're describing that I guess it kind of brings me back

1:20:51.920 --> 1:20:56.320
 to a lot of the other things we've been discussing is just almost like the the reciprocal nature

1:20:56.320 --> 1:21:02.320
 of everything where no pressure that's great everyone's happy all the time it's even I mean

1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:06.800
 let's uh use an example of sci fi movies to say The Matrix which of course the first one was amazing

1:21:06.800 --> 1:21:11.200
 and then each subsequent movie made this series worse but um but basically they're working on a

1:21:11.200 --> 1:21:15.920
 new one by the way yeah I've heard we'll see I'm hoping for the best but um but basically uh you

1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:20.240
 know let's say hey we started our first initial world agent Smith says to Neo he's like our first

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:25.680
 world was a utopia where everyone was happy and nothing ever went wrong it's like your primitive

1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:31.040
 cerebrum rejected it and I think that there's obviously I mean what do I think but I guess

1:21:31.040 --> 1:21:38.560
 well I'm here so I might as well say what I think um but I guess uh you know great things are fantastic

1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:44.480
 a kind gentle place is fantastic and this is again why I love Dune because I think Dune does

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:48.560
 such a great job of of expressing Frank Herbert does such a great job of expressing again the

1:21:48.560 --> 1:21:53.520
 reciprocal nature of these ideas you know look at uh look at Sparta for instance or at least what I

1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:59.760
 understand is Sparta from the reading and also watching 300 um uh you know and reading the Wikipedia

1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:06.880
 and reading the Wikipedia article about the movie not the uh place um but uh it's um that's a hard

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:12.960
 brutal place and there was their benefit to that like absolutely was their drawback to that

1:22:12.960 --> 1:22:18.800
 absolutely is it sustainable I should I would think probably not um I mean granted it hasn't

1:22:18.800 --> 1:22:25.600
 sustained but I mean that type of a of a thing it burns too hot almost and it uh it destroys the

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:31.440
 host at a certain point and you know I guess that that type of unforgiving nature but entirely

1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:36.640
 entirely permissive has its own issues and I guess coming back to your what your description

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:41.440
 of like describing a toxic relationship is a very dangerous and tricky thing because it's almost

1:22:41.440 --> 1:22:46.320
 like uh it's like birds eye view me it's like you know you see let's say a husband and a wife arguing

1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:50.880
 and you're like all right well sort of somebody hitting somebody I need to keep myself out of this

1:22:50.880 --> 1:22:57.280
 because I have no idea what I'm seeing something but I don't know what's going on or why specifically

1:22:57.280 --> 1:23:02.720
 and again short of it going to a place that's that just out a lot of bounce I don't know who's

1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:08.160
 right here I don't know who's wrong and I don't know what phase of this things are in so I guess

1:23:08.160 --> 1:23:13.920
 coming back and in the long term what's good for yeah the both people right it's dangerous for so

1:23:13.920 --> 1:23:16.960
 if I want to put my finger on the scale I can understand the the desire to do them like hey

1:23:16.960 --> 1:23:20.720
 guys just break it up yeah but and that may be the right thing at the time but at the same time

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:26.480
 I'm not sure so I think back to all of the times that you know that like you mentioned your coach's

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:30.960
 pushing you when very very hard and then other times going like hey let's put it in perspective

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:34.640
 here I think that's an interesting thing for high performance and I think that we're seeing that

1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:39.200
 again societally you know now or at least maybe that's just pops up on my internet feed periodically

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:43.760
 but coaches shouldn't be allowed to do this or yell at this person to yell at that person

1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:49.760
 like well have you ever been go to boxing gym it's not a commercial entity not really a real

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:56.400
 boxing not LA boxing not a USC gym like a real place you're going to see what things are like

1:23:56.400 --> 1:24:00.160
 when it's entirely performance based go to wrestling room at a high level you know again

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:03.840
 there's there's left and right limits and there are such things obviously is abuse of course

1:24:03.840 --> 1:24:11.280
 but and that should never be tolerated um but it's not a commercial entity I don't need to be sweet

1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:14.800
 to you if you're if you're screwing up if you're dropping the ball and in fact recognizing that

1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:21.120
 I'm not doing you a favor or the team a favor by by being permissive of that type of behavior

1:24:21.120 --> 1:24:25.680
 I think is important everything in its context and at its time is important and I guess I can

1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:31.360
 think again at the times that I've been put put or had put on me like a great deal of pressure

1:24:31.360 --> 1:24:38.400
 to do x y's a year to succeed um or to push for success and I can't look back fondly enough on

1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:42.560
 those times and they were tough at the time but without that I'm not sitting here without that

1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:49.280
 I don't go from growing up in a in a very nice family in the suburbs to fighting at the highest

1:24:49.280 --> 1:24:53.920
 level in jujitsu gi no gi and now in mixed martial arts starting a career at age 27

1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:58.720
 you know I don't it just doesn't happen because people generally speaking from that

1:24:58.720 --> 1:25:02.960
 background don't get pushed hard enough physically to be able to make that transition

1:25:03.600 --> 1:25:09.200
 and that has benefits and it has drawbacks you know when you stare into the abyss it stares

1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:13.840
 back and I think that that's an important thing to understand you know you stare long enough you

1:25:13.840 --> 1:25:17.680
 you can become something that you don't that you would be sorry that you did you don't look

1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:22.880
 enough and you don't have perspective either you know and I think that that's an interesting thing

1:25:22.880 --> 1:25:27.120
 I can speak to someone who's relative to being someone who's relatively articulate and reasonable

1:25:27.120 --> 1:25:31.200
 I try to be reasonable but you know I'll say in sparring if people get crazy with me they get a

1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:38.000
 warning and then I'ma crack them and what do they expect oh they hear the guy on a on an interview

1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:42.240
 but who did they think they were meeting because there's also the guy in the ring

1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:46.160
 and there's layers there too I remember training with you it was it's kind of funny

1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:53.840
 there's like there's well you didn't know who I was I mean you still like I have a really good

1:25:53.840 --> 1:26:01.040
 straight ankle up by the way yeah that so I don't remember what rank I was but it might have been

1:26:01.040 --> 1:26:07.440
 purple or something like that and I did some like I you had this look on your face which I've

1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:16.240
 often seen in black belts it's like here he goes again like here here's him trying this thing

1:26:16.960 --> 1:26:22.400
 and then when I kind of annoyed you a little bit with it now I get that it was a good it like I

1:26:22.400 --> 1:26:26.640
 you know I did something somewhat effective like some like maybe a little bit off balance

1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:31.440
 yeah there's I just peeled off a little layer of Ryan Hall to where I was like okay let me

1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:38.480
 let me like there there's like layers underneath there's like my Tyson's somewhere in there

1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:44.240
 like so it was like okay this like new guy rolls in here he thinks he can do the stupid thing

1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:49.440
 and then and then you started to beat the hell out of me but the the point is there's layers here

1:26:49.440 --> 1:26:55.200
 from the guy who was being interviewed now to like Genghis Khan but it's but it's all in the same

1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:59.440
 body right but it's like all of us are like that right in various different directions and recognizing

1:26:59.440 --> 1:27:03.600
 that's okay it's just there are consequences to all every choice that we make has a consequence

1:27:03.600 --> 1:27:07.200
 sometimes there's like objectively wrong or objectively right but at least in my mind that's

1:27:07.200 --> 1:27:12.080
 a pretty small box everything else is just there's a consequence to that do you like that consequence

1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:18.480
 do you not and who do I want to become what do I want to try to hone myself for anyone else into

1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:22.880
 and also like but this is something I've screwed up as a coach plenty of times you know like if

1:27:22.880 --> 1:27:27.920
 someone says if you're if like I come to like Lex I really really want to take you know research

1:27:27.920 --> 1:27:33.280
 very seriously like okay I believe you now I haven't shown you that but I believe you like okay

1:27:33.280 --> 1:27:38.320
 and now me not showing up to research or to study or not being up until three in the morning thinking

1:27:38.320 --> 1:27:43.280
 about this is no longer acceptable there was a time like five seconds before me making that statement

1:27:43.280 --> 1:27:47.840
 that if I went to bed without reading the book that I needed to read no worries but the second

1:27:47.840 --> 1:27:52.080
 that I made that statement your expectations for me changed and maybe it's something that's

1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:55.680
 something that I've screwed up a whole bunch of times in my as a teacher because it's an

1:27:55.680 --> 1:27:59.040
 interesting thing obviously you know being a like running a martial arts school is as your

1:27:59.040 --> 1:28:04.640
 principally an athlete is sometimes I don't pay enough attention to what people are doing I would

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:09.760
 just go okay you say XYZ I'm like Roger that I believe you're cool I will now put you in category

1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:14.720
 X and whether rightly or wrongly like maybe this person didn't understand what they were asking

1:28:14.720 --> 1:28:19.040
 for or I didn't express this or the other and it just it caused cross wires and then most

1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:21.840
 times you just you hash it out you have a discussion you figure out get to the bottom of

1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:25.920
 what people are trying to do or what they want but uh if I was paying more attention I think I

1:28:25.920 --> 1:28:29.200
 could have been a lot more effective or if I had more experience and sometimes maybe I'm not sharp

1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:32.960
 enough or I don't I'm not perceptive enough to be able to to see what's going on and maybe with

1:28:32.960 --> 1:28:37.520
 years more down the line I'll be able to have a sharper perception but uh I think that's another

1:28:37.520 --> 1:28:41.760
 one of those interesting things that some that sometimes I would caution or not caution but

1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:46.400
 just inform a prospective martial arts student depending upon where you're going um you know

1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:50.880
 this you both you and also your coach or other people in the room they wear many hats and sometimes

1:28:50.880 --> 1:28:55.040
 there's a I had the wrong hat on you were talking to me as Lex the guy I didn't realize you were

1:28:55.040 --> 1:28:57.520
 talking to me I thought you were talking to me as Lex the guy I didn't realize you're talking to me

1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:01.360
 as Lex the martial artist I'm like oh crap I was talking to the wrong person so it's almost like if

1:29:01.360 --> 1:29:09.040
 you had a like I run my gym with my wife she's a black belt so she's my wife she's my peers as a

1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:15.040
 martial artist uh in jiu jitsu he's here by the way in judging so exactly all right well all right

1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:18.880
 so but but a fellow black belt and I guess like another she doesn't have a microphone so you can't

1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:22.960
 hear all the trash she's talking exactly but it can be tough and that's something we've had to work

1:29:22.960 --> 1:29:26.640
 through a lot and it's like looking back and it's like now being where I'm at now and it's easy for

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:30.160
 me to say that because she's in the room and I don't want to stab me just continue to slowly

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:35.360
 poison me over time yeah um which frankly I understand um you know it's it's the sort of thing

1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:40.320
 that that is now way more effective than anything else I could really reasonably expect to have

1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:46.480
 but there were times when when both of us you know were justifiably annoyed at the other because

1:29:46.480 --> 1:29:49.920
 of crossed wires and sometimes you know you just have disagreement anywhere or misunderstanding

1:29:49.920 --> 1:29:54.320
 anyway but again like I've I coach some of my friends I've coached I've coached my friend who

1:29:54.320 --> 1:29:58.720
 I've known since I was four years old you know sometimes I don't go hey buddy how you doing

1:29:58.720 --> 1:30:01.360
 sometimes like what the fuck are you doing put your hand over there how many times we talked

1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:05.760
 about this and then you walk away and you can see him look at your crooked and you're like oh

1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:09.360
 crap oh yeah he thought I was talking to his friend yeah well all right let we need to talk this one

1:30:09.360 --> 1:30:13.680
 out hashing out and not he's wrong how could he possibly think that way like oh no I totally

1:30:13.680 --> 1:30:18.640
 understand that but if I was 22 but doesn't need no I'm a purple belt some nonsense like that and

1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:23.200
 it's and it doesn't come from a bad place but it's just I guess that comes back to society to anything

1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:27.440
 people only have the perspective that they have and the awareness that we have and so again going

1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:32.400
 back and going hey guys grace like I don't expect it's not fair for me to go I'd fight UFC why

1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:36.160
 doesn't this guy who came in as an attorney understand how hardcore this needs to be and

1:30:36.160 --> 1:30:43.200
 like how could he and at the same time though if if I'm using the language of someone that is

1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:47.360
 interested in at least performance from a martial arts perspective I understand how that could be

1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:51.200
 off putting let's say for instance someone that's like all of that would be out of bounds in their

1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:56.240
 normal workplace but if they think of the gym as my office then whether they agree or disagree with

1:30:56.240 --> 1:30:59.840
 what's going on they go okay I hear why I see why that might have happened let's talk about this

1:30:59.840 --> 1:31:04.880
 and we can again all push forward in a positive direction that benefits I guess everyone's journey

1:31:04.880 --> 1:31:11.360
 throughout the activity and now on top of all that there's moods okay I mean especially lately

1:31:11.360 --> 1:31:21.120
 uh I think two days ago maybe yesterday no two days ago I've never been that cranky in my life

1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:27.120
 I think I don't know what it was but I wanted to tell everybody how much they annoyed me

1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:34.800
 it was like I was just very conscious of this feeling of like why why is this happening right

1:31:34.800 --> 1:31:40.240
 now so I consciously decided as I usually do in those cases to not say anything to anybody

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:49.840
 how do you do that uh well I you know it's uh it's yeah meditate because it's not I tend to

1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:54.720
 to I tend to then visualize what's going to happen in the next like how's this going to make my life

1:31:54.720 --> 1:32:06.720
 better like if I say something that mean to somebody else I have uh just started a conflict

1:32:06.720 --> 1:32:15.600
 that will just escalate will continue will add more conflict to my life it'll make things I just

1:32:15.600 --> 1:32:22.400
 don't like the feeling it will create and so you live enough life to know that like uh it's just like

1:32:22.400 --> 1:32:28.560
 with like street fighting you know I I would get into a lot of fights when I was younger just on

1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:33.840
 the street but then you realize like it's not like a jiu jitsu match or something like that it's not

1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:41.680
 it'll escalate it'll it'll might come back at you it'll like that person might find you again but

1:32:41.680 --> 1:32:51.120
 more importantly the anxiety of it of having created little enemies in this world distorts the

1:32:51.120 --> 1:32:57.600
 way you see the world so I've noticed that like if I am shitty to people on the internet which I

1:32:57.600 --> 1:33:03.760
 haven't been I think in a long time is like it it somehow brings the shittiness to you more and more

1:33:03.760 --> 1:33:10.960
 it escalates like the more love you put out there the more like the people who put love out like

1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:14.720
 surround you when you mentioned forgiveness as well like you said you give hope it's like I

1:33:14.720 --> 1:33:18.960
 guess back to the original you know the holocaust survivor scenario we're like oh my god like you

1:33:18.960 --> 1:33:25.120
 think of the ultimate in like I've never experienced one one billionth of that level of of pain and

1:33:25.120 --> 1:33:29.760
 horror and it's like and I can't let this little thing go you know I guess that's an interesting

1:33:29.760 --> 1:33:33.760
 thing I think you're just making the point in your personal life I guess the same way right

1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:41.040
 yeah they're yeah and on the internet it's hard I've somehow gotten I mean you've you've had a

1:33:41.040 --> 1:33:47.520
 level of celebrity for a while I've recently gotten some level of like celebrity and like these

1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:54.320
 people who are just shitty for no reason come out from all from all places like calling me a

1:33:54.320 --> 1:34:00.960
 fraud or anything else I mean it's a giant silent bob strike back they find out a movie is going to

1:34:00.960 --> 1:34:04.000
 be made about them and people talking shit on the internet and they're like what's the internet and

1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:07.360
 then someone shows them and they're like what and they go to a message board and they go to

1:34:07.360 --> 1:34:10.720
 Hollywood to try to stop it from being made and they eventually get money for their likeness and

1:34:10.720 --> 1:34:13.840
 they use the money to buy plane tickets and fly around and beat the shit out of all the people

1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:18.720
 that talk bad about them yeah it's tough I mean it's uh I'm having trouble with it because there's

1:34:18.720 --> 1:34:25.040
 people like yeah there's you know there's posts and forums and like heated discussions about

1:34:25.040 --> 1:34:30.160
 his legs for even a fraud I don't know what has he really done and there's like and then there's

1:34:30.160 --> 1:34:35.840
 people like well I think he's an alright guy but I'm not sure like like there's like literal

1:34:35.840 --> 1:34:42.400
 discussions and I'm like like nobody like if you increase the level of celebrity there's going to

1:34:42.400 --> 1:34:48.000
 be like one of the things that hurts my heart a little bit is like some level of toxicity around

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:54.880
 Joe Rogan for example there's like communities of people that now like talk about him selling out

1:34:54.880 --> 1:35:02.080
 for example all that kind of stuff and I don't you know and Joe I've talked to him about it is

1:35:02.080 --> 1:35:08.880
 amazing that he uh he says don't read the comments he legitimately doesn't read the comments his heart

1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:14.880
 and his soul doesn't give a damn about the comments all he gives a damn about is his friends like one

1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:20.320
 of the things that's really inspiring to me and that's I've had a conversation with him offline

1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:29.040
 about Spotify and the removed episodes people are curious what's Spotify it's it's a thing on the

1:35:29.040 --> 1:35:36.880
 internet where I think you can play Taylor Swift songs on I'll write that down but you can also

1:35:36.880 --> 1:35:42.960
 now play Joe Rogan podcast oh cool and they gave him a hundred million dollars so that that's

1:35:42.960 --> 1:35:50.080
 uh you know that's awesome for Joe it's yeah but the thing I've had a discussion with him

1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:54.960
 and I made a video about it that I took down because the toxicity is like it's hard to put

1:35:54.960 --> 1:36:03.200
 into words but he will give away the hundred million in a second if he ever has to compromise

1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:09.680
 who he is like he doesn't I mean he already said as he talked about he's made quote unquote fuck

1:36:09.680 --> 1:36:16.880
 you money a long time ago he doesn't need any more money he doesn't care it's nice to have money

1:36:17.440 --> 1:36:25.200
 whatever but like he'll give it away so the it's nice to see when people like him at a level of

1:36:25.200 --> 1:36:33.120
 celebrity level of success and financial success don't change at all they're just the same thing

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:38.800
 that makes you happy is talking in his case talking shit with his friends in the case of most of us

1:36:38.800 --> 1:36:45.440
 really just just hanging out with friends doing the things you love in his case doing the things

1:36:45.440 --> 1:36:55.120
 he loves without any like you know the texas way the freedom like without any corporate bureaucracy

1:36:55.120 --> 1:37:01.280
 bullshit that rolls in and says well maybe you shouldn't say fuck you know like more than 20

1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:06.000
 times a podcast or something like that like those kinds like rules like people like he says in a

1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:12.080
 suit and tie they show up and say stuff oddly enough people that could never have done what he

1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:20.160
 does yeah exactly and it's kind of inspiring to see that and I hope people I hope people realize

1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:27.760
 how special of a human he is he's inspired like people like me like I'm just I'm a scientist right

1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:34.720
 so he inspired somebody like me from a very different walk of life to be like kind to others

1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:42.160
 to be open minded I don't know that uh it's a special dude so like people need to support that

1:37:42.160 --> 1:37:50.480
 and treasure that as opposed to uh as opposed to be toxic about it if I mean what uh because people

1:37:51.840 --> 1:37:57.840
 really for a long time have told me that it would be awesome if Ryan Hall's on goes on Joe Rogan I

1:37:57.840 --> 1:38:03.840
 definitely think that would be an awesome thing had have you listened to Joe has he been a part of

1:38:03.840 --> 1:38:08.480
 your life in some kind of way um you know well Joe's always I'm never watching Joe on Fear Factor

1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:12.080
 when I was a little kid which is cool so I've actually gotten a like from a from a bird's eye

1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:17.760
 view watch you know his his kind of just path through life yeah but one of the things that that I

1:38:17.760 --> 1:38:21.520
 always appreciate and again I barely know Joe other than to shake his hand he interviewed me after

1:38:21.520 --> 1:38:26.880
 the uh briefly in the ring after the BJ Pan fight but um one of the things that I've always admired

1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:32.720
 about Joe is that I think he had fucking money from the start I think that zero dollars is fucking

1:38:32.720 --> 1:38:37.920
 money for Joe I think and that's something I respect about him a great deal um because as you

1:38:37.920 --> 1:38:43.120
 say it's interesting to watch it's like you you hope that uh George St. Pierre's like this it's

1:38:43.120 --> 1:38:47.040
 really not I'm not super close to George but we're teammates at TriStar and he's never been anything

1:38:47.040 --> 1:38:51.120
 but a gentleman is one of those people that if you didn't know George was famous when you walk

1:38:51.120 --> 1:38:55.040
 in the gym you'd never know idea he's not holding court not doing it he's just you know training

1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:58.800
 and how about an amateur doing this if you have a question for him he'll help me like I'm nobody

1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:03.520
 man he would give me advice and train me it was super cool and he didn't kill me which I really

1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:09.040
 appreciated he's a gentleman but uh you know it's like you you meet someone and you go man I'm so

1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:14.080
 it's so cool that this is the guy who's the best that this is the guy who who's been successful and

1:39:14.080 --> 1:39:18.800
 then you go why are they successful like I said true to what they're doing they haven't changed

1:39:18.800 --> 1:39:22.400
 they're the same as they've been and I remember I got to TriStar in 2012 and George was already

1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:26.480
 already George St. Pierre but I remember watching and talking to people and they're like oh man George

1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:30.000
 is the same as he's always been and it's neat I see him in the gym training now and again giving

1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:34.800
 advice now and it seems like Joe has always been consistent and it's neat to watch someone

1:39:35.440 --> 1:39:39.600
 not compromise on their values and not change who they are and not you know periodically like you

1:39:39.600 --> 1:39:43.280
 know again we all make mistakes like you have a bad day or this or that and an apology needs to

1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:47.120
 be issued or even my bad or this or that and you're like yeah they just move on that they're

1:39:47.120 --> 1:39:51.920
 not afraid to be themselves and they're not afraid to be wrong they're not afraid to make a mistake

1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:55.520
 as you as you mentioned open mind and some like so what are the correct beliefs to have about this

1:39:55.520 --> 1:39:59.280
 that I know going in everyone's going to be okay with what I'm saying which is usually the beginning

1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:05.920
 of a conversation that's going to go nowhere right and it's neat to see the things I guess

1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:11.520
 that he's created on his own as a result of the authenticity that's there and it reminds me of

1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:16.880
 like Dave Chappelle and again I've never met Dave but it's neat to see someone that's clearly

1:40:16.880 --> 1:40:22.800
 again authentic in their own way doing their own thing and they're because of that they're above

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:27.680
 the corporate nonsense but what's funny I think the message behind all of it is hey guys we all

1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:32.560
 are I can't promise you that I'm gonna have money Joe couldn't promise you that he's gonna have money

1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:39.200
 now it ended up working out but he was above that nonsense from the jump and he just continued

1:40:39.200 --> 1:40:42.640
 to be above it by never giving it any mind and just going like yeah I'm gonna be a reasonable

1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:48.080
 person I'm gonna try to learn I'm gonna try to grow and if I say something annoying you can come

1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:51.680
 and talk to me about it we can get to the bottom of it and I'm like if I need to say my bad thanks

1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:55.600
 appreciate it now you know I will and if I don't need to I'm like hey I still appreciate the talk

1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:59.360
 thanks man shake your hand and we carry on and we go our separate ways and hopefully I'll treat

1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:03.840
 you with respect you treat me with respect and and that's about it and I guess I think it's a

1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:08.560
 lesson that it can work out no matter what you don't have to count out to like these weird powers

1:41:08.560 --> 1:41:14.080
 that be and whether you're at this level or at this level but you can live your life the way

1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:17.680
 that you want and as you mentioned talk to your friends hang out be happy and it just so happens

1:41:17.680 --> 1:41:22.000
 that that resonates with people it actually reminds me of like speaking at MIT and being in Boston

1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:26.160
 is like a goodwill hunting you know like again that's what do you really want to do he could

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:29.360
 have gone this way he could have gone that way and it was an interesting story but it's like

1:41:29.920 --> 1:41:34.080
 this person wants to hang out with his buddies and wants to do other things and again happens to

1:41:34.080 --> 1:41:39.040
 be brilliant and happens to be able to do all these other things but there was I guess it's

1:41:39.040 --> 1:41:43.200
 like at least in my mind a story of authenticity as well and it was both the same thing in the

1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:48.720
 Robin Williams character and I just think that that's a message because watch watching things

1:41:48.720 --> 1:41:52.640
 occur on the internet as they do now things so many things playing out in the public eye

1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:57.520
 I feel like so many private or otherwise formally private discussions and disputes and you know

1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:02.720
 interactions now become they all have a well what is this going to say when it goes public

1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:06.640
 so how can I couch what I'm saying or how can I word this in a way that's going to get people on

1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:11.040
 my side or use the right buzzwords or not use the wrong buzzwords and it's just neat to see people

1:42:11.040 --> 1:42:15.840
 you know in their own way flip the bird to that because I just think that that's that's just

1:42:15.840 --> 1:42:21.760
 not how a human being is meant to think or interact I'm curious what you think about

1:42:22.720 --> 1:42:29.520
 the thing that recently it has you know me like hosting this podcast I sometimes think about like

1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:38.720
 who should I talk to and not in terms of like it's the the old Hitler question now Hitler

1:42:38.720 --> 1:42:44.400
 I would definitely talk to because post world war two because everyone knows he's evil the question

1:42:44.400 --> 1:42:52.800
 whether you talk to Hitler in 1937 like when people who are really students of what's going on

1:42:52.800 --> 1:43:00.800
 understand that this is a very dangerous human being but large number of part of the world

1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:06.720
 they're like well he's a leader who cares for Germany so the question I have it's interesting

1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:13.280
 to me it involves a particular person named who also lives in Austin Texas named Alex Jones I

1:43:13.280 --> 1:43:19.040
 don't know if you're familiar with the guy I am familiar with mr. Jones I've actually recently

1:43:19.040 --> 1:43:26.640
 just listened to info wars like one episode of his show I guess he does every day and it kind of

1:43:26.640 --> 1:43:34.080
 remind me of a time in college when I drank too much tequila like there's no turning back like

1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:41.840
 no it's like like the the mistakes you make that like it it's I mean you don't know where you're

1:43:41.840 --> 1:43:49.120
 going to wake up you don't know who you're going to kill or not kill or steal or rob it's it's

1:43:49.120 --> 1:43:56.480
 unclear so that that it felt like I was getting pulled into a dark place where pretty much everybody

1:43:56.480 --> 1:44:04.720
 is a pedophile that's trying to control the world so Bill Gates definitely is a pedophile everybody

1:44:04.720 --> 1:44:11.200
 in power anybody in power there's a kind of a deep skepticism about power and a conspiratorial way

1:44:11.200 --> 1:44:18.320
 to see the world where everything is like dark forces in all corners it's like the way you

1:44:18.320 --> 1:44:23.120
 feel when you're a kid that there's a monster hiding in the closet which is also why you leap

1:44:23.120 --> 1:44:28.080
 over the bed from like four feet away there's a strategy yes so but he says that you're just

1:44:28.080 --> 1:44:32.800
 being weak you need to look under the bed under the bed there's monsters and we need to be aware

1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:37.440
 of them because they're growing they're multiplying you should be and they're touching children

1:44:37.440 --> 1:44:44.720
 they're touching children exactly so it all connects but the the I when I listened to him

1:44:44.720 --> 1:44:47.840
 and I thought about like do I want to talk to him on this podcast for example

1:44:47.840 --> 1:44:57.040
 when I listened to his conversation with Joe Rogan the two times he talked on there to me it was

1:44:57.920 --> 1:45:05.440
 somehow entertaining like it was fun to listen to it's fun to listen to a madman go on for

1:45:05.440 --> 1:45:13.920
 four hours because it's almost like theater like this is what I talked to Joe about when people

1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:21.680
 try to censor Alex Jones Joe says that the people who try to censor him don't give enough credit to

1:45:21.680 --> 1:45:28.960
 the intelligence of human beings to like understand like that like what a person says on a large

1:45:28.960 --> 1:45:35.760
 platform does not necessarily is not the truth you can be a madman and say crazy things and

1:45:35.760 --> 1:45:43.280
 people are intelligent enough to hear certain things when they're said like the earth is flat

1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:49.040
 they can they can be intelligent enough not to all of a sudden start believing that the earth is

1:45:49.040 --> 1:45:54.720
 flat like they they're intelligent enough to sort of select different ideas and be able to enjoy

1:45:55.440 --> 1:46:00.960
 the theater of a particular ridiculous over the top conversation without being sort of influenced

1:46:00.960 --> 1:46:10.880
 to where they start believing like toxic set of beliefs now there's a lot of sort of other kinds

1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:15.680
 of people especially now with cancer culture that say well you don't want to give platform to crazy

1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:22.320
 people that that ultimately whose beliefs might lead to dangerous consequences like and I see it

1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:29.040
 very often now with conspiracy theories that go that go like way too far like for example

1:46:30.400 --> 1:46:39.360
 would I I'm not I haven't looked into it so I'm sorry I will look into it but it hurts my heart

1:46:39.360 --> 1:46:48.080
 to see that on Bill Gates in my opinion the person who has saved and improved more lives than

1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:54.960
 probably any human in history literally because of the money he's invested in helping like just

1:46:54.960 --> 1:47:01.600
 just the work he's done on like malaria in Africa the number of people he's helped is huge and yet

1:47:01.600 --> 1:47:08.320
 every interview anything you see now on Bill Gates everyone is calling him I believe haven't

1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:13.200
 looked into it but I believe everyone's calling him a pedophile I don't know the full structure of it

1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:19.440
 but it's it's just a very it feels like an army of like it feels like it's hundreds of thousands

1:47:19.440 --> 1:47:24.160
 of people that's what it feels like it might be a much smaller percentage but it feels like a huge

1:47:24.160 --> 1:47:28.480
 number of people are calling him a pedophile so that's the that's the flip side if you allow if

1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:33.680
 you give platform to conspiracy theories like that then you start to have bigger and bigger

1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:39.200
 percent of the population believe in these crazy things I just I wanted to put it out there because

1:47:39.200 --> 1:47:44.880
 I don't know what to think of that if you put yourself in Joe Rogan shoes if you put yourself

1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:50.640
 in my shoes if you put yourself just in your own shoes I mean I'm even I'm in my shoes right now

1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:55.920
 great if you're staying your shoes just stay in your shoes can I have your wish would you talk

1:47:55.920 --> 1:48:03.200
 would you give platform to people like Alex Jones would would you talk to somebody like

1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:10.320
 Alex Jones or or not yes I would and I feel very strongly about this honestly

1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:18.160
 well I think that it's it's an interesting thing and I would just say a lot of times I can understand

1:48:18.160 --> 1:48:24.960
 you know very very clearly why people would take issue with the idea of I guess what they

1:48:24.960 --> 1:48:32.160
 proceed to be amplifying this man's voice this man's reach you know as a demonstrable negative

1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:40.560
 but I think you know when you take a step back further the the cure is more damaging than the

1:48:40.560 --> 1:48:49.040
 disease and significantly so I guess I think that I'm very very wary of I think being where

1:48:49.040 --> 1:48:54.320
 you mentioned Alex Jones being wary of power and people with it that's a lot of times there's a lot

1:48:54.320 --> 1:49:01.840
 of truth and validity to crazy things that people say it's the conspiracy theories that stick

1:49:01.840 --> 1:49:07.040
 are the ones that sound credible at least quasi credible in some aspect and it's almost like

1:49:07.040 --> 1:49:12.080
 it seems to me like an anchor in people's mind and it is also funny to me obviously the the

1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:17.760
 Bill Gates it's so funny to tar people with things like pedophile racist rapist like these are

1:49:17.760 --> 1:49:21.840
 things that we're basically trying to pick words that no one can ever support someone who does these

1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:29.280
 things yeah and that's you know and that changes year by year like currently pedophile is totally

1:49:29.280 --> 1:49:36.160
 in as a thing to call somebody just just as a it used to be communist or marxist Cleveland

1:49:36.160 --> 1:49:41.120
 Browns fan you know like come on you know who actually nobody likes the brown so I'll agree

1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:44.800
 with you that was that's why I picked on that's the trick is you find a group of people that

1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:49.600
 nobody likes we're good here all right that's the move but uh yeah that's a creepy thing though

1:49:49.600 --> 1:49:54.640
 because that is that is the creepy thing it's like people are always looking for groups of

1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:58.960
 people are always looking for and I find this really deeply disturbing um like hey so who's

1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:03.600
 the guy that we can all get away with you know just treating like dirt who's the guy that I

1:50:03.600 --> 1:50:08.560
 can be a dick to I can just walk up and punch in the face and no one's gonna say anything yeah and

1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:13.840
 it's even if I you know people do that with whether it's literal Nazis or someone that I

1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:19.200
 called Nazi you know I guess what's the bigger issue this person's ridiculous beliefs or what

1:50:19.200 --> 1:50:25.200
 I'm doing and you mentioned Hitler before and obviously Mein Kampf being a you know like the

1:50:25.200 --> 1:50:29.440
 outline for some of the things they did later and when the evil was it always there did it did

1:50:29.440 --> 1:50:36.080
 it take root later on or flourish later on but was was Adolf Hitler a problem because he had

1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:41.600
 crazy ideas or because he did things I think it's because it's not I think I know it's because he

1:50:41.600 --> 1:50:46.800
 did things now if I'm gonna start punishing thought crime I I'm gonna have to start punishing

1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:51.280
 thought crime and that's a terrifying concept even if I'm right about the certain about the

1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:56.000
 objectively correct about the things that I decide to call out of bounds who put me in charge and

1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:01.760
 made me arbiter of good taste and how long until I decide that something else is is out of bounds

1:51:01.760 --> 1:51:07.440
 it's it's always a sliding scale or it's always a sliding standard and I find that that you know to

1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:12.000
 be more of a concern than people doing crazy things because I guess if you mention Alex Jones you

1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.400
 know putting out ridiculous ridiculous ideas ridiculous theories I think that most people

1:51:16.400 --> 1:51:20.480
 don't look at Alex Jones as a credible person now I'm not going to pretend to be deeply read

1:51:20.480 --> 1:51:25.680
 into all of his beliefs or the things that he's trying to pedal but there's plenty of things

1:51:25.680 --> 1:51:31.200
 that are quasi mainstream that I think on with this side or that side that maybe not comparably

1:51:31.200 --> 1:51:37.600
 ridiculous but are yeah you know particularly in hindsight or you know are we're not or silly

1:51:37.600 --> 1:51:44.080
 and I guess the idea of of getting a group of people together to decide what we're not going

1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:51.600
 to tolerate is a very very tricky thing and I think that you know it reminds me of law or you know

1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:55.520
 even you know religion when it gets to like what are the things that we don't like how do we feel

1:51:55.520 --> 1:52:01.440
 about rape it's like no under no circumstances is that an acceptable behavior murder no that's

1:52:01.440 --> 1:52:07.440
 not acceptable behavior killing no kind of depends on the situation are you at war were you justified

1:52:07.440 --> 1:52:12.800
 were you acting in self defense okay so it's not now murder is a specific type of killing

1:52:12.800 --> 1:52:17.200
 the same way you know other things should be a specific type of something else but I guess we

1:52:17.200 --> 1:52:21.360
 we draw the line of murder we say if you want to exist in our society you can't do this this

1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:26.160
 cannot be done and then we go theft if someone said hey I murdered that guy can you understand

1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:29.520
 where I'm coming from I might say yeah I'll hear you out doesn't mean that I think you're right

1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:34.000
 but I'm like have you ever been wronged so deeply that you could imagine that you could kill someone

1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:38.160
 I'm like no I haven't but I could conceptualize someone doing that and I'm like yeah okay and

1:52:38.160 --> 1:52:42.080
 you still need to go you still need to face you know criminal justice as we have it in our system

1:52:42.080 --> 1:52:46.480
 at least that's how we've decided yeah there's it's interesting you have to be able to like

1:52:46.480 --> 1:52:52.240
 there's if you look at the history of discourse in this country I think it's still true but I'm

1:52:52.240 --> 1:53:04.640
 not sure it's changed since 9 11 is it used to be impossible to criticize a soldier it was easier

1:53:04.640 --> 1:53:10.800
 to criticize war it was harder to criticize soldiers for allowing themselves to be the tools of war

1:53:10.800 --> 1:53:17.120
 I tend to be maybe it's the Russian upbringing it's the it's the combat thing I tend to romanticize

1:53:18.560 --> 1:53:26.400
 war and soldiers I see soldiers as heroes but I've also heard people that not only say that

1:53:26.400 --> 1:53:34.960
 soldiers are the war is bad they say soldiers are bad what's their argument it's it's the kind of a

1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:45.120
 libertarian view that they're basically slaves to evil right war is evil and they're they're given

1:53:45.120 --> 1:53:53.120
 they are suspending their moral and ethical like as like duties as a human being to become the

1:53:53.120 --> 1:54:00.160
 tools of evil that's sort of the argument if you see war is evil I mean I think it's useful to hear

1:54:00.160 --> 1:54:08.640
 that but there's for a long part in history that was completely unacceptable same with abortion

1:54:08.640 --> 1:54:17.440
 you see abortion as murder I mean if I classified in that if I put it in that in that basket

1:54:18.720 --> 1:54:26.560
 it starts we're living in the midst of like a genocide looked at from that perspective

1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:30.480
 could you feel how people could be deeply upset by abortion you go of course looked at from a

1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:34.800
 different perspective you say I don't believe it to be murder that's not how I see it then you go

1:54:34.800 --> 1:54:39.040
 oh well if that's the genesis of your your thought process then you're like yeah okay now now I see

1:54:39.040 --> 1:54:44.880
 how we can come to a different thing but I guess we go well abortion is murder period therefore if

1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:50.320
 you support it you support murder that's a convenient way for me to tar you right but I guess

1:54:50.320 --> 1:54:56.240
 that's kind of coming back to the alex jones I'm this nuance it's uh you have to have the nuance

1:54:56.240 --> 1:54:59.520
 in these kinds of conversations and I have to be willing to have the conversation and I have to

1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:05.440
 be willing to sit down if I can't sit down across from like the most violently racist angry hypothetical

1:55:05.440 --> 1:55:10.400
 internet you know conceived person that none of us have ever actually met in real life but or hopefully

1:55:10.400 --> 1:55:15.920
 not um you know and go like well of course I believe that this person's wrong but allow me to

1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:19.840
 change do my best I'll hear him out and I'll go no I can go point by point explain where this guy

1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:24.000
 or this girl is wrong and hopefully bring them over to a more reasonable position where they will

1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:29.200
 have better beliefs and they will like objectively better beliefs and beliefs that will will and they'll

1:55:29.200 --> 1:55:32.960
 treat other people better why would I want to marginalize this person I might not want to talk

1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:36.640
 I might not want to invite them to my barbecue if they're acting like a jerk all the time but

1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:40.080
 how could I would it not make the world a better place if I'd hear them out and they go look if

1:55:40.080 --> 1:55:43.280
 you're gonna sit down and talk with me we're gonna have to have a discussion I'll hear what you have

1:55:43.280 --> 1:55:49.840
 to say and if I can't if I can't explain to someone why their ridiculous belief is wrong

1:55:49.840 --> 1:55:53.600
 then I might I must not be so confident in my position and I guess that's where I come back

1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:58.320
 to the Alex Jones thing as you mentioned you know with uh with Bill Gates and and you're much

1:55:58.320 --> 1:56:02.000
 more familiar with with the specifics of all the good that he's done but you know again he's been

1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:08.880
 an unbelievable force for good you know in this world you can list a b c d things that the man

1:56:08.880 --> 1:56:14.240
 has has done this foundation has done and you know positive things and then the other people

1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:20.240
 could speculate about ridiculous crazy levels of of evil but you can't produce any evidence for

1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:24.560
 that sort of thing because if you could the man will find himself in trouble you know and anyway

1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:30.480
 I guess what I would would say is that why you can't force me to accept the truth the same way

1:56:30.480 --> 1:56:34.160
 you could write down two plus two equals four on a piece of paper and show me how it works and I

1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:38.160
 could say nah but that doesn't make it not true and you've still given yourself an opportunity

1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:42.960
 to present your case you've presented it to me and you've also for anyone listening and watching

1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:47.840
 you know you've been able to critically assess what's gone on you know or critically address

1:56:47.840 --> 1:56:51.760
 back and forth you know kind of the the discourse and I think that you almost you're making your

1:56:51.760 --> 1:56:57.440
 case for the public so I guess like you know when it comes to just never not engaging with

1:56:57.440 --> 1:57:01.600
 these people that seems to me to be cowardly and I think that that's a something that we're seeing

1:57:01.600 --> 1:57:06.800
 in society right now I think I think we're seeing a crisis of courage in society all over the place

1:57:06.800 --> 1:57:10.880
 and I think that's where we're seeing poor leadership I think we're seeing you know

1:57:10.880 --> 1:57:14.880
 understandable things happening everywhere but we need stronger voices and stronger

1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:18.960
 stronger beliefs that have a conviction and are willing to engage with others

1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:23.200
 not just turning into a shouting contest and not I didn't win because there's more of me oh I voted

1:57:23.200 --> 1:57:27.280
 I out voted you that's nice too but that's a stand in for bullets that's saying I won because

1:57:27.280 --> 1:57:31.520
 there's more of me that doesn't mean that I'm right because plenty of horrible and unpopular

1:57:31.520 --> 1:57:35.520
 now things have been very very deeply popular in the past and would have won a popular vote

1:57:35.520 --> 1:57:41.360
 does that make them right I'd say clearly not so I guess you'd hope that we engage with these people

1:57:41.360 --> 1:57:44.880
 and that you can do your best to bring them over to a more reasonable position if you believe that

1:57:44.880 --> 1:57:48.080
 you have one and if you can't well at least you made the effort and I think that that's

1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:51.520
 something where martial arts shows the value it's like do you know if you're going to go

1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:56.320
 win your next fight I'm like I have no idea I will proceed forward with with full effort and

1:57:56.320 --> 1:58:00.480
 and you know I will fight with dignity I'll fight with honor and I'll fight with courage

1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:05.280
 and I'll use everything that I have and I will play within the bounds of the game and that's that

1:58:05.280 --> 1:58:08.560
 and the result will be what it'll be but I'll walk into and out of that ring with my head

1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:13.600
 hell high because I will know that I did my part I did my job the outcome the specific outcome is

1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:17.920
 not in my control it's just strongly in my influence and and I think that that's something

1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:21.840
 that helped me that martial arts has taught me because other times even when I was successful

1:58:21.840 --> 1:58:27.520
 or unsuccessful I would focus on if I won I'm I won therefore I'm good I lost therefore I'm bad

1:58:27.520 --> 1:58:32.480
 this other guy won or lost therefore as opposed to evaluating their method and I think it's so easy

1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:36.640
 when we're taking a bird's eye view of things to not evaluate how someone's doing things you're not

1:58:36.640 --> 1:58:40.800
 evaluating my process you're simply evaluating my outcome and I could have stumbled into something

1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:44.960
 very very good or very very bad and we can look back and I think that's the value of history I mean

1:58:44.960 --> 1:58:48.480
 I don't mean to get on my dang high horse but it's like this evaluate histories we can see the

1:58:48.480 --> 1:58:53.360
 unbroken chain or the chain of events that led us somewhere and then only with only with the eyes

1:58:53.360 --> 1:58:58.720
 of history can we truly evaluate things unless we're in the room watching it happen and I guess

1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:04.400
 that's again where we start to go most of the big bad scary things that have happened in history

1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:08.880
 that are done particularly on an industrial scale which implies governmental power and

1:59:08.880 --> 1:59:13.520
 things like that or these the equivalent involve groups of people getting together and going hey

1:59:13.520 --> 1:59:18.400
 we're not going to deal with that guy giant groups of people so maybe we're right this time

1:59:18.400 --> 1:59:22.720
 but maybe we're wrong next time and I guess I would be back to the Gandalf putting on the one

1:59:22.720 --> 1:59:27.280
 ring I would be very very hesitant even if we thought we were in the right to simply try to

1:59:27.280 --> 1:59:32.960
 try to marginalize just on general principle even people like Alex Jones whom on their face

1:59:32.960 --> 1:59:36.720
 are pretty ridiculous like you said you should sit down with Adolf Hitler and talk to the man

1:59:36.720 --> 1:59:44.560
 I agree with you to play a little devil's advocate please is Alex Jones might be a bad example but

1:59:44.560 --> 1:59:52.080
 if we look at because he has a face he is a human he's a real person there is also trolls on the

1:59:52.080 --> 2:00:00.640
 internet for Chan the worry I have with those folks is that and there might be parallels to

2:00:00.640 --> 2:00:07.840
 martial arts is they practice guerrilla warfare meaning they don't necessarily want to arrive

2:00:07.840 --> 2:00:15.760
 at the truth they just always want to cut at the ankles of the powerful like they want to always

2:00:15.760 --> 2:00:23.040
 break down the powerful and even if they I mean it's they turn everything into a game so they

2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:29.440
 let's see if we can make the world let's see if we can make a trend that Bill Gates is a pedophile

2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:35.120
 right they make it into a game they get excited about this game they see the powerful let's see

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:39.760
 if we can convince that like who is the most positive person we can think of let's see if we

2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:46.000
 can turn them into evil and they've tried that would like would like everybody and and it seems

2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:51.440
 to stick and they're good at it you know some would argue whatever you think about our current

2:00:51.440 --> 2:00:57.920
 president that he has some elements of that which is he's figured out whatever this music

2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:05.440
 of social discourse that's going on he's figured out how to always troll the mainstream

2:01:05.440 --> 2:01:11.760
 like flow of consciousness that's the the media he always kind of says stuff that annoys a very

2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:17.920
 large number of people and he enjoys that because it's like taking the powerful taking the way things

2:01:17.920 --> 2:01:23.680
 were before and he like shakes it up by saying the most inappropriate thing almost on purpose or

2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:31.600
 instinctually and so on the problem I have with that is that doesn't the powerful thing there is

2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:39.760
 it brings the power the those in power down a notch that's a great thing the negative thing is it

2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:48.000
 doesn't push us closer to a nuanced careful rigorous discourse towards truth it's like showing up to

2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:54.960
 a party and just like starting to yell it doesn't create a good conversation it just makes everything

2:01:54.960 --> 2:02:02.880
 it just makes everything into a game where truth doesn't even seem like a thing we can even hope

2:02:02.880 --> 2:02:06.560
 to achieve that makes sense and I guess as you mentioned we'll come back to another movie because

2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:10.880
 I don't do books and do movies some people just want to watch the world burn right and I guess

2:02:10.880 --> 2:02:17.360
 there's that's a creepy creepy you know kind of urge that some people have and then also is some

2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:20.880
 people you're like hey would you like to throw a brick through that glass window you're like yeah

2:02:20.880 --> 2:02:25.120
 I'm not gonna do that because I think about what's going to what's gonna what's gonna occur like

2:02:25.120 --> 2:02:28.560
 something's gonna be hurt someone's property not gonna do it versus hey you want to see what'll

2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:34.000
 happen like yeah sure you know kids are always like my son he's grabbed spider man and dropped

2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:38.640
 small table spider man fell my spider man didn't fall Sean like he dropped him you knocked him

2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:44.880
 off the table and he'll grin and basically you know it's an interesting thing like you said

2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:50.480
 like playing that Pete these people are appealing to and you know and also almost like the little

2:02:50.480 --> 2:02:55.120
 dog factor of like I people do want to watch the powerful get taken down a notch for all the good

2:02:55.120 --> 2:03:00.080
 and the not good of that just plenty of people it seems to me that have found their way to incredibly

2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:05.200
 high positions some some have just found themselves there and many many many many many people you

2:03:05.200 --> 2:03:09.920
 know men and women of all backgrounds are brilliant and have worked hard and yeah of course there's

2:03:09.920 --> 2:03:14.000
 luck and there's there's luck into everything they're you know LeBron James in spite of being

2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:18.960
 the best basketball player on God's green earth is fortunate that he didn't get hit by a car you

2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:23.440
 know it's fortunate they didn't tear his knee you know but thankfully we get to see all these things

2:03:23.440 --> 2:03:31.920
 you know but um I guess uh it's if people don't have any skin in the game you never know what

2:03:31.920 --> 2:03:36.080
 they're gonna do and I think that's the problem with the internet you know that people get to be

2:03:36.080 --> 2:03:40.320
 nameless be faceless that's why guerrilla fighters are outside of the bounds of war like you don't

2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:45.440
 have a uniform on like I don't know who you're from you don't get the same treatment that a soldier

2:03:45.440 --> 2:03:50.880
 gets um for and people well that's crazy I'm actually there's reasons for this because otherwise

2:03:50.880 --> 2:03:56.640
 people are able to assail things and there's no there's no one responsible there's no way to go

2:03:56.640 --> 2:04:00.480
 and say hey where's where did this come from what's the root of this what how can I address this

2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:03.600
 and I think that's the problem of the internet's problem of twitter this problem places like

2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:08.640
 4chan I wouldn't mind seeing that type of stuff go away if I'm frank but that's not the same thing

2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:13.840
 as people with a face people with people who are willing to stand there and say hi my name is so and

2:04:13.840 --> 2:04:17.920
 so even if I have ridiculous beliefs hopefully you know people will hear me out and then if I'm

2:04:17.920 --> 2:04:24.240
 wrong educate me but uh I guess you hope that the real I guess in my mind antidote to all of this

2:04:24.240 --> 2:04:30.000
 silliness is education and and I think that that's something that we're you know critical thinking

2:04:30.000 --> 2:04:35.120
 is is not necessarily I went to school in America and you know I feel very fortunate but critical

2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:39.200
 thinking is not something that's that's focused on I mean and it's it's tough it's almost like

2:04:39.200 --> 2:04:42.480
 talking about jujitsu it's tough to teach critical thinking when I don't know any words you have to

2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:46.800
 teach me techniques you can't teach me to be an artist but recognize that the techniques are the

2:04:46.800 --> 2:04:51.440
 beginning not the end ultimately it's the artistry that we are searching for not just the not just

2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:56.880
 the science or there are the biorote memorization and I guess you know you'd hope that people's

2:04:56.880 --> 2:05:00.960
 ability to think critically and recognize that majority rule or whoever's loudest does not

2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:03.840
 mean that they're right by any stretch of the imagination and we don't appeal to that and we

2:05:03.840 --> 2:05:09.840
 don't bow to that will help them to help inoculate them against the ridiculous things that come out

2:05:09.840 --> 2:05:15.680
 of these places these dark places that that are objectively not great but the I guess all circling

2:05:15.680 --> 2:05:22.480
 back if even if we swatted these you know these bad things out of existence right now we've got

2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:27.280
 to be very very careful doing that because it's who's doing the swatting this political group

2:05:27.280 --> 2:05:31.200
 that's in power right now the people that support a current president would maybe feel a certain way

2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:36.080
 the people that support another option would feel differently as to what exactly defines toxic and

2:05:36.960 --> 2:05:43.360
 you know I guess that that's what gives me pause yeah and but also the grace thing I tend to believe

2:05:43.360 --> 2:05:51.280
 that the technology you said education but the the platforms we use like twitter and the reddit

2:05:51.280 --> 2:05:58.400
 and all these platforms have a role to play to teach us grace meaning they they should help us

2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:06.400
 incentivize the kind of behavior that is incentivized in real life like being a dick

2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:12.400
 in real life is not incentivized like one on one interaction like there's cases where it is but

2:06:12.400 --> 2:06:18.800
 usually being kind to each other is incentivized on the internet it's not like you get likes for

2:06:18.800 --> 2:06:25.200
 being for mocking people in a funny in a humorous way and it could be dark kind of mocking depending

2:06:25.200 --> 2:06:30.480
 on the community you can go you can go to the appearance if somebody's a little fat or a little

2:06:30.480 --> 2:06:36.960
 too skinny you can comment on their appearance the hair the way the hair looks like the appearance

2:06:36.960 --> 2:06:44.320
 stuff it could be on the people comment all the time on the level of eloquence of my speech

2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:50.480
 go fuck yourself I like it it's creepy though watching watching previously like this used to

2:06:50.480 --> 2:06:54.160
 be lowbrow though like people doing this type of stuff it's creepy watching like our political

2:06:54.160 --> 2:07:01.840
 figures get into this type of game yes but again it's a little bit refreshing right it's the

2:07:02.880 --> 2:07:11.120
 my hope with Donald Trump was is that he would shake up the the people who wear suits usually

2:07:11.120 --> 2:07:17.840
 the like if you're from DC I remember like showing up I actually didn't wear what I usually wear in

2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:23.040
 DC because I was like everybody's wearing a suit and tie when I was like giving talks and stuff

2:07:23.040 --> 2:07:29.840
 except for much who wears jeans and a t shirt doesn't give a damn much is a forever renegade

2:07:31.760 --> 2:07:38.160
 but I don't even remember what oh yeah so my hope with Trump was the huge shake up that system to

2:07:38.160 --> 2:07:45.120
 say like like to inject new ideas to inject new energy of course the way it turned out

2:07:45.760 --> 2:07:50.880
 is different but like there's a it turns out that you might want to have somebody who's like like

2:07:50.880 --> 2:07:57.440
 an Andrew Yang type character who is is full of ideas that are very different and inject the energy

2:07:57.440 --> 2:08:05.280
 new energy into the system through youthful new ideas versus through the troll that like

2:08:05.920 --> 2:08:12.960
 that's very good at sort of mocking and like playing outside the the rules of the game

2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:20.000
 but Trump did reveal powerfully I don't know what to think of it that it's just a game

2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:26.960
 and you don't have to play by the rules that's both inspiring and dark deeply depressing right

2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:32.880
 yeah and I don't know what to do with it I don't I mean the same I'm not drawing parallels

2:08:32.880 --> 2:08:39.040
 not drawing parallels between our president and Adolf Hitler but it's certainly and there's a lot of

2:08:40.240 --> 2:08:46.160
 in history a lot of positive and a lot of negative things happen when charismatic leaders

2:08:46.160 --> 2:08:51.360
 realize they don't have to play by the rules you can just flip the table it's the that

2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:58.480
 Kevin Spacey show oh house cards house of cards where you just flip the table or whatever you

2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:02.640
 don't have to play by the rules of the chess game you can flip the table one wonders if that's

2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:07.280
 always been done in private you know I guess because that's I mean even look obviously in

2:09:07.280 --> 2:09:13.280
 the United States is a is a republic but we had we had bush then we had Clinton then we had more

2:09:13.280 --> 2:09:18.320
 bush then we had President Obama then we were about to have another Clinton that's fairly creepy

2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:26.080
 yeah even on its own but now we added another I mean I'm sure we'll have a generation of Trump's

2:09:26.080 --> 2:09:36.720
 no gee we uh you know I'm Russian so I think we humans like kings still and queens there's something

2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:42.560
 we're attracted to the the thing we talked about coaches there's something in us that

2:09:42.560 --> 2:09:47.440
 longs to towards that authoritarian control one of the beautiful things about America

2:09:48.240 --> 2:09:55.200
 the second amendment is we also like individual freedom that's one of the one of the unique

2:09:55.200 --> 2:10:01.200
 aspects at the founding of this country and still and for me is the beacon of hope that

2:10:02.800 --> 2:10:09.920
 somehow there's the fire of freedom burns in there like that Texas feel that gives me hope

2:10:09.920 --> 2:10:18.480
 that f u energy that revolts against the power which as we discussed power corrupts and ultimately

2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:27.040
 leads to sort of degradation of the whoever's ruling the people it's interesting though like it

2:10:27.040 --> 2:10:30.640
 seems to me maybe I'm just I don't know if I'm reading this properly when I when I see it but

2:10:30.640 --> 2:10:36.800
 it's it seems to me that that like you said that that you know flip the bird I'm going to do me

2:10:36.800 --> 2:10:42.880
 within reason like as long as I'm not hurting you uh is idea that that very much at least in my

2:10:42.880 --> 2:10:46.640
 mind defines the American ideal or at least part of the consciousness of the United States

2:10:47.280 --> 2:10:52.960
 is is under attack to a certain extent you know um and if only like I can think to like you know

2:10:52.960 --> 2:11:00.240
 maybe generation behind us um it's it's becoming more collectivist you know for all the good and

2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:05.520
 also the not good of that and it's uh you know not in not in term not not in terms of policy at this

2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:10.800
 point but just in terms of like uh consciousness and I wonder if that's a an internet thing you

2:11:10.800 --> 2:11:14.400
 know people are more in touch with one another than they've as far as I'm can tell who've ever

2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:19.920
 been or at least more than in my lifetime and uh you know the rest of the world seems much closer

2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:24.480
 than it did you know living in Virginia California seems very far away being on the internet it's

2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:29.440
 just right there I can hear about it I can see it I can I can interact with people from there

2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:35.360
 you know I remember uh you know being in Tennessee at uh you know one time and then and reading about

2:11:35.360 --> 2:11:40.720
 you know events taking place in you know the Middle East and that just seemed like a mile away

2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:45.120
 seemed like a unbelievably far distance and then another time when you're in DC you just feel like

2:11:45.120 --> 2:11:48.000
 oh you read about something happening in Paris and it just feels like it's just right around the

2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:52.720
 corner because DC is a seat of a a seat of power where things are just occurring all the time and

2:11:53.520 --> 2:12:00.000
 you know I guess you you wonder about that's where I come back to the group decisions to

2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:05.120
 not listen to this person or to cancel this or to you know we all the moral majority shall do the

2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:09.760
 following as opposed to as long as you're not hurting me and long as you're not hurting anyone

2:12:09.760 --> 2:12:14.320
 else I have to let you do I have to let you be on general principle even if I don't like you I'm

2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:18.960
 very free to not like you I'm free to speak out against you but I'm not it is not within my right

2:12:18.960 --> 2:12:25.600
 or and not with it and it's not I I would not be right to attempt to attack you and that is an

2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:30.320
 interesting thing though when we see words being redefined or words being defined whether it's

2:12:30.320 --> 2:12:36.000
 toxicity whether it's violence if I think that what you're saying is is your speech is by itself

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:40.960
 you know a violence or a precursor to violence I'm justified in doing all sorts of things you

2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:46.880
 know and and that creeps me out significantly because again even if it ends up being pointed

2:12:46.880 --> 2:12:52.560
 in a good direction initially it's only a matter of time and actually that brings me to another

2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:58.800
 dune oh yeah I got all day um how much are they paying you but we about say the uh the

2:12:58.800 --> 2:13:05.440
 frank herbert estate not enough frankly uh let's see and how many books are there in dune uh that's

2:13:05.440 --> 2:13:14.240
 a gen question you also have I read the whole series but not a couple of the I read all the

2:13:14.240 --> 2:13:20.480
 prequels as well with the exception of a couple is there a book one for dune dune would be book one

2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:25.440
 and even the prequels it's still all better if you start like I read dune and then read the

2:13:25.440 --> 2:13:30.080
 original what is it six and then I went back and started to read some things just like watching

2:13:30.080 --> 2:13:36.000
 star wars you want to start at episode four whatever yeah I think so that's the way that's

2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:41.600
 the move and then stop at six call it a day watch the Mandalorian but well I thought you're not

2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:47.680
 walking back you're no I like the Mandalorian yeah that is what I said I was told that I was

2:13:47.680 --> 2:13:53.600
 harmless for not liking baby Yoda boy we don't talk about a couple of the movies not including the

2:13:53.600 --> 2:13:58.240
 Mandalorian the Mandalorian's fine it's the more recent movies that we don't like to talk about

2:13:58.240 --> 2:14:06.080
 oh the what's his name the goofy guy uh Ryan no no no the creature the goofy creature with the

2:14:06.080 --> 2:14:11.840
 jar jar yeah jar jar yeah do you ever see the the the jar jar banks is actually like the dark lord

2:14:11.840 --> 2:14:16.000
 of the sith theory that fixed the whole initial trilogy we're like he's he's like goofing around

2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:19.120
 and like making it all the way through battles and winning are like wait a minute he oops his way

2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:24.400
 he walks over to a pool does a triple back flip falls in you're like it's just bizarre that he's

2:14:24.400 --> 2:14:29.920
 the this is the alex jones theory of of star wars he's actually running everything he was the one

2:14:29.920 --> 2:14:34.960
 that actually was like hey we should vote in chancellor chancellor palpatine or senator palpatine

2:14:34.960 --> 2:14:38.640
 like right before they put jar jar in charge first off what did they think was going to happen

2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:43.200
 and second off that was I would think that'd be great you're like oops oh man I guess he's the

2:14:43.200 --> 2:14:48.000
 emperor now that would have been great but actually to the to the cancel and all the other stuff again

2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:51.520
 it's just like you'd hope that it gives pause and I think about this for fighting because a lot of

2:14:51.520 --> 2:14:56.720
 times I'll use this example people and people like fight fans and you know like UFC they love

2:14:56.720 --> 2:15:01.520
 people that run out and try to murder each other and it's entertaining and it's super entertaining

2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:06.160
 but you know Floyd Mayweather doesn't resonate with people as much it's like people started I

2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:10.000
 remember the time when Floyd was not as popular now people think people love Floyd because

2:15:10.000 --> 2:15:14.880
 he's 50 and oh Floyd and oh man finally he had so much success that we all can't help but recognize

2:15:14.880 --> 2:15:20.640
 the man's genius and greatness but prior to that oh he's boring he's this he's that he fights you

2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:26.880
 know with he's circumspect he's cautious he's he's pressing he's intelligent deeply intelligent and

2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:31.440
 when you watch people go out and try to murder each other you can flip a coin a hundred times and

2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:35.680
 you know you can get you could be lucky enough to get a hundred heads but it's still a coin flip

2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:40.160
 and I think that that's what's going on all the time is you know people are getting an outcome

2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:44.000
 that they want but it wasn't a well thought out situation and that's why you'll win by five in a

2:15:44.000 --> 2:15:48.080
 row by knockout and then lose three in a row and then people will go well what happened to that guy

2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:51.760
 he used to be so great and you're like no he's doing what he's always been doing it's just it was

2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:56.640
 getting great outcomes on a coin flip prior and it's getting negative outcomes on a coin flip now

2:15:56.640 --> 2:16:01.600
 but uh I guess what I would say is it watches it's interesting watching you know I guess

2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:07.840
 this societal beliefs become such a thing that we're almost adopting on a religious level if

2:16:07.840 --> 2:16:12.720
 we're not careful if if when I say religious level I mean like like pan life like this is

2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:16.400
 guiding all of my choices for all the good and the bad of that and this is a dune quote is

2:16:16.400 --> 2:16:20.400
 when religion and politics travel in the same car the writers believe that nothing can stand in their

2:16:20.400 --> 2:16:25.280
 way their movements become headlong faster and faster and faster they put aside all

2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:29.520
 thoughts of obstacles and forget that the precipice does not show itself to the man in a blind rush

2:16:29.520 --> 2:16:34.960
 until it's too late and I think that that's again the the pause we go oh man thank goodness we have

2:16:34.960 --> 2:16:40.000
 this guy that wants to rebuild Germany he'll put us back where we need to be and you stop questioning

2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:45.920
 any your own judgment your own just you start you stop thinking essentially right I'm not allowed

2:16:45.920 --> 2:16:50.000
 to question this oh well of course this is correct of course it's well of course I'm right I intended

2:16:50.000 --> 2:16:54.240
 to do right so of course my actions are correct I mean how many times have any of us intend to do

2:16:54.240 --> 2:16:58.960
 something helpful and ended up doing something less and you know plenty of people who intend to

2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:05.120
 do harm could by accident do something decent and I guess it's like you know I'm not saying anything

2:17:05.120 --> 2:17:09.120
 you know terribly terribly you know insightful but it's just one of those where it's hard to

2:17:09.120 --> 2:17:13.760
 it's hard to say in the moment and that's where you hopefully caution you would counsel some degree

2:17:13.760 --> 2:17:20.240
 of caution and that that's what worries me with with people deciding that we're also right about

2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:25.840
 this or we're also right about that and attempting to rather than win the argument silence the

2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:30.400
 counter argument no matter how crazy it may seem because I just think that that idea even when it's

2:17:30.400 --> 2:17:36.320
 pointed in a good direction initially it's only a matter of time you're amongst many things

2:17:37.280 --> 2:17:44.080
 a jujitsu black belt one of the things that people are really curious about white belts and blue

2:17:44.080 --> 2:17:50.160
 belts in jujitsu but also people haven't tried the art is what does it take to be a jujitsu black

2:17:50.160 --> 2:17:56.000
 belt I think that you know everyone's journey is a little bit different but the one thing that the

2:17:57.040 --> 2:18:02.720
 Calvin Coolidge quote you know determination persistence is the only thing that that will

2:18:02.720 --> 2:18:09.120
 win in the end it will always win in the end not brilliance not toughness not education it's

2:18:09.120 --> 2:18:15.120
 persistence and I think that having the belief that no matter what happens to me I will proceed

2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:19.680
 forward and I will figure out how to make this happen how our high water I think is the one thing

2:18:19.680 --> 2:18:24.720
 that ties together all of the people that I've ever met that made it through whatever it was that

2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:30.400
 they were going through because you know sometimes you can get lucky and you can have an easy time

2:18:30.400 --> 2:18:34.720
 or and that luck could be you had a good situation it could be I mean like in the obvious sense of

2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:37.520
 like where you're living where you're training what's going on you had a good situation you're

2:18:38.400 --> 2:18:42.640
 unbelievably athletic oh you're you're going to be an astronaut you're brilliant and an Olympic

2:18:42.640 --> 2:18:46.640
 athlete you know like well that's a fantastic situation you know you won the genetic lottery

2:18:46.640 --> 2:18:52.080
 and I'm sure you were taught as well but you also won the genetic lottery it's a determination is the

2:18:52.080 --> 2:18:56.560
 one thing though because that person could have a very easy go of it initially and then tear their

2:18:56.560 --> 2:19:02.240
 knee and then they're no longer the the superhuman physical specimen that they were the only thing

2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:08.560
 that will keep them going is persistence and I think that that I would just say that persistence

2:19:08.560 --> 2:19:12.880
 I say I'll just put one foot in front of the other and sometimes I can see the path ahead

2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:18.400
 and sometimes it's beyond my vision but I will not stop I may even slow down but I won't stop

2:19:18.400 --> 2:19:22.720
 and that's the only thing that I can say that I've seen tie everyone together because there's

2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:26.480
 so many ways to the top of any mountain and there's so many different personalities and

2:19:26.480 --> 2:19:33.680
 skills and backgrounds involved but everyone everyone carries on so at the core the foundational

2:19:33.680 --> 2:19:38.400
 advice is just don't quit just keep going that's the lesson of martial arts I think you know we

2:19:38.400 --> 2:19:43.680
 think it's like how to be strong or how to be how to win but in reality it's like how to persist

2:19:43.680 --> 2:19:48.720
 how to endure because it's all of us have been beaten so many times and gotten beaten up so many

2:19:48.720 --> 2:19:52.240
 times and thought about quitting have I ever thought about quitting absolutely have I ever

2:19:52.240 --> 2:19:57.920
 quit never I will never ever quit ever I can say you might knock me out I will be damned if I quit

2:19:57.920 --> 2:20:05.360
 what's the darkest moment is it injury related like is it uh so like to me like two possibilities

2:20:05.360 --> 2:20:12.080
 I've fortunately never been seriously injured but I think that's a dark place to be like having

2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:19.840
 to be out for many months uh for um as Jen was saying like with a head injury especially like

2:20:20.560 --> 2:20:28.000
 the uncertainty that's one and then the other side is if you have big ambitions as a competitor

2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:36.400
 or realizing that you're not as good like those those doubts were like I kind of suck

2:20:37.040 --> 2:20:43.760
 how am I supposed to be a world the greatest fighter of all time if I if if like several

2:20:43.760 --> 2:20:50.000
 people in the gym are kicking my ass those are the two things that paralyze you I think that

2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:56.240
 everyone's darkest moment is maybe different looking from the outside for Ryan I wouldn't say

2:20:56.240 --> 2:21:01.120
 that he's had injuries and he's had bad ones I wouldn't say that was his darkest moment I think

2:21:01.840 --> 2:21:07.200
 for me I would say some of my head injury was my darkest moment absolutely and I have torn

2:21:07.200 --> 2:21:14.160
 my ACL twice I've torn my shoulders four times I've had lots of surgeries for me the orthopedic

2:21:14.160 --> 2:21:20.720
 injuries were not the most difficult it was the brain injury for others that might be the case

2:21:20.720 --> 2:21:26.320
 for them maybe they've never experienced an injury and maybe for them that's their darkest moment

2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:30.800
 from the outside obviously Ryan can speak to this more but for Ryan I think it was the

2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:38.640
 inability to to perform at certain points to the the missing of opportunities that for him

2:21:38.640 --> 2:21:43.440
 from my perspective watching him go through and having seen various points of his growth from

2:21:43.440 --> 2:21:50.320
 from early purple dot on I think the hardest time for him looking in obviously was uh when

2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:55.680
 he would hit moments where he wasn't able to perform for various reasons he couldn't get fights he

2:21:55.680 --> 2:21:59.520
 he was having difficulties there I think that that was the hardest point for him

2:22:00.560 --> 2:22:04.640
 did you did you think like with the head injury that you might not never be able to do jiu jitsu

2:22:04.640 --> 2:22:11.200
 again yeah I mean I I mine was very um it was really bad and it was just the one hit but I

2:22:11.200 --> 2:22:15.040
 had a looping memories for seven months didn't know it because when your brain's messed up you're

2:22:15.040 --> 2:22:22.320
 not even aware that you're looping um and so uh I saw two different neurologists I find like it

2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:27.840
 took a very long time um I didn't know if I was going to be able to have like linear thoughts or

2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:32.640
 read a book I didn't know at certain points if I could listen to music again you know without

2:22:32.640 --> 2:22:38.720
 making my head hurt um and so uh it was almost two years before I woke up in the morning without a

2:22:38.720 --> 2:22:44.560
 headache um just waking up before I even start my day and so that so that's even bigger than

2:22:44.560 --> 2:22:50.320
 jiu jitsu that's just life that's just that's just hard and I think that you can experience so many

2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:57.600
 things I've had all these injuries um we lost a baby when I was 15 15 weeks um we've had all

2:22:57.600 --> 2:23:03.920
 these experiences and what the hardest point for me not saying all those things weren't hard but it's

2:23:03.920 --> 2:23:08.400
 kind of like as you go through these you just realize like life goes on and you have to keep

2:23:08.400 --> 2:23:13.360
 working at it and you have to keep going and you asked me earlier offline what did I feel depressed

2:23:13.360 --> 2:23:20.880
 and not for my head injury I don't think that at least in the moment I had a any recognition of that

2:23:20.880 --> 2:23:26.480
 it's kind of like but I think different people's personalities I have kind of the like buckle down

2:23:26.480 --> 2:23:32.160
 and just keep going and and sometimes it's not until lots of time later that you realize wow that

2:23:32.160 --> 2:23:36.960
 was really hard because you were just struggling to live and and function and do the things that

2:23:36.960 --> 2:23:42.160
 you need to do along do you mind jumping on just like this part of the conversation just for a few

2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:49.360
 minutes over do you mind no just sitting together oh no no just for a little bit sorry it'd be cool

2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:55.360
 so we put a face to it you know uh is it okay with you yeah it's fine with me it's fine with you

2:23:56.320 --> 2:24:00.560
 by the way what was the head injury if you don't mind sharing someone hit there had dropped their

2:24:00.560 --> 2:24:06.640
 knee on the back of my head during training it was a lot bigger than me so one strike to the back

2:24:06.640 --> 2:24:12.480
 of the head is too much for someone there's a reason that's outlawed in MMA right someone 50 pounds

2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:16.080
 everything you drop their knee on the back of your head once and it's it's the funny thing about

2:24:16.080 --> 2:24:20.160
 getting hit right you never can really be sure what's going to happen I think it's actually one of

2:24:20.160 --> 2:24:25.200
 the magical parts about jiu jitsu where like if you choke me if you we know what's going to occur

2:24:25.920 --> 2:24:30.640
 you hit someone they might be completely unharmed like you might be punching Tony Ferguson in the

2:24:30.640 --> 2:24:34.800
 face and like he you need to hit him with a sledgehammer to affect this man and then other

2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:38.720
 people they could get really badly hurt which I guess it's back to your point about you know

2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:43.040
 street fighting and things like that and a serious serious potential you know second third order

2:24:43.040 --> 2:24:47.600
 consequences of any action that we take but yeah that's a that's a tricky thing about getting hit

2:24:48.160 --> 2:24:54.720
 how does it make you feel that like the the really shitty thing about injuries to me was that like

2:24:55.600 --> 2:25:00.880
 you start thinking like well if I did this one little thing different like this wouldn't have

2:25:00.880 --> 2:25:07.920
 happened today like one one moment changes your entire life is that do you do you think that way

2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:13.120
 or is that totally counterproductive um you can't help but think that way when you've had them on

2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:19.200
 of injuries I've had now because I've had more than most people's fair share um as my orthopedic

2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:23.520
 says you don't want to win that you don't want to with the contest of who's had the most but since

2:25:23.520 --> 2:25:30.400
 you have built me a pool yeah um but I think you can't help but think that way sometimes but I

2:25:30.400 --> 2:25:34.960
 definitely don't think it's I think it can be facilitated if you don't put yourself up too much

2:25:35.920 --> 2:25:43.440
 because thinking about why have I been subject to so many injuries and and a lot of it comes to

2:25:43.440 --> 2:25:49.280
 just um almost all of mine in particular people a lot heavier than me so we're to I but if I've

2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:54.320
 been training martial arts 15 years I'm obviously on the much smaller side I'm a woman I've done

2:25:54.320 --> 2:25:59.760
 thousands and thousands of rounds with people 50 pounds plus heavier than me I mean years

2:25:59.760 --> 2:26:03.760
 not training with anyone less than 50 pounds which is 50 pounds is almost half my body weight

2:26:03.760 --> 2:26:09.360
 and when you also add testosterone the natural um physiological advantages of men not just are

2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:13.680
 they heavier with more mass they're faster the more explosive they're stronger um if they're the

2:26:13.680 --> 2:26:21.120
 same size and so I think that the willingness to be in that environment over and over and over again

2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:28.480
 creates a lot of strength resiliency willingness to continue but it also like in order to do that

2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:34.960
 you almost have to uh for me the way I was approaching it was like pretend like I wasn't

2:26:34.960 --> 2:26:39.760
 more vulnerable um and just be willing to step in and step in and step in and take it until you

2:26:39.760 --> 2:26:43.920
 make it kind of thing make it until you make it kind of yeah like I'll just one day I'll be strong

2:26:43.920 --> 2:26:49.840
 enough and you avoid an injury for most for most of those rounds I would injury the problem that

2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:54.720
 Ryan points out is that like you could do thousands of rounds but if one person that size that strength

2:26:54.720 --> 2:27:00.160
 that hover reacts in a way that you don't expect it doesn't it's not like an oops it's like always

2:27:00.160 --> 2:27:06.240
 major do you regret any of it like I think that most no one I know has experienced the degree

2:27:06.240 --> 2:27:11.840
 of injuries that I've experienced and I started it at a time when uh in 2005 is very different than

2:27:11.840 --> 2:27:17.760
 now where you have the coaches have more control over what you're doing they're more aware in general

2:27:17.760 --> 2:27:25.520
 about a lot of the injuries there's just a lot more people who are uh hobbyists than when I started

2:27:26.240 --> 2:27:31.680
 there were hobbyists but it was different kind of hobbyists you know than now um now our girls

2:27:31.680 --> 2:27:37.040
 can train with other girls they don't have to do thousands of rounds with somebody significantly

2:27:37.040 --> 2:27:44.400
 more powerful than them um and uh for the drawbacks and the benefits of that you know as with anything

2:27:44.400 --> 2:27:51.920
 um so I think I think that I don't think I would go back and change it there were times

2:27:51.920 --> 2:27:57.040
 after one of my injuries where I said to Ryan I said I quit I'm done I'm not doing this anymore I

2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:02.720
 probably said it more than once but there was one time I was really serious in 2012 um I was

2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:07.120
 really serious I tore my shoulder I had I was looking at missing a big competition again in

2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:12.000
 the world for my second or third year in a row after injuries and I said I'd quit my job two

2:28:12.000 --> 2:28:18.880
 years before and I'm like I'm done and Ryan before that had always been you know I keep

2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:24.320
 me focused and then he kind of said okay if you want to be done be done just just have a good time

2:28:24.320 --> 2:28:30.480
 no I'm really done I didn't want to train anymore okay okay and then you know I think he helped

2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:36.480
 facilitate a moment for me to go um visit a friend some friends some girls that were doing a girls

2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:40.400
 camp who are close to my size or some friends of mine to go train and I was like oh wait

2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:45.120
 I do love this thing it's harder for me on a daily basis but that doesn't mean I don't love

2:28:45.120 --> 2:28:50.000
 this thing and it really helped change my mind I started to connect with other people travel more

2:28:50.000 --> 2:28:55.680
 myself um because previously he had done that but I hadn't really done that I think there was a point

2:28:55.680 --> 2:29:00.720
 where um when I started to do it was just for fun I just wanted to sport after college I played

2:29:00.720 --> 2:29:05.040
 sports as a kid I want to I just want to exercise I wasn't into the martial arts he's giving me a

2:29:05.040 --> 2:29:08.800
 hard time about it because he was always very how can you not care about martial arts I don't know

2:29:08.800 --> 2:29:14.080
 I just want to play sports um and Ryan was really big and took kind of the philosophy side of the

2:29:14.080 --> 2:29:18.880
 martial arts aspect um he used to give me a hard time and I think after that moment this moment

2:29:18.880 --> 2:29:22.800
 where I looked at myself and I said do I want to keep doing this is when I started to appreciate

2:29:22.800 --> 2:29:28.480
 jiu jitsu take it took off some of the pressure I'd been feeling I think as Ryan's girlfriend but I

2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:34.000
 had a full time job a long time it was never my goal to be a jiu jitsu world champion and I think

2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:38.800
 after that moment where I was like you know I really do like this I really do want to keep this I had

2:29:38.800 --> 2:29:43.040
 this moment like anytime where you're like I'm doing this for me I'm not doing this for him and I

2:29:43.040 --> 2:29:50.480
 think that that's um I think that that was really lucky for me because how often in our lives do we

2:29:50.480 --> 2:29:55.600
 have a kind of a challenge where we have to stop and we have to say is this really what I want how

2:29:55.600 --> 2:30:01.200
 often in a relationship do you do that how often in any type of lifestyle or job do you stop and

2:30:01.200 --> 2:30:06.000
 do you really ask yourself is something really difficult happen that you look and you go am I

2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:10.800
 just doing this because it's convenient and easy or is this what I really want to do yeah I've had

2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:18.320
 those moments like this this podcast is one of those things is like you you stop and think like

2:30:19.040 --> 2:30:25.920
 I actually love this and it's uh I had that with jiu jitsu too I don't think I had said until like

2:30:25.920 --> 2:30:32.640
 brown belt that I stop I mean yeah it's when you first face real challenges you think like

2:30:32.640 --> 2:30:39.280
 why am I doing this it's I think most of my progression was why not I think that's the right

2:30:39.280 --> 2:30:45.520
 the leap of faith and then at a certain point you think like what why am I doing this and

2:30:45.520 --> 2:30:52.240
 if you can answer honestly that because I love it it's kind of a liberating feeling it's a it's a

2:30:52.240 --> 2:30:57.680
 yeah it's so it's so powerful it's an acceptable for the opportunity to be there right because

2:30:57.680 --> 2:31:03.360
 you love it and yeah man I yes great gratitude it's yeah so it's it's ultimately gratitude yeah

2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:09.120
 let me ask you this so Ryan said like what what is it I took over your thing yeah this is no nobody

2:31:09.120 --> 2:31:14.160
 cares about Ryan I wouldn't yeah I'll photoshop him out or whatever however you edit you do that

2:31:14.160 --> 2:31:22.720
 be great put Sean Connery's head yeah just like a dune ad over here exactly Sean Connery I can get down

2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:29.040
 that is that the sexiest man in Sean Connery in the dune universe that's my understanding okay I think

2:31:29.040 --> 2:31:34.960
 in any universe yeah well mind gossing give him we actually named our son after Sean Connery oh yeah

2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:41.520
 oh yeah sorry three five notion of yes yes he was in the rock that was I love all those

2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:47.520
 awesome flame Nicholas Cage oh yeah Connery's face all greatest movie of all time this accent

2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:52.080
 and Connery was so awesome I don't know where it's from Alabama I guess or something I love that they

2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:56.720
 got like Steve Buscemi in there like we need Steve Buscemi in this thing and we got him Dave Chappelle

2:31:56.720 --> 2:32:03.200
 yeah that's right yeah he's a prisoner in April yep greatest movie of all time should have won an

2:32:03.200 --> 2:32:08.080
 Oscar Dave Chappelle also in Blue Street with Martin Lawrence and then what do you call it a

2:32:08.080 --> 2:32:13.360
 Robinham men in tights oh Robin in tights was one of my favorites as a kid I've baked but Robin yeah

2:32:13.360 --> 2:32:20.800
 without that's a good uh wow we just listed off some really bad 90s movies but you take that back

2:32:20.800 --> 2:32:27.920
 for telling our age yeah so about speak yourself so what like in your view I don't mean to

2:32:28.640 --> 2:32:32.320
 from like a smaller person I guess that's an interesting thing while Jiu Jitsu is like

2:32:32.320 --> 2:32:40.880
 that uh small I don't know hopefully it's not a bad thing um elf elves are taller

2:32:41.680 --> 2:32:48.640
 like with all these like uh bigger people you could still enjoy the art like what does it take

2:32:48.640 --> 2:32:55.360
 to get a black belt to excel to quote unquote master the art gosh everyone has such a different

2:32:55.360 --> 2:33:03.120
 path Ryan's promoted six seven people something like that and I think about half of them have had um

2:33:04.960 --> 2:33:10.800
 have kids have families have other careers um at the time some of them competed a lot some of them

2:33:10.800 --> 2:33:16.560
 have never competed or rarely competed some haven't competed a long time um some had started

2:33:16.560 --> 2:33:21.680
 different places they everyone's had different journeys uh even in our own little group of seven

2:33:21.680 --> 2:33:29.760
 um I think only maybe only two or three were were high level competitors of that group um at the

2:33:29.760 --> 2:33:36.560
 higher belts very like brown black maybe um and so it's just different for every person and that's

2:33:36.560 --> 2:33:42.400
 something that that you know we try to tell her since we have 400 students and um do we have a

2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:48.320
 we don't really have anyone who's you know a stated other other than like other coaches like Adam

2:33:48.320 --> 2:33:52.160
 but we don't have anyone it's like a stated high level competitor as a student at the moment we

2:33:52.160 --> 2:33:55.360
 people look at our gym and go it's lots of competitors it's not lots of competitors it's

2:33:55.360 --> 2:34:01.920
 never been lots of competitors and we've had ones and twos here and there um but really everybody's

2:34:02.480 --> 2:34:06.480
 in it for the long term if they're in it sometimes the the high level competitors are the ones that

2:34:06.480 --> 2:34:11.360
 are more likely to drop off because they have a bit of success particularly at at blue or purple

2:34:11.360 --> 2:34:14.960
 and then they realize how hard it is at brown and black and then they they have a hard time

2:34:14.960 --> 2:34:19.840
 continuing on that that path and then they can't look at themselves as a non competitive hard time

2:34:19.840 --> 2:34:24.640
 continuing with jiu jitsu I think whereas sometimes it's the guy who comes in as the white belt and

2:34:24.640 --> 2:34:29.360
 he trains you know twice a week every week and the next thing you know he's been there for two

2:34:29.360 --> 2:34:33.120
 or three years like oh he's a blue belt he's a purple belt he's a brown belt and and he's just

2:34:33.120 --> 2:34:39.360
 consistent um over over a long period of time and willing to take the path and no two people's path

2:34:39.360 --> 2:34:44.640
 is exactly the same no two people's lives are exactly the same you have um we have students

2:34:44.640 --> 2:34:50.480
 who started as a white belt as a you know a young adult with no you know no responsibilities and they

2:34:50.480 --> 2:34:54.800
 train all the time and then they have a job you know then they graduate college then they have a

2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:58.000
 job then they have married then they have kids then they have different points in their careers and

2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:03.760
 at different points in your life jiu jitsu will be there you know for whatever way that you're

2:35:03.760 --> 2:35:09.200
 willing to accept it it's place I think that's actually kind of what back to the initial question

2:35:09.200 --> 2:35:14.160
 we discussed about you know what makes a warrior you know and and also like what makes something

2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:19.120
 or someone and you know particularly impressive in my mind is like uh what they make out of what

2:35:19.120 --> 2:35:24.320
 they have um you know one of my favorite movies ever is forest gump and it's obviously it's it's

2:35:24.320 --> 2:35:28.000
 just if you can't because I've heard people are doing forest gump sucks I'm like I don't like

2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:34.560
 use a person and uh like you have no heart at all but basically uh it's the story of someone

2:35:34.560 --> 2:35:39.920
 that tries hard and it's like yeah but it's it's funny movie but it's like um you know I guess

2:35:39.920 --> 2:35:46.160
 you meet each person where they are you know and obviously you want everyone needs to be pushed we

2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:50.320
 all need to be pushed we need friends and people around us that push us to be better versions of

2:35:50.320 --> 2:35:54.640
 ourselves all the time and and as you mentioned the people you spend all of your time around

2:35:54.640 --> 2:36:00.480
 deeply impact you um and we have to be willing to be pushed it takes a leap of faith for me to trust

2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:07.440
 me to put some of my self in my my you know I guess my ability my control my personal agency

2:36:07.440 --> 2:36:14.240
 as it were in the hands of someone else that I that I trust and that I respect but if if I can do

2:36:14.240 --> 2:36:19.760
 that well again maybe I never become you know high level black belt competitor but you know I had

2:36:19.760 --> 2:36:23.280
 four of the things I was doing in my life I also have a family I have this I have that you know

2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:26.640
 what that person was able to accomplish in the martial arts relative to what they were able

2:36:26.640 --> 2:36:30.800
 to put in this phenomenal you know other times someone could be a very successful black belt and

2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:35.520
 it might be a bum because they could have been a lot more and you know they could have done more

2:36:35.520 --> 2:36:40.400
 they could have focused more and there's no shame in deciding that you don't want to do that but

2:36:40.400 --> 2:36:46.240
 whatever it is that you're you're invested in I remember the uh take it uneasy podcast and that

2:36:46.800 --> 2:36:51.360
 I love because you know I'll just chill out I like resting it's like vacation oh who wants to

2:36:51.360 --> 2:36:54.400
 go on vacation I'll go on vacation for a day or two you want to spend three weeks on vacation

2:36:54.400 --> 2:36:58.320
 like I kill myself like get me out of here like this is horrible this is I'm a waste of life I'm

2:36:58.320 --> 2:37:02.640
 not doing anything useful you're technically on vacation right now right well this is fun though

2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:06.720
 this is like a one day vacation exactly but if you know if you had okay I would I'm sure you're

2:37:06.720 --> 2:37:10.800
 thinking about jumping off of the building right now but if you had to if you had to talk to me for

2:37:10.800 --> 2:37:14.000
 you know like three days I'm sure you just you probably shut me off the building I don't blame

2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:18.640
 you I'll be dead people but yeah five hours in but yeah but you know it is it's like you want to

2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:23.040
 be pushing towards something um because otherwise what's the purpose of being here you know it's

2:37:23.040 --> 2:37:28.160
 not just a college it's doing something useful building growing as a person helping others

2:37:28.160 --> 2:37:32.400
 do the same if that's within your power at any given time but I think that's kind of the neat

2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:36.240
 thing about martial arts is it can be many many different things to many different people you

2:37:36.240 --> 2:37:40.720
 know I finally for instance was able to get a college degree let this this year that which I

2:37:40.720 --> 2:37:44.480
 mean it's not a big deal for most people but for me it was a big deal because I was going back and

2:37:44.480 --> 2:37:50.480
 finish yeah and I never envisioned ever going back and that's a hard step to to go back and finish

2:37:50.480 --> 2:37:56.160
 that's uh it weighs heavy on you if you don't it's interesting yeah I was just I was more proud of

2:37:56.160 --> 2:37:59.760
 that than most things I've ever done if I'm honest you know and it was neat and I really enjoyed it

2:37:59.760 --> 2:38:05.440
 and it was the process of doing it but you know or my academic credentials impressive like not in

2:38:05.440 --> 2:38:11.200
 the least but for me it's like it was a big deal for me personally to take that step and to go back

2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:15.920
 and do that and I was I was proud of the the direction and because it would have been easy like

2:38:15.920 --> 2:38:19.920
 do I need to do it like no I'm you know I'm business I'll do okay I'll try I'll keep fighting

2:38:19.920 --> 2:38:25.680
 but I was happy to take the time in between fights when I was when I was was unbooked for an opponent

2:38:25.680 --> 2:38:29.200
 to do something productive rather than just I'll just hang out you know like I can still train

2:38:29.200 --> 2:38:32.640
 every single day but I can also train and go to school people go to the Olympics while going to

2:38:32.640 --> 2:38:40.720
 school I can I can do martial arts and and go to school one thing I gotta ask is uh you know a bunch

2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:47.360
 of women listen to this podcast if they haven't done jiu jitsu I think it'd be kind of intimidating

2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:54.640
 to uh step on the mat with a bunch of bros uh that like enjoy somehow killing each other

2:38:54.640 --> 2:39:00.960
 there like how do you succeed in that environment to where you can learn this art learn how to

2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:08.080
 beat all those people up um oh gosh is there any advice I mean another way to ask that is like

2:39:08.080 --> 2:39:13.360
 if if uh any women listening to this are interested in starting jiu jitsu like is there advice for

2:39:13.360 --> 2:39:18.560
 that journey honestly I think it's just walking in the door and starting sometimes I don't know

2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:24.640
 how to respond to that because I'm not at I don't view myself as typically anxious particularly um uh

2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:31.040
 in in interactions with other people or new people that's shy shy is not a word that has

2:39:31.040 --> 2:39:37.360
 been used for me by if you ask my family and um they joke because our son talks a lot he's

2:39:37.360 --> 2:39:41.120
 advanced verbally and they're always like oh well let's we know where he gets that from like

2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:46.880
 because he just doesn't stop talking he narrates everything he does um and so they always tease

2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:54.000
 because that's like I'm known for for kind of talking a lot um but so I haven't been typically

2:39:54.000 --> 2:40:00.000
 I'm not I don't consider myself a shy person so for me going into um a new room a new group of

2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:04.160
 people is you know there's there's always that you don't really know who they are how they're

2:40:04.160 --> 2:40:09.280
 going to treat you but I typically but I I don't have a lot of anxiety with that so I don't if

2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:14.080
 that's something that's going to put something up I don't really know how to to address that

2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:19.280
 particular feeling um but in terms of all of the rooms I've been in I have popped in the

2:40:19.280 --> 2:40:24.880
 gypsy gyms before I knew Ryan in Florida like I traveled for my job so in Germany and Florida

2:40:25.440 --> 2:40:28.720
 and California and places where where I don't know anyone they don't know me

2:40:29.440 --> 2:40:36.800
 and I have never once had anyone be anything other than than kind and solicitous and helpful

2:40:37.680 --> 2:40:42.080
 and long before when I was a white belt and a blue belt and didn't know anything and

2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:49.120
 and didn't know anyone and um I just think that it's a community of people that it's so cool that

2:40:49.120 --> 2:40:55.040
 no matter where you go in the world um I walked into a gym in Prague one time where only two

2:40:55.040 --> 2:41:01.200
 people spoke English and and it was just yeah it's weird you know it's weird it's weird that like

2:41:01.200 --> 2:41:05.200
 part of a group and they're like oh let me tell you what it's part of a cult right yeah but it's

2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:12.400
 like a positive cult like it for sure that's what we would say as cultists yeah that's true yeah

2:41:12.400 --> 2:41:18.400
 that's true I mean we do need to murder everybody you practice like Edo I mean yeah that's this cult

2:41:18.400 --> 2:41:23.760
 uh deeply believes it no but there is a like if you look at different kinds of games like chess

2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:29.760
 and so on like there's a skepticism I mean there's not a brotherhood sisterhood feeling

2:41:29.760 --> 2:41:34.640
 with jiu jitsu it's like you can roll into most places even like with judo like I can see the

2:41:34.640 --> 2:41:43.440
 contrast like because I've trained in judo places it uh it's more like tribal like you walk in

2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:50.720
 and like who is this like there's that kind of feeling with jiu jitsu there's uh less so there

2:41:50.720 --> 2:41:54.960
 is a little bit with like the competitors there's always like the competitors feeling each other

2:41:54.960 --> 2:42:02.000
 out usually like the blue belts but like outside of that in terms of if you don't get the if you

2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:08.960
 walk in with the vibes of just loving the art and just wanting to have a good time you're like

2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:14.880
 welcome it's it's really cool it's really fascinating it's a really great thing I think and as a woman

2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:20.560
 I think you you think you're walking into these rooms of these you know big strong tough guys and

2:42:20.560 --> 2:42:26.480
 um if anything I would I would say that they're almost like much more solicitous when a woman comes

2:42:26.480 --> 2:42:31.360
 in there and not like they're just like hitting on you all the time you know it's just that you walk

2:42:31.360 --> 2:42:36.400
 in and everyone is like oh cool you want to do this thing that I love let me make sure you have a

2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.600
 good experience and take care of you and I think that's that's an experience that that I hope people

2:42:41.600 --> 2:42:46.000
 have when they come into our gym and and I've I've always felt when I walked into other gyms and and

2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:51.040
 so you know we try our best to make that comfortable and and it can be a little uncomfortable because

2:42:51.040 --> 2:42:57.360
 there are when you walk into a male dominant environment there's conversations and topics

2:42:57.360 --> 2:43:02.480
 there's a different style of camaraderie and joking that a lot of men will do that um maybe

2:43:02.480 --> 2:43:07.120
 some women are more uncomfortable with I grew up with four brothers so I kind of maybe was a little

2:43:07.120 --> 2:43:12.880
 more desensitized to that um and I worked for the department of defense for for a while too so

2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:19.040
 before I I I see you're with the government yeah so so I did that I'm already skeptical yeah

2:43:21.040 --> 2:43:25.040
 I'm not oh you left I'm not gonna ask you about UFOs then because you're not gonna tell me the

2:43:25.040 --> 2:43:31.520
 truth no they exist oh yeah no you just freaked out a lot of people okay

2:43:33.840 --> 2:43:37.040
 but yeah by the way where's where's your school because people always ask like where

2:43:37.040 --> 2:43:42.400
 uh well we're outside of Washington DC in northern Virginia in Falls church you always

2:43:42.400 --> 2:43:47.120
 want to pick like what's the best school if I try out a list place or if I want to move to this place

2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:52.240
 so that's well I mean obviously we're biased but yeah we're in the Washington DC area the best

2:43:52.880 --> 2:43:58.160
 okay we just took a little break now we're back let me ask you one thing that a bunch of people

2:43:58.160 --> 2:44:03.840
 are curious about you're one of the innovators first of all you're one of the great innovators and

2:44:03.840 --> 2:44:10.400
 and philosophers and thinkers in jujitsu right but we are also one of the innovators in terms of leg

2:44:10.400 --> 2:44:17.760
 locks and and the 50 50 position and just like the fact that legs have something to do in jujitsu

2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:25.920
 the the under the other popularizer or innovator in the space is John Donahar and his whole group

2:44:25.920 --> 2:44:33.280
 of guys do you have thoughts about their whole system of leg locks and their ideas about jujitsu

2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:38.480
 and so on? Sure I I guess uh you know obviously you know John and the students at HENZO who've

2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:43.600
 been able to do fantastic things competitively in the past number of years and you know you

2:44:43.600 --> 2:44:49.760
 mentioned innovators in the in that kind of you know section of jujitsu I would be uh I'd love to

2:44:49.760 --> 2:44:55.120
 bring up some guys like Dean Lister um of course uh Masakaze Minari in fact a lot of what was going

2:44:55.120 --> 2:45:00.320
 on in like 90s Japan like combat submission wrestling there was some crazy gnarly stuff that

2:45:00.320 --> 2:45:05.040
 it's just it's on grainy VHS tape but like stuff that if people were doing now they go oh my god

2:45:05.040 --> 2:45:10.000
 that's brand new like there's um it's it's been I think these are things that have been around for a

2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:15.840
 while um in various places I first learned the 50 50 position just like the leg entanglement of it

2:45:15.840 --> 2:45:20.400
 from Brandon Vera actually at a seminar at Lord Urban's Martial Arts I think in 2005

2:45:20.400 --> 2:45:25.280
 he learned it from Dean Lister uh who used it to submit Alexandria Kakareko a really really

2:45:25.280 --> 2:45:30.960
 tough nogi guy at ADCC on the in the run that uh Dean made to the to the gold medal in the absolute

2:45:30.960 --> 2:45:36.720
 division which was a great performance at the time first American to do that um and uh you know

2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:41.040
 and I actually saw a video I mean first a boss Rooton actually broke I think Guy Mezger's

2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:46.080
 foot with a 50 50 heel hook that he actually grabbed his heel and his and his toes went

2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:51.360
 and in pank races back when they had like the man panties and the high uh high boots on yeah and uh

2:45:51.360 --> 2:45:57.280
 dude that was gnarly boss Rooton is underappreciated as like as like he double oh yeah like and oh yeah

2:45:57.280 --> 2:46:01.280
 like you know his leverage his leverage it's that's like a toehold that's you know that goes the

2:46:01.280 --> 2:46:06.080
 other way and it's like it either doesn't work or breaks in half and uh well he's uh is people

2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:13.280
 don't often think of boss Rooton as an innovator but he is in a way like he uh you know talk about

2:46:13.280 --> 2:46:18.640
 like Elon Musk and first principles thinking in terms of physics he like just feels like he just

2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:23.280
 gets the job he figures out like the simplest way to get the job done of breaking things and

2:46:23.840 --> 2:46:27.920
 establishing control and hurting people remember that was back to the boss if you listen to boss

2:46:27.920 --> 2:46:32.400
 Rooton do any like commentary for any of the uh the big MMA shows or any MMA show way back when

2:46:32.400 --> 2:46:35.440
 anytime guys were clenching he's like the guy should roll for a knee bar he was saying that way

2:46:35.440 --> 2:46:39.440
 back when and now people are doing it all the time with varying degrees of success it's it's

2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:43.760
 funny it's like it's also tough to be uh I think like a breakaway thinker I mean you know group

2:46:43.760 --> 2:46:49.840
 think is a real thing and group inertia and it's it's neat to see um you know particularly at a

2:46:49.840 --> 2:46:55.840
 time when maybe that type of stuff was less accepted um you know someone going hey I'm gonna

2:46:55.840 --> 2:47:00.320
 I'm gonna run off in this other direction I think you know whoever you know the inventor of electricity

2:47:00.320 --> 2:47:05.120
 in my mind is a lot more impressive than whomever not to say that the person down the line isn't

2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:10.480
 impressive that comes up with an interesting way to use it both are cool but when you think about

2:47:10.480 --> 2:47:13.600
 just then can you imagine we're sitting here we're like yeah people I'm gonna build an airplane

2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:17.280
 you're like what are you talking about it's crazy people don't fly I'm like no I'm gonna do it and

2:47:17.280 --> 2:47:20.720
 of course it's not gonna be as good as the airplane down the line the iterative things that happen

2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:26.400
 later on but um just being able to go to dream something into existence that you haven't seen

2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:31.200
 before and then make it happen like takes an unbelievable like strength of character almost

2:47:31.200 --> 2:47:36.160
 like a force of will because you have you're you're you're blazing a trail that hasn't been

2:47:36.160 --> 2:47:42.000
 that hasn't been walked before that's the bj pen factor in you know winning the jujitsu world championship

2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:47.680
 first non brazilian to do that was back in 2001 and then rafael lavato later on it's like he's

2:47:47.680 --> 2:47:51.520
 you know both of those guys are so unbelievably impressive in my mind for the same reason you

2:47:51.520 --> 2:47:57.200
 know because they were out there winning at a time when that wasn't a common thing not that it's easy

2:47:57.200 --> 2:48:01.920
 to win now it's just there's not a psychological hurdle that needs to be leapt I remember you

2:48:01.920 --> 2:48:05.360
 know when I was early in jujitsu like americans weren't winning the world championships at any

2:48:05.360 --> 2:48:10.640
 belt I mean bj we all knew bj pen because bj pen did it but it was really really uncommon now it

2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:14.800
 happens you know on the semi regular basis of course the bj's are so strong europeans are still

2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:20.000
 strong but uh in australians are coming on as well but uh it's it's definitely kind of an

2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:24.640
 interesting thing so to come back to you know john danahar and the henzo team obviously they're

2:48:24.640 --> 2:48:29.840
 doing fantastic things john's has some really really great innovation there and the the the

2:48:29.840 --> 2:48:34.960
 systematization and the methodology that they're using is uh is great and it's neat to see that's

2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:40.720
 getting out there I would just also what I would encourage people to make sure that they're you

2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:44.160
 know catching up on their history because obviously you know john's a brilliant instructor and has

2:48:44.160 --> 2:48:48.720
 done things you know for the sport that um that are fantastic that haven't been done before but

2:48:48.720 --> 2:48:52.320
 you know none of us exist in a vacuum and I've learned things from everywhere else so you know

2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:57.200
 john would say the same I'm sure and uh you know Dean Lister would say the same and it's just neat

2:48:57.200 --> 2:49:01.200
 when you can kind of trace the history of all of this happening because we've had humanity's had

2:49:01.200 --> 2:49:05.440
 two arms and two legs for some time at least as long as I've been alive but you mentioned like

2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:10.080
 airplanes and you think there's something totally new to be invented in jujitsu still not totally

2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:17.040
 new but like the you know flying isn't new uh but airplanes nevertheless made that much more

2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:24.000
 efficient is there like new ideas to be discovered in jujitsu still I'd say the reason I'd say yes

2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:28.640
 is the same reason I would say I believe in alchemy even though I don't no I'm serious like I've got

2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:33.440
 some some backing for this okay um you know I guess I talk about this with a buddy of mine a lot

2:49:33.440 --> 2:49:41.520
 like uh and the facilitative versus not facilitative beliefs and if I don't believe something is possible

2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:46.400
 and I do no investigation towards it I'll never find something even if it's there it's almost like

2:49:46.400 --> 2:49:50.400
 it's no different than me walking up on a group of people and going like oh man look at these

2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:54.320
 jerks this is going to suck versus me going oh I wonder what these guys are up to I'm about to

2:49:54.320 --> 2:49:57.920
 have two very different conversations even though the players in the game are no different my

2:49:57.920 --> 2:50:02.880
 internal constitution has changed because of of how I've decided to approach the situation so

2:50:02.880 --> 2:50:07.280
 although I wouldn't personally want to spend all my time trying to turn lead into gold because I

2:50:07.280 --> 2:50:12.000
 don't believe that it's likely to work only a person who's willing to spend his or her life

2:50:12.000 --> 2:50:16.080
 in that pursuit will actually get to the bottom of that and also in the in the pursuit of that

2:50:16.080 --> 2:50:20.720
 they're likely to find other things so I think a lot of times the idea is that humanity is pushed

2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:24.720
 forward by you know again it's another or since it's got carbon it's like you know human beings

2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:30.080
 are in this slog it's paraphrasing just in this slog over time and then periodically the humanity

2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:34.720
 gives birth to genius like someone that invents the wheel invents electricity pushes us forward

2:50:34.720 --> 2:50:39.120
 you know comes up with with the idea of governance that doesn't you know just start and end with the

2:50:39.120 --> 2:50:44.480
 point of a sword you know and you know these aren't common things these are unbelievable

2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:48.080
 advancements that you know that I just me sitting here I didn't come up with them but I just get

2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:52.400
 the benefit of it so I guess what I would say is a lot of times these ideas are called crazy you

2:50:52.400 --> 2:50:57.360
 know like as we discussed on kind of offline it's like you know Einstein was brilliant in his 20s

2:50:57.360 --> 2:51:02.480
 and it was brilliant before that I would suspect but basically you know gets recognized later on

2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:06.320
 in life and of course we all thought those were great ideas the man was probably roundly mocked

2:51:06.320 --> 2:51:12.400
 for giant chunks of his life and I guess so it's neat to I would say there's definitely in my mind

2:51:12.400 --> 2:51:17.200
 things that even if it's just combinations and new to me new ways to see things new ways to

2:51:17.200 --> 2:51:21.920
 understand different depth of understanding possibly new things new positions new ideas

2:51:21.920 --> 2:51:28.080
 because even if that's not true the process of going through and acting as if it is and

2:51:28.080 --> 2:51:33.120
 believing like that and focusing and and trying to investigate will make any of us will push us

2:51:33.120 --> 2:51:38.400
 all forward we're sitting there you know obsessing over the cult of our current knowledge I think

2:51:38.400 --> 2:51:43.600
 is the biggest the biggest danger and the biggest cause of stagnation that exists anywhere.

2:51:45.360 --> 2:51:49.600
 Yeah and it starts with believing the the impossible which is kind of interesting

2:51:49.600 --> 2:51:55.040
 one of the things that's really inspiring to me is to see people out there which which sadly are rare

2:51:55.040 --> 2:52:03.600
 who kind of have a combination of two things one is they have a worldview that involves

2:52:04.320 --> 2:52:10.640
 that includes a lot of ideas that are crazy and the second part is they're exceptionally focused

2:52:10.640 --> 2:52:16.640
 and competent in bringing that whatever the ideas in that worldview to reality so there's

2:52:16.640 --> 2:52:20.720
 certainly a lot of people with crazy ideas you know there's a lot of conspiracy theorists they have

2:52:20.720 --> 2:52:28.720
 way out there beliefs about things but they're not doing much to like make the like build stuff

2:52:28.720 --> 2:52:33.520
 grounded like they're not engineers or whatever they're just like espousing different crazy ideas

2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:38.080
 but that's why you get like the Elon Musk type characters and the reason I bring him up a lot

2:52:38.080 --> 2:52:43.760
 is because like there's not many others to bring up it's like there's not many examples of it

2:52:43.760 --> 2:52:48.960
 through history the people I mean the guys convinced that we're going to colonize Mars

2:52:49.680 --> 2:52:57.680
 and basically everybody on earth thinks that's insane everyone except the guy that's going to

2:52:57.680 --> 2:53:03.600
 do it right except that's going to do it and like you can imagine like a couple hundred years from

2:53:03.600 --> 2:53:09.520
 now people will I mean first of all they they won't certainly won't remember the haters

2:53:09.520 --> 2:53:15.600
 they won't remember all the people if if they do remember them they'll remember them in a sense

2:53:15.600 --> 2:53:21.680
 like people are silly to think that this isn't the obvious path forward like from a perspective

2:53:22.240 --> 2:53:27.600
 that's what that's what Elon talks about like it's obvious they were going to expand throughout the

2:53:27.600 --> 2:53:34.320
 universe like so from his perspective from his perspective like but to me it is also obvious

2:53:34.320 --> 2:53:40.800
 because like either we destroy ourselves or or we'll expand beyond earth like

2:53:43.120 --> 2:53:48.000
 like there's not many you know we well it's not maybe it's not completely obvious I guess I share

2:53:48.000 --> 2:53:54.720
 that worldview there's the other possibility that we humans find a sort of an inner peace

2:53:54.720 --> 2:53:59.520
 where the forces of capitalism will calm down and we'll all just meditate and do yoga and

2:53:59.520 --> 2:54:04.640
 jiu jitsu and like relax with this whole tech thing where we keep building new technologies but

2:54:04.640 --> 2:54:11.040
 it's cool to have those kinds of people that just believe the big ambitious crazy dreams

2:54:11.040 --> 2:54:14.480
 because that's where it starts if you want to build something special you have to first believe

2:54:15.120 --> 2:54:19.600
 that when you also have to believe strongly enough that you're not vulnerable and I'm

2:54:19.600 --> 2:54:24.160
 speculating but it's like I can only imagine how many people have told Elon that what he's doing

2:54:24.160 --> 2:54:28.960
 is crazy so not only did he dream it up he dreamed it up went with it and also went with it in the

2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:34.640
 face of being told that it's not going to work and then anytime and then also stepped away from

2:54:34.640 --> 2:54:38.960
 the bitterness because he's done a series of really crazy impressive things and that's only

2:54:38.960 --> 2:54:42.880
 those little things that I'm aware of but and also staying away from the bitterness of every

2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:47.760
 single time you did something good initially I all I do is talk down about you and then eventually

2:54:47.760 --> 2:54:53.200
 I act as of course of course I never apologize and yet you don't let that dampen your spirits for

2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:58.400
 the next innovation which is pretty incredible to me to watch yeah it's kind of cool I mean

2:54:58.400 --> 2:55:04.640
 it's contagious to spend time with the guy because he's not it's rogan has the same look to him which

2:55:04.640 --> 2:55:14.480
 is interesting about these people is like there there's like a hater shield that he's like he

2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:21.280
 doesn't even like sense them it feels like like it doesn't he doesn't he thinks to uh to Elon it's

2:55:21.280 --> 2:55:27.360
 like it's obvious I mean he keeps calling it like first principles thinking like physics says it's

2:55:27.360 --> 2:55:32.720
 true therefore it's true like he's convinced himself that like his beliefs are grounded in the

2:55:32.720 --> 2:55:38.560
 fundamental fabric of the way the universe works therefore the haters don't matter right and I mean

2:55:38.560 --> 2:55:42.480
 that's kind of like a system of thought he developed himself through all the difficulty

2:55:42.480 --> 2:55:47.040
 through all the doubt he's able to take huge risks with basically putting everything he

2:55:47.040 --> 2:55:52.000
 owes on the line multiple times throughout his life amidst all the drama amidst all the doubts

2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:59.040
 amidst all like the he's still able to make just clear clear headed decisions it's I don't know

2:55:59.040 --> 2:56:03.440
 what to make of it but it's inspiring as hell well it's I think it's something's funny I think like

2:56:03.440 --> 2:56:08.240
 I can only imagine the you know history will look back on him as a brilliant person but that's not

2:56:08.240 --> 2:56:12.080
 the only there's there's a lot of maybe not numeric not statistically speaking but a lot

2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:15.520
 numerically on a giant planet of you know billions of people a lot of brilliant people

2:56:16.320 --> 2:56:20.000
 well you know time place luck fortune and all that other stuff but at the same time

2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:25.520
 time that clearly isn't the only determining thing in making Elon Musk Elon Musk and obviously

2:56:25.520 --> 2:56:30.480
 I don't know the guy from adam and but it's an interesting thing that it's not just his

2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:34.640
 intellect his belief system his structure how he's viewing the world like that's

2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:40.160
 did he reason his way to that did he not what other factors came in I'm really curious about

2:56:40.160 --> 2:56:46.800
 that because I guess coming it's again I feel really strongly about people's belief structure

2:56:46.800 --> 2:56:53.120
 and this the how they view the world being more important than the engine behind it you know it

2:56:53.120 --> 2:56:57.920
 makes someone resilient or not it makes someone positive or not because you get up 10,000 I think

2:56:57.920 --> 2:57:01.840
 about this for competitive stuff you get up 10,000 things going properly and one thing going

2:57:01.840 --> 2:57:06.160
 improperly if you focus on the improper you'll probably fix it at a certain point which is good

2:57:06.160 --> 2:57:10.960
 facilitative for development in the long term but if you had to go and try to perform a task in the

2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:15.520
 next five minutes and you're focusing on the negative your confidence and your your belief

2:57:15.520 --> 2:57:20.720
 in the positive outcome of the future is likely to be damaged or as you could have 25 things going

2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:24.320
 wrong but you go man I'm sure I'm happy to be alive how fortunate I am this is great I can't

2:57:24.320 --> 2:57:29.120
 this is I have problems to solve this is awesome versus I list the problems and I start bishing

2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:33.120
 about them both of them are technically accurate but it's I guess different lenses and I think

2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:37.520
 that's a really neat thing to see you know someone you know exemplifying that for us.

2:57:37.520 --> 2:57:46.640
 So maybe to look at the the fighting world there's a million questions I can ask here like one you

2:57:46.640 --> 2:57:53.200
 mentioned BJ Penn you first of all you're undefeated in the UFC and one of the fights you've had is

2:57:53.200 --> 2:58:00.080
 against BJ Penn which is a kind of an incredible fight you won performance of the night what did

2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:07.920
 it feel like to uh to face BJ Penn and to beat him definitively as he did like what's that whole

2:58:07.920 --> 2:58:13.280
 experience like? I'll be honest I didn't know if I was going to ever be able to fight again after

2:58:13.280 --> 2:58:18.640
 beating Graham Maynard in 2016 um you know I've had a couple periods of those I was about to join

2:58:18.640 --> 2:58:24.960
 the army actually and when I was 30 before the for the UFC for Jen sent me over to an ultimate

2:58:24.960 --> 2:58:28.320
 fighter I didn't want to go because I was like one they're never going to pit me two I'd be terrible

2:58:28.320 --> 2:58:32.560
 for TV three I'll probably say something I'm gonna get you know burned to death in the streets

2:58:32.560 --> 2:58:37.360
 you know like this isn't a great idea and then she said we'll go out there see what happens do

2:58:37.360 --> 2:58:41.360
 it anyway you'll be you'll regret it if you didn't and then I ended up doing ultimate fighter and

2:58:41.360 --> 2:58:48.160
 then so I fought three times on the show and then I fought for the for the finale so those four

2:58:48.160 --> 2:58:53.520
 times in like five or six months which was great and then it took me a year to get another opponent

2:58:53.520 --> 2:58:58.400
 um and that was Graham Maynard and then Gray was obviously very tough guy managed to get a good

2:58:58.400 --> 2:59:03.840
 outcome there then it took two years to to fight BJ Penn and that was you know obviously I'm

2:59:03.840 --> 2:59:08.400
 training all the time every single day and that never stops but that was I'll be honest like pretty

2:59:08.400 --> 2:59:12.400
 deeply frustrating because you know as a human being as an athlete you know I think as an athlete

2:59:12.400 --> 2:59:17.120
 you die twice like you have an athletic peak or area and then then you go on with the rest of your

2:59:17.120 --> 2:59:21.200
 life but it is a microcosm for the rest of your life it's like you're you're seeing this the sand

2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:26.480
 tick away in the hourglass would drop away and you're going man this is these are years between

2:59:26.480 --> 2:59:30.720
 thirty one thirty two thirty three like I'll be at my best at this time my absolute best physically

2:59:30.720 --> 2:59:35.840
 now not technically I'm a lot better now than I was before on a plan but at a certain point you will

2:59:35.840 --> 2:59:39.760
 unless you're Bernard Hopkins you will reach diminishing returns and then I guess the long

2:59:39.760 --> 2:59:45.680
 the long wait you can feel the clock ticking is this frustrating so why why did it take two years

2:59:45.680 --> 2:59:52.480
 for BJ that's the question people ask a lot it's like why does nobody want to fight right I don't

2:59:52.480 --> 2:59:56.640
 know I probably they probably think they'll get infected by whatever this is but I don't I don't

2:59:56.640 --> 3:00:01.280
 blame them but I would mean you're a really tough opponent is but is the bottom line I'll say that

3:00:01.280 --> 3:00:06.640
 I'm different I maybe they perceive that the the the threat is greater than the reward I'm hoping

3:00:06.640 --> 3:00:12.000
 that now that we're ranked number 12 you know in the UFC rankings that that will change and I know

3:00:12.000 --> 3:00:17.680
 that if we're one more win and then we're in the top 10 that you know now now we're you're there

3:00:17.680 --> 3:00:21.920
 but uh what I've consistently found is that like randoms want to fight and I'm like go away you

3:00:21.920 --> 3:00:25.280
 know I didn't come here for you you know because if I wanted to just fight anybody I could go down

3:00:25.280 --> 3:00:29.120
 to a waffle house and yell until like DMX shows up and we can we can fight because he'll be at the

3:00:29.120 --> 3:00:32.960
 waffle house too who am I kidding I really want to hang out with DMX but uh you know it's like you

3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:37.920
 want to when I had the opportunity I'm calling DMX oh my god that was so cool it sounds like a

3:00:37.920 --> 3:00:44.320
 Netflix show I would never fight DMX we'd be on the same team no but uh anyway um it's I guess um

3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:50.000
 I accepted fights against uh I asked they got asked about llamas I said yes I got asked about

3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:54.880
 Dennis Ramirez I said yes um you know like long periods of time and they at that time well you

3:00:54.880 --> 3:01:02.960
 know in between 2016 and 2018 um I was struggling to have have opponents who would sign up and uh

3:01:02.960 --> 3:01:07.440
 us I haven't turned down fights I've just said hey you know keep the I don't care about fighting the

3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:14.400
 randoms and it's and you have a successful school you're like you're running you're martial artists

3:01:14.400 --> 3:01:20.000
 broadly speaking so it doesn't make sense then to take fights that aren't like right that fit

3:01:20.720 --> 3:01:24.560
 a certain kind of trajectory for your career and that's when when BJ Penn they said well BJ's

3:01:24.560 --> 3:01:29.440
 looking for an opponent I was like I'm your guy and uh and I think that you know BJ accepted that

3:01:29.440 --> 3:01:34.480
 fight because I'm another jujitsu guy I don't think he perceived that I was much of a threat on the

3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:42.320
 feet um and uh you know I was able to it was neat to get it to compete against someone uh you know

3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:45.840
 who's one of my heroes one of the people I looked up to in MMA for the longest time and

3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:51.440
 were you intimidated by that no no I love competing I I don't really get nervous or scared before

3:01:51.440 --> 3:01:56.320
 fights I'm not afraid to get hurt and not afraid to win I'm not afraid to lose it's I I'm just

3:01:56.320 --> 3:02:00.800
 excited for the I feel thankful for the opportunity to compete and the opportunity to play when it

3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:05.920
 matters you know I I just that's the only time I'm interested in playing anymore is when it when

3:02:05.920 --> 3:02:10.960
 it matters when the opposition is I know that you know it's funny because people pick on on

3:02:10.960 --> 3:02:15.360
 a lot of some opponents particularly after after the fact like if you if you get a good outcome

3:02:15.360 --> 3:02:19.120
 well then of course let's beat that guy that guy wasn't that good I'm like well I was that's

3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:24.080
 after the fact I get to say that and also as the person in the ring you know BJ Penn has

3:02:24.080 --> 3:02:29.040
 hurt a lot of people in in makes martial arts cage and I could actually absolutely have been on

3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:34.160
 that list so it was neat to get to compete against someone that I really respect someone that I

3:02:34.160 --> 3:02:38.960
 looked up to for a long time someone who has a great skill set and also I went up and wait to

3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:41.920
 fight him in his weight class he didn't have to come down to mine which is where he takes

3:02:41.920 --> 3:02:45.280
 was lightweight it was lightweight yeah I'm generally a featherweight I walk around at like

3:02:45.280 --> 3:02:51.520
 158 pounds so um what's uh what's lightweight and featherweight lightweight is 155 with a day

3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:55.520
 before weighing and featherweight is 145 with a day before weighing so I'm a little bit more

3:02:55.520 --> 3:03:02.000
 properly sized for featherweight but anyway you know I so I didn't feel like obviously he was giving

3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:07.360
 up a couple years of age but I was giving up size and all this other stuff and it was you know I

3:03:07.360 --> 3:03:12.160
 was just excited to have the opportunity to step in against someone like BJ and you know we managed

3:03:12.160 --> 3:03:17.600
 to get out of there with a with a good outcome without getting too banged up but uh just it was

3:03:17.600 --> 3:03:21.760
 cool because we tied up on the fence and just even uh the second you know is when you're rolling

3:03:21.760 --> 3:03:25.280
 with somebody and you touch and you can feel what they're doing you go oh man this guy's really good

3:03:26.000 --> 3:03:29.600
 you can feel the calm you can feel the small minor adjustments that they're making the subtle

3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:33.440
 things that they're doing and uh that was one of those things that was really neat and gratifying

3:03:33.440 --> 3:03:38.000
 because you know you never know sometimes people that you've heard of are a little bit less technically

3:03:38.000 --> 3:03:41.440
 proficient than you thought and other times you'll meet some guy that you train like who the hell is

3:03:41.440 --> 3:03:47.120
 this guy how have I not heard of this person and uh BJ was exactly as a jitsu guy what I would have

3:03:47.120 --> 3:03:51.840
 thought and uh another thing that's another thing to bug me about how people reacted after the fight

3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:57.280
 is uh you know basically going I'll BJ screwed up this screwed up that and like all right yeah

3:03:57.280 --> 3:04:05.120
 it's so interesting it's sad I that was you know one of the to me I mean as a fan of both that was

3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:13.040
 a beautiful moment is uh as a kind of passing of a torch in a sense of exceptional performance

3:04:13.040 --> 3:04:20.800
 like another one that stands out to me maybe you can comment is I don't understand well maybe I do

3:04:20.800 --> 3:04:27.520
 why Connor McGregor gets as much hate as he does uh he probably revels in it but I think

3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:38.800
 he doesn't get enough credit for uh Jose Aldo for the for like for basically you know knocking him out

3:04:38.800 --> 3:04:47.040
 in the in the in the first few seconds of uh of a fight I mean now Jose is like one of the greatest

3:04:47.040 --> 3:04:53.760
 fighters ever that's true uh maybe some people can be even put in the top 10 no question and the

3:04:54.560 --> 3:05:02.080
 like I don't understand why it's doesn't get as much like Connor McGregor doesn't get as much credit

3:05:02.080 --> 3:05:09.040
 uh as I think he deserves for that and for Eddie Alvarez and all the fights for some reason whenever

3:05:10.400 --> 3:05:16.880
 Connor McGregor beats somebody well that they they were not that good then like it means like

3:05:16.880 --> 3:05:22.160
 they were they were there something was off right that's convenient isn't it yeah it's it's it's

3:05:22.160 --> 3:05:29.680
 quite strange to me but I mean what are your thoughts on uh on Connor McGregor maybe one

3:05:29.680 --> 3:05:34.800
 way to ask that I'm rushing some obviously also a Khabib fan but I'm also a Connor fan it seems

3:05:34.800 --> 3:05:39.200
 like there's not many of us who are like fans of both right um what are your thoughts you and

3:05:39.200 --> 3:05:47.120
 Artem Lobov yeah right the two of us which also is a good fight uh uh tough dude yeah really really

3:05:47.120 --> 3:05:51.040
 tough dude it's like five languages really interesting cat oh so like oh wow I didn't know

3:05:51.040 --> 3:05:56.480
 that side of this there's a brain there well on the Khabib versus Connor what do you make

3:05:56.480 --> 3:06:01.680
 of their first fight what do you do you agree with me that uh they should fight again because I think

3:06:01.680 --> 3:06:07.920
 it'd be awesome if they fought again in Moscow and uh do you agree with me I'm just gonna put

3:06:07.920 --> 3:06:13.120
 say things that piss people off but I believe is that Connor actually has a chance to be Khabib

3:06:13.840 --> 3:06:17.440
 one to Connor absolutely has a chance to be Khabib Connor has a chance to beat anyone that

3:06:17.440 --> 3:06:20.720
 he steps into that ring with and not just like a mathematical chance you're like oh one of the

3:06:20.720 --> 3:06:25.680
 billion but like you know like he absolutely it's funny because I won't pretend to know Connor

3:06:25.680 --> 3:06:30.080
 really well but I first met Connor in 2010 when I was teaching a seminar in uh at Straitless Jim

3:06:30.080 --> 3:06:35.360
 Ireland in Dublin um and that's actually where I first met all of the coaches that ended up being

3:06:35.360 --> 3:06:42.080
 on Connor's team um you know John Kavana, Owen Roddy, Gunnar Nelson you know so for I actually

3:06:42.080 --> 3:06:46.080
 I enjoyed being an ultimate fighter and being on uh you're my favorite team and getting a

3:06:46.080 --> 3:06:49.520
 train with all the guys there but at the same time the people that I was actually I knew better

3:06:49.520 --> 3:06:56.160
 were actually the European side all all of Connor's coaches um and uh that was a neat thing because I

3:06:56.160 --> 3:07:00.400
 got to I met Connor I didn't know who Connor like Connor wasn't Connor at that point yeah that was

3:07:00.400 --> 3:07:04.960
 before his UFC debut oh yeah well well before yeah I think I think he got in like 2014 maybe

3:07:04.960 --> 3:07:09.520
 something like that yeah and uh anyway but he was doing well in cage warriors winning the titles

3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:14.640
 there I think prior to that you know I remember going seeing him on the show and uh also then

3:07:14.640 --> 3:07:20.400
 getting him trained because I competed uh I was initially slated to fight David Tamer for the

3:07:20.400 --> 3:07:24.720
 ultimate fighter finale before getting put into fight autumn uh for the title for the show so I

3:07:24.720 --> 3:07:29.200
 went over to Ireland to train for a couple days and basically it was neat to watch him watch him

3:07:29.200 --> 3:07:34.640
 work I mean man he's focused and trains a lot and he's very very smart and very very hard working

3:07:34.640 --> 3:07:41.760
 and I think a lot of times people get stuck in the uh in this um you know and they almost want to

3:07:41.760 --> 3:07:46.400
 believe that this was lucky or this this person you know that they're not working that hard they're

3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:51.600
 just out there they got there with their mouth and that's that's just not the case and um you

3:07:51.600 --> 3:07:54.880
 know I don't know what it's like you know obviously Connor's very well off right now and I don't know

3:07:54.880 --> 3:07:58.720
 how hard how seriously he's training what he's doing I can't speak to any of that but uh there's

3:07:58.720 --> 3:08:02.800
 no question that that he has skills to be dangerous and one of the funny things obviously that could

3:08:02.800 --> 3:08:06.240
 be fight went could be his way could be was a great fighter and and also has the chance to beat

3:08:06.240 --> 3:08:13.600
 anyone in that ring at any given time but uh there's there was a Connor you know it's uh one

3:08:13.600 --> 3:08:18.480
 that he can he can put anybody away and as you mentioned I think that he doesn't get the credit

3:08:18.480 --> 3:08:21.120
 for the Eddie Alvarez fight doesn't get the credit for the Josie Aldo fight because it was

3:08:21.120 --> 3:08:24.080
 almost so much of a letdown I remember that happened the same weekend that I did the ultimate

3:08:24.080 --> 3:08:30.320
 fighter finale and you're like all right wait what yeah it almost doesn't feel like a fight

3:08:30.320 --> 3:08:34.720
 happened but we mentioned Miyamoto Musashi I mean Musashi was famous for the way he poked

3:08:34.720 --> 3:08:38.480
 and prodded the people with what he was doing whether overtly or not it's like oh we're supposed

3:08:38.480 --> 3:08:44.640
 to fight to the death in uh you know at 3 p.m. tomorrow great four p.m. rolls around I'm just

3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:48.800
 not there five I mean you remember all the all the antics and nonsense that Connor was pulling

3:08:48.800 --> 3:08:52.800
 prior to that like speaking person that's not something I would feel comfortable doing but

3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:57.280
 it's like everyone's different and the effect that it had on on Josie was I mean beyond evident

3:08:57.280 --> 3:09:01.920
 when was the last time Josie started the started the fight with leaping left hand leaping right

3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:07.760
 hand you're like wait what and then he was obviously you know living rent free and in Josie's head

3:09:07.760 --> 3:09:13.200
 at that point and that was a combination of psychological you know ability and and where

3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:17.280
 with all and then physical and it reminded me of the way Muhammad Ali would would bother people

3:09:17.280 --> 3:09:23.600
 and whatnot and the fact that he's a polarizing figure I think makes some people not give him

3:09:23.600 --> 3:09:28.640
 his due and then at the same time sometimes certain fans may be go overboard but uh they

3:09:28.640 --> 3:09:33.520
 remember the knee that Ben Askren got knocked out with by Mosserdahl I mean that was an amazing

3:09:33.520 --> 3:09:37.520
 unbelievable thing but three inches to the right three inches to the left I guess whichever side

3:09:37.520 --> 3:09:43.360
 his head wasn't now you could have been square but uh and that fight starts with Ben Askren on

3:09:43.360 --> 3:09:48.880
 top of you in the first five seconds well Connor ran and threw a knee just like that it could be

3:09:48.880 --> 3:09:52.640
 even could be got right around it that could have easily gone the other way can you imagine what

3:09:52.640 --> 3:09:57.040
 would have happened if after the after coming back from boxing um after coming back from from

3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:01.680
 the Mayweather fight Connor rocks could be in the first 10 seconds it's over and you're like

3:10:01.680 --> 3:10:08.400
 he would it would have been intolerable but basically yeah like you know but see here's

3:10:08.400 --> 3:10:14.480
 the thing let me actually push back slightly uh I mean no please to the fans correct me if I'm wrong

3:10:15.440 --> 3:10:21.440
 but Connor seems to because I've competed a lot and like there's a tension there's a negativity

3:10:21.440 --> 3:10:27.440
 sometimes depending on the opponent and there's a respect afterwards that happens like when you

3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:33.920
 understand that there's a deep like respect and almost like love for each other like I always seen

3:10:33.920 --> 3:10:39.920
 that in Connor like all the trash talk afterwards yes there's a it's it's a subtle thing you can't

3:10:39.920 --> 3:10:48.000
 always see it but there's a respect like I agree and like that I almost on the Khabib side I almost

3:10:48.000 --> 3:10:54.240
 feel like Khabib really took it personally he didn't he didn't he lost the respect for Connor

3:10:54.240 --> 3:10:59.120
 I thought the whole time Connor had the respect so I what I wanted to say is like if Connor won

3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:05.440
 that fight like Rock Khabib I could see like I wouldn't see trash talking I could see like

3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:10.080
 trash talking stop right there I think so too but at the same time I'm sure you recall like Connor

3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:14.640
 Connor crossing some pretty personal territory you know both religiously and and also familiarly

3:11:14.640 --> 3:11:19.920
 with with Khabib and it's you know I mean I think it's the sort of thing that I don't know it's

3:11:19.920 --> 3:11:25.040
 an interesting that's one of the reasons like you have to know the difference so obviously I know the

3:11:25.840 --> 3:11:31.200
 the Khabib the Dagestani people they don't play around like that they don't play around like that

3:11:31.920 --> 3:11:36.240
 you know I mean they take offense to basically and I mean you don't do that so

3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:44.000
 so like Connor didn't maybe he did on purpose or maybe he wasn't even just aware of totally fair

3:11:44.000 --> 3:11:48.640
 of uh it was cultural differences you know the box he opened like you you can talk to

3:11:49.360 --> 3:11:54.320
 Floyd Mayweather you can you can go anywhere with him you can you can say the most offensive things

3:11:54.320 --> 3:12:03.440
 but with Khabib it's hard lines but you um I mean a lot of people ask I know you're a featherweight

3:12:03.440 --> 3:12:11.440
 but if you were to uh face it feels like Khabib was one of the hardest puzzles to solve

3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:18.480
 in in all of mixed martial arts if you were to face Khabib do you think how would you go about

3:12:18.480 --> 3:12:22.880
 solving that puzzle like almost the question is almost from a jiu jitsu perspective too

3:12:23.520 --> 3:12:29.360
 what do you do with a guy that's exceptionally good at controlling position especially on top very

3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:36.480
 good at wrestling and taking down and controlling position like let's say so forget maybe striking

3:12:36.480 --> 3:12:43.200
 on the ground how do you solve that guy like what do you do with your guard if you get taken down

3:12:43.200 --> 3:12:48.480
 or do you create an entire system of not getting taken down or escaping is like what what ideas do

3:12:48.480 --> 3:12:52.640
 you have for that well I guess I would say in my mind fighting is a game of trading energy

3:12:53.840 --> 3:12:58.080
 kind of uh you know there's two there's two things there's damage and there's energy

3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:02.720
 so like when I say energy I mean like a tired not tired how much how much gas you've got

3:13:02.720 --> 3:13:07.920
 um and then damage counts obviously as well um you could be feeling I could be feeling great and

3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:11.040
 then you get to kick me in the head hard really hard three times it doesn't matter that I could

3:13:11.040 --> 3:13:17.600
 get up and run a mile I can't get up so anyway um you know I think what Khabib does is so well

3:13:17.600 --> 3:13:22.480
 is he makes the fight look like it could be an amagamado fight um he does a great job of avoiding

3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:28.320
 damage on the feet for the most part and really sucking the life out of people with how suffocating

3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:32.960
 and oppressive as his control is um his chain wrestling is as good as anyone we've ever seen

3:13:32.960 --> 3:13:39.440
 in the UFC it's fantastic um but uh that poses a really serious threat for people that need to

3:13:39.440 --> 3:13:43.920
 maintain a certain amount of space and try to hurt him on the feet because unless they're able to

3:13:43.920 --> 3:13:48.640
 inflict an adequate amount of damage they're gonna each time let's say for instance let's say him

3:13:48.640 --> 3:13:53.600
 taking them down as a foregone conclusion at some point um if every single time Khabib takes you

3:13:53.600 --> 3:13:58.320
 down you get right back up it's not the big deal um because it's actually more we've all experienced

3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:03.280
 this let's say you and I are rolling you tapped me 15 times in one round who's more tired probably

3:14:03.280 --> 3:14:07.840
 you are yeah what my ass so badly that that it's like you're the only one working but um

3:14:08.720 --> 3:14:14.080
 so if you're comfortable with the up and down of it like being taken down if you're if you

3:14:14.080 --> 3:14:20.480
 don't if you don't get hurt badly or tired on the bottom you have a chance but that doesn't

3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:25.120
 involve just cracking him on the feet before he gets a hold of you uh that's a lot that's a lot

3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:30.960
 to ask that's a lot to ask that's difficult to do it seemed actually like Connor it seemed like it

3:14:30.960 --> 3:14:36.320
 when he was being kind of taken down or the the take down attempts against Khabib he seemed to be

3:14:36.320 --> 3:14:40.000
 somewhat relaxed the whole thing I thought he was doing well actually I think that particularly

3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:44.000
 for the first round I thought he did a very good job it's just one of those things that I think like

3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:49.840
 uh could be being could the fight's taking place in Khabib's world in large part and I mean set

3:14:49.840 --> 3:14:54.400
 aside that one giant uh what is it right hand that that Khabib hit Connor with that by the way

3:14:54.400 --> 3:14:59.760
 Connor reacted like an absolute champion he got crushed by that overhand and then drop and his

3:14:59.760 --> 3:15:04.240
 eyes went right back on Khabib it was immediate positive great response so even though that was

3:15:04.240 --> 3:15:07.920
 I think that was a bit of a surprising thing Connor reacted really really well but if you're

3:15:07.920 --> 3:15:12.800
 going to be on bottom with Khabib for four rounds that's going to be tough and also Connor's a way

3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:17.840
 better grappler than people like to give him credit for but he's not the type of grappler that can do

3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:22.640
 that can that's too tall of an order but there are grapplers that could do that or at least would

3:15:22.640 --> 3:15:27.520
 have a much much better shot at uh being able to weather that type of a storm do you see yourself

3:15:27.520 --> 3:15:36.400
 being able to be relaxed through that kind of storm yes well I guess I remember being punch it

3:15:36.400 --> 3:15:42.240
 being being being savagely beaten is very relaxing the timing of that answer was like okay

3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:50.960
 okay that's a dumb question no that's ultimately the goal of Jiu Jitsu is to um be relaxed through

3:15:50.960 --> 3:15:55.520
 the fire for sure and remember like every usc fighter I win all hypothetical matchups yeah

3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:05.920
 that's true uh since uh I'm one to ask ridiculous questions and we've been talking about sci fi and

3:16:05.920 --> 3:16:10.480
 all that kind of stuff let me ask the kind of big question that everybody disagrees about

3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:16.640
 certainly with me is who are the top five greatest MMA fighters of all time oh man and um

3:16:17.680 --> 3:16:22.560
 why is Fedor number one okay well first off Fedor is number one oh really oh you agree right there

3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:27.520
 with you really oh yeah talk about people that just get completely under appreciated even though

3:16:27.520 --> 3:16:32.800
 he's never been like he's never succeeded in the UFC it's not his fault it came along after him

3:16:32.800 --> 3:16:37.440
 at the time that at the time that Fedor was at his height the UFC was not where it was at for

3:16:37.440 --> 3:16:41.520
 heavyweight fighting I mean not that there weren't good heavyweights there but Fedor Fedor was

3:16:41.520 --> 3:16:47.280
 unbelievable you know I mean you remember I mean in Minotaur Noguera I was a massive fan of him I

3:16:47.280 --> 3:16:53.200
 still remember watching uh was it Pride 2004 when when Noguera fought CroCup and got blasted with

3:16:53.200 --> 3:16:57.040
 that left kick and dropped with like seconds left in the first round Pride was great because

3:16:57.040 --> 3:17:00.960
 that 10 minute first round in that five minute second which again materially alters alters the

3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:04.560
 fight big time and you know just the texture of the fight because it's totally it's borderline

3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:10.880
 different sport you know then then getting a five a pause and a five but anyway similar sports like

3:17:10.880 --> 3:17:14.000
 one of those swimming things where they have nine gold medals for different types of swimming right

3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:20.480
 but still swimming but anyway um oh yeah that they would disagree yeah I don't mean I'm not trying

3:17:20.480 --> 3:17:25.680
 to but it's so it's totally true ten ten minutes is different than five minutes sorry I think don't

3:17:25.680 --> 3:17:30.160
 don't don't drown me swimmers I don't swim very well it's easy for me to easy me to downplay it but

3:17:30.160 --> 3:17:37.200
 anyway uh uh yeah and then no better than uh John Jones like the modern era well I mean I guess it's

3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:43.120
 tough to compare to compare across eras it would be like going and saying like oh man how how would

3:17:43.120 --> 3:17:49.280
 such and such great grappler from today fair against someone from 1995 I'm like well probably

3:17:49.280 --> 3:17:54.480
 pretty well for them depending upon who they are what's going on you know there's some people that

3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:58.880
 would their skill sets might transition across eras but a lot of times not but that's not fair we

3:17:58.880 --> 3:18:04.240
 get that they'll be like comparing Spartans to modern day you know like army guys they're like

3:18:04.240 --> 3:18:08.640
 well who's gonna win like well did modern day army guys get modern day weapons well yeah but

3:18:08.640 --> 3:18:12.720
 who's the toughest ruggedest group of people at the very least so I guess it's it's tough to say

3:18:12.720 --> 3:18:17.120
 but at least in my mind the people that I think about for great fighters their their quality of

3:18:17.120 --> 3:18:23.280
 opposition um their level of like lasting and like success their level of lasting innovation

3:18:23.280 --> 3:18:27.040
 like the courage that they have to demonstrate because again it's like being a big fish in a

3:18:27.040 --> 3:18:31.280
 small pond takes no courage doesn't mean that there's nothing there but it it just requires

3:18:31.280 --> 3:18:36.960
 something a little bit different so Kazushi Sakuraba is one of my guys too um BJ Penn also I mean

3:18:36.960 --> 3:18:42.640
 BJ Penn fought Lyoto Machida that's insane you know it's that was a time it was a different sport

3:18:42.640 --> 3:18:46.160
 it was a different time in the sport where you know they were some guys were were bouncing around

3:18:46.160 --> 3:18:51.280
 doing different things but let's so I guess the Gracie family it's I mean they never had an

3:18:51.280 --> 3:18:56.080
 in like obviously Hoist was there um but they never and that was a definitely a different sport

3:18:56.080 --> 3:19:00.400
 weight classes being open things like that but you have to say that Hoist is up there oh no question

3:19:00.400 --> 3:19:04.640
 one of the greatest ever I think so too and and again I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you

3:19:05.440 --> 3:19:10.560
 if it weren't for him so the Gracie family as a whole but I mean who's the better I mean I think

3:19:11.520 --> 3:19:15.120
 Hoist would tell you himself probably that Hickson would have handled business back then

3:19:15.120 --> 3:19:18.480
 but they didn't put him in so again he's the greatest fighter the greatest fighter the greatest

3:19:18.480 --> 3:19:23.760
 fighter that we saw do his business so Hoist up there for sure what about so this is like nobody

3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:28.560
 seems to agree with me on this but like this connects to soccer again and messy it seems that

3:19:28.560 --> 3:19:37.040
 people value like how long you've been a champion how many like defenses of the championship that

3:19:37.040 --> 3:19:46.240
 you've had successfully to me I highly value singular moments of genius so like like I don't

3:19:46.240 --> 3:19:51.360
 like if you look at Conor McGregor he hasn't I guess held I've been a champion very long very

3:19:51.360 --> 3:19:56.080
 much he didn't defend either title right he didn't defend any other either of the titles

3:19:56.080 --> 3:20:02.640
 but like if you're talking and same with messy if you look at uh Leonel messy there's just moments

3:20:02.640 --> 3:20:08.320
 of brilliance unlike any other in history for both Conor and messy and people don't seem to give

3:20:08.320 --> 3:20:13.600
 credits like well how many World Cups have you on but to me like why is it about this arbitrary

3:20:13.600 --> 3:20:17.200
 World Cup thing or championship thing I think it's easier for people to wrap their head around

3:20:17.200 --> 3:20:22.400
 right it's like the NFL Combine when was I mean yeah numbers it's something well again if I go and

3:20:22.400 --> 3:20:28.080
 if I pick Tom Brady in the first round you know and it works out they call me a genius if I pick

3:20:28.080 --> 3:20:32.400
 Tom Brady in the first round after his combine and it doesn't work out I get fired and I'm never

3:20:32.400 --> 3:20:37.360
 hired again I have to work work somewhere else but it's like I'm insulating myself from criticism

3:20:37.360 --> 3:20:42.080
 I think almost if I go by the numbers well he had more bench presses it's like how many times

3:20:42.080 --> 3:20:47.520
 have the guys that are like the super studs in the uh in the NFL Combine ever been on the greatest

3:20:47.520 --> 3:20:53.280
 players in the NFL history in NFL history like zero or close to zero and even if even if there's

3:20:53.280 --> 3:20:57.680
 some it's certainly not a one to one correlation so it's so funny though I think it's just like how

3:20:57.680 --> 3:21:02.800
 many how long how many days did he hold the title your title reign was x times longer that means

3:21:02.800 --> 3:21:06.640
 nothing so if we want to define greatest fighter ever like you said I think individual moments of

3:21:06.640 --> 3:21:10.720
 like you're like that was transcended that was different that was something else because people

3:21:10.720 --> 3:21:14.960
 can win or lose for any number of different reasons and that it's an interesting thing again I don't

3:21:14.960 --> 3:21:21.120
 blame Argentina not winning the World Cup on Messi you know that's not fair you know how many

3:21:21.120 --> 3:21:26.560
 times is you know I mean I'll use the I remember when Trent Ilfer was the quarterback for the uh

3:21:26.560 --> 3:21:30.160
 the Baltimore Ravens and they had such a strong defense I'm not trying to pick on Trent Ilfer

3:21:30.160 --> 3:21:35.280
 but it's like they had such a strong defense that they were to make that was the Ray Lewis you know

3:21:35.280 --> 3:21:40.880
 Chris McAllister era you know and they they won they won the Super Bowl I don't think anyone is

3:21:40.880 --> 3:21:46.880
 going to say that you know Trent Dilfer's a better quarterback than you know or put him in the same

3:21:46.880 --> 3:21:52.320
 category as Dan Marino but he got the W he's got the he's got the Super Ring how many times let's

3:21:52.320 --> 3:21:56.320
 use March Mantis or Super Bowl I love it like that that guy always makes the finals but he just never

3:21:56.320 --> 3:22:00.720
 gets it done yeah so let me get this straight get into the finals nine times doesn't count because

3:22:00.720 --> 3:22:05.040
 you didn't win the end game I'm not saying it wouldn't be better but that guy won the game once he

3:22:05.040 --> 3:22:09.600
 got over the hump well how many other times was he in the finals zero you're like all right yeah

3:22:09.600 --> 3:22:15.360
 it's interesting well we yeah that we were obsessed with these numbers like um well because we can't

3:22:15.360 --> 3:22:19.280
 assess their method right well I think most of the time most of us can't assess the method of

3:22:19.280 --> 3:22:23.200
 anything it's like oh look at that guy do x y swimming I'm like how do I know Michael Phelps

3:22:23.200 --> 3:22:27.600
 is great I don't know he was faster I can't look at his technique and say anything other than

3:22:27.600 --> 3:22:31.360
 well that's way better than anything I know how to do but I can't say the difference between him

3:22:31.360 --> 3:22:36.560
 and the next guy so I guess that's I wonder if it's like I need a concrete identifier and a lot of

3:22:36.560 --> 3:22:40.880
 times people don't like saying I don't know and most people won't put like Aranda Rousey in the top

3:22:40.880 --> 3:22:48.960
 even 20 or 50 of but like she changed more than more than almost anybody else she changed the

3:22:50.000 --> 3:22:55.360
 martial arts history I don't know if that even I don't think I'm over exaggerating that she

3:22:55.360 --> 3:23:04.800
 she she made it okay for women to be fighters yeah and it and like changed the way we see

3:23:05.360 --> 3:23:11.360
 like she's one of the great feminists of our time in her own way yeah in you know in a weird

3:23:11.360 --> 3:23:17.680
 kind of way that like I don't know uh maybe I'm just a Aranda Rousey fan but the yeah the but

3:23:17.680 --> 3:23:21.120
 she's not in the conversation because then you start converting into numbers well how many

3:23:21.120 --> 3:23:25.600
 did she is she among the greatest fighters or did she do the greatest things you know I mean I

3:23:25.600 --> 3:23:30.240
 don't I think it's something I mean obviously Aranda is a great judoka who was competing in

3:23:30.240 --> 3:23:34.240
 MMA at a time when a lot of the girls like where did you get your skills in the olympics

3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:38.000
 how would you get yours high school you're like yeah you're gonna olympic girls gonna beat you up

3:23:38.000 --> 3:23:43.120
 but uh I I guess that that doesn't diminish her just that accomplishment is what it is I don't

3:23:43.120 --> 3:23:48.560
 have to I don't fade or is not diminished by the fact that he would like if he were to fight

3:23:48.560 --> 3:23:52.800
 steep and meoches right now it probably wouldn't go great or that John Jones exists I don't now

3:23:52.800 --> 3:23:58.000
 have to like knock fade or his accomplishments down or say oh because BJ Penn or someone so let's say

3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:02.000
 has a mixed record at this point that somehow invalidates the things that they've done before

3:24:02.560 --> 3:24:06.000
 I guess it kind of brings us back to a lot of the other people we've talked about the fact that

3:24:06.000 --> 3:24:09.520
 the the brilliant people throughout history that we love or some of the monsters throughout history

3:24:09.520 --> 3:24:14.480
 that we rightly revile in a lot of cases were complicated people and their legacy is more

3:24:14.480 --> 3:24:18.240
 than just one thing and someone doing something amazing doesn't involve doesn't mean they didn't

3:24:18.240 --> 3:24:23.280
 do anything bad and someone doing terrible things doesn't doesn't mean that doesn't invalidate the

3:24:23.280 --> 3:24:28.960
 positives that they did but I guess we're fighting the urge to put people in one category and same

3:24:28.960 --> 3:24:33.600
 with ourselves I think that's why people get depressed oh I'm good right now oh I'm bad right

3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:37.920
 now versus hey we're all of work in progress and we're trying to do x number of things and legacy

3:24:37.920 --> 3:24:44.320
 is a tough thing to figure out anyway and it's all speculative last time or no on reddit you said

3:24:44.320 --> 3:24:51.680
 that last time too that you don't experience much fear before fights I'd like to ask you a

3:24:51.680 --> 3:24:55.840
 couple Mike Tyson things if it's okay it's just interesting to me maybe I'm just weird so there's

3:24:55.840 --> 3:25:02.720
 a I don't know if you've seen this clip of Tyson talking about how he feels leading up to a fight

3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:09.520
 that he's kind of overtaken with fear as he gets closer and closer and closer to the ring

3:25:09.520 --> 3:25:18.080
 as confidence grows have you seen the clip I'm aware of it okay it's in a while here let me play

3:25:18.080 --> 3:25:23.680
 it for you I think George St. Pierce it's something similar to me one time while I'm in the dressing

3:25:23.680 --> 3:25:29.520
 room five minutes before I come out my gloves are laced up I'm breaking my glove down I'm

3:25:29.520 --> 3:25:33.360
 pushing the level of the back of my leg breaking the middle of the glove for my knuckle pierced

3:25:33.360 --> 3:25:38.000
 through the left I feel my knuckle piercing against the tight leather gloves on the last

3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:43.760
 buckling when I come out I have supreme confidence I'm scared to death I'm totally afraid I'm afraid

3:25:43.760 --> 3:25:48.800
 of everything I'm afraid of I'm afraid of being humiliated but I'm totally confident close I get

3:25:48.800 --> 3:25:54.640
 to a ring more confidence I get closer more confidence I get closer more confidence I get

3:25:54.640 --> 3:25:58.640
 all during my training I've been afraid of this man I thought this man might be capable of beating

3:25:58.640 --> 3:26:05.040
 me I've dreamed of him beating me but I always stayed afraid of him but it was close I get to

3:26:05.040 --> 3:26:10.640
 tell me I'm more confident once I'm in the ring I'm a god no one could beat me I'm a god I mean

3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:17.440
 first of all he's cognizant of both his demons and whatever the hell ideas he has about violence

3:26:17.440 --> 3:26:24.400
 is so interesting is there something about the the tension that he's describing about being

3:26:24.400 --> 3:26:30.640
 confident and scared that resonates with you or do you hold to this idea that you've kind of

3:26:30.640 --> 3:26:36.160
 spoken about before that you're really not afraid no I can I can appreciate what he's saying you

3:26:36.160 --> 3:26:41.840
 know I think that you know I can speak to feeling like concerned about let's say for instance if

3:26:41.840 --> 3:26:48.000
 you feel a certain way I think people are a lot more like computers than we like to admit

3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:53.120
 and just because a lot of times I can't parse what's going on and why doesn't mean that it's not

3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:58.560
 it doesn't make sense I see and and I think that at least in the times of like if I'm concerned

3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:03.920
 about a situation or about a person or about something happening prior to the fight or I'm

3:27:03.920 --> 3:27:07.680
 like there's a reason there there was a reason I don't have to push that down and bury it there's

3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:12.240
 a reason like why what have I not thought about what have I not done what am I missing why am I

3:27:12.240 --> 3:27:16.880
 feeling this way as you mentioned you know for yourself prior like you'd be like why am I feeling

3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:20.240
 like this I don't do this very well in certain aspects of my life if I'm not that I mentioned

3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:24.480
 it or not I think about it but when it comes to competing I think I do an all right job and I'm

3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:28.960
 trying to learn to be better and it's uh and going like well why do I if I feel this way

3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:33.200
 there's a reason okay am I thinking about this the wrong way have I not adequately prepared for

3:27:33.200 --> 3:27:37.680
 something I have to I have to address it and then maybe I'll be up for four hours that night you

3:27:37.680 --> 3:27:41.600
 know like extra hours thinking like one if I not address watching sparring watching this watching

3:27:41.600 --> 3:27:48.640
 that and then that when I when I am thinking about things more more accurately or when I've

3:27:48.640 --> 3:27:54.640
 addressed what that concern was I feel any of that concern kind of dissipate and I guess uh

3:27:55.280 --> 3:28:00.160
 if I honestly thought that you know I guess when it comes I know I'm gonna die at a certain point

3:28:00.160 --> 3:28:06.400
 obviously I'm gonna get hurt I mean you know pain happens but the pain of loss would be nothing

3:28:06.400 --> 3:28:11.040
 compared to the or the pain of injury be nothing compared to the pain of of running away you know

3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:18.640
 and yeah and so I guess if I think about it where's my value what it's like I feel like I'm a winner

3:28:18.640 --> 3:28:22.400
 every single time I step into that ring and fight with everything that I have I can't promise that

3:28:22.400 --> 3:28:27.120
 I'll win my next fight I know that I have the skills and the tools to beat anyone in grappling or

3:28:27.120 --> 3:28:33.040
 in mixed martial arts at this point it's just I I know that for certain I've trained with enough

3:28:33.040 --> 3:28:37.440
 people I compete with enough people I know I know where I stand but I also know that I'm not perfect

3:28:37.440 --> 3:28:43.600
 and also the the better fighter even if I perceive that I was that thing doesn't win on the night the

3:28:43.600 --> 3:28:50.400
 the man who fights better wins on the night and if I give credence in my mind to only the person

3:28:50.400 --> 3:28:56.000
 that's that's one has value versus going what's your process what's your path through this how

3:28:56.000 --> 3:29:01.440
 are you going about this how are you thinking about this how are you behaving then if I can

3:29:01.440 --> 3:29:06.080
 focus on the process then then I will respect my opponent and I will respect myself and I'll

3:29:06.080 --> 3:29:13.120
 respect anyone that behaves with with a certain level of consistency to that and they could win

3:29:13.120 --> 3:29:17.360
 there's plenty of winners in history that that are shit bags and there's plenty of losers that are

3:29:17.360 --> 3:29:22.400
 not but winning doesn't make you a bad or good person and losing doesn't make you good by the

3:29:22.400 --> 3:29:26.960
 fault either or bad by the fault so and I think that that can be the truth socially that can be

3:29:26.960 --> 3:29:32.640
 the truth you know athletically and you know academically so I guess is there a primal fear

3:29:32.640 --> 3:29:43.680
 though like a primal fear of getting hurt the running away and not facing the the threat

3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:48.240
 long term is the bigger pain than any pain you can experience in the fight

3:29:49.840 --> 3:29:54.080
 that's pretty powerful but what about the violence of I mean you don't have that on your face but

3:29:54.080 --> 3:29:59.920
 like the I don't know if you've also seen Tyson talk about he was on Rogan recently he was talking about

3:29:59.920 --> 3:30:09.600
 how he was trying to psychoanalyze himself about why he enjoys violence so much I mean he called it

3:30:10.480 --> 3:30:16.480
 orgasmic I don't know have you seen that clip I haven't okay we're playing we're playing it

3:30:16.480 --> 3:30:20.880
 because I can I need to because Trump also retweeted it which is hilarious I don't know

3:30:20.880 --> 3:30:27.520
 how to contextualize yeah that's that our president retweeted the clip of uh of yeah let's say

3:30:27.520 --> 3:30:31.520
 of Tyson saying that's just maybe he's just doing like they're not gonna it's like I'm gonna throw

3:30:31.520 --> 3:30:35.840
 him a curveball no one's gonna have any idea what that but yeah he did no explanation just here you

3:30:35.840 --> 3:30:40.320
 go there you go well I think that's kind of like what you're describing it's like if I give you an

3:30:40.320 --> 3:30:45.200
 answer it has to be a good one better to just let your imagination run exactly yeah he's yeah he's

3:30:45.200 --> 3:30:57.200
 like the Kubrick of our time no it's really interesting that sometimes um period it's not real but

3:30:57.200 --> 3:31:02.160
 sometimes I struggle with the fact of why is the possibility I can really hurt somebody like you

3:31:02.160 --> 3:31:08.640
 don't want to hurt them what do you mean but you struggle struggle with the possibility that you

3:31:08.640 --> 3:31:18.960
 could hurt them that is sometimes it's orgasmic sometimes hmm yeah like some fights like particular

3:31:18.960 --> 3:31:24.800
 like Tyrell Biggs or someone that you had problems with someone that you Joe's not getting you had

3:31:24.800 --> 3:31:34.400
 animosity towards so when you finally get your hands on them hey um what does it mean um when

3:31:34.400 --> 3:31:40.400
 fighting gets you get you erect what does that mean it's a good question means you're getting

3:31:40.400 --> 3:31:46.960
 excited yeah so that that's going through your mind right now well that's how I get when I was a

3:31:46.960 --> 3:31:52.720
 kid and I you know sometimes I get the twinkle the twinkle yeah well that's what I'm saying it's

3:31:52.720 --> 3:31:59.520
 like you reached a state as a human being as a champion as a ferocious fighter you reached a state

3:31:59.520 --> 3:32:06.320
 of of ability and of accomplishment that very few humans will ever ever touch and feel that's

3:32:06.320 --> 3:32:11.120
 why I'm asking you when you're running when you're hitting the bag when that heart's beating again

3:32:11.120 --> 3:32:16.080
 and that you know who you are your mic motherfucking Tyson so when you're doing all this shit again

3:32:16.080 --> 3:32:21.360
 you're still Mike Tyson those thoughts have got to be burning inside you again it's got to be pretty

3:32:21.360 --> 3:32:31.440
 wild I don't know it's um it's wild but I'm I believe it's um it's rightfully so to be that way

3:32:31.440 --> 3:32:36.880
 and I just know how to um I don't think I'm mastered but I just know how to deal with it I don't let

3:32:36.880 --> 3:32:45.760
 it overwhelm me I mean he goes on to try to they don't ever like Joe doesn't bite well the interesting

3:32:45.760 --> 3:32:52.720
 thing about that conversation is Mike was trying to figure himself out yeah like he's trying on

3:32:52.720 --> 3:33:04.400
 the spot like why do I feel this way uh is to me it was like to me it's so real and honest to uh

3:33:05.280 --> 3:33:14.880
 to feel like pleasure from hurting somebody like that you rarely hear that in this society

3:33:14.880 --> 3:33:24.240
 it's like you rarely like talk about like you feel pleasure from winning you feel pleasure from like

3:33:25.120 --> 3:33:31.600
 the relief of overcoming like all the stress you have to go through pleasure from

3:33:32.880 --> 3:33:38.720
 just like the specifics of the fight the techniques he used the maybe overcoming being down a couple

3:33:38.720 --> 3:33:45.440
 rounds but like how often do you hear somebody say I just enjoyed he's not even saying because

3:33:45.440 --> 3:33:52.960
 I hate the opponent he's saying like I enjoyed purely the violence of it that's crazy I mean I

3:33:52.960 --> 3:33:59.760
 don't know it's honest it it made me ask like I wonder how many of us are cognizant of that

3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:07.840
 I'd say Mike is uncommonly seemingly uh honest I think athletes make a full time job out of lying

3:34:07.840 --> 3:34:14.080
 you know I think people make a full time job that's fair I mean in some you tell yourself

3:34:14.080 --> 3:34:18.400
 or you tell others what you feel you need to or maybe whether you even know what you feel you

3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:24.480
 need to but why should he not I mean again did he did he run up and just hit somebody that's

3:34:25.120 --> 3:34:30.720
 didn't sign up for this no they they sign up to be there well that's the interesting thing

3:34:30.720 --> 3:34:38.880
 about Dyson is there's that weird uh like nonstandard behavior I mean like your fighting style is

3:34:38.880 --> 3:34:47.040
 nonstandard he's nonstandard to another degree of like uh who else has that in jiu jitsu uh uh

3:34:47.040 --> 3:34:57.040
 Polaris has this kind of weirdness like what's what's in there like there's a fear that I think

3:34:57.040 --> 3:35:04.000
 uh most opponents would have because it's like it's no longer about like it takes you out of the

3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:11.120
 realm of its game it takes us back to the thing we were talking about like before is it strips away

3:35:11.120 --> 3:35:18.080
 that like several layers of Ryan Hall the the podcast uh guest Ryan Hall the jiu jitsu instructor

3:35:18.080 --> 3:35:23.280
 Ryan Hall the jitsu competitor he keeps going down to a point where like Ryan Hall the murderer

3:35:23.280 --> 3:35:29.520
 of all things that get in his way that lies underneath all of it seemingly like if we're

3:35:29.520 --> 3:35:34.640
 like in this society we put all that aside but it makes you wonder like now society's

3:35:34.640 --> 3:35:40.640
 being tested in in many ways it makes you wonder like what's underneath there well do we want do

3:35:40.640 --> 3:35:44.240
 we want the answer to that because I guess it's what is it uh you seen Paul fiction you know the

3:35:44.240 --> 3:35:48.480
 best character in the movie and in the best scene in the movie is like if my questions

3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:52.160
 here if you're what he called it my answer is scary you should cease asking scary questions

3:35:52.160 --> 3:35:56.960
 you know and I guess uh you wonder I mean all of us that's something that I think it's funny

3:35:56.960 --> 3:36:03.600
 we call that's not okay I mean versus maybe not appropriate for situation x y or z but uh

3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:08.160
 what should make any of us think I mean humanity is a different place now and I'm not saying

3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:12.720
 anything crazy out there but it can manage a different place now than we were 5 000 years ago

3:36:12.720 --> 3:36:17.920
 where all of us are descended from people who have killed things with their teeth and fingernails

3:36:17.920 --> 3:36:23.440
 in order to be where we are and whether it was in whether it was an animal or it was in conflict

3:36:23.440 --> 3:36:28.640
 with another person I mean think about that the chances of dying by violence now are so so slim

3:36:28.640 --> 3:36:33.760
 at least in in most countries in most places like shockingly small thankfully but there was a period

3:36:33.760 --> 3:36:39.600
 of time like the most period of time where dying by violence was mostly how it went down and I guess

3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:45.600
 what would be facilitative what would allow you to win back to Ender's game you know what allows you

3:36:45.600 --> 3:36:52.960
 you if you can't do that you are always you are forever subject to people who can and that's

3:36:52.960 --> 3:36:57.760
 that's a real thing and you know we're fortunate to find ourselves in a situation where we don't

3:36:57.760 --> 3:37:02.000
 where other things matter but that is a funny thing periodically where people you'll see people

3:37:02.000 --> 3:37:06.240
 like kind of jawing at each other like in videos or out in the world that clearly neither of them

3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:09.200
 expect this to get serious like I'm just going to yell at you you're going to yell at me and it's

3:37:09.200 --> 3:37:13.280
 like this weird larping thing we're both going to go on in a separate way all it takes is one

3:37:13.280 --> 3:37:17.600
 person to be like well I wasn't kidding yeah and it's like oh you'll go to jail I'm like oh I know

3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:23.280
 you're going to go to the morgue and it's that's but that can happen like that like society I mean

3:37:23.280 --> 3:37:27.200
 obviously anyway you could jump across the table stab me in the eye I mean I appreciate I'd hope if

3:37:27.200 --> 3:37:32.320
 you don't and there will be consequences if you do but not from not from me from from the rest of

3:37:32.320 --> 3:37:37.360
 society will potentially get you at a certain point but you can decide to not play by the rules

3:37:37.360 --> 3:37:42.640
 anytime you want and it's fascinating that yeah that's we've created rules based on which we all

3:37:42.640 --> 3:37:49.360
 behave but underneath there you know there there's things that doesn't the there's motivations and

3:37:49.360 --> 3:37:55.200
 forces that don't play by the rules and still there nature's metal is under the surface seriously

3:37:55.200 --> 3:37:59.840
 and again I pull out my phone and I'm basically saying like hey I'm gonna you're gonna get caught

3:37:59.840 --> 3:38:04.000
 yeah but really I'm further antagonizing you rightly or wrongly you know what I mean like

3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:08.080
 and that that's an interesting thing and I feel like just people need to remember any of us need

3:38:08.080 --> 3:38:14.880
 to remember just for any reason just that's that's one step away at all at all times you ever I've

3:38:14.880 --> 3:38:19.120
 had people say to me before like oh I don't feel safe I'm like you're not safe I kill you before

3:38:19.120 --> 3:38:24.000
 you get out of this room nothing you do stop that nothing I mean but don't worry you can do the same

3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:28.160
 to me which means I'm like oh oh thank goodness can you imagine like how many guns are there are in

3:38:28.160 --> 3:38:33.600
 this country like I mean everywhere I mean seriously everywhere but that's a heartening thought not the

3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:36.880
 other way because people usually freak out and go oh my god gun violence gun violence is a gun

3:38:36.880 --> 3:38:41.520
 violence is like really not a serious issue in the United States compared to what it could be

3:38:41.520 --> 3:38:46.240
 because it means that I mean with the amount of guns and the amount of bullets that are out there

3:38:46.240 --> 3:38:52.480
 that are in circulation can you imagine if like one in every thousand was used in anger each day

3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:56.560
 I mean this would be a terrifying place to live you couldn't go anywhere so I mean although you

3:38:56.560 --> 3:39:00.800
 could say hey this is more than we'd like or x y z it actually means that people are much more

3:39:00.800 --> 3:39:06.240
 reasonable and sane than than we're saying then or then I then sometimes I might I might argue so I

3:39:06.240 --> 3:39:10.560
 guess what I mean is like oh man I walked to 7 11 and I didn't get stabbed I'm like oh well that's

3:39:10.560 --> 3:39:15.760
 good because not because I protected myself with my karate it's basically no one decided to run over

3:39:15.760 --> 3:39:20.240
 and stab me because I wasn't protecting myself it's like they they stopped so I guess we're all

3:39:20.240 --> 3:39:25.280
 fortunate to live in a society that that like you said nature being metal doesn't become that big of

3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:29.200
 an issue all the time but it is funny when you get people in the ring and you go hey let's peel back

3:39:29.200 --> 3:39:36.320
 from mr. Tyson many layers of that and say hey now it's okay and it's cool that I mean that's what

3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:43.920
 society is doing so I've lived in Harvard Square for a while and we add extra layers of what safe

3:39:43.920 --> 3:39:51.440
 means like now there's a discourse about safe spaces about like ideas being violence or or like

3:39:51.440 --> 3:39:59.280
 uh you know like yeah but the ideas or minor slights against your personality being violence

3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:05.520
 but that's all like extra layers around the nature is metal thing that uh it's cool that's

3:40:05.520 --> 3:40:12.480
 that's what progress is but we can't forget that like underneath it is still it's still the the

3:40:12.480 --> 3:40:19.680
 thing that will murder at the at the drop of uh in any at any moment if uh if aroused one thing

3:40:19.680 --> 3:40:24.880
 that I find funny though or ironic maybe about the uh the you know words of violence you know

3:40:24.880 --> 3:40:31.680
 offenses violence thing is that of course that if that the belief in that then justifies my violence

3:40:32.320 --> 3:40:37.440
 like my and whether maybe my maybe not physical violence but my response to my my aggressive

3:40:37.440 --> 3:40:42.560
 response to things and I guess like which again be grets be gets a further aggressive response

3:40:42.560 --> 3:40:48.000
 and like a you know kind of a tit for tat sort of situation or or it goes to like well there's 10

3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:52.080
 of me and there's one of you so we'll get you and you can't do anything about it but that's not

3:40:52.080 --> 3:40:56.480
 morality that's that's just saying that's might makes right so I guess again you can understand

3:40:56.480 --> 3:41:01.760
 why people do it and there are certain there is a progress aspect to it but again I guess without

3:41:01.760 --> 3:41:07.120
 proper examination I'm effectively with my 10 friends you know and and the force of the law

3:41:07.120 --> 3:41:12.320
 Mike Tysoning people but not admitting to myself what I'm doing and at least Mike Tyson again is

3:41:12.320 --> 3:41:20.160
 honest are you uh afraid of death I mean it's easy for me to say no as I sit here probably not about

3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:25.600
 to die but is this the UFC question can you defeat any opponent exactly the answer is of

3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:30.480
 course yes and uh I don't have they're not around they're not here are they yeah exactly but uh I

3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:35.440
 mean are you uh do you ponder your own mortality maybe another context to that is you mentioned

3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:41.440
 two deaths for martial artists I think that's actually why honestly even though it had a

3:41:41.440 --> 3:41:46.080
 relatively young age I think mortality is something that I'm aware of more maybe more than the average

3:41:46.080 --> 3:41:50.240
 person I think probably most athletes can speak to this and anyone that's had for a while I've

3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:55.360
 managed to slide out of a couple near death experiences personally you know mostly river

3:41:55.360 --> 3:42:02.080
 related um because I'm an idiot but um I regret nothing but uh yeah yeah but uh thank god we're

3:42:02.080 --> 3:42:11.760
 but um yeah it is an interesting seeing the end and seeing going well what's gonna happen I guess I

3:42:11.760 --> 3:42:16.320
 think it comes back to kind of what we're discussing about belief structure and belief system I think a

3:42:16.320 --> 3:42:22.640
 lot of times if I recognize that no matter what I do it's all gonna end one day and then you go well

3:42:22.640 --> 3:42:28.480
 why were we here what would I do am I gonna make it to 40 I have no idea I'd like to hope so that

3:42:28.480 --> 3:42:33.680
 I had no idea that I was gonna make it to to the age that I am now um am I gonna make it to 80 how

3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:39.600
 much of that is in my control much of it is not I mean we it's so funny it's an interesting like

3:42:39.600 --> 3:42:44.480
 back to the belief structure again like locus of internal and external locus of control you know

3:42:44.480 --> 3:42:49.520
 what's facilitative versus what's true and you know I think accepting personal responsibility

3:42:49.520 --> 3:42:55.680
 for more than is on my control is is probably a positive but at the same time recognizing that

3:42:55.680 --> 3:43:00.880
 much of much is not in my control I was fortunate enough to be born in the United States fortunate

3:43:00.880 --> 3:43:05.920
 enough to you know to not to knock on wood have have a serious disease that I'm not aware of right

3:43:05.920 --> 3:43:12.640
 now um I didn't do any of that I just showed up that was really fortunate and I I guess that doesn't

3:43:12.640 --> 3:43:18.960
 diminish the fact that I've tried to make decent choices but it works in concert with it and I I

3:43:18.960 --> 3:43:26.720
 guess um when I when you go is death what I want right now no no I should think not and again it's

3:43:26.720 --> 3:43:33.200
 easier me to be relatively calm about it as I'm not staring it in the face but what I would care

3:43:33.200 --> 3:43:38.800
 a lot more about is is how you live that's what's in my control and I can't control if as I walk

3:43:38.800 --> 3:43:43.120
 out of this building a helicopter falls on me worrying about that I can't control maybe I

3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:48.160
 maybe I have cancer now and I don't know it and I really hope not but um there's something about

3:43:48.160 --> 3:43:54.000
 meditating on the fact that it could end today outside of your control they can clarify your

3:43:54.000 --> 3:44:00.240
 thinking about yeah the the fact that life is amazing like just kind of something yeah helping

3:44:00.240 --> 3:44:04.880
 you enjoy this moment even if life was horrible let's say for instance it was it was you live at

3:44:04.880 --> 3:44:09.200
 one of those times or places and this place is still existing in this world today that life

3:44:09.200 --> 3:44:16.160
 is brutal and metal and whatever all and short and painful would you still want it and again

3:44:16.160 --> 3:44:21.680
 as I'm sitting here not not on fire physically it's easy to say yes but I would I'm confident I

3:44:21.680 --> 3:44:27.280
 still I'll plant my feet and say yes any of life any life is amazing and beautiful and and a gift

3:44:27.280 --> 3:44:32.240
 an unbelievable gift uh that none of us have earned for the record and we're I hate the word

3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:36.240
 earned a lot of times earned yeah you earned but it's like there's a lot of a lot of good fortune

3:44:36.240 --> 3:44:42.400
 and earning and that's back to do I want justice or do I want grace and I guess we're all fortunate

3:44:42.400 --> 3:44:47.040
 to be where we are no matter where we are and hopefully it should give us some sense of perspective

3:44:47.040 --> 3:44:51.760
 some sense of compassion for other people but also like like you said a sense of peace if it all

3:44:51.760 --> 3:44:57.920
 ended right now would I be happy with what I with life to this point of course would you like to live

3:44:57.920 --> 3:45:03.120
 a little longer yeah I would try to do more and try to live rightly to the best that I know how

3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:08.880
 which over time will hopefully continue to evolve in a positive direction but if the answer to that

3:45:08.880 --> 3:45:15.360
 is no I I guess that's that's always that's a sign that that what I'm doing is not what I'm

3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:20.640
 meant to be doing and I'm you're familiar with the Tecumseh before so there's a I've got one

3:45:20.640 --> 3:45:25.920
 actually if you could give me 10 seconds I'll read this one out this is a personal favorite

3:45:25.920 --> 3:45:29.840
 basically and I think it sums up I mean again I it's one of those quotes on the internet like

3:45:29.840 --> 3:45:35.840
 when Abraham Lincoln said don't believe everything you read online but uh this is you know it's

3:45:35.840 --> 3:45:39.920
 again uh attributed but it's like so live your life that the fear of death can never enter your

3:45:39.920 --> 3:45:44.720
 heart trouble no one about their religion respect others in their view and demand that they respect

3:45:44.720 --> 3:45:50.720
 yours love your life perfect your life beautify all things in your life seek to make your life long
