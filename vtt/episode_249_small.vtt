00:00.000 --> 00:04.600
 The following is a conversation with Albert Burla, CEO of Pfizer.

00:04.600 --> 00:09.840
 If you'd like to skip ahead to our conversation, the timestamps as always are below.

00:09.840 --> 00:15.520
 But if not, please allow me to say a few words about truth and human nature.

00:15.520 --> 00:21.880
 Specifically, about two groups of people throughout history that seek to lay claim to the truth.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.760
 The first group will tell you that only they possess the truth,

00:25.760 --> 00:32.800
 that the government will save you, the company will save you, the science, the authorities, the experts, the institutions will save you.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.320
 The second group, too, will tell you that only they possess the truth,

00:37.320 --> 00:40.440
 that the government will hurt you, the company will hurt you,

00:40.440 --> 00:44.520
 the science, the authorities, the experts, the institutions will hurt you.

00:44.520 --> 00:50.680
 Both groups have the benevolent and the malevolent, their heroes and their charlatans.

00:50.680 --> 00:57.720
 And I think the hard truth is that no one in this world can tell you with absolute certainty which is which.

00:57.720 --> 00:59.600
 You have to use your mind.

00:59.600 --> 01:03.760
 This is the burden of being human, of being free.

01:03.760 --> 01:11.400
 Don't blindly follow any leader, neither the emperor nor the martyr who points out that the emperor has no clothes.

01:11.400 --> 01:14.680
 And then there's the lessons of history.

01:14.680 --> 01:19.360
 Vaccines have saved hundreds of millions of lives in the past century.

01:19.360 --> 01:23.280
 And in general, the advance of medicine has saved billions of lives.

01:23.280 --> 01:28.280
 If you ignore the power of science, you're not being honest with the lessons of history.

01:28.280 --> 01:33.000
 And if you ignore the corrupting nature of power and money within institutions,

01:33.000 --> 01:39.800
 including governments and companies that led to the suffering and death of hundreds of millions in the past century,

01:39.800 --> 01:45.000
 you are once again not being honest with the lessons of history.

01:45.000 --> 01:52.000
 I announced that I will be having this conversation with Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO, and a lot of people wrote to me.

01:52.000 --> 01:59.840
 I would like to say that I was and am and always will be listening and learning with an open mind from everyone.

01:59.840 --> 02:08.680
 My own opinion, worth little as it is, is that the development of the COVID vaccines is one of the greatest accomplishments of science and recent history.

02:08.680 --> 02:18.160
 For the rest, from safety and efficacy to policy and economics, I stand humbled before a complicated world full of fear and anger.

02:18.160 --> 02:24.720
 A small number of malicious people from all walks of life will use that fear and anger to divide us,

02:24.720 --> 02:29.040
 because the division makes them money and gives them power.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.200
 I took two shots of the Pfizer vaccine.

02:31.200 --> 02:32.760
 This was my decision.

02:32.760 --> 02:43.040
 I don't ever want to force this on anyone and I certainly don't want to dismiss your concerns or worse you as a person if you choose not to get vaccinated.

02:43.040 --> 02:52.440
 I can assure you one thing, in this conversation and in any conversation, the choice of questions I ask and words I say is mine and mine alone.

02:52.440 --> 03:00.240
 When my words fall short, as they often do, it is only because of the limitations of my mind and of my speaking ability.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.120
 It is not due to pressure or fear.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.160
 I'm not afraid of anyone.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.960
 I cannot be bought by anyone with money, power or fame.

03:08.960 --> 03:13.480
 I hope to prove this to you and to myself in the coming years.

03:13.480 --> 03:19.120
 This life is short and to me, without integrity, it is not worth living.

03:19.120 --> 03:22.680
 People sometimes talk down to me, call me naive.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.720
 Perhaps they are right, but it is who I am.

03:26.720 --> 03:32.480
 I think this life, this world, this, our human civilization is beautiful.

03:32.480 --> 03:37.520
 And as the Stieffsky said, beauty will save the world.

03:37.520 --> 03:43.760
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here's my conversation with Albert Burla.

03:43.760 --> 03:50.840
 The development of the COVID 19 vaccine was one of the greatest accomplishments of science in recent history,

03:50.840 --> 03:57.560
 no matter what, this should give people hope for the future and yet it is more a source of division.

03:57.560 --> 04:02.480
 I hope we can discuss both the inspiring and the difficult ideas in this conversation

04:02.480 --> 04:06.360
 so that we can do our small part in healing this division.

04:06.360 --> 04:07.680
 I hope so.

04:07.680 --> 04:14.800
 Take me through the day of November 8th, 2020, when the Pfizer team were waiting for the results of the Phase 3 clinical trials.

04:14.800 --> 04:20.360
 We had assembled in a very small office that we are having in Connecticut, very few people.

04:20.360 --> 04:28.600
 There were five, I think, and in another place, what we call the data monitoring committee,

04:28.600 --> 04:32.160
 which is a group of experts, independent experts there on Pfizer,

04:32.160 --> 04:36.840
 we're going to have the opportunity to unblind the data

04:36.840 --> 04:44.080
 and then tell us if the study needs to continue or if it is successful or if it fails.

04:44.080 --> 04:45.840
 And we were waiting for their call.

04:45.840 --> 04:53.240
 So the call came a little bit later than what we expected, which created a lot of anxiety to all of us,

04:53.240 --> 04:55.120
 but came around, I think, two o clock.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.520
 You're just sitting there waiting, what were you feeling?

04:57.520 --> 05:04.440
 Sitting there waiting and teasing one another, drinking coffee, making jokes.

05:04.440 --> 05:11.320
 So how did you feel like when you heard the results, the successful results?

05:11.320 --> 05:23.240
 Free, liberated, happy, like if a huge weight that was on my shoulders was lifted.

05:23.240 --> 05:27.760
 I heard you said, I love you to the team.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.480
 I did.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.960
 This is how we speak in Mediterranean.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.400
 Listen, maybe it's the Russian thing too.

05:35.400 --> 05:41.160
 I love love, so I appreciate that kind of celebration.

05:41.160 --> 05:48.000
 So looking back from that moment to before, how much did it cost to develop the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine?

05:48.000 --> 05:53.480
 What was it like making the decision to make that investment when the risk is very high

05:53.480 --> 05:56.160
 and you don't know if it's going to be successful?

05:56.160 --> 05:58.080
 You know, we do a lot of that anyway.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.800
 This is what we do in our daily work.

06:00.800 --> 06:05.800
 We are putting money, we are investing in research, which is highly risky.

06:05.800 --> 06:10.840
 The difference in that case was that we didn't risk at all, we put it all in.

06:10.840 --> 06:15.640
 We put everything in one go so that we don't lose time.

06:15.640 --> 06:20.360
 Usually we will spend 50 millions and then if that goes well, then we will spend another 50

06:20.360 --> 06:22.320
 and then if it goes well, then 100.

06:22.320 --> 06:28.800
 Here we put all together a little bit more than $2 billion, $2.3 billion.

06:28.800 --> 06:37.160
 And it was a significant decision, but it was a very easy decision to make

06:37.160 --> 06:39.760
 in the context of what we were living at that time.

06:39.760 --> 06:42.960
 It was a pandemic, people were scared, we were scared.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.360
 We didn't know how tomorrow would look like.

06:46.360 --> 06:54.360
 We were living unprecedented situations and we knew that we have capabilities that may help.

06:54.360 --> 06:57.600
 So there was not a second question or choice.

06:57.600 --> 06:59.160
 We go all in.

06:59.160 --> 07:08.080
 When you make decisions like that, you're the CEO of a company that needs to make money.

07:08.080 --> 07:12.720
 And that hopes to do a lot of good in the world.

07:12.720 --> 07:17.280
 How much of both of those things are part of the calculation?

07:17.280 --> 07:25.320
 So when you said it was an obvious choice, I think you've said a bunch of things of the kind

07:25.320 --> 07:31.320
 of saying we need to go all in, sort of very boldly diving in.

07:31.320 --> 07:39.600
 How much was that that the world is facing uncertainty and fear and potentially destructive

07:39.600 --> 07:41.000
 pandemic in the early days?

07:41.000 --> 07:45.320
 Just when you're seeing the full uncertainty before us, don't know how it's going to enroll.

07:45.320 --> 07:51.080
 And how much of it is this may also be a good financial decision to take this risk?

07:51.080 --> 07:56.880
 Yeah, I think about it all the time and I know very well that if you focus too much on making money,

07:56.880 --> 07:58.520
 you will never make.

07:58.520 --> 08:02.920
 You should focus in what is the real value driver.

08:02.920 --> 08:09.000
 And the real value driver, it is to make breakthroughs that change patients lives.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.520
 If you don't do that, you will never make money.

08:11.520 --> 08:13.600
 If you do that, don't wear.

08:13.600 --> 08:16.680
 Things will fall into place and also money will fall.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.080
 But the mentality of the company is to be how to help the patient.

08:20.080 --> 08:23.960
 And that's what the management was that the shareholders want, because that's the only

08:23.960 --> 08:26.480
 way that we can create value.

08:26.480 --> 08:32.640
 In this particular case, we're not thinking at all about what are we going to make when

08:32.640 --> 08:38.640
 we sell it or if we don't sell it, because what we were focusing 100% was how to bring

08:38.640 --> 08:45.000
 a solution to the world, but will help all of us change the way the fear that was bring

08:45.000 --> 08:46.800
 hope to the world.

08:46.800 --> 08:53.600
 And as always, when you do that, you will have good returns as well.

08:53.600 --> 08:58.760
 On a philosophical level, on a human level, do you ever worry that the pressure to cover

08:58.760 --> 09:05.560
 the costs that were invested to develop a new drug, to develop this vaccine harms your

09:05.560 --> 09:08.000
 ability to conduct unbiased studies?

09:08.000 --> 09:13.360
 Ah, not at all, because the studies are highly regulated.

09:13.360 --> 09:19.560
 Everybody knows what regulators, and when I say regulators, FDA, European authorities,

09:19.560 --> 09:24.080
 UK authorities, Israeli authorities, Japanese authorities, Canadian authorities, want to

09:24.080 --> 09:29.200
 see how the study needs to be conducted and what exactly they need to see to approve it

09:29.200 --> 09:30.480
 or not.

09:30.480 --> 09:36.120
 So clearly, everybody takes into consideration how much money I'm going to invest and what

09:36.120 --> 09:39.160
 is the chances that I'm going to lose them.

09:39.160 --> 09:44.840
 But what you can do is to change the rules of the game so that you won't lose the money.

09:44.840 --> 09:51.080
 There are very well established methodologies that would say, with very high precision,

09:51.080 --> 09:54.920
 if your medicine is effective, if your medicine is safe.

09:54.920 --> 09:59.880
 And those are there for all and all playing with these emeralds.

09:59.880 --> 10:07.000
 Do you have an intuition about why is the FDA trying to get 75 years to release the

10:07.000 --> 10:08.000
 Pfizer data?

10:08.000 --> 10:12.600
 They're trying to request that it will not be released for 75 years.

10:12.600 --> 10:18.760
 And then maybe the broader version of that question is, do you think people should have

10:18.760 --> 10:24.400
 sort of full transparency and immediate access to the data, immediate, you know, on the scale

10:24.400 --> 10:27.320
 of weeks, not years?

10:27.320 --> 10:32.360
 I think the relations with regulators, they have been always very transparent, and there

10:32.360 --> 10:42.440
 are a lot of laws that they are forcing regulators and companies to put out there, their interactions

10:42.440 --> 10:44.880
 and what exactly was discussed.

10:44.880 --> 10:52.160
 Now to go into specific details of some discussions, I don't know what is the reason that FDA

10:52.160 --> 10:55.960
 wants to take the time, but I'm sure they have very good reasons.

10:55.960 --> 10:59.960
 Well, let me just say my side of it.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.920
 It doesn't look like a good reason.

11:01.920 --> 11:04.760
 It looks like maybe it's because I come from the Soviet Union.

11:04.760 --> 11:11.680
 Now, this is not you saying this, this is me saying this, is there seems to be a bureaucracy

11:11.680 --> 11:13.560
 that gets in the way of transparency.

11:13.560 --> 11:15.400
 That's always the challenge with government.

11:15.400 --> 11:19.680
 So government is very good at setting rules and making sure there's oversight of companies

11:19.680 --> 11:21.480
 and people and so on.

11:21.480 --> 11:26.520
 But they create, they slow things down, which is a feature and a bug.

11:26.520 --> 11:31.560
 And in this case, they slow down so much, I think the reason they set it at 75 years

11:31.560 --> 11:37.640
 is because they set a rate of being able to only review 500 pages of data a day or something

11:37.640 --> 11:38.640
 like that.

11:38.640 --> 11:43.480
 And it's a very kind of bureaucratic thing where in reality, you could just show the

11:43.480 --> 11:47.800
 data and it's not like something is being hidden.

11:47.800 --> 11:53.080
 But in a battle to win people's trust, to inspire them with science, it feels like transparency

11:53.080 --> 11:57.440
 is one of the most beautiful things, one of the most powerful things that the FDA has.

11:57.440 --> 12:02.800
 FDA has the potential to be one of the great institutions of our country.

12:02.800 --> 12:06.440
 And this is one example that it feels to me like a failure.

12:06.440 --> 12:10.320
 So in your perspective, you're saying, I'm sure they have a good reason.

12:10.320 --> 12:17.640
 So do you, the FDA, is this black box that you submit things to once they approve?

12:17.640 --> 12:21.400
 You know that those are the rules, it's approved.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.400
 That's it.

12:22.400 --> 12:24.560
 But this is not a black box.

12:24.560 --> 12:28.640
 We know very well what is the process.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.160
 Everybody knows very well what are the processes.

12:31.160 --> 12:35.880
 The review process also, it is very detailed.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.480
 They have scientists of very, very high caliber.

12:38.480 --> 12:45.160
 Not every regulator in the world, but the Europeans, the Breeds, the FDA clearly, they

12:45.160 --> 12:50.200
 have very, very high caliber of scientists that they are going into a lot of details.

12:50.200 --> 13:00.000
 And also, basically everything for a study is really released by law in the specifications

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
 of the product.

13:01.000 --> 13:05.360
 But it's a very detailed document that it is issue and has basically the essence of

13:05.360 --> 13:06.840
 everything was discussed.

13:06.840 --> 13:13.280
 I don't know about specific documents if take them time to release, but clearly this is

13:13.280 --> 13:16.000
 not a black box type of process.

13:16.000 --> 13:21.360
 A lot of this stuff is, how do you effectively communicate to the world about the incredible

13:21.360 --> 13:24.240
 science that's been done, about the processes that were followed?

13:24.240 --> 13:25.760
 I agree with you.

13:25.760 --> 13:29.640
 And sometimes it's just in eloquence in communication.

13:29.640 --> 13:34.840
 It's not that there's a failure process, it's in eloquence communication and silence.

13:34.840 --> 13:40.240
 It's in the moment when clearly a lot of people are bothered and have questions.

13:40.240 --> 13:47.800
 This is when you speak out and you explain exactly why as opposed to letting this distrust

13:47.800 --> 13:50.360
 build up and linger.

13:50.360 --> 13:56.760
 Because the result is there's a very large percent of the population that just, I mean,

13:56.760 --> 14:01.440
 it divides people and science suffers, I think.

14:01.440 --> 14:08.520
 And also the effectiveness of solutions suffers, like the vaccine and so on.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.640
 I asked a few folks, I know, if they had challenging questions for you.

14:12.640 --> 14:16.400
 I'm sure many of them answer your call.

14:16.400 --> 14:20.680
 Well, yeah, yeah, you know, many friendly folks out there.

14:20.680 --> 14:26.120
 By the way, I'm sweating not because this is a difficult conversation, it is, but it's

14:26.120 --> 14:29.680
 also hot in here for the record.

14:29.680 --> 14:33.120
 So one of the folks is Mr. Jordan Peterson.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.480
 I don't know if you know who that is.

14:35.480 --> 14:38.520
 He's a psychologist and intellectual and author.

14:38.520 --> 14:42.640
 He suggested to me that I raise the concern that there's a close working relationship

14:42.640 --> 14:45.800
 between Pfizer, FDA and CDC.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.880
 So we talked about FDA.

14:48.880 --> 14:55.240
 Do you worry that this affects both positive and negative, Pfizer's chances of getting

14:55.240 --> 14:56.560
 drugs approved?

14:56.560 --> 15:01.280
 The fact that there's people that worked at the FDA that now work at Pfizer, Pfizer,

15:01.280 --> 15:04.280
 FDA, that there's a kind of pipeline.

15:04.280 --> 15:12.680
 Does this worry you that it affects your ability to do great unbiased work?

15:12.680 --> 15:21.360
 I have zero doubts that this is not affecting at all their ability to be unbiased and regulate.

15:21.360 --> 15:27.880
 But in order to, for the system also reinforces that by creating significant time barriers,

15:27.880 --> 15:33.720
 if someone moves from an industry to FDA, she won't be able to deal with topics for a

15:33.720 --> 15:34.720
 period of time.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.400
 And then for even an enhanced period of time with topics that are related with the company

15:38.400 --> 15:40.800
 he or she may come from.

15:40.800 --> 15:48.480
 I think these regulators, they are really very strict, rightly so.

15:48.480 --> 15:55.360
 If anything, I feel sometimes that maybe they should be a little bit more open minded, particularly

15:55.360 --> 16:01.360
 when it comes to new technologies, rather than trying to judge and implement the same framework

16:01.360 --> 16:03.600
 or the variation of new technologies to all.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.520
 They are always as regulators in the conservative side.

16:07.520 --> 16:14.840
 But always, always they are unbiased and they are trying the best and it's not only one

16:14.840 --> 16:15.840
 or two people.

16:15.840 --> 16:21.360
 They have processes to make sure that there are self checks and balances within the agencies,

16:21.360 --> 16:24.160
 both in CDC and in the FDA.

16:24.160 --> 16:28.160
 Difficult decisions, they bring external experts that they should express.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.520
 Easy decisions, they are internal experts that they are debating a lot.

16:31.520 --> 16:33.680
 And if there are disagreements, they elevate them.

16:33.680 --> 16:39.080
 So I think it's, we are lucky to have good regulators.

16:39.080 --> 16:45.880
 I think I agree with what you said before, as with all governmental agencies, there is

16:45.880 --> 16:46.880
 bureaucracy.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.000
 And the bureaucracy needs to be addressed.

16:50.000 --> 16:56.920
 And by saying bureaucracy is not relaxing the bar, the bar needs to remain high.

16:56.920 --> 17:04.600
 But being focusing on what matters rather than on the detail.

17:04.600 --> 17:09.040
 So you don't, you know, I've been reading quite a bit about history.

17:09.040 --> 17:13.600
 You don't worry about human nature and corruption that can seep in.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.800
 You're saying institutionally there's protections against this.

17:16.800 --> 17:24.360
 I think there is always the fear of corruption, particularly when you speak about public servants.

17:24.360 --> 17:29.040
 But clearly the risk is very different country by country.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.960
 And speaking about agencies by agencies.

17:31.960 --> 17:37.840
 I think the regulatory agencies have a very good track record in history of the US, of

17:37.840 --> 17:44.960
 Europe, of England, of very, very good track record of integrity.

17:44.960 --> 17:46.240
 It's something I think about.

17:46.240 --> 17:53.320
 So I grew up in the Soviet Union and I need to perhaps introspect this a little bit.

17:53.320 --> 18:00.240
 But when I was growing up, ethically, there was a sense that bribery is the only way you

18:00.240 --> 18:01.920
 can get stuff done.

18:01.920 --> 18:04.120
 That was the system of the time.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.840
 Like you get pulled over by a police officer.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.560
 Like obviously you need to bribe them.

18:09.560 --> 18:12.040
 It was like the way of life.

18:12.040 --> 18:17.200
 And then so coming to this country was beautiful to see that the rule of law has so much power.

18:17.200 --> 18:26.600
 And ultimately the rule of law when enacted, when it holds up, it gives people freedom

18:26.600 --> 18:28.680
 to do the best work of their lives.

18:28.680 --> 18:30.760
 But there's still human nature.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.560
 And that worries me a lot here.

18:32.560 --> 18:36.080
 And again, it goes back to the perception, the communication.

18:36.080 --> 18:43.000
 When there's people that have worked at Pfizer and an FDA at the CDC, you look at the resume,

18:43.000 --> 18:44.800
 they have those things on the resume.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.800
 It worries people.

18:46.800 --> 18:52.560
 Are these great leaders that we are supposed to see as authorities?

18:52.560 --> 18:54.600
 Are they playing a game on us?

18:54.600 --> 19:01.960
 I would say that I recognize what you said about what happened or I'm sure that what

19:01.960 --> 19:07.800
 you describe in the country that you're coming from, how you experienced it.

19:07.800 --> 19:12.240
 And I know that there are other countries that you need to do these things to do your

19:12.240 --> 19:13.240
 job.

19:13.240 --> 19:19.560
 I don't think it's the case in this country, particularly when it comes to those agencies

19:19.560 --> 19:20.800
 that you mentioned.

19:20.800 --> 19:23.840
 I think they have a very high track record.

19:23.840 --> 19:28.680
 And also, I don't think that there are a lot of people that are worried about it or doubt

19:28.680 --> 19:29.680
 it.

19:29.680 --> 19:34.200
 I'm sure, like everywhere, there will be a minority, but the vast majority of the Americans,

19:34.200 --> 19:38.040
 the vast majority of the Europeans, the vast majority of the Brits, the vast majority of

19:38.040 --> 19:47.080
 the Israelis, they trust what FDA or EMA or CDC or NHRA will say.

19:47.080 --> 19:51.800
 Still, there's currently a distrust of big pharma in the public.

19:51.800 --> 19:55.920
 Maybe this is something I'd love to hear your comment on.

19:55.920 --> 20:00.120
 There's distrust of science when it's tangled up with corporations and government institutions

20:00.120 --> 20:02.880
 like we've talked about.

20:02.880 --> 20:09.240
 But they have to be entangled to achieve scale or oversight and to achieve the kind of scale

20:09.240 --> 20:13.000
 that Pfizer's been able to accomplish.

20:13.000 --> 20:16.760
 How can Pfizer regain the public trust?

20:16.760 --> 20:19.240
 How can you regain the public trust, do you think?

20:19.240 --> 20:24.920
 Can that regain but sort of take steps to increase the public trust?

20:24.920 --> 20:33.040
 Reputation is something that you can lose in buckets, but you can end up in drops.

20:33.040 --> 20:40.640
 And once you lost it, you are going to take a lot of effort to bring it back.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.560
 And the pharmaceutical industry lost it.

20:42.560 --> 20:50.480
 It's clear that the reputation of the industry in the last decade was on the lowest that

20:50.480 --> 20:52.880
 we have seen ever.

20:52.880 --> 20:59.160
 And for there are many reasons for that, but clearly there are reasons that are related

20:59.160 --> 21:02.200
 also with the behavior of the industry.

21:02.200 --> 21:09.000
 That needed to change and I'm hopeful that very few will disagree that the industry is

21:09.000 --> 21:12.400
 a very different industry right now.

21:12.400 --> 21:21.400
 That being said, I truly believe that if there is one lesson that stands out from the many

21:21.400 --> 21:26.960
 lessons that we learned during COVID, is the power of science in the hands of the private

21:26.960 --> 21:28.960
 sector.

21:28.960 --> 21:36.880
 I think it was the private sector that came with solutions with diagnostic tests when

21:36.880 --> 21:43.680
 we didn't have solutions with respirators, when we didn't have solutions with treatments,

21:43.680 --> 21:45.760
 solutions with vaccines.

21:45.760 --> 21:55.440
 And I think that demonstrated very clearly to the world the value of a thriving life

21:55.440 --> 22:00.520
 sciences sector, private life science sector to society.

22:00.520 --> 22:08.120
 That also affected very positively the reputation both of the sector and of Pfizer.

22:08.120 --> 22:11.480
 I'm not going to make the mistake to consider given.

22:11.480 --> 22:17.720
 I'm not going to make the mistake that because our reputation is high, that will remain so.

22:17.720 --> 22:20.160
 We need to earn it every day.

22:20.160 --> 22:25.320
 Every day with everything we do, with everything we say, with the way we behave.

22:25.320 --> 22:30.160
 And I hope that we will rise to this occasion and we will do that.

22:30.160 --> 22:34.320
 You've been in Pfizer for 28 years, time flies when you're having fun, and you've become

22:34.320 --> 22:37.840
 CEO in 2019.

22:37.840 --> 22:42.080
 It is a company you love, a company you believe in.

22:42.080 --> 22:46.400
 It's a company that has developed drugs that has helped millions of people.

22:46.400 --> 22:51.840
 So let me ask yet another hard question on this topic of reputation.

22:51.840 --> 22:58.080
 In 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of arthritis drug, Bextra, and agreed

22:58.080 --> 23:01.520
 to a $2.3 billion settlement.

23:01.520 --> 23:07.000
 How do you make sense of the fact that this happened to a company you love and you believe

23:07.000 --> 23:08.000
 in?

23:08.000 --> 23:09.160
 Yes.

23:09.160 --> 23:16.520
 The Bextra case in 2009 was related to things that happened in 2003.

23:16.520 --> 23:21.600
 And the things that happened in 2003 were things that basically several of our reps

23:21.600 --> 23:24.320
 did off label promotion.

23:24.320 --> 23:30.280
 So they spoke with the physicians about off label use of the product, and they should

23:30.280 --> 23:31.280
 do it.

23:31.280 --> 23:32.720
 Can you clarify it?

23:32.720 --> 23:37.120
 So off label are things that the FDA didn't approve, extra stuff.

23:37.120 --> 23:40.920
 You basically say this drug does extra stuff that the FDA never approved.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.920
 Correct.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.560
 And this is something that it is allowed when physicians are speaking to physicians, but

23:45.560 --> 23:50.480
 it is not allowed for the pharmaceutical companies to refer to these studies because

23:50.480 --> 23:53.360
 usually are studies that are happening off label.

23:53.360 --> 23:57.720
 And apparently several of our reps in 2003, they did it.

23:57.720 --> 24:05.280
 And we had to settle in 2009, and we paid a very big fine, as you said.

24:05.280 --> 24:10.400
 The fine was related not to the severity of the conduct, but the size of the revenues.

24:10.400 --> 24:14.640
 So the fines are, if Bextra was a small product, we would get a small fine.

24:14.640 --> 24:17.920
 Bextra was a very big product, and we got a very large fine.

24:17.920 --> 24:18.920
 Very bad.

24:18.920 --> 24:21.520
 What happened in 2003?

24:21.520 --> 24:26.760
 I don't think that these things happened since then.

24:26.760 --> 24:34.200
 We have a stellar record from 2009 until now of complying with every single regulation

24:34.200 --> 24:35.200
 and rule.

24:35.200 --> 24:39.840
 We have internal processes to make sure that these are not happening by individuals that

24:39.840 --> 24:42.080
 may have an interest.

24:42.080 --> 24:47.600
 For example, to get a promotion, they may try and do things that are not the right things.

24:47.600 --> 24:55.000
 And we have, more importantly, a culture in this company that really sets aside people

24:55.000 --> 24:56.640
 that they think differently.

24:56.640 --> 25:04.520
 So I didn't like what happened in 2003, but I believe a lot has changed in the 20 years

25:04.520 --> 25:07.920
 that followed, or almost 20 years.

25:07.920 --> 25:12.720
 So you're developing drugs, you're developing solutions to help millions of people, but

25:12.720 --> 25:15.000
 there's risk involved.

25:15.000 --> 25:21.640
 And so there would be lawsuits heading back your way, because there's a lot of lawyers

25:21.640 --> 25:27.640
 in the world, partially.

25:27.640 --> 25:35.880
 How do you put that into the calculation of how you tried to do good in the world?

25:35.880 --> 25:38.400
 That some of the cost is the lawsuits.

25:38.400 --> 25:44.800
 How do you not fall victim to thinking that it's just the cost of doing business?

25:44.800 --> 25:48.640
 And that some of the lawsuits might actually represent real pain that people are going

25:48.640 --> 25:49.640
 through?

25:49.640 --> 25:52.600
 No, I think that we try always to do the right thing.

25:52.600 --> 25:56.960
 And that's, as I said, very well embedded into our culture.

25:56.960 --> 26:03.400
 If you don't do the right thing, sooner or later, you will pay for it, one way or another.

26:03.400 --> 26:09.880
 And right now, for us doing the right thing, it is being able to find innovations to issues

26:09.880 --> 26:17.960
 that are real, diseases that they do not have good coverage, good treatments right now.

26:17.960 --> 26:26.160
 We try to find treatments that significantly surpass the current standards of care.

26:26.160 --> 26:31.000
 And we try not only to comply with what regulators are asking us to do, this is what you need

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
 to do to prove the safety or the efficacy, but exceed them.

26:35.000 --> 26:39.960
 No matter what we do on that, I'm sure that people will find opportunity, because as you

26:39.960 --> 26:44.640
 said, there are a lot of lawyers to sue us, but we believe in the justice system.

26:44.640 --> 26:51.280
 And we believe that eventually, if you are doing the right thing, you will be on the

26:51.280 --> 26:52.680
 right side of the history.

26:52.680 --> 27:01.000
 I'm really glad you say that, because focusing on doing the right thing, no matter the money,

27:01.000 --> 27:03.360
 I believe is the best way to make money.

27:03.360 --> 27:10.440
 And also, in another way, in other realms, creating a product that people love is the

27:10.440 --> 27:11.880
 best way to make money.

27:11.880 --> 27:17.280
 So focusing on the core of the thing that makes people feel good, that brings value

27:17.280 --> 27:19.840
 to people's lives.

27:19.840 --> 27:27.560
 So I'm now in Austin, Texas, my good friend, Joe Rogan, he's been highlighting to me this

27:27.560 --> 27:32.440
 aggressive marketing on mainstream media channels by Pfizer.

27:32.440 --> 27:35.440
 So let me ask a general marketing question.

27:35.440 --> 27:37.520
 Do you see this as a conflict of interest?

27:37.520 --> 27:44.560
 Is it my bias, the reporting of news, that a lot of us, a lot of people, me included,

27:44.560 --> 27:49.920
 look to these mainstream channels of news for kind of authority of what the heck's going

27:49.920 --> 27:52.000
 on in the world.

27:52.000 --> 28:03.520
 And if Pfizer is sponsoring many of these shows, there's a worry, it may be a perception thing,

28:03.520 --> 28:07.320
 but there's also a natural worry that it would influence what they're talking about, because

28:07.320 --> 28:09.080
 they're afraid of losing the sponsorship.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.960
 It's subtle, but at scale, it might have a serious impact.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.960
 Do you worry about this?

28:14.960 --> 28:21.600
 I think people could go one way or another because of multiple reasons.

28:21.600 --> 28:29.000
 From our perspective, I don't think we have aggressive marketing.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.000
 What do we do?

28:30.000 --> 28:38.240
 We go on TV and we are having ads about our products and they are highly regulated.

28:38.240 --> 28:43.840
 I think it is the right of people to know, to learn that if there is a product like that,

28:43.840 --> 28:49.160
 it's very clearly that we cannot say things, that they are off label, that have not been

28:49.160 --> 28:54.760
 approved, we need to have, every time we go on TV, as you know, FDA is forcing us to say

28:54.760 --> 29:00.120
 also the bad things that can happen for a medicine, sometimes that takes more time than

29:00.120 --> 29:01.560
 the good things.

29:01.560 --> 29:04.480
 And I don't think that we are doing aggressive marketing.

29:04.480 --> 29:11.600
 Now, people could be influenced and can be biased in the podcast or in the other type

29:11.600 --> 29:16.600
 of media activities that they have for multiple different reasons.

29:16.600 --> 29:23.360
 Yeah, I know, but it's still, it's pressure, it's human nature, I mean, one of it is perception,

29:23.360 --> 29:24.360
 but I worry about too.

29:24.360 --> 29:28.320
 I think I have a ton of sponsors for this podcast, for example, and none of them ever

29:28.320 --> 29:34.200
 asked me to do anything, they are just, you know, I think likely that kind of pressure

29:34.200 --> 29:39.560
 is not happening for Pfizer, but there is implied pressure sometimes.

29:39.560 --> 29:45.760
 And I worry about that a lot because, you know, I look at academia.

29:45.760 --> 29:52.560
 I look for the good in people, I tend to believe most people are good or have the capacity

29:52.560 --> 29:55.120
 to be good and the desire to be good.

29:55.120 --> 30:05.960
 When I came to MIT, I was a little bit disappointed, maybe heartbroken.

30:05.960 --> 30:14.800
 How much pressure, I think unjustified pressure people felt from financial constraints, especially

30:14.800 --> 30:19.480
 at MIT when there's, I think, a lot of money.

30:19.480 --> 30:24.560
 People still felt constraints and they weren't, they wasn't bringing out the best of them.

30:24.560 --> 30:28.680
 They weren't supporting each other, they weren't loving each other, like celebrating each other's

30:28.680 --> 30:29.680
 successes.

30:29.680 --> 30:35.520
 I don't want to blame money on everything, money constraints, but when you have sponsors,

30:35.520 --> 30:41.440
 it just, I personally worry that it doesn't bring the best out of people.

30:41.440 --> 30:48.760
 And so, I feel like I want to put some responsibility on sponsors and great big companies like

30:48.760 --> 30:57.720
 Pfizer to kind of not get in the way of the best of human nature, whether it's sponsoring

30:57.720 --> 31:05.240
 podcasts, mainstream media, like, I don't know, athletes, whatever.

31:05.240 --> 31:08.720
 You need to know that we are so, so careful with sponsorships.

31:08.720 --> 31:12.320
 First of all, we have very few, very, very few.

31:12.320 --> 31:16.880
 We have a team that for every single one could be $2,000.

31:16.880 --> 31:20.520
 They will try to see if there is a conflict of interest in the way we do it.

31:20.520 --> 31:26.800
 And also, what is the reputation of the, of the, the persons or the programs that we are

31:26.800 --> 31:27.800
 sponsoring.

31:27.800 --> 31:32.000
 So, I don't think our friend, I think, was from Texas.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.000
 Yes.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.000
 Yeah.

31:34.000 --> 31:38.680
 I don't think he got it right that we do.

31:38.680 --> 31:41.400
 We don't do those type of things.

31:41.400 --> 31:42.400
 We don't.

31:42.400 --> 31:44.760
 Oh, in terms of like having a negative effect on.

31:44.760 --> 31:46.600
 Not even having aggressive sponsorships.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.600
 We have very few.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.600
 Yeah.

31:48.600 --> 31:49.600
 When you clip them all together.

31:49.600 --> 31:54.920
 And most of the sponsorships that we have, it is more on patient related organizations

31:54.920 --> 32:00.640
 rather than we are very careful not to sponsor other things that can be perceived, not even

32:00.640 --> 32:03.800
 influenced, but perceived that we may influence.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.400
 So, we are very, very careful on that.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.560
 This is not the case with us.

32:07.560 --> 32:15.120
 So, with the incredibly fast development of the vaccine, could you tell me the story

32:15.120 --> 32:22.880
 from the engineering to the science to the human story of how you could do it so fast?

32:22.880 --> 32:28.720
 By November, you even had the ambition to do it by October, it was in the initial days.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.720
 How do you.

32:29.720 --> 32:31.240
 Eight days later.

32:31.240 --> 32:37.800
 In that time, how do you show that the vaccine is safe and effective, given that I think

32:37.800 --> 32:41.680
 previous vaccines have taken years to do that.

32:41.680 --> 32:49.240
 The vaccines take years to do that and the time that it takes, it is basically the vast

32:49.240 --> 32:55.560
 majority, the time to conduct the final phase three study for this, the confirmatory study.

32:55.560 --> 32:59.240
 And you do that because the phase three study cost a lot of money in our case costs almost

32:59.240 --> 33:00.240
 a billion.

33:00.240 --> 33:07.480
 So, you don't want to go and risk a billion in blind data, normally, before you do a lot

33:07.480 --> 33:11.560
 of experiments to make sure that the product that you're putting in the phase three is

33:11.560 --> 33:13.560
 the right one.

33:13.560 --> 33:17.640
 We didn't have that time, so we risk all the money.

33:17.640 --> 33:24.120
 So we went into, we condensed all the time towards this phase three, but the phase three

33:24.120 --> 33:31.680
 study had to follow all the rules that any study follows when we do this trial.

33:31.680 --> 33:37.160
 Could you just briefly describe the basics of what is phase one, what is phase two, what

33:37.160 --> 33:38.160
 is phase three?

33:38.160 --> 33:42.840
 Let's say that there are so many phases when you try, first of all, to find what is the

33:42.840 --> 33:43.840
 right vaccine.

33:43.840 --> 33:49.640
 We tried from 20 different vaccines, we nailed down to four, and for those four, we selected

33:49.640 --> 33:52.600
 eventually two and then eventually one.

33:52.600 --> 33:57.240
 Once you have those selections, what is the dose you're going to use?

33:57.240 --> 34:02.560
 And then we tried multiple different doses to see which one we think is the best.

34:02.560 --> 34:05.280
 What is trying in tail in those early days?

34:05.280 --> 34:12.920
 You go, first of all, with smaller doses in humans, and then after you have done a lot

34:12.920 --> 34:17.920
 of experiments in animals so that you can feel that it is safe enough to go to humans

34:17.920 --> 34:22.920
 and then go with very low dose, and then you gradually increase the dose and then you monitor

34:22.920 --> 34:28.720
 those humans to make sure that there are not any, let's say, reactogenicity to what you

34:28.720 --> 34:29.720
 are giving them.

34:29.720 --> 34:34.600
 At the same time, you start to measure what is doing in terms of immune responses.

34:34.600 --> 34:38.080
 So you do that with multiple vaccines and you do that with multiple doses and you do

34:38.080 --> 34:42.800
 that with multiple ages of people, young people, old people.

34:42.800 --> 34:49.560
 And eventually, from the 20 vaccines to multiple doses to multiple schedules, is it after three

34:49.560 --> 34:53.960
 weeks, the second dose, or is it after four weeks or after six months?

34:53.960 --> 35:01.240
 All of that will inform you that I think this is the vaccine, this is the dose, this is

35:01.240 --> 35:05.680
 the scheme that I believe will give me the best results.

35:05.680 --> 35:10.040
 And when you have that, then you go to do what we call the phase three.

35:10.040 --> 35:15.520
 This is a very big study with thousands of people where you use the vaccine that you

35:15.520 --> 35:19.720
 think is the right one and a placebo.

35:19.720 --> 35:23.120
 The placebo and the vaccine, they look identical.

35:23.120 --> 35:26.720
 Nobody knows if he's injected a placebo or a vaccine.

35:26.720 --> 35:32.200
 The physician that makes the injection, the doctor, doesn't know if he's injecting placebo

35:32.200 --> 35:33.200
 or vaccine.

35:33.200 --> 35:37.520
 He knows a barcode, only the computer knows.

35:37.520 --> 35:41.520
 In order to go into this computer, there are keys and there are at least two people that

35:41.520 --> 35:45.240
 needs to put their keys so that someone can see the data.

35:45.240 --> 35:50.000
 And those people, they have legal obligations, never to do that, right?

35:50.000 --> 35:54.080
 So before a certain point, so all of that is blind.

35:54.080 --> 35:59.840
 The idea is that when you go into this study, you need to make sure that you are going with

35:59.840 --> 36:00.840
 the right one.

36:00.840 --> 36:02.880
 That's why it takes so much time.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.520
 But the study is the study.

36:04.520 --> 36:09.960
 You need to have a significant number of people that will give the two and then you let them

36:09.960 --> 36:13.480
 live their lives and then you see how many of them will get the disease.

36:13.480 --> 36:18.920
 And then you see if there are differences in percentage of infections for the vaccinated

36:18.920 --> 36:19.920
 compared to the nonvaccinated.

36:19.920 --> 36:24.000
 At the same time, you are monitoring all of them to see if there are differences in the

36:24.000 --> 36:25.000
 safety profile.

36:25.000 --> 36:29.920
 If those that go to the placebo have the same, let's say, heart attacks with those that they

36:29.920 --> 36:33.400
 didn't, they got the vaccine because heart attacks will happen.

36:33.400 --> 36:41.120
 If you have 50,000 people, because it's part of life, all these processes are very well

36:41.120 --> 36:43.920
 established and since years.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.200
 What we did the last one was exactly the same as we did always.

36:47.200 --> 36:49.320
 We just didn't lose time.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.000
 We were not careful with money.

36:52.000 --> 37:00.040
 Instead of recruiting 50,000 people over a year because we had, let's say, 30 hospitals

37:00.040 --> 37:05.880
 doing the recruitment, we went with 150 hospitals doing the recruitment that cost a lot of money.

37:05.880 --> 37:10.120
 But instead of recruiting them in a year, we recruited them in three or four months.

37:10.120 --> 37:17.160
 So I did this type of things by taking return on investment, taking costs out of the equation

37:17.160 --> 37:19.240
 and we were able to achieve this result.

37:19.240 --> 37:22.560
 But it's not the process, believe me.

37:22.560 --> 37:25.440
 It is the heart of the people.

37:25.440 --> 37:29.600
 People don't know what they can and what they cannot do.

37:29.600 --> 37:35.400
 And if anything, they have a serious tendency to underestimate what they can do.

37:35.400 --> 37:41.320
 And always, when you ask them something that is seemingly impossible, they will think out

37:41.320 --> 37:44.600
 of the box to be able to deliver.

37:44.600 --> 37:49.520
 We discussed about the timing instead of eight years, we didn't ask them to do it in six.

37:49.520 --> 37:52.960
 We asked them to do it in eight months.

37:52.960 --> 37:59.320
 Our normal manufacturing yearly production of Pfizer was 200 million doses of vaccines

37:59.320 --> 38:00.320
 every year.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.080
 That was what we were doing in the last 10 years.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.000
 We didn't ask them to make 300 million doses for a new vaccine.

38:06.000 --> 38:11.120
 We asked them to make 3 billion doses for a new vaccine.

38:11.120 --> 38:16.040
 The discovery phase of a new molecule, like the treatment that we have now, the pill against

38:16.040 --> 38:18.400
 COVID, takes four years.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.720
 We didn't ask them to do it in three.

38:19.720 --> 38:22.720
 We asked them to do it in four months, which is what they did.

38:22.720 --> 38:29.280
 When you're setting this type of goals, they know immediately they cannot just think within

38:29.280 --> 38:30.440
 the box.

38:30.440 --> 38:34.440
 And immediately this is where the human ingenuity and the heart comes.

38:34.440 --> 38:37.520
 And this is how they surprised all of us.

38:37.520 --> 38:40.880
 So there's incredible science and engineering going on here.

38:40.880 --> 38:43.320
 Absolutely.

38:43.320 --> 38:51.000
 This is what's bothering me, that the conversation in public is often not about that.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.920
 It's about politics, unfortunately.

38:53.920 --> 38:54.920
 Politics.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.800
 So I spent the day with Elon Musk yesterday.

38:57.800 --> 39:00.760
 He works with rockets.

39:00.760 --> 39:05.880
 Similar situation as with Pfizer in the sense that there's NASA and then there's private

39:05.880 --> 39:07.440
 company.

39:07.440 --> 39:11.560
 And that's a source of incredible inspiration to people.

39:11.560 --> 39:16.280
 No politics, very little politics.

39:16.280 --> 39:23.280
 This is part of the thing I'm hoping to do our little part in this conversation that

39:23.280 --> 39:30.600
 help untangle a little bit, just reveal the beauty and the power of the thing that was

39:30.600 --> 39:34.040
 done here, especially with the vaccine, but other things that are being done with the

39:34.040 --> 39:37.960
 antiviral drug.

39:37.960 --> 39:41.060
 Let me just kind of linger on the safety.

39:41.060 --> 39:48.720
 What can you say, there's a lot of people that are concerned that the Pfizer vaccine,

39:48.720 --> 39:56.880
 by the way, of which I took two shots, no booster yet, is unsafe.

39:56.880 --> 39:59.600
 What do you say to people that say that?

39:59.600 --> 40:03.400
 No, they should not fear something like that.

40:03.400 --> 40:04.400
 It's completely wrong.

40:04.400 --> 40:11.640
 There is no medical product in the history of humanity that have been tested as much

40:11.640 --> 40:17.080
 as this vaccine has been administered to hundreds of millions of people.

40:17.080 --> 40:24.480
 And because of the importance of COVID, they have been scrutinized, those people, constantly.

40:24.480 --> 40:30.440
 Right now, healthcare authorities are looking for every single signal around the world of

40:30.440 --> 40:34.560
 people that they got the vaccine and try to see if it is vaccine related or not.

40:34.560 --> 40:41.080
 There are electronic medical records that will tell us when and what happened to a person

40:41.080 --> 40:43.880
 when he did got the vaccine.

40:43.880 --> 40:55.800
 And we know now, we have so high certainty that it is so safe, exactly as the data sheet

40:55.800 --> 40:59.240
 says about this vaccine, more than any other product.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.680
 They should not be afraid of something like that.

41:01.680 --> 41:08.680
 And they should not listen to information, what it is, misinformation, what it is spread

41:08.680 --> 41:10.680
 on purpose.

41:10.680 --> 41:18.400
 Well, I don't like the word misinformation because, you know, again, back to the Soviet

41:18.400 --> 41:25.720
 Union, anyone who opposes the state is spreading misinformation, so you can basically call

41:25.720 --> 41:27.640
 anything misinformation.

41:27.640 --> 41:33.600
 That's the unfortunate times we live in is you can call anyone, you can basically call

41:33.600 --> 41:37.560
 anybody a liar and say, I'm the sole possessor of the truth.

41:37.560 --> 41:42.720
 And just no offense to me, just because you wear a tie doesn't mean you're any more likely

41:42.720 --> 41:45.800
 to be in the possession of the truth than anyone else.

41:45.800 --> 41:47.760
 So I wouldn't disagree with that at all.

41:47.760 --> 41:53.000
 I don't think that somebody who's not wearing a tie and as people can see that I'm not wearing

41:53.000 --> 42:03.240
 a tie and you are, but it's not about being able, those that they have the power to impose

42:03.240 --> 42:09.960
 on the others the stigma that you, what you are saying is misinformation.

42:09.960 --> 42:14.280
 But there are a few things that the society, we have accomplished and science is one of

42:14.280 --> 42:15.880
 them.

42:15.880 --> 42:26.120
 And data is, and analytics of data is another one and to say that something which is highly

42:26.120 --> 42:35.480
 scientific by people that they are not scientists, I think that it is not what you're describing

42:35.480 --> 42:41.320
 what used to happen in the Soviet Union or in any other autocratic regime in the world

42:41.320 --> 42:42.320
 right now.

42:42.320 --> 42:49.680
 But I definitely do think that the scientists, the public science communicators I've listened

42:49.680 --> 42:56.840
 to over COVID have really disappointed me because they have not spoken with empathy.

42:56.840 --> 43:01.360
 They haven't sufficiently in my view have put their ego aside and really listened to

43:01.360 --> 43:02.360
 people.

43:02.360 --> 43:08.840
 Yes, people that don't have a PhD, people have not really, maybe you've not even taken

43:08.840 --> 43:15.080
 like a biology course in college or something like that, but still they have children, they

43:15.080 --> 43:21.960
 worry, they fear, they don't know who to trust, they don't know if they should listen to the

43:21.960 --> 43:28.040
 CEO of Pfizer who might have other incentives in mind who might just care about money and

43:28.040 --> 43:29.040
 nothing else.

43:29.040 --> 43:34.520
 And so they just use common sense and they ask questions and I think to them, talking

43:34.520 --> 43:39.720
 down to them as if they're not intelligent so on is something scientists have done almost

43:39.720 --> 43:44.360
 like roll their eyes and that disappoints me because I think that's kind of what is

43:44.360 --> 43:45.880
 the source of division.

43:45.880 --> 43:48.440
 Look, humility is a virtue.

43:48.440 --> 43:49.440
 Yes.

43:49.440 --> 43:54.880
 And the fact that you are educated doesn't mean that you are having either humility or

43:54.880 --> 43:58.880
 empathy or you have good human qualities.

43:58.880 --> 44:06.680
 This was never and will never be a metric of judging this type of virtues.

44:06.680 --> 44:09.680
 Those that they do this, they're wrong.

44:09.680 --> 44:15.880
 And actually they are not doing good service to the public health because they are undermining

44:15.880 --> 44:17.160
 people are not stupid.

44:17.160 --> 44:23.600
 They see if you are not be respecting them and if you are not respecting their need to

44:23.600 --> 44:27.200
 learn because that affects their health, the health of the mother, of the kids.

44:27.200 --> 44:33.680
 So I fully agree with you that we should be very patient to explain again and again and

44:33.680 --> 44:36.360
 again what is happening.

44:36.360 --> 44:40.080
 And the vast majority of the people that they don't get vaccinations right now is because

44:40.080 --> 44:41.080
 they're afraid.

44:41.080 --> 44:42.320
 It's not for any other reason.

44:42.320 --> 44:45.040
 It's not that they have an agenda.

44:45.040 --> 44:51.560
 What I'm saying is there is a small number of people that they have made business for

44:51.560 --> 44:56.800
 them to profit from this anxiety.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.320
 I'll give you an example.

44:59.320 --> 45:01.000
 I have been arrested by FBI.

45:01.000 --> 45:04.000
 This is what someone wrote.

45:04.000 --> 45:05.000
 I read it.

45:05.000 --> 45:06.000
 I laughed.

45:06.000 --> 45:09.000
 I mean, okay, this is where they take it.

45:09.000 --> 45:11.200
 There was a reason why they wrote it back.

45:11.200 --> 45:16.360
 The FISA was arrested FBI because they want to create doubts in the minds of the people

45:16.360 --> 45:21.560
 that they're afraid and say, look, if FDI arrested him likely, I will not do the vaccine.

45:21.560 --> 45:22.560
 But I laughed.

45:22.560 --> 45:29.800
 A week later, the wife of the FISA CEO died.

45:29.800 --> 45:34.440
 There is a picture in this website of my wife.

45:34.440 --> 45:36.880
 Someone says to me, now I'm pissed.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.520
 I'm not laughing.

45:38.520 --> 45:44.320
 I tried to find my kids to tell them if you read something, mom is fine, don't worry.

45:44.320 --> 45:49.480
 Then I remember that she has very old parents back in Greece.

45:49.480 --> 45:53.400
 We start calling them to making sure because you know that that will be picked up by Greek

45:53.400 --> 45:56.280
 newspapers and they will publish it.

45:56.280 --> 45:58.440
 They are those people that wrote these things.

45:58.440 --> 46:05.000
 They know very well that my wife didn't die and died because she was vaccinated, right?

46:05.000 --> 46:14.240
 So this is the narratives that they are on purpose forming to profit from the stress

46:14.240 --> 46:18.640
 and the anxiety of good people.

46:18.640 --> 46:24.680
 And that's something I have to kind of, people that listen to this, that kind of doubt institutions.

46:24.680 --> 46:32.640
 I do also want to say that there's quite a few folks who realize they can make money

46:32.640 --> 46:37.880
 from saying the man is lying to you.

46:37.880 --> 46:40.400
 The government is lying to you.

46:40.400 --> 46:42.600
 It's all corrupt.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.840
 It's all a scam.

46:44.840 --> 46:48.320
 Big farmer is lying to you, they're manipulating you.

46:48.320 --> 46:51.800
 I'm surprised at how much money can be made with that.

46:51.800 --> 46:52.800
 And it's sad.

46:52.800 --> 47:00.280
 So you have to, just as people use their common sense to be skeptical when listening to politicians

47:00.280 --> 47:06.400
 and powerful figures, they should be skeptical to also when listening to sort of the conspiracy

47:06.400 --> 47:12.760
 theorists or not even the conspiracy theorists, but people who raise questions about institutions.

47:12.760 --> 47:18.720
 Think on your own, think critically with an open mind that everyone can be manipulating

47:18.720 --> 47:22.840
 you, but also everybody has the capacity to do good.

47:22.840 --> 47:30.240
 And I think science in its pure form, not when entangled with institutions, is a beautiful

47:30.240 --> 47:31.440
 thing.

47:31.440 --> 47:36.240
 And in the hands of many companies, it is a beautiful thing at scale.

47:36.240 --> 47:43.360
 Still, you have a lot of incentive as having created the vaccine at Pfizer, this incredible

47:43.360 --> 47:49.840
 technology to sing it praises.

47:49.840 --> 47:56.000
 So there's a kind of, you know, people are skeptical, like how much do we trust?

47:56.000 --> 48:00.840
 How excited Albert is about this vaccine.

48:00.840 --> 48:06.440
 So for example, not to do a Shakespearean analysis of you to Twitter, but I think you

48:06.440 --> 48:13.560
 tweeted something about a study with 100% efficacy of the vaccine or in stopping a transmission

48:13.560 --> 48:16.080
 or something like that.

48:16.080 --> 48:25.360
 Do you regret sort of being like overrepresenting the effectiveness of the vaccine, technically

48:25.360 --> 48:32.840
 saying correct things, but just kind of like highlighting the super positive things that

48:32.840 --> 48:35.800
 may be misinterpreted, you know, saying 100%.

48:35.800 --> 48:41.760
 No, I never said something 100% that every time I speak, if a number is 100%, I rush

48:41.760 --> 48:46.000
 to say that in biology, there is nothing 100% because always there will be when you go

48:46.000 --> 48:47.000
 to the millions.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.000
 Okay.

48:48.000 --> 48:52.960
 There were in the study things that were 100%, for example, deaths or in South Africa.

48:52.960 --> 48:58.360
 When we tried it, there was 100% efficacy, clearly small numbers.

48:58.360 --> 49:05.000
 When the numbers will become much bigger, the 100% will not hold, but will be 95, 96.

49:05.000 --> 49:07.400
 So still the direction of this is the point.

49:07.400 --> 49:16.400
 So I'm very, very careful what I tweet and in addition to how careful I am, I have people

49:16.400 --> 49:20.960
 that they are looking at and they are having second or third opinions to make sure that

49:20.960 --> 49:21.960
 we don't put.

49:21.960 --> 49:26.480
 Because I know that people are listening to me right now, everything I say.

49:26.480 --> 49:33.560
 And I want to make sure that they continue not only being clear as to what I want to

49:33.560 --> 49:38.600
 say so they don't misunderstandings, but also I maintain the trust of the people.

49:38.600 --> 49:46.040
 I don't think that someone who only picks information and only emphasizes positive things,

49:46.040 --> 49:52.160
 but someone that it is the one to be trusted and I want me and Pfizer to be trusted.

49:52.160 --> 49:57.280
 So many felt the vaccine was presented as a cure that wouldn't require regular booster

49:57.280 --> 49:58.880
 shots.

49:58.880 --> 50:02.840
 Was that something you believed early on, did you always believe that many regular shots

50:02.840 --> 50:03.840
 would be required?

50:03.840 --> 50:10.240
 And maybe in a bigger picture, how many, do you think this will, for the Pfizer vaccine,

50:10.240 --> 50:14.680
 is it something you see that's taking a booster shot regularly, like annually?

50:14.680 --> 50:15.680
 Yes.

50:15.680 --> 50:20.280
 Beginning when we had the first months of the vaccine, people would ask me, do we need

50:20.280 --> 50:21.280
 another one?

50:21.280 --> 50:22.280
 And I said, we don't know.

50:22.280 --> 50:24.480
 I was very clear about it.

50:24.480 --> 50:29.920
 Then around April, May, I started seeing the first data and I made statements that I think

50:29.920 --> 50:34.960
 we will need a booster around eight to 12 months after the second dose.

50:34.960 --> 50:40.120
 And then after that, annually vaccinations, this is what I said, believe is one of the

50:40.120 --> 50:42.680
 most likely scenarios.

50:42.680 --> 50:46.280
 And it was based on the data that I had, but then Delta came.

50:46.280 --> 50:51.880
 And because I always making the caveat that with absent a new variant, with everything

50:51.880 --> 50:56.920
 we know, with Delta, it was proven that we need the booster to move to the three, to

50:56.920 --> 50:58.160
 the six months.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.880
 And this is what happened.

51:00.880 --> 51:05.440
 And I still said, I think the booster is a six months.

51:05.440 --> 51:08.920
 And then I think it will be an annually vaccination, likely.

51:08.920 --> 51:12.920
 We have to monitor to see the data, but this is the likely scenario.

51:12.920 --> 51:15.360
 Now we have Omicron.

51:15.360 --> 51:19.040
 And Omicron says that two doses might be challenging.

51:19.040 --> 51:22.800
 We don't know exactly yet, but three doses work.

51:22.800 --> 51:28.640
 So clearly a lot of countries already started moving now, the third dose, not from six months

51:28.640 --> 51:37.920
 to three, so that they will reduce the period that people will not be protected with the

51:37.920 --> 51:39.800
 third dose.

51:39.800 --> 51:44.760
 I don't know with Omicron, if how long this will last.

51:44.760 --> 51:49.160
 And frankly, I don't know if we will need a new vaccine tailor made to Omicron based

51:49.160 --> 51:51.160
 on everything we know so far.

51:51.160 --> 51:54.800
 We are monitoring and we will know way more in the weeks to come.

51:54.800 --> 51:58.480
 If there is a need for a new vaccine, we will have it.

51:58.480 --> 52:03.600
 And if there is a need for mass production of this new vaccine, I can also feel very

52:03.600 --> 52:08.200
 comfortable that we will not lose any of our capacity that we have developed.

52:08.200 --> 52:14.800
 Right now we are running at one billion, almost approximately, doses per quarter, four per

52:14.800 --> 52:15.880
 year.

52:15.880 --> 52:20.120
 And if we have two streets and have half of that in the new, half of that in the old,

52:20.120 --> 52:22.080
 we will do still four billion doses.

52:22.080 --> 52:28.240
 So I think the world should feel very, very comfortable, but if there is a need, we will

52:28.240 --> 52:29.800
 be ahead of the virus.

52:29.800 --> 52:35.400
 Yeah, you did, you delivered or produced three billion this year vaccines and you're on track

52:35.400 --> 52:36.960
 to do four billion next year.

52:36.960 --> 52:43.560
 I mean, if we had a lot more time, we would talk about how the heck you achieve that kind

52:43.560 --> 52:44.560
 of scale.

52:44.560 --> 52:45.560
 It's truly incredible.

52:45.560 --> 52:48.760
 Let me ask the policy question.

52:48.760 --> 52:55.960
 What are your feelings about vaccine mandates in terms of do you think the most effective

52:55.960 --> 53:00.480
 way to vaccinate the population is to acquire it?

53:00.480 --> 53:07.400
 Or do you go with the American way and give people the freedom to choose?

53:07.400 --> 53:14.160
 I think it is a very difficult topic and a very difficult decision, whoever needs to

53:14.160 --> 53:15.160
 make it.

53:15.160 --> 53:16.680
 And clearly it's not me.

53:16.680 --> 53:21.160
 It is the public health officials of every country that they have to make this decision.

53:21.160 --> 53:31.120
 I have to make the decision for Pfizer employees and I had to balance the fear of those that

53:31.120 --> 53:36.040
 they work, that they want to feel that the others are vaccinated and the fear of those

53:36.040 --> 53:38.160
 that they don't want to get the vaccine.

53:38.160 --> 53:42.960
 And eventually I came to the decision that we will mandate it at Pfizer.

53:42.960 --> 53:43.960
 We are flexible.

53:43.960 --> 53:50.920
 We are giving exceptions, of course for health, maybe some religions, but we decided to mandate

53:50.920 --> 53:51.920
 it.

53:51.920 --> 53:57.720
 Now, at Pfizer, when we did this decision, we were at 90% vaccination rates when we said

53:57.720 --> 54:00.200
 you are going to mandate it.

54:00.200 --> 54:03.880
 And that took it up to 96.

54:03.880 --> 54:06.560
 It works.

54:06.560 --> 54:12.280
 This 10% was never going to move, I felt, because no matter what, you have a small number

54:12.280 --> 54:17.560
 of people that really are scared and they don't feel comfortable to do it.

54:17.560 --> 54:18.960
 It worked in our case.

54:18.960 --> 54:20.440
 We took it to 96%.

54:20.440 --> 54:22.200
 I'm happy for those people.

54:22.200 --> 54:26.720
 A lot will not disease and some will not die of the obvious people.

54:26.720 --> 54:33.720
 But it's not to me to say because the debate, it's serious debate and there are a lot of

54:33.720 --> 54:41.600
 pros and cons if you need to push people, if you need to give them the freedom and it

54:41.600 --> 54:42.600
 comes with the territory.

54:42.600 --> 54:47.760
 If you are elected to run a country, you should be ready to make difficult decisions.

54:47.760 --> 54:50.760
 And no matter what decision you make, there will be fake stories written about you as

54:50.760 --> 54:51.760
 we talked about.

54:51.760 --> 54:54.640
 You will not be able to please everyone.

54:54.640 --> 54:55.640
 Yes.

54:55.640 --> 55:00.000
 Well, let me just say that I think, again, coming from the Soviet Union, I think at the

55:00.000 --> 55:07.240
 public level, at the federal level, mandates is a really bad idea.

55:07.240 --> 55:12.240
 Even if it's good for the health of the populace, there's something about preserving the freedom

55:12.240 --> 55:14.720
 is really powerful about this country.

55:14.720 --> 55:20.400
 Like doing the hard work of convincing people to get vaccinated, to choose to get vaccinated

55:20.400 --> 55:23.640
 if they want, but still have the freedom not to.

55:23.640 --> 55:25.800
 That's a really powerful freedom.

55:25.800 --> 55:28.640
 To me, it's super lazy to mandate.

55:28.640 --> 55:38.560
 People should understand the science and want to get vaccinated.

55:38.560 --> 55:41.480
 Do you think children need to get vaccinated?

55:41.480 --> 55:42.480
 I do.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.680
 I do think that they need to get vaccinated.

55:44.680 --> 55:54.960
 So age ranges five to 16, there's a lot of parents that fear for the well being of their

55:54.960 --> 55:55.960
 children.

55:55.960 --> 55:58.080
 Can you empathize with those parents?

55:58.080 --> 56:04.640
 Can you still man their arguments against the vaccine for their children?

56:04.640 --> 56:06.120
 Because people know who I am.

56:06.120 --> 56:15.600
 I had the opportunity to interact with parents before that was, let's say, approved.

56:15.600 --> 56:23.520
 And there were so many way more that I had a lot of empathy because they were afraid

56:23.520 --> 56:26.920
 for their kids because they didn't have a vaccine.

56:26.920 --> 56:31.280
 And they were the ones that were speaking at that time, bringing me a vaccine.

56:31.280 --> 56:32.800
 When are you going to bring me a vaccine?

56:32.800 --> 56:33.800
 I have a really fear.

56:33.800 --> 56:39.640
 I feel that this is unfair, but I am protected, my husband is protected, my old son is protected

56:39.640 --> 56:45.720
 and my little sweetheart, because he's below the age, is not protected.

56:45.720 --> 56:50.720
 Now that we have the vaccines, I'm sure that those that are afraid of the vaccine, not

56:50.720 --> 56:56.440
 of the disease, which are smaller number, admittedly, also, they will have, if they

56:56.440 --> 57:00.320
 are afraid of them, I'm sure that they will afraid even more about their kids because

57:00.320 --> 57:04.200
 they love, I would say, more than they love themselves.

57:04.200 --> 57:06.640
 So it's going to be this situation.

57:06.640 --> 57:12.760
 And again, the same, how it can you do to demonstrate, to convince people, to win the

57:12.760 --> 57:15.440
 minds and the hearts of the people, but this is the right thing to do.

57:15.440 --> 57:16.800
 What do you think about that calculation?

57:16.800 --> 57:19.760
 Because the risk for kids is very low.

57:19.760 --> 57:25.800
 Kids do die, kids do go to the hospital from COVID, but the rate is very low.

57:25.800 --> 57:30.200
 The rate is lower, but kids, they do die.

57:30.200 --> 57:35.960
 And how can you say that I'm not going to protect a kid for something that it is likely

57:35.960 --> 57:37.160
 to happen?

57:37.160 --> 57:38.600
 And it is not only that.

57:38.600 --> 57:44.080
 What happens in the school, when they stop the education process, because a kid got the

57:44.080 --> 57:50.680
 disease and they don't have vaccines so that they can control, it is such a big disruption

57:50.680 --> 58:00.680
 and such a big risk for the health of the kids, that it shouldn't be a debate.

58:00.680 --> 58:06.280
 Look, how many kids are having polio right now?

58:06.280 --> 58:11.560
 Way fewer number than those that are having COVID in the hospital.

58:11.560 --> 58:14.280
 But everybody is getting the vaccine.

58:14.280 --> 58:15.280
 It's...

58:15.280 --> 58:17.200
 Well, polio was deadlier for kids.

58:17.200 --> 58:18.360
 But it's not now.

58:18.360 --> 58:22.320
 So why some a kid to do it now?

58:22.320 --> 58:23.760
 Because it needs to be protected.

58:23.760 --> 58:28.280
 Well, the unique thing about the COVID vaccine is a new type of technology too.

58:28.280 --> 58:31.120
 So there's an extra concern.

58:31.120 --> 58:37.920
 Choosing to vaccinate a child, you're making a choice that can potentially hurt them.

58:37.920 --> 58:41.600
 That's the way parents that are hesitant about the vaccine think.

58:41.600 --> 58:48.840
 I think choosing to vaccinate children makes a choice so that something could not potentially

58:48.840 --> 58:50.360
 hurt them, which is the disease.

58:50.360 --> 58:53.960
 That's why we are doing vaccinations since ever.

58:53.960 --> 59:00.600
 I know that there are people that they're concerned for themselves and for their kids.

59:00.600 --> 59:09.120
 What I know it is that I'm a scientist and I'm a parent and I am telling you that vaccines

59:09.120 --> 59:14.920
 is a very good thing for kids and thank God we were able to develop them.

59:14.920 --> 59:18.560
 So we've talked quite a bit about the vaccine, but there's an incredible new technology that

59:18.560 --> 59:24.360
 Pfizer is developing with the Pax Lovid antiviral for COVID.

59:24.360 --> 59:26.440
 Where does that stand?

59:26.440 --> 59:29.280
 How does that work?

59:29.280 --> 59:35.200
 And how are you able to develop it in four months, like you said, and all of that in

59:35.200 --> 59:36.720
 just a few minutes?

59:36.720 --> 59:42.080
 First of all, what this is about, this is a real game changer.

59:42.080 --> 59:48.480
 This is a course of treatment that you get only if you get the disease, you get COVID.

59:48.480 --> 59:54.520
 Then what happens is that you will take for five days pills, day and night, and twice

59:54.520 --> 59:56.800
 a day for five days.

59:56.800 --> 1:00:02.560
 And instead of 10 people from those that disease to go to hospital, only one will go.

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:08.520
 This is, and with all the caveats that the numbers are small, no one died.

1:00:08.520 --> 1:00:11.360
 It was 100% efficacy on deaths.

1:00:11.360 --> 1:00:16.320
 Of course, I'm sure that in real world, when the numbers are getting very high, we may

1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:18.920
 have 99 instead of 100.

1:00:18.920 --> 1:00:25.960
 But these are spectacular results for something that you can take home and stay home.

1:00:25.960 --> 1:00:30.720
 The biggest problem right now in Europe, in the U.S., when we have surges, every time

1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:39.320
 that we have a surge of COVID, it is that the ICUs are full, the hospitals are paralyzed,

1:00:39.320 --> 1:00:44.040
 they have to postpone elective surgeries, they have to postpone other operations because

1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:47.240
 they don't have the capacity because of that.

1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:56.440
 Keeping people out of the hospitals, home, keeping people without dying, it is something

1:00:56.440 --> 1:00:59.440
 that you didn't have before.

1:00:59.440 --> 1:01:03.840
 But this is a significant, significant game changer.

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:09.280
 I have to ask a controversial, difficult question.

1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:12.080
 What are your thoughts about ivermectin?

1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:14.280
 Has it sufficiently been studied?

1:01:14.280 --> 1:01:20.480
 Has Pfizer considered it in its, like I said, incredible development of the antiviral?

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:25.080
 As a comparator, that kind of thing, just investigated in general.

1:01:25.080 --> 1:01:30.560
 The reason I bring it up, because I've read quite a few criticisms of people, there's

1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:36.320
 been some comparisons of Paxilover to the ivermectin, and I think people should look up.

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:40.960
 There is Dr. John Campbell that describes that comparison and makes that claim, and there's

1:01:40.960 --> 1:01:44.640
 quite a lot of people that debunk or argue against that.

1:01:44.640 --> 1:01:50.120
 You can do your own research, but there is a lot of people that kind of see this free

1:01:50.120 --> 1:01:54.400
 drug without patents on it and say, this could be the savior.

1:01:54.400 --> 1:01:56.640
 So can you just speak to that comparison?

1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:01.880
 It's not the first time, if you remember, there were other compounds that were claimed

1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:12.640
 that they are the solution to COVID, and clearly, they were proving that they're not.

1:02:12.640 --> 1:02:16.160
 There are compounds that there are solutions and compounds that they're not.

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:23.680
 As a scientist, and I discuss with our scientists, they don't see any reason why a medicine like

1:02:23.680 --> 1:02:29.760
 ivermectin, which is a parasitic side, to be able to act on COVID, and so they don't

1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:35.600
 see that there's any connection, and they haven't seen any paper that describes someone

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:37.440
 that used it that it had any results.

1:02:37.440 --> 1:02:43.120
 I'm sure that there will be some people that will claim, because people are claiming anything,

1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:50.640
 but I don't think that there was any paper in any peer review magazine, a reliable scientific

1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:52.960
 magazine, to support this claim.

1:02:52.960 --> 1:02:56.720
 So we are focusing on saving people's lives.

1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:01.480
 We are not focusing on craziness.

1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:08.800
 Well, to push back, there is quite a lot of papers, but the studies are small, so there's

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:09.800
 no conclusive evidence.

1:03:09.800 --> 1:03:12.880
 I haven't seen any that it is reliable.

1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:16.800
 I don't know where are these smaller, big, reliable.

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:18.800
 I haven't seen any.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:27.120
 Some of the big ones have been retracted, which means they weren't legitimate.

1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:31.880
 This is definitely something that people need to look into, the people that kind of question

1:03:31.880 --> 1:03:36.680
 of the effectiveness of ivermectin, definitely something to think about, and I think is the

1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:37.680
 reason that...

1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:41.640
 It was chloroquine on them before, for God's sake.

1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:42.640
 That's why I packed them.

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:45.880
 How many people died because of that?

1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:48.720
 This is the dangerous thing.

1:03:48.720 --> 1:03:50.120
 This is the sad thing.

1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:51.120
 Yeah.

1:03:51.120 --> 1:03:56.000
 Max Lovitt has been studying thousands of people and will be under the scrutiny, not

1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:01.880
 only of regulators, but as we will go into the implementation, as it happened in many

1:04:01.880 --> 1:04:05.080
 countries, they will monitor to see what's happened.

1:04:05.080 --> 1:04:09.800
 Let's say that whatever we do, once it is out there, within a few weeks, they will know

1:04:09.800 --> 1:04:14.040
 all hospitals if it works or not, because they will see the statistics.

1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:21.080
 We've gone through one of the more difficult periods in recent human history over the past

1:04:21.080 --> 1:04:23.320
 two years, like as a society.

1:04:23.320 --> 1:04:29.560
 What gives you hope about the future for human civilization?

1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:31.720
 You look into the next few years.

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:34.080
 I think the human ingenuity.

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:41.320
 I think although the world always is progressing, although there are a lot of things that need

1:04:41.320 --> 1:04:45.960
 to be fixed in the society of 2020.

1:04:45.960 --> 1:04:54.040
 The society of 2020 is better at large than things 50 years back, 100 years back, in all

1:04:54.040 --> 1:05:01.840
 different aspects, from poverty, for human rights, from science, from quality of life,

1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:03.360
 from any aspect.

1:05:03.360 --> 1:05:11.800
 I am positive that humans can create and always create a better future, and we'll continue

1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:14.680
 doing so.

1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:19.280
 You have helped save the lives of millions of people, help improve the quality of their

1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:26.120
 lives, but you yourself are just one biological organism with an expiration date.

1:05:26.120 --> 1:05:28.200
 Do you ponder your mortality?

1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:30.360
 Do you think about your death?

1:05:30.360 --> 1:05:32.960
 Are you afraid of death?

1:05:32.960 --> 1:05:35.320
 That's a very interesting question.

1:05:35.320 --> 1:05:38.480
 I was discussing with a lot of people that I was fearless of death.

1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:42.000
 I couldn't care less when I was young.

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:50.280
 The first time that I start feeling that I want to be around was when I had kids.

1:05:50.280 --> 1:05:56.400
 Then I started feeling that, oh, gosh, I hope I will be around to see their wedding.

1:05:56.400 --> 1:05:59.920
 I hope they will be around to see their children.

1:05:59.920 --> 1:06:04.560
 If there is something that scares me, the possibility I will not be part of their lives

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:06.680
 anymore, and I will not be watching.

1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:11.800
 I hope there is life upstairs, so I will be able to watch them from there.

1:06:11.800 --> 1:06:12.800
 From upstairs.

1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:15.760
 Get a nice overview.

1:06:15.760 --> 1:06:22.000
 Let me ask the big, ridiculous question, and you only have two minutes or less to answer

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:23.000
 it.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.440
 What is the meaning of life?

1:06:24.440 --> 1:06:26.000
 What's the meaning of this whole thing?

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:29.040
 You said ingenuity is the thing that gives you hope.

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:33.080
 We seem to be all busy trying to help each other, trying to build a better world.

1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:34.080
 Why are we doing that?

1:06:34.080 --> 1:06:38.880
 I would repeat something that Steve Jobs has said.

1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:42.840
 Death is life's biggest invention.

1:06:42.840 --> 1:06:47.880
 It eliminates the old and gives place to the new.

1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:51.920
 Life is all about moving forward.

1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:57.040
 Life is all about creating new things.

1:06:57.040 --> 1:07:03.360
 Maybe everyone is a contributor, but no one is the owner.

1:07:03.360 --> 1:07:05.320
 Always creating something new.

1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:06.480
 Always.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:10.040
 Adding something beautiful into the world may be a little bit of love.

1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:11.040
 Hopefully.

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:12.880
 Albert, thank you so much.

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:18.320
 It's a huge honor that you go through some of these difficult questions with me today,

1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:21.920
 and then you give your extremely valuable time for this conversation.

1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:23.160
 Thank you so much for talking to me.

1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:29.280
 Thank you for your interest, and I'm happy as I was telling you before, but I can brag

1:07:29.280 --> 1:07:33.360
 with my kids that I was in your podcast because you are their hero.

1:07:33.360 --> 1:07:34.360
 You made it.

1:07:34.360 --> 1:07:35.360
 I made it.

1:07:35.360 --> 1:07:36.360
 Thank you.

1:07:36.360 --> 1:07:37.360
 Thank you.

1:07:37.360 --> 1:07:40.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Albert Berla.

1:07:44.560 --> 1:07:48.440
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Oscar Wilde.

1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:52.440
 The truth is rarely pure and never simple.

1:07:52.440 --> 1:07:54.760
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
