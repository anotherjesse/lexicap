 The following is a conversation with Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector, human rights activist,

00:06.160 --> 00:12.160
 and author of the book, In Order to Live. Quick mention of our sponsors,

00:12.160 --> 00:18.480
 Belcampo, Gala Games, BetterHelp, and Aidsleep. Check them out in the description to support this

00:18.480 --> 00:27.440
 podcast. Let me say a few words about North Korea. From 1994 to 98, North Korea went through a famine.

00:27.440 --> 00:34.720
 Mass starvation caused primarily by King Jung Il, who at the time was the new leader of North Korea

00:34.720 --> 00:43.760
 after his father's death in 1994. Somewhere between 600,000 and 3 million people died due to

00:43.760 --> 00:50.160
 starvation. From all the stories of famine in history, including my own family history, I've

00:50.160 --> 00:56.800
 come to understand that hunger tortures the human mind in a way that can break everything we stand

00:56.800 --> 01:04.960
 for. In North Korea, during the 90s famine, many were driven to cannibalism. Imagine more than 10

01:04.960 --> 01:12.160
 million people suffering starvation for months and years, always on the brink of death. We don't know

01:12.160 --> 01:18.640
 the exact numbers of people who died because the suffering was done in silence, in darkness. Very

01:18.640 --> 01:25.760
 little information in or out. Most people had to survive without electricity, without clean water,

01:25.760 --> 01:31.840
 medical supplies, sanitation, and food. The North Korean propaganda machine called this

01:31.840 --> 01:37.760
 the Arduous March, or the March of Suffering. And words such as famine and hunger were banned

01:37.760 --> 01:44.800
 because they implied government failure. And once again, now, in 2021, King Jung Un,

01:44.800 --> 01:50.160
 the current leader of North Korea, is calling for his country to prepare for another Arduous March,

01:50.160 --> 01:56.160
 or March of Suffering. Another period of mass starvation as the country closes its borders.

01:57.360 --> 02:02.320
 Looking at atrocities of the past decades and the encroaching atrocity there now,

02:02.320 --> 02:07.520
 I think about the quiet suffering of millions of North Koreans. I think about the torture of the

02:07.520 --> 02:13.760
 human spirit. I think about a North Korean child who could be a scientist, an artist, a writer,

02:13.760 --> 02:20.480
 but who instead grows impossibly thin without food, their bodies slowly rotting away as their

02:20.480 --> 02:28.080
 parents watch helplessly. I got emotional in this conversation with you on me, in part because I

02:28.080 --> 02:34.720
 remembered my grandmother, who survived Haldamor, the famine in Ukraine, intentionally created by

02:34.720 --> 02:41.840
 Stalin, where four to 10 million people died and many, many more suffered. Imagine knowing that if

02:41.840 --> 02:47.520
 you don't engage in cannibalism, you will die before your children did, and then it will be eaten.

02:48.320 --> 02:53.920
 Imagine, because of this, deciding to murder and eat your own children, as many people did.

02:55.040 --> 03:02.000
 Imagine the kind of desperation, torture that leads up to a decision like that. I'm not smart

03:02.000 --> 03:08.560
 enough to know what evil is, nowhere to draw the line between good and evil. But Stalin, King

03:08.560 --> 03:15.600
 Jung Il, Kim Jong Un, are men who, in the name of power, are willing to make millions of people,

03:16.160 --> 03:22.960
 of children, suffer and die from starvation. I rarely have hate in my heart, but I hate these

03:22.960 --> 03:29.680
 men. I hate that such men exist in this world. I hate that the beauty I love about this life

03:29.680 --> 03:35.840
 exists amid such unimaginable cruelty. I have been haunted by this conversation,

03:35.840 --> 03:42.240
 by memories of my grandmother's pain, but I've also been warmed by memories of her love.

03:43.360 --> 03:50.480
 Love gives me hope, hope for the perseverance of the human spirit, even in the face of evil.

03:51.920 --> 03:57.040
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here is my conversation with Yohan Mi Park.

03:58.240 --> 04:03.120
 Can you tell your story from North Korea to today as you describe in your 2015 book,

04:03.120 --> 04:08.080
 and with the extra perspective on life, love and freedom you've gained since then?

04:08.080 --> 04:14.000
 Wow, that's a long story. So I was born in the northern part of North Korea initially,

04:14.720 --> 04:22.000
 and my father was a party member, and my mom was housewife. I had one older sister,

04:22.720 --> 04:29.280
 and I remember born in that country. I never thought I was in an unusual country. Now I'm

04:29.280 --> 04:35.520
 thinking of what is literally called the Hermit Kingdom, but I thought I believed that I was

04:35.520 --> 04:42.080
 living in the best country on earth. It was a socialist paradise, and everybody in the rest

04:42.080 --> 04:50.400
 of the world worshiped my dear leader, and there was nothing to envy for me. So I had this enormous

04:50.400 --> 04:56.400
 pride in my heart, and grateful to be in that country. So was love for the leader, not fear?

04:56.400 --> 05:04.560
 For me at least, it was love. Yeah, it was all the admiration and gratitude. It changed

05:04.560 --> 05:12.320
 lately, but for me was pure, pure like love. Was there any, like looking back with the perspective

05:12.320 --> 05:20.880
 you have now, would you describe some of those moments growing up as full of happiness, or was

05:20.880 --> 05:27.440
 that delusion at the time? So not knowing the alternative, will you still be able to be happy?

05:28.400 --> 05:34.480
 The fact that I did not know, like in North Korea, this is the only country in this 21st century

05:34.480 --> 05:41.200
 has no internet, and they don't even know the existence of internet. Not only that, we don't

05:41.200 --> 05:50.000
 even have this 24 hour electricity, so not knowing definitely helped, I think, to be saying.

05:50.000 --> 05:54.320
 So as a human being, you're still able to find moments of happiness?

05:54.960 --> 06:01.120
 I think my happiness was from family, nothing else, even though those days keep telling me that

06:01.120 --> 06:07.600
 they were our source of meaning and happiness, I don't think I ever got happy by that. Maybe they

06:07.600 --> 06:12.880
 are here and there in schools, and like when I was learning propaganda, like, you know, the proud

06:12.880 --> 06:18.000
 feeling, right? I'm in the greatest nation here and there, but like actually true happiness came

06:18.000 --> 06:24.720
 from laughing with my family and my friends. Are there any childhood memories, pleasant,

06:24.720 --> 06:33.360
 or painful ones that stand out to you now? I mean, like, you know, whenever I think about my

06:33.360 --> 06:39.280
 North Korea, the interesting is there's no color. I mean, one is because North Korean

06:39.280 --> 06:45.680
 country has no color, right? Most of things are unpaved, and trees all cut down. We have no fear,

06:45.680 --> 06:52.800
 so people cut down trees to make food. So, but only that, like, even what we are wearing was,

06:52.800 --> 06:58.560
 like, no color. So it's an interesting memory to look back.

06:58.560 --> 07:05.760
 What about fashion? I've noticed from sort of, you know, you have quite an incredible sense of

07:05.760 --> 07:11.760
 fashion. So contrast that with your time in North Korea, how do you remember fashion? Just

07:11.760 --> 07:17.840
 or ways that people could express themselves visually. Was it all bland? There was no

07:17.840 --> 07:22.880
 word for fashion in North Korea. We didn't even know. It was not even our dictionary.

07:22.880 --> 07:28.480
 So of course, I did not know about Victoria. Secret models. I didn't even know what models were.

07:28.480 --> 07:35.120
 So when I came out, I learned the model was a job. And like, what is that? And I'm still confused.

07:35.120 --> 07:39.600
 So there's so many jobs that we have here that doesn't exist in North Korea.

07:39.600 --> 07:45.760
 What was life like in North Korea compared to the rest of the world? So maybe you said there's no

07:45.760 --> 07:54.320
 internet, 24 hour electricity is a luxury you do not have. What about food? What about water?

07:55.120 --> 07:59.840
 What about basic human rights? I think that's the thing, like, when people were asking me,

07:59.840 --> 08:05.600
 can you tell me about, like, life in North Korea? And in the past, I was like, I cannot describe it

08:05.600 --> 08:10.560
 to you. And initially I thought, oh, because of my English that I cannot find the words,

08:10.560 --> 08:16.320
 it's not that it's a different planet. The common sense that we have doesn't exist there.

08:16.320 --> 08:22.960
 Like, people literally do not know the concept of romantic love or human rights or liberty.

08:23.840 --> 08:31.440
 So when I'm thinking back to my country, it's, you know, like, as you cannot imagine life on

08:31.440 --> 08:38.000
 Mars right now. It's like that kind of difference. I grew up never seeing the map of the world.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.000
 I never knew that I was Asian. Like, the regime told me that I was Kim Il Sung, the first Kim race.

08:44.800 --> 08:50.400
 And then our calendar doesn't begin when Jesus Christ was born. Our calendar begins where Kim's

08:50.400 --> 08:57.600
 was born. So we, and history was forgotten to us. They didn't tell us about, of course, Christianity

08:57.600 --> 09:05.200
 or like the Big Bang. Like, our history began when Kim was born. So everything was forgotten to us.

09:05.200 --> 09:11.600
 And it was a different meaning. I mean, feeling of existence. You know, it's not even like

09:12.320 --> 09:18.720
 same life. I literally think that was almost like my past life. And this is like a new life that I began.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.280
 You're, you're almost like a different human being now.

09:21.280 --> 09:27.760
 Absolutely. Yeah. So you've, I have to say, I often say that my favorite book

09:28.720 --> 09:35.440
 is Animal Farm by George Orwell. I've read it, I don't know how many times. And so I was really

09:35.440 --> 09:41.440
 happy to hear that that was of the many books, excellent books that we'll hopefully talk about.

09:41.440 --> 09:46.400
 You mentioned that Animal Farm had a big impact on you. It was the book that kind of

09:46.400 --> 09:54.480
 led to a kind of awakening for you. Maybe can you describe what impact it had?

09:55.040 --> 09:59.440
 So after going through what I went through, right, and I arrived in South Korea after many years of

09:59.440 --> 10:07.040
 journey, they were saying, so Kim's were dictators. And South Korea is not colonized by American

10:07.040 --> 10:12.240
 bastards. And Americans, first of all, not bastards. They're good people. And then they said everything

10:12.240 --> 10:18.560
 that you believe in North Korea was a lie. It was a propaganda. Then at 15, I was thinking,

10:18.560 --> 10:23.200
 so if everything that I believe was a lie, how do I know what you're telling me is not lie?

10:24.240 --> 10:32.000
 That was so hard. How do I trust ever again? And I just, it was chaos in belief, right? I did not

10:32.000 --> 10:38.240
 know what was true anymore. And that's the moment few years later, I read this book, like Animal Farm,

10:38.240 --> 10:43.360
 just by mistake. It was a very short book in the library. I was like, okay, I can finish that quickly.

10:44.240 --> 10:51.360
 And when that ending, that like last chapter, right, they could not see between the pigs and

10:51.360 --> 10:57.520
 humans anymore, right? That sentence, I just understood everything what happened. I just

10:57.520 --> 11:02.720
 made every sense to me what happened to me, my people, and to my country.

11:02.720 --> 11:08.800
 Yeah, that there's, there's so many things that could say about that book. Yeah, there's a haunting

11:08.800 --> 11:14.320
 nature to the end. And I guess spoiler alert, but you should have read this already. You're

11:14.320 --> 11:22.320
 listening to this. At the end, the animals were looking to the humans and to the pigs and they

11:22.320 --> 11:29.600
 couldn't see the difference. And then there's this kind of gradual transition from the initial

11:29.600 --> 11:39.600
 revolutionary steps of animals fighting for their freedom to slowly the pigs gaining control went

11:39.600 --> 11:48.960
 from four legs good, two legs bad, to four legs good, two legs better. It was even better, I think,

11:48.960 --> 11:54.400
 something like that. They were so like gradually transitioning the ideology under which the farm

11:54.400 --> 12:02.880
 operates. And I think the gradual nature of that, where basically you have generations born, not

12:02.880 --> 12:11.440
 knowing how things were in the past. And that's, that's what makes the most kind of for me haunting

12:12.240 --> 12:21.840
 transition from freedom to slavery to suffering to injustice, all those things. And the animals

12:21.840 --> 12:29.440
 don't know they're part of that. And also for me personally, I always kind of found a kinship with

12:29.440 --> 12:36.320
 Boxer, the horse, because I just kind of an idiot, I just work really hard. I just work hard. And I

12:36.320 --> 12:46.480
 just love the idea of working hard for an ideal. And the tragic nature of, to the end, that horse

12:46.480 --> 12:55.200
 Boxer working his ass off for, for the pride for others. But yeah, for the pride of the farm,

12:55.200 --> 13:03.280
 you know, and then the pigs giving him sort of using that, but then just sending him to

13:03.280 --> 13:08.800
 the slaughterhouse anyway, when he was no longer useful. I mean, there's so many tragic elements

13:08.800 --> 13:14.000
 that echo everything I've seen in the Soviet Union. And many of the elements that you see

13:14.000 --> 13:20.480
 in even harsher, more drastic way in North Korea, if there's something hopeful you pull from that book,

13:21.440 --> 13:26.800
 like within the suffering, within the gradual decline, the taking away the freedom, there were

13:26.800 --> 13:33.360
 still moments of beauty, it seemed like. It can be. But I think for me was when I was

13:34.000 --> 13:40.720
 ending the last page of the book, until that point, I was angry towards the dictator. Why do you do

13:40.720 --> 13:45.920
 this as a human being? I was so angry dreaming of killing him, right? Revenging my father,

13:45.920 --> 13:53.040
 the people that he cared. But when I was ending the last chapter, actually, everybody was responsible

13:53.040 --> 13:59.600
 to create this dystopia in my country. That animals, initial animals, when they're scared,

13:59.600 --> 14:04.960
 when they receive the first execution, and then they were not doing their jobs, picking out and

14:04.960 --> 14:11.920
 keep questioning. They had a question, and then the SNS, they see fear, they silence. Because

14:11.920 --> 14:18.240
 of that, that's when I was like, my grandma knew life could be different. I think the one thing

14:18.240 --> 14:23.600
 about North Koreans are unique is that they don't know they are oppressed. They don't know that they

14:23.600 --> 14:28.800
 are slaves to the dictator. And the fact that other people know they're oppressed, like in America,

14:28.800 --> 14:32.960
 a lot of people think they are oppressed, like you are not oppressed. You don't even know the

14:32.960 --> 14:39.760
 definition of oppression. And like that's like when the new animals came, the new animals didn't

14:39.760 --> 14:45.760
 even know what the life could be like. There's no alternative for them to compare even. And I was

14:45.760 --> 14:50.960
 like, my grandmother knew. Why didn't they not do anything about it? And they were just scared.

14:50.960 --> 14:58.000
 They kept silent, and everybody was responsible. So the people who knew were too afraid to say,

14:58.000 --> 15:04.720
 right? And then there's people that just didn't even know. And I don't know what's more terrifying

15:04.720 --> 15:10.400
 about human nature, looking at this group of people who are afraid to say that things could

15:10.400 --> 15:16.080
 be otherwise. And then the group of people that don't even know it could be better.

15:18.080 --> 15:22.480
 It's, uh, I don't know that this, that's the reason I've returned to that book often, because

15:22.480 --> 15:29.280
 it's such maybe because it's interesting using animals to represent ideas that were very human.

15:29.280 --> 15:37.120
 It almost allows you to explore the darkness of human nature without sort of being broken by it.

15:37.120 --> 15:40.640
 So you mentioned anger. When I watch your interviews,

15:42.560 --> 15:48.160
 you're really calm and collected, not just your interviews, you know, Instagram, the way you present

15:48.160 --> 15:56.720
 yourself. You, um, I don't know. It seems like you're almost at peace with the world. Is there

15:56.720 --> 16:04.560
 in private times when you're just angry? Do you feel fear? Do you go to dark places, depression,

16:04.560 --> 16:09.600
 all those kinds of things? Are you, are you able to put that world that you were in behind you?

16:09.600 --> 16:18.720
 It's a joke because I talk about North Korea every single day and I still rescue people like from

16:18.720 --> 16:24.080
 China and Russia and other countries, right? And sometimes I'll rescue mission fears and they get

16:24.080 --> 16:31.360
 captured and sent back. I still have people in North Korea report to me. So like when I talked to

16:31.360 --> 16:37.600
 my sister who chose to not be in this life, activist life, she forgot most of things.

16:37.600 --> 16:45.040
 And like for the other hand, I like to remember everything. So sometimes it's a, it's a blessing

16:45.040 --> 16:52.080
 to keep reminded of how, because it's, you know, they say happiness is a relative thing. It is

16:52.080 --> 16:57.600
 sometimes. I mean, the thing is also people say, because nobody was falling when you're going up,

16:57.600 --> 17:03.280
 everybody was suffering, you should have been okay, right? But no, like if you are suffering

17:03.280 --> 17:08.160
 or suffering in that degree, no matter even if there's no comparison, like if you're in Nazi

17:08.160 --> 17:14.480
 German in the Holocaust, right? In the concentration camp, I'm sure nobody was better than them. I'm

17:14.480 --> 17:19.920
 sure they were suffering. It's the same thing. I suffered. But now, because I'm in this place,

17:19.920 --> 17:25.600
 I can't compare easily, right? Getting that perspective. But it is true. Like I still have

17:25.600 --> 17:31.920
 days that I cannot get out of bed. And I really hoping like that where it was Elon Musk talking

17:31.920 --> 17:37.920
 about downloading your brain, blah, blah. Like if maybe technology develops, that I can download

17:37.920 --> 17:43.840
 some part of my memory and then I can erase your memory. And that would be so much better.

17:44.960 --> 17:52.240
 This is a, sorry for the tough question, but if I came to you, if Elon came to you and said,

17:52.240 --> 17:55.120
 we can erase that part of your memory, would you do it?

17:55.120 --> 18:02.240
 Some days I would do it for sure. And my mom would do it 100%. My sister would do it.

18:02.240 --> 18:08.720
 All other defectors know they do it 100%. For me, I will hesitate because I'm a witness.

18:09.680 --> 18:17.600
 So if I delete that part, I don't know how real that can be. But it is painful. Like after I talk,

18:17.600 --> 18:23.520
 give a speech, right? I mean, I'm fine. But somehow I'm depressed. Sometimes if the talk was very

18:23.520 --> 18:28.880
 intense, I'm like depressed for three weeks. It takes a while for me to be recharged. But I don't

18:28.880 --> 18:36.400
 know why it is, you know. I just don't know. Well, there's also the, and there's a guy named

18:36.400 --> 18:43.360
 Victor Franco who wrote the book, Man Search for Meaning. And there's some aspect where, so he

18:43.360 --> 18:48.000
 talks about the Holocaust and that you can, in those moments of suffering, still discover meaning,

18:48.000 --> 18:54.800
 still discover happiness in the simplest of joys. Like while starving, you know, a little piece

18:54.800 --> 19:03.280
 of bread could be a source of incredible joy. And there's some aspect in which that experience

19:03.280 --> 19:11.120
 gives you a clarity about the world. Like somehow experiencing suffering allows you to deeply

19:11.120 --> 19:19.680
 experience joy and love and also empathize with the suffering of others. And like, it's almost like,

19:19.680 --> 19:24.960
 brings you closer to other humans. So it's this double edged sword that

19:27.920 --> 19:35.280
 that the highest of joys sometimes are catalyzed by suffering. And it's hard to know what to do

19:35.280 --> 19:40.080
 with that. You see that with World War II, the stories of soldiers that have suffered. But

19:40.080 --> 19:46.400
 some of the closest bonds of brotherhood, of just pure love, was experienced by them.

19:47.520 --> 19:54.800
 And it sucks that our brains are like this. You know, love requires hardship. I don't know why

19:54.800 --> 20:00.960
 that is. Yeah, that's like, that's the thing. Of course, in my journey, I learned how to survive,

20:00.960 --> 20:08.080
 right? Went to not trust and went to run. But I think most of I was keep learning what it means

20:08.080 --> 20:13.600
 to be a human being. I think that was like the ultimate thing I was keep learning. And I still

20:13.600 --> 20:20.240
 don't know fully what it means. But I do think it seems like suffering is necessary to stay for

20:20.240 --> 20:27.520
 people to be grateful and even be joyful to sometimes. So I talk about love quite a bit.

20:28.560 --> 20:36.960
 You mentioned that romantic love. I'm fascinated about love in many aspects. But you mentioned

20:36.960 --> 20:45.280
 romantic love was forbidden in North Korea. What do you think about love now that you've kind of

20:45.280 --> 20:52.480
 discovered it? What's the role of love in life? Why was it so why do you think it was forbidden in

20:52.480 --> 20:58.160
 North Korea? So the tragic thing about North Korea is not only just banning Shakespeare,

20:58.160 --> 21:03.280
 like we don't even know what Romeo and Juliet is, right? Our movies is never about love stories.

21:03.280 --> 21:10.080
 But then also they ban the love between mother and daughter, wife and husband. And you know,

21:10.880 --> 21:18.000
 and you between your friends, they deny you being a human. So only love that I knew was when I describe

21:18.000 --> 21:23.680
 my feeling towards the leader and in a written form. That was the only love that people know in

21:23.680 --> 21:29.520
 North Korea. And now I'm like, there are many loves you can experience. I mean, I think you

21:29.520 --> 21:36.800
 definitely love science, right? But imagine that if you're being denied that. So there are so many

21:36.800 --> 21:44.800
 loves in life, but in North Korea, all of those things are denied. And I think for me, love what

21:44.800 --> 21:50.160
 makes you tick, like, you know, love for your child, love for your parents, love for your friends,

21:50.160 --> 21:57.440
 love for even yourself, that is denied. So I mean, many people say like love is an option,

21:57.440 --> 22:02.800
 but like, then why do you live? I think we live to love. And it doesn't have to be romantic love.

22:02.800 --> 22:10.160
 It can be anything. But finding love in any person or in any subject, I think that's a goal. I think

22:10.160 --> 22:14.800
 that's when people find the meaning in something. Yeah, I think love, romantic love is just one sort

22:14.800 --> 22:21.280
 of part of it. One echo of the some core thing. Yeah, science, I love science, I love robots,

22:21.280 --> 22:28.720
 all of those things. And it sounds like deliberately or not, the North Korean regime

22:29.680 --> 22:35.360
 wants to channel that very deep aspect of the human spirit all towards the leader.

22:35.360 --> 22:42.080
 Yeah, that's it. That's the only thing they allow us to fear and know about. So I remember,

22:42.800 --> 22:48.480
 I mean, you read 1984 by George Orwell, it talks about double think and double speak,

22:48.480 --> 22:54.640
 who controls the language, who controls thoughts. And while he does talk about as they go, they

22:54.640 --> 23:00.000
 like eliminate a lot of words, right? Now, like later, one word can represent 10 different things.

23:00.720 --> 23:07.600
 And like what fascinates me is like how many vocabulary meaning people can have. And like

23:07.600 --> 23:14.080
 when I literally came out, remember when the San Francisco and someone came to me and hugged me,

23:14.080 --> 23:19.120
 and then he was a guy like, oh, baby, don't worry, I'm gay. I was like, what the heck is gay? I

23:19.120 --> 23:24.720
 don't know, right? And then they tried to go to a hotel and Google the gay. And I was like, oh,

23:24.720 --> 23:30.800
 that's what you meant. And like that, like, they deny what that is. I'm sure there are gays in

23:30.800 --> 23:37.920
 North Korea. I'm sure there is. But you don't know what it is. And like that, they eliminate words.

23:37.920 --> 23:43.440
 So the fact that you know the concept, that is stays much better than and that that's the thing

23:43.440 --> 23:49.280
 a lot of people like when you're born, you somehow know what justice is, what liberties and it's

23:49.280 --> 23:55.600
 or somebody taught you that. And like that's the thing where people say, oh, humans are inherently

23:55.600 --> 24:00.880
 know what is right, what is wrong, what is oppression. And like, you know, that's like BS.

24:00.880 --> 24:09.280
 You got to learn. That's fascinating that words give rise to ideas. So like as a child,

24:09.280 --> 24:15.520
 one of the ways to learn about justice and freedom is to first learn the word and then to ask, well,

24:15.520 --> 24:21.040
 what is it? Yeah, the concept. Yeah. And if you don't have the word for it, then you never have the

24:21.040 --> 24:26.400
 kind of first spark that leads to you trying to be curious about it. That's interesting and controlling

24:26.400 --> 24:32.800
 the words. And then learning your thoughts. You control the thoughts. There's so many echoes.

24:32.800 --> 24:39.280
 I mean, I have, it's a very different, but perhaps a very similar experience, which is the journey of

24:39.280 --> 24:46.400
 my family through the Soviet Union. Because there is a love of country, there is a pride of the people.

24:46.400 --> 24:52.640
 Yeah. Like you are proud of your family in general. Yeah. But I wonder how much of that is polluted

24:52.640 --> 25:02.640
 by the propaganda. I think a lot, for sure. Yeah. It is here this day. I'm like, my father who died

25:02.640 --> 25:10.640
 in China and he was tortured and then he died. He wanted to go back before his death, right? And

25:10.640 --> 25:16.640
 then it's like, dad, if you go back, you're going to be executed. And it's like, I want to be executed.

25:16.640 --> 25:26.640
 He wanted to go back to North Korea. To be executed. So he can be buried in his own land.

25:26.640 --> 25:34.640
 And then his last wish was, if I die, criminate me and then bring my ashes back to my country.

25:34.640 --> 25:40.640
 When I'm dead, I still want to be in my country. And this is a nationalism. This is a propaganda, right?

25:40.640 --> 25:48.640
 But now, it's the same thing. It's the same thing. If I die, I somehow buried in my land.

25:48.640 --> 25:54.640
 And I still feel like I'm the outsider. I'm always longing for my home. It's a horrible home.

25:54.640 --> 25:58.640
 People say, what's your dream? Do you want to be a president? Do you want to run for office?

25:58.640 --> 26:04.640
 I just want to go home. That's my dream, right? And people here don't get it ever.

26:04.640 --> 26:14.640
 I don't know what to do with that. I love my country. And I think for me, my country is the United States.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.640
 And perhaps it will be for you too one day.

26:16.640 --> 26:22.640
 It is. I think it's becoming, the US has been a very special place in my heart. I think this is the first place.

26:22.640 --> 26:30.640
 I felt like I feel like home. And I mean, I was in South Korea longer and I didn't feel that way.

26:30.640 --> 26:36.640
 So I think we have very different life stories, but I think it's almost two different people.

26:36.640 --> 26:42.640
 For me, it's the person that was in the Soviet Union, the person that's here. Those are two different people.

26:42.640 --> 26:50.640
 That previous person's home in the Soviet Union. And he's part of me. And I suppose in that same way,

26:50.640 --> 26:58.640
 your first maybe two decades of life are somehow longing for the home that is North Korea.

26:58.640 --> 27:06.640
 And your next two decades of life might be finding a home in the United States.

27:06.640 --> 27:16.640
 Your dad, can you tell the story of his struggle, of his death?

27:16.640 --> 27:20.640
 Do you miss him? Do you think about him?

27:20.640 --> 27:28.640
 You know, all the time. I had a son when I was 22 and I had IVF three times.

27:28.640 --> 27:32.640
 And as you see, I'm like 80 pounds, but back then I was like 75 pounds.

27:32.640 --> 27:38.640
 Because of my severe malnutrition, somehow my body is very different.

27:38.640 --> 27:46.640
 And so after three times of IVF after 23, I was still wanting family.

27:46.640 --> 27:54.640
 The reason I wanted him is because I felt so guilty for my father that he never seen this world.

27:54.640 --> 27:58.640
 Somehow, when you're so desperate, you become illogical.

27:58.640 --> 28:04.640
 Like, I want to believe in that I really can't, like Buddhist idea, right? You come back to life.

28:04.640 --> 28:10.640
 And I prayed, please come to me like as my son, so I will take care of you. Like come back.

28:10.640 --> 28:16.640
 And when I was pregnant with my son, even though I planted pregnant with a girl,

28:16.640 --> 28:20.640
 doctor made a mistake. He became a boy.

28:20.640 --> 28:23.640
 So I made his middle name, like my father's name, Jin Sik.

28:23.640 --> 28:28.640
 I think he's the only North American God, North Korean name.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.640
 It is.

28:30.640 --> 28:33.640
 So he's a part of your father's and your son?

28:33.640 --> 28:40.640
 That's how I, that's how I make the sense of it. And that's how I move forward.

28:40.640 --> 28:48.640
 Like if I, like as a logical human being, you, you know, when you're done, maybe that's what I at least used to think.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.640
 But then life just become too unbearable.

28:51.640 --> 28:55.640
 And somehow that's the thing, like we tell ourselves stories in order to live.

28:55.640 --> 28:59.640
 And that's how I can read my title of the book in order to live.

28:59.640 --> 29:07.640
 I had to tell myself a lot of stories to overcome a lot of things. I think I was a part of it.

29:07.640 --> 29:14.640
 Can you tell the story of you escaping North Korea to China?

29:14.640 --> 29:21.640
 Yeah, I think it's, it's amazing.

29:21.640 --> 29:29.640
 Even though I was like 13, right? Like life outside of North Korea is almost like went by like one second.

29:29.640 --> 29:33.640
 And my life till that point was like eternity.

29:33.640 --> 29:39.640
 I remember being in China, I arrived there at the end of March at 13.

29:39.640 --> 29:43.640
 And by October, it was six months past.

29:43.640 --> 29:52.640
 And I literally felt like I lived eternity and one day living in China felt like living one year.

29:52.640 --> 29:57.640
 One day was like surviving through one day was so hard.

29:57.640 --> 30:02.640
 Every night I was like, I cannot believe I got done one day today.

30:02.640 --> 30:05.640
 That was the thing why I was grateful for before I went to bed.

30:05.640 --> 30:11.640
 Okay, I survived. I didn't get captured and I made another day on Earth.

30:11.640 --> 30:19.640
 So the experience of the minutes is what? Fear? Fear of being captured?

30:19.640 --> 30:23.640
 Fear, loss, everything.

30:23.640 --> 30:30.640
 Because I mean, I saw my own mom in China to survive.

30:30.640 --> 30:35.640
 So it was more than that. And it's not feeling. I think that's the thing.

30:35.640 --> 30:44.640
 In China, I learned not to fear. And after my escape was a challenge, I didn't feel anything.

30:44.640 --> 30:50.640
 And it was hard. Not feeling anything is a torture. It's the biggest torture you can ever feel.

30:50.640 --> 30:55.640
 Like even you feel sadness, that's better than not feeling anything.

30:55.640 --> 31:00.640
 And I felt something when I had my son. That's when I started healing.

31:00.640 --> 31:07.640
 So he was a miracle to save me. But yeah, in China, it wasn't even fear. It was numb.

31:07.640 --> 31:13.640
 You were numb. It was like paralysis. Just overwhelming.

31:13.640 --> 31:19.640
 The uncertainty of your future. Did you have a sense what your future held at the time?

31:19.640 --> 31:22.640
 What even future? I don't even know that word.

31:22.640 --> 31:28.640
 A lot of times I was looking at myself. I left my body and just looking at me.

31:28.640 --> 31:33.640
 And just not feeling anything. It's not like I'm scared of her. I'm sad for her.

31:33.640 --> 31:37.640
 Just looking at me like, oh, that's interesting.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.640
 Wow.

31:38.640 --> 31:45.640
 Just not feeling anything. And me being raped, going through every emotion of life to survive.

31:45.640 --> 31:50.640
 But somehow, I don't know if you say so or something.

31:50.640 --> 31:57.640
 Looking at it, you feel nothing. You don't feel anything for that person.

31:57.640 --> 32:10.640
 So even with your mom, was there some warmth that you were able to extract from the connection with your mom?

32:10.640 --> 32:17.640
 Yeah, of course. I think that made me survive. I had a very strong connection with my family.

32:17.640 --> 32:21.640
 And I think that's what kept me going to do all of that.

32:21.640 --> 32:29.640
 I think, as you said, I escaped at 13. My sister, at the age of 16, escaped with her friend first.

32:29.640 --> 32:34.640
 And I was going to escape with her. But one day I got like really bad stomach ache.

32:34.640 --> 32:40.640
 And my parents took me to a hospital. And in North Korean hospitals, they don't have like X ray machines.

32:40.640 --> 32:46.640
 They don't even have electricity. They like literally using one needle to inject everybody.

32:46.640 --> 32:51.640
 And people don't die from cancer in North Korea. You die from infection and fever and hunger, right?

32:51.640 --> 32:56.640
 Most likely you're going to die more by being treated by a doctor than not being treated.

32:56.640 --> 33:03.640
 I think I was lucky. Even though they thought I had appendix, they operated on me without any painkillers.

33:03.640 --> 33:06.640
 And I didn't get infection. I survived.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.640
 So that's how I got delayed to escape with my sister.

33:10.640 --> 33:15.640
 And she left me a note in my bedside saying, like, follow this lady.

33:15.640 --> 33:19.640
 And this is like another trick about human trafficking rate.

33:19.640 --> 33:25.640
 She sold me to China as a sexual slave. And she executed for it later.

33:25.640 --> 33:28.640
 She was executed for that later.

33:28.640 --> 33:33.640
 She had five daughters and she sold all her children to China.

33:33.640 --> 33:40.640
 And we can now sitting here judging on like how hard it is you are selling your own children to China.

33:40.640 --> 33:44.640
 And as a sexual slave, they were like her children were like seven, 10 years old.

33:44.640 --> 33:48.640
 But that was the only way for her to save her children.

33:48.640 --> 33:52.640
 And if she didn't serve me that day, I would be dead right now.

33:52.640 --> 33:55.640
 So I'm grateful that she sold me.

33:55.640 --> 34:01.640
 And I think that's the thing is life is so crazy. You cannot judge.

34:01.640 --> 34:07.640
 It is so complex. And yeah, that's how she changed my life by selling me.

34:07.640 --> 34:10.640
 She sold my mom and myself in 2007 to China.

34:10.640 --> 34:14.640
 So you're grateful for that. You're grateful for that suffering.

34:14.640 --> 34:16.640
 Of course I am grateful.

34:16.640 --> 34:18.640
 Because the alternative is worse.

34:18.640 --> 34:24.640
 I would not be here with you. You never knew what I just said.

34:24.640 --> 34:28.640
 What do you make of the others suffering in the world today?

34:28.640 --> 34:31.640
 The people there in North Korea.

34:31.640 --> 34:38.640
 So that is part of your life's work is helping those people.

34:38.640 --> 34:42.640
 What do you think about them? What should people know about them?

34:42.640 --> 34:46.640
 I think that's when I get angry. Whenever I think about them.

34:46.640 --> 34:52.640
 Who's your anger directed at?

34:52.640 --> 34:58.640
 The heartlessness of people. The ignorance of people.

34:58.640 --> 35:02.640
 So when I got out of North Korea, I went to all of them.

35:02.640 --> 35:07.640
 And I went to South Korea one day. I was watching television.

35:07.640 --> 35:14.640
 And there's like famous Korean Kpop stars crying and doing some fundraising concert.

35:14.640 --> 35:19.640
 And I literally thought, oh my god, something is horribly going wrong in this country.

35:19.640 --> 35:21.640
 Why are these people crying?

35:21.640 --> 35:28.640
 It was a theory campaign. And then later it was showing that it was an animal rights campaign.

35:28.640 --> 35:33.640
 To helping out cats and puppies in the shelters.

35:33.640 --> 35:37.640
 Do you know anybody who has their tears like that? To another human being right now?

35:37.640 --> 35:43.640
 Like no. People rather give millions of dollars to save some dolphins

35:43.640 --> 35:47.640
 than saving these children right now being raped in China.

35:47.640 --> 35:55.640
 And I think I love Elon Musk. I love these people who want to go to the moon, Mars.

35:55.640 --> 36:00.640
 And people told them, yeah, we went to the moon. I did not know in North Korea.

36:00.640 --> 36:05.640
 But I think that's what upsets me. Why there's not even one single human

36:05.640 --> 36:08.640
 with that kind of brilliance in their brain?

36:08.640 --> 36:13.640
 They can't save so much suffering, but nobody does anything.

36:13.640 --> 36:18.640
 I think that's when I feel like hard to find hope in humanity.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.640
 And that's when I get so upset.

36:20.640 --> 36:25.640
 Because think about like even Biden or Trump or Obama.

36:25.640 --> 36:28.640
 They know what's happening in North Korea exactly, right?

36:28.640 --> 36:31.640
 We see satellite photos. There's public executions.

36:31.640 --> 36:35.640
 I mean, the UN says this is a Holocaust happening again.

36:35.640 --> 36:42.640
 And if the Holocaust is happening again, how are you okay doing nothing about it?

36:42.640 --> 36:46.640
 But somehow humans are able to okay nothing, anything.

36:46.640 --> 36:50.640
 And this is like, this is hard.

36:50.640 --> 36:54.640
 Like when people say I'm going to change the world, I want to make a difference.

36:54.640 --> 36:58.640
 It's hard to believe it, you know.

36:58.640 --> 37:02.640
 Yeah, that we can turn our back to human suffering at scale when it's right in front of us.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.640
 I mean, that makes you think about the Holocaust.

37:04.640 --> 37:09.640
 Everybody was looking the other way.

37:09.640 --> 37:12.640
 Because it was almost too hard to look at it.

37:12.640 --> 37:15.640
 No, it's not. It's an easier thing.

37:15.640 --> 37:19.640
 I was like here to speak at the South by Southwest a few years ago.

37:19.640 --> 37:23.640
 And they were everybody talking about like Elon Musk project going to the moon, right?

37:23.640 --> 37:26.640
 It's going to be more like species.

37:26.640 --> 37:29.640
 Back then I didn't even know who it was.

37:29.640 --> 37:35.640
 So if you're just trying to go out to this earth, you haven't even explored our earth yet.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.640
 You cannot go to North Korea right now.

37:37.640 --> 37:40.640
 You haven't explored that part of our planet.

37:40.640 --> 37:44.640
 Can we do that first and then move on?

37:44.640 --> 37:48.640
 Explore the landscape of human suffering, like alleviate suffering in the world.

37:48.640 --> 37:53.640
 There's a lot of suffering happening in Africa that has to do with disease.

37:53.640 --> 37:59.640
 And for some reason it's, even though we turn our back to that kind of suffering too,

37:59.640 --> 38:03.640
 we still can try to do something about it.

38:03.640 --> 38:08.640
 And there's still efforts in terms of healthcare, in terms of medicine,

38:08.640 --> 38:12.640
 in terms of bioengineering, in terms of like all these efforts to help people from disease.

38:12.640 --> 38:17.640
 But like that's almost like converting it into an engineering problem and trying to solve it.

38:17.640 --> 38:19.640
 That somehow is easier for us humans.

38:19.640 --> 38:29.640
 But when there's obvious sort of non disease related torture of humans, we look the other way.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.640
 Yeah.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.640
 Whether it's China or it's North Korea.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.640
 Yeah.

38:35.640 --> 38:38.640
 I mean that has to be changed somehow.

38:38.640 --> 38:39.640
 We have to change that somehow.

38:39.640 --> 38:45.640
 This is the thing right now, like China, they bring the Xinjiang Uighurs, right?

38:45.640 --> 38:51.640
 They like say, oh, this vitamin take it and then it kills their sperm and make it not reproduce.

38:51.640 --> 38:56.640
 Their birth rate gone down something 47 to something 50% in the one year time.

38:56.640 --> 38:59.640
 It's a genocide in 21st century.

38:59.640 --> 39:03.640
 And they get those people and get their like organs out.

39:03.640 --> 39:08.640
 Imagine if there's some people who do that with cutie puppies and cats.

39:08.640 --> 39:13.640
 There's gonna be insane amount of product, they're gonna destroy everything.

39:13.640 --> 39:17.640
 And this is like a human nature that I don't get.

39:17.640 --> 39:21.640
 Why there's so much anti human sentiment in this modern world?

39:21.640 --> 39:23.640
 We don't have to.

39:23.640 --> 39:28.640
 The fact that I was saying like the fact that you care about animals rights is beautiful.

39:28.640 --> 39:31.640
 Because you care about something who cannot speak for themselves.

39:31.640 --> 39:35.640
 The fact that we care about animals is because they cannot speak for themselves, right?

39:35.640 --> 39:38.640
 They don't have that ability.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.640
 And there are many people who cannot speak for themselves right now.

39:41.640 --> 39:44.640
 And why do you refuse to be the voice for them?

39:44.640 --> 39:46.640
 Because they are simply being a human.

39:46.640 --> 39:52.640
 And maybe it connects to us not being proud of who we are.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.640
 Like maybe I don't know what it is.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.640
 Why do they deny humans this way?

39:57.640 --> 39:59.640
 Maybe they don't like themselves.

39:59.640 --> 40:02.640
 Yeah, it's almost...

40:02.640 --> 40:09.640
 We would have to acknowledge some dark things about ourselves in order to start helping.

40:09.640 --> 40:10.640
 What's the solution?

40:10.640 --> 40:13.640
 So, I see two solutions.

40:13.640 --> 40:17.640
 One is on the military side.

40:17.640 --> 40:23.640
 It's assassination or the full on invasion.

40:23.640 --> 40:32.640
 And then on the activism side, which is figuring out ways to...

40:32.640 --> 40:39.640
 Like you said, sort of let people in North Korea understand their situation.

40:39.640 --> 40:42.640
 Sort of from within, try to reform.

40:42.640 --> 40:43.640
 Or maybe there's others.

40:43.640 --> 40:50.640
 Obviously, there could be activism from the outside to build up momentum for the entirety of the world.

40:50.640 --> 40:57.640
 Especially the world that is not just the United States or Europe, but also is Russia and China and so on.

40:57.640 --> 40:59.640
 What are your ideas here?

40:59.640 --> 41:04.640
 What we can do as individuals and as countries?

41:04.640 --> 41:11.640
 I think the first thing that we can do is speak about Chinese law in this sponsoring dictatorship in North Korea.

41:11.640 --> 41:16.640
 Like, I haven't had so much struggle talking about North Korea, right?

41:16.640 --> 41:18.640
 They say, how North Korea is possible?

41:18.640 --> 41:21.640
 Why is it like the way like this is?

41:21.640 --> 41:25.640
 99% accountability going to CCP.

41:25.640 --> 41:30.640
 Kim Jong Un cannot last without Chinese help even one week.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.640
 This is completely funded.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.640
 This Holocaust is funded by CCP.

41:35.640 --> 41:38.640
 But if you talk about in the mainstream, of course, they don't buy it.

41:38.640 --> 41:45.640
 And I think it's in a way, North Korea is a lot easier to solve than even in the Middle East.

41:45.640 --> 41:48.640
 There's nothing conflict like between people.

41:48.640 --> 41:50.640
 There's no ideology, no religion, nothing.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.640
 People are peaceful, right?

41:52.640 --> 41:54.640
 There's not even one civil...

41:54.640 --> 41:56.640
 Like any discontent among the people.

41:56.640 --> 42:02.640
 All problem is, there's a dictator funded by the second economic power in the world.

42:02.640 --> 42:07.640
 And even any military, they know if they kill Kim Jong Un, they're going to get killed by Chinese.

42:07.640 --> 42:12.640
 Nobody can dare to stand up against Kim Jong Un because China is backing it.

42:12.640 --> 42:21.640
 So somehow, here in the West, we collectively acknowledging that China is the responsible person for these crimes against humanity in North Korea.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.640
 Then we can somehow...

42:24.640 --> 42:26.640
 Stand up to China.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.640
 Exactly.

42:27.640 --> 42:34.640
 We're failing to do that in a way in all kinds of avenues of life, of public life.

42:34.640 --> 42:40.640
 Because for many reasons, they're probably primarily financial.

42:40.640 --> 42:43.640
 But it also...

42:43.640 --> 42:45.640
 I'm against...

42:45.640 --> 42:47.640
 I don't know, maybe you can correct me.

42:47.640 --> 42:53.640
 I'm against sort of making China this evil enemy.

42:53.640 --> 42:58.640
 Because I've seen this with Russia as well.

42:58.640 --> 43:01.640
 And I don't think that leads to progress.

43:01.640 --> 43:03.640
 I think you want to highlight...

43:03.640 --> 43:11.640
 You basically want to help the Chinese people become the best version of themselves.

43:11.640 --> 43:21.640
 So speak to the Chinese people and not making the leaders of China into these caricatures of devils.

43:21.640 --> 43:25.640
 I feel like the Cold War, the way it was done in Russia, I just...

43:25.640 --> 43:31.640
 For both sides, they were caricaturing each other through propaganda and the result was not productive at all.

43:31.640 --> 43:34.640
 It did not help Russia become the best country it could be.

43:34.640 --> 43:37.640
 It did not help America become the best country it could be.

43:37.640 --> 43:41.640
 And the same thing with China, I feel like making them into this enemy,

43:41.640 --> 43:47.640
 like being afraid of China, making them into the thing that's going to spy on us,

43:47.640 --> 43:49.640
 that's going to destroy the rest of the world,

43:49.640 --> 43:53.640
 that's not going to help China reform themselves.

43:53.640 --> 43:55.640
 They're going to plant their feet.

43:55.640 --> 43:58.640
 The dictators, the evil people, will become more evil.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.640
 The power of Hungary will become more...

44:01.640 --> 44:03.640
 They will centralize the power more.

44:03.640 --> 44:05.640
 It feels like...

44:05.640 --> 44:10.640
 Maybe naive, but it feels like it should be...

44:10.640 --> 44:13.640
 Again, love, not violence that solves this thing.

44:13.640 --> 44:18.640
 Now, of course, in North Korea, it's like long gone.

44:18.640 --> 44:21.640
 80 years, almost 80 years.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.640
 Love is not going to solve that problem.

44:23.640 --> 44:25.640
 I mean, I don't... It's very difficult.

44:25.640 --> 44:27.640
 They have tried that.

44:27.640 --> 44:33.640
 Because of the sunshine policy, which is there's two people walking down the street,

44:33.640 --> 44:35.640
 and the sun and the wind made a battle.

44:35.640 --> 44:38.640
 So who can take off that man take off jacket?

44:38.640 --> 44:41.640
 So wind tried to blow as much air as he could,

44:41.640 --> 44:44.640
 and then that man was like putting more like his jacket on, right?

44:44.640 --> 44:45.640
 Not taking off.

44:45.640 --> 44:48.640
 But sunshine came, okay, I'm going to give him a lot of warmth,

44:48.640 --> 44:50.640
 and then he took his jacket out and came out.

44:50.640 --> 44:52.640
 So that was the theory.

44:52.640 --> 44:54.640
 Let's give North Korea as much love they want.

44:54.640 --> 44:57.640
 Let's give them a lot of money, whatever they want.

44:57.640 --> 44:58.640
 Let's give to them.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.640
 Do they know that we are not here to attack them?

45:00.640 --> 45:01.640
 Yeah.

45:01.640 --> 45:05.640
 And North Korea, what they did was the guy who did the sunshine policy in South Korea

45:05.640 --> 45:08.640
 named Kim Dae Joon won the Nobel Peace Prize for that.

45:08.640 --> 45:12.640
 And Kim Jong Il used the money to build new Korean weapons.

45:12.640 --> 45:15.640
 So that's how they came with the nukes.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.640
 So I think that's the thing.

45:18.640 --> 45:20.640
 I hope your love solves problems.

45:20.640 --> 45:24.640
 But there's got to be a way, and the hope is with the 21st century,

45:24.640 --> 45:26.640
 you can directly speak to the people somehow.

45:26.640 --> 45:29.640
 When there's no internet, when there's nothing like that, it's hopeless.

45:29.640 --> 45:34.640
 I think China, there's a hope that China is still connected to the internet.

45:34.640 --> 45:36.640
 I love your optimism.

45:36.640 --> 45:41.640
 I have seen the actual dark side of China on the underground.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.640
 I hope...

45:43.640 --> 45:44.640
 I think that's the thing.

45:44.640 --> 45:46.640
 People in the West, right?

45:46.640 --> 45:48.640
 They say, oh, how can it be that bad?

45:48.640 --> 45:53.640
 They ask me, like, I'm walking past this young teenager man

45:53.640 --> 45:56.640
 and native the world with my sister.

45:56.640 --> 46:00.640
 He's, like, intestine coming out through his back, right?

46:00.640 --> 46:05.640
 And even in that moment, what he wanted was, please give me food.

46:05.640 --> 46:06.640
 He was hungry.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.640
 His intestine is hanging out of his body.

46:08.640 --> 46:09.640
 Yeah.

46:09.640 --> 46:10.640
 And he's...

46:10.640 --> 46:11.640
 He asked me for food.

46:11.640 --> 46:15.640
 Do you know what humans demand when they die in North Korea?

46:15.640 --> 46:17.640
 All they want is eating, right?

46:17.640 --> 46:18.640
 Yeah.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.640
 And people say, oh, nothing can be that bad.

46:21.640 --> 46:26.640
 But people just here haven't seen an actual true evil.

46:26.640 --> 46:30.640
 Would you say that the evil comes from a tiny minority of people,

46:30.640 --> 46:33.640
 or is it permeate much larger parts of the population?

46:33.640 --> 46:36.640
 Like, if we look at sex trafficking,

46:36.640 --> 46:40.640
 how many people...

46:40.640 --> 46:50.640
 Like, is it 99.9% of the people are longing to do good in the world?

46:50.640 --> 46:51.640
 Or is there...

46:51.640 --> 46:53.640
 Is it...

46:53.640 --> 46:57.640
 Or do we all have the capacity for evil in certain kind of environment,

46:57.640 --> 47:02.640
 certain kind of governmental structures inspire a large part of the population

47:02.640 --> 47:04.640
 to do bad things?

47:04.640 --> 47:07.640
 I think humans are capable of anything.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.640
 There's no exception.

47:09.640 --> 47:12.640
 I don't think there's anything to bomb with that morality.

47:12.640 --> 47:18.640
 I think in North Korea, you can say initially that there's few guys in the top

47:18.640 --> 47:21.640
 wanting the power and then doing this.

47:21.640 --> 47:27.640
 But eventually it made a society where people don't even know what compassion is.

47:27.640 --> 47:28.640
 We don't know the concept of...

47:28.640 --> 47:32.640
 We don't know that you need to feel bad for another human being when they're suffering.

47:32.640 --> 47:35.640
 The fact that you know compassion is in your knowledge.

47:35.640 --> 47:37.640
 That's why you do that.

47:37.640 --> 47:39.640
 Humans need to learn.

47:39.640 --> 47:41.640
 It's not anything bad about human nature.

47:41.640 --> 47:44.640
 It's just saying humans are capable of everything.

47:44.640 --> 47:47.640
 We are the most adaptable species on the planet.

47:47.640 --> 47:51.640
 That's why we created the internet, like talking this way, right?

47:51.640 --> 47:54.640
 No other animals have done it because we are so adaptable.

47:54.640 --> 47:57.640
 That is a good thing and that's a bad thing.

47:57.640 --> 48:03.640
 In that adaptable situation, during the Holocaust, those people,

48:03.640 --> 48:08.640
 they could have been capable of good too if they were exposed to different systems.

48:08.640 --> 48:13.640
 That's why when people underestimate evil, that's what scares me.

48:13.640 --> 48:15.640
 Evil is evil.

48:15.640 --> 48:17.640
 It's a different thing.

48:17.640 --> 48:19.640
 It's a completely different thing.

48:19.640 --> 48:28.640
 Of course, I get your idea. We don't want to isolate 1.3 billion human beings on Earth by Chinese.

48:28.640 --> 48:32.640
 The thing is, we are talking about this regime, not the people.

48:32.640 --> 48:34.640
 I love Chinese people. I speak Chinese.

48:34.640 --> 48:39.640
 I love all about that country, but this system does promote evil.

48:39.640 --> 48:44.640
 That's an optimistic view, actually, because we can fix systems.

48:44.640 --> 48:46.640
 It's hard to fix people.

48:46.640 --> 48:50.640
 If we fix systems, then the people are adaptable, as you said.

48:50.640 --> 48:55.640
 The question is, first of all, you have to talk about it just as you're doing.

48:55.640 --> 49:01.640
 You're right now like this little flame that burns bright and it's really important for North Korea.

49:01.640 --> 49:11.640
 Just keep talking about it until hopefully it leads to, at the highest levels of power,

49:11.640 --> 49:17.640
 revolutionizing the systems in the world and then in China and in North Korea.

49:17.640 --> 49:22.640
 Do you see North Korea being a potential instigator of a nuclear war?

49:22.640 --> 49:29.640
 They will not start a nuclear war as long as they can do whatever they want right now.

49:29.640 --> 49:34.640
 North Korea's army not designed to fight the enemy.

49:34.640 --> 49:40.640
 They designed to prevent their own people, the Kuteta and the revolution with their own citizens.

49:40.640 --> 49:49.640
 That is 1.6 million North Korea with a tiny country, the fourth largest army in the world.

49:49.640 --> 49:53.640
 This country designed to fight their own citizens.

49:53.640 --> 50:00.640
 The army, the fourth largest in the world, is designed to basically fight its own people.

50:00.640 --> 50:06.640
 Oppress their own people. That's what North Korea military is about.

50:06.640 --> 50:12.640
 Okay, let me ask you some aspects about North Korean life.

50:12.640 --> 50:17.640
 Can you describe the Songbun system of ascribed status used in North Korea?

50:17.640 --> 50:20.640
 Yeah, so that's a very interesting thing.

50:20.640 --> 50:27.640
 Right now there are a lot of people playing with this ideology of democratic socialism, socialism, communism, whatever you call it,

50:27.640 --> 50:29.640
 Marxism, Leninism, right?

50:29.640 --> 50:35.640
 They have all these similar features where we give collective power to a certain entity.

50:35.640 --> 50:39.640
 And they will make the decision for the bigger good, right?

50:39.640 --> 50:43.640
 And North Korea came up with the idea, the Kim Il Sung.

50:43.640 --> 50:46.640
 He was the Leninist, he was a Marxist, saying,

50:46.640 --> 50:50.640
 I'm going to create the most equal society on human face.

50:50.640 --> 50:52.640
 So it was a communist North Korea.

50:52.640 --> 50:58.640
 And then they came up with this Songbun system, it's like family caste system.

50:58.640 --> 51:03.640
 Three big categories, warrior, wavering and hostile.

51:03.640 --> 51:08.640
 And that in between three classes, they divide into 50 different classes.

51:08.640 --> 51:12.640
 So a lot of people don't even know which exact class you belong to.

51:12.640 --> 51:14.640
 That's a secret government document.

51:14.640 --> 51:16.640
 And that's how they decided your future.

51:16.640 --> 51:21.640
 So in North Korea, before you were born, your life is determined for you.

51:21.640 --> 51:23.640
 And this is almost a joke, right?

51:23.640 --> 51:26.640
 They dreamed of creating the most equal society.

51:26.640 --> 51:31.640
 They ended up with becoming the most unequal society in the face of humanity.

51:31.640 --> 51:36.640
 So there are 50 different classes and where the one guy on the top became a god.

51:36.640 --> 51:39.640
 So when this animal farm, as we keep saying,

51:39.640 --> 51:43.640
 all the animals are equal and some are more equal than others.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.640
 Exactly.

51:44.640 --> 51:47.640
 But it's not only, it's just more equal.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.640
 One guy in North Korea became a god.

51:49.640 --> 51:54.640
 So North Korea was born out of Marxist ideals?

51:54.640 --> 51:55.640
 Yeah.

51:55.640 --> 51:56.640
 It's from Stalin.

51:56.640 --> 52:06.640
 Can you comment on Juche ideology, which seems to be its own kind of socialism,

52:06.640 --> 52:13.640
 but with unique aspects here, it really does ideologically

52:13.640 --> 52:16.640
 says the importance of having a great leader.

52:16.640 --> 52:21.640
 Is there some interesting similarities or differences that you can comment on

52:21.640 --> 52:25.640
 between other implementations of communism throughout history?

52:25.640 --> 52:28.640
 The Soviet Union, China, elsewhere?

52:28.640 --> 52:30.640
 So Juche is very unique.

52:30.640 --> 52:33.640
 It came around the 90s after the Soviet Union collapsed.

52:33.640 --> 52:38.640
 So before that, North Korea was very still loyal to the Marxism and Leninism,

52:38.640 --> 52:41.640
 which the state takes care of you.

52:41.640 --> 52:45.640
 We are going to give you the right education, health care, your livelihood.

52:45.640 --> 52:47.640
 Everybody is going to be equal.

52:47.640 --> 52:51.640
 You're going to have in the working collective farm, collective workplace.

52:51.640 --> 52:56.640
 Everybody collectively do things together and let's work for the paradise.

52:56.640 --> 52:59.640
 But 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed.

52:59.640 --> 53:04.640
 And until then, North Korea was heavily subsidized by Soviet Union's aid.

53:04.640 --> 53:06.640
 And then Soviet Union didn't give them anything.

53:06.640 --> 53:09.640
 So not three million people dying on the streets.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.640
 The regime then came up with the idea,

53:11.640 --> 53:18.640
 okay, our goal is what is successful for us is keeping the 10% of population alive,

53:18.640 --> 53:20.640
 which is in the capital Pyongyang.

53:20.640 --> 53:22.640
 So they designed the hunger games.

53:22.640 --> 53:25.640
 There is a capital, 13 other districts.

53:25.640 --> 53:29.640
 Everybody on the countryside on purpose being starved.

53:29.640 --> 53:33.640
 So those people who are starving cannot thinking about meaning of life,

53:33.640 --> 53:35.640
 cannot thinking about shooting to the moon.

53:35.640 --> 53:37.640
 They're not going to think about anything.

53:37.640 --> 53:39.640
 Or they're going to think it's like finding next meal.

53:39.640 --> 53:41.640
 All on purpose.

53:41.640 --> 53:43.640
 All on purpose. It's man made famine.

53:43.640 --> 53:46.640
 International community was begging to give North Korea food.

53:46.640 --> 53:53.640
 Why not still at the UN? They beg to give North Korea formula, medicine and food.

53:53.640 --> 53:55.640
 They are begging, can you please feed your people?

53:55.640 --> 53:57.640
 And Kim Jong Un said, no, thank you.

53:57.640 --> 54:00.640
 Last year, when North Korea had a horrible, horrible flooding,

54:00.640 --> 54:02.640
 South Korean president begging,

54:02.640 --> 54:04.640
 can you get, can I give you please some medicines?

54:04.640 --> 54:05.640
 No.

54:05.640 --> 54:07.640
 Because he wants to be the one provider.

54:07.640 --> 54:10.640
 He doesn't want people to think other people giving him the thing.

54:10.640 --> 54:12.640
 So on purpose, other people starving.

54:12.640 --> 54:16.640
 And the Juche idea is that's when you're coming from.

54:16.640 --> 54:20.640
 So until that communism was about like status being a father figure.

54:20.640 --> 54:22.640
 Take care of all your needs, right?

54:22.640 --> 54:24.640
 Give the power to us and you're all good.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.640
 But North Korea regime said, okay, now we cannot give people's ration.

54:28.640 --> 54:32.640
 So which means Juche means self reliance.

54:32.640 --> 54:36.640
 You need to take care of yourself while you're giving every right to us.

54:36.640 --> 54:40.640
 So now in the 90s, the regime told us,

54:40.640 --> 54:42.640
 okay, we are not gonna give you ration.

54:42.640 --> 54:44.640
 You cannot trade, that's illegal.

54:44.640 --> 54:46.640
 But you find your own way to survive.

54:46.640 --> 54:48.640
 So be self reliant.

54:48.640 --> 54:50.640
 That's what Juche is.

54:50.640 --> 54:53.640
 And you know, but when you're a god, you can do whatever you want.

54:53.640 --> 54:55.640
 You don't need to make a sense.

54:55.640 --> 54:58.640
 That's the difference being a god and being a leader.

54:58.640 --> 55:01.640
 And when it is religion, it's not forceifiable.

55:01.640 --> 55:03.640
 You cannot challenge it.

55:03.640 --> 55:05.640
 God's way is suspicious.

55:05.640 --> 55:07.640
 God works in a mysterious way.

55:07.640 --> 55:12.640
 So when you're a god, people are not gonna say, oh, this doesn't make sense, right?

55:12.640 --> 55:17.640
 You're gonna, okay, whatever God says, as a human being, we can never challenge this thought.

55:17.640 --> 55:20.640
 It's unbelievable what regimes can do.

55:20.640 --> 55:35.640
 There's something about famine, you know, that is another level of evil to me.

55:35.640 --> 55:40.640
 You know what Stalin did in Ukraine in the 30s?

55:40.640 --> 55:42.640
 Yeah.

55:42.640 --> 55:44.640
 Fuck them.

55:44.640 --> 55:46.640
 Yeah.

55:46.640 --> 55:48.640
 This is what torture is.

55:48.640 --> 55:49.640
 Cannibalism.

55:49.640 --> 55:50.640
 Yeah.

55:50.640 --> 55:51.640
 And...

55:51.640 --> 55:54.640
 North Korea too, they are humans.

55:54.640 --> 55:59.640
 Right now, in 21st century, 7 billion people on this earth right now.

55:59.640 --> 56:05.640
 You make enough for 10 billion people, nobody should be starving right now.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.640
 It's worrisome to me.

56:07.640 --> 56:11.640
 The humanity is moving forward with technological advances, blah, blah.

56:11.640 --> 56:14.640
 We are going so fast in advancement.

56:14.640 --> 56:20.640
 And we are living this like 25 million human beings in the cage, completely leaving them behind.

56:20.640 --> 56:23.640
 And North Korea is living like 16 centuries.

56:23.640 --> 56:27.640
 I never, like this morning I was taking a shower, beautiful shower.

56:27.640 --> 56:29.640
 I never knew what shower was.

56:29.640 --> 56:33.640
 I was bathing a few times a year, going to the river.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.640
 How do I even know what shampoo is?

56:35.640 --> 56:39.640
 And this is how human beings in 21st century are living.

56:39.640 --> 56:43.640
 And it doesn't bother us, and rather, most people are obsessed with being a vegan.

56:43.640 --> 56:48.640
 And like, how do you reconcile this?

56:48.640 --> 56:50.640
 I think we get used to stuff very quickly.

56:50.640 --> 56:51.640
 We get used to comforts.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.640
 That's just the way of human life.

56:53.640 --> 56:56.640
 You take the beautiful things for granted.

56:56.640 --> 57:02.640
 So I try to appreciate everything I have, so whether it's like the food I have now,

57:02.640 --> 57:06.640
 or like the luxury to have a diet and be struggling with that,

57:06.640 --> 57:10.640
 or just the basic simple moments of being alive with the people I love.

57:10.640 --> 57:13.640
 Or actually I get like, I think I'm on drugs all the time,

57:13.640 --> 57:19.640
 because I feel like just even like the smog, everything on this table just brings me joy.

57:19.640 --> 57:25.640
 But like, filling your life with joy in the full capitalistic American way,

57:25.640 --> 57:31.640
 you can still, at the same time, not feel too bad about yourself,

57:31.640 --> 57:34.640
 and still focus on the suffering in the world.

57:34.640 --> 57:44.640
 And I think there's some way that in trying to build a better world in America,

57:44.640 --> 57:47.640
 it has ripple effects elsewhere.

57:47.640 --> 57:53.640
 Sort of like, so I'm a fan of rockets in space.

57:53.640 --> 57:55.640
 It sounds perhaps counterintuitive,

57:55.640 --> 58:03.640
 but sending rockets to space will help solve the North Korea a problem,

58:03.640 --> 58:08.640
 because it lets people dream and build cool stuff.

58:08.640 --> 58:13.640
 So it's not the rocket, it's the other people that like are inspired by the rocket

58:13.640 --> 58:16.640
 and then look to other problems in the world.

58:16.640 --> 58:19.640
 I mean, that's what Elon did is like, he saw problems in the world

58:19.640 --> 58:22.640
 and saw like, what can I do to help it?

58:22.640 --> 58:26.640
 And I think the North Korea one is a tough one now,

58:26.640 --> 58:32.640
 because that ultimately has to do with revolutionizing government.

58:32.640 --> 58:34.640
 We gotta change China.

58:34.640 --> 58:36.640
 That's what it takes.

58:36.640 --> 58:39.640
 Changing China's communist party is impossible.

58:39.640 --> 58:42.640
 That's why we couldn't solve North Korea for that many decades.

58:42.640 --> 58:49.640
 For now it's China, but it's Russia.

58:49.640 --> 58:53.640
 It's certain aspects of the United States and struggling with that.

58:53.640 --> 58:58.640
 There's a bunch of technologies that are striving at this.

58:58.640 --> 59:02.640
 For example, I don't know what your thoughts about cryptocurrencies.

59:02.640 --> 59:03.640
 I love it.

59:03.640 --> 59:08.640
 So there's an idea that money could be a way to destroy

59:08.640 --> 59:12.640
 or to challenge the power centers of the world.

59:12.640 --> 59:16.640
 So if you take away the power from fiat currency

59:16.640 --> 59:19.640
 and give it to this thing that can't be controlled by government,

59:19.640 --> 59:22.640
 this cryptocurrency, whether it's Bitcoin, Ethereum, all those kinds of things,

59:22.640 --> 59:26.640
 that's a way to get money into the hands of people

59:26.640 --> 59:29.640
 to where the government can't take that money away.

59:29.640 --> 59:33.640
 But North Koreans don't have electricity, no internet.

59:33.640 --> 59:35.640
 So we can do that with China.

59:35.640 --> 59:39.640
 We can do it with a lot of African dictatorship countries, right?

59:39.640 --> 59:44.640
 I do think cryptocurrency is such a fascinating technology, right?

59:44.640 --> 59:46.640
 I think this is an amazing experiment.

59:46.640 --> 59:51.640
 When the power is in our hands, I'm the huge out of game believer.

59:51.640 --> 59:55.640
 But I think North Korea is too behind, you know?

59:55.640 --> 59:59.640
 I think that's what is unique about North Korea is that most of the things that we talk about

59:59.640 --> 1:00:02.640
 is different planet, literally.

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:07.640
 The common law that we have is now applicable.

1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:10.640
 What about Kim Jong Un?

1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:11.640
 Kim Jong Un, yeah.

1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:18.640
 Is he intentionally evil or is he mindlessly propagating an evil system

1:00:18.640 --> 1:00:20.640
 created by his ancestors?

1:00:20.640 --> 1:00:22.640
 What's your sense of the man?

1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:26.640
 So with Kim Jong Un, I can give him more benefit of that.

1:00:26.640 --> 1:00:30.640
 He was an initial true believer of communism.

1:00:30.640 --> 1:00:34.640
 But then as later he gained the power, he realized,

1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:37.640
 I think back then he thought most of the people are done,

1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:42.640
 like individual's done, so therefore I need to make a decision for all of you.

1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.640
 That pure arrogance came from out of him.

1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:47.640
 Even that I can tolerate, okay?

1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:48.640
 Fine.

1:00:48.640 --> 1:00:52.640
 And Kim Jong Un, who never like, yeah, fine, he grew up in that system too.

1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:55.640
 But Kim Jong Un is very unique.

1:00:55.640 --> 1:01:01.640
 This guy was educated in Switzerland in the heart of democracy.

1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:05.640
 He knew how human beings should be treated.

1:01:05.640 --> 1:01:07.640
 As a child he went.

1:01:07.640 --> 1:01:10.640
 When you're a child, your brain is very susceptible.

1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:11.640
 Yeah.

1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:12.640
 Right?

1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:13.640
 You change anybody.

1:01:13.640 --> 1:01:16.640
 Like why the man was so obsessed with changing young people's minds.

1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:19.640
 Like that's every revolutionary they do, right?

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:21.640
 They go change young people's minds first.

1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:25.640
 This guy was so obsessed with power, him being a god.

1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:28.640
 Even starting in Switzerland didn't change him.

1:01:28.640 --> 1:01:32.640
 And that's why I think that's a pure evil.

1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:36.640
 You know, I can give him more benefit of that to his grandfather and father.

1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:41.640
 But when it comes to Kim Jong Un, this is like what pure evil looks like.

1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:43.640
 Pure selfish being.

1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:46.640
 That's what it looks like.

1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:51.640
 Is there some sense where he's justifying everything he's doing to himself?

1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:56.640
 Or do you think there's a psychopathic aspect to where he enjoys the suffering?

1:01:56.640 --> 1:02:02.640
 I think in his life, I read a lot of North Korea, a lot of CIA documents,

1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:05.640
 a lot of intelligence people who worked there,

1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:08.640
 and even worked in North Korea and type illicit and escaped.

1:02:08.640 --> 1:02:10.640
 I could hear about them.

1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:15.640
 So Kim Jong Un, when they're born, they treat like gods.

1:02:15.640 --> 1:02:19.640
 So they never have a sense of them being a human.

1:02:19.640 --> 1:02:21.640
 They're like equal with others.

1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:24.640
 For them, we are just any kind of tool.

1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:27.640
 Like that one, Napoleon like thing does, right?

1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:28.640
 Anybody is a tool.

1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:32.640
 Like once boxer dies, get him slaughtered for my cause.

1:02:32.640 --> 1:02:34.640
 And they do not even feel guilty about it,

1:02:34.640 --> 1:02:37.640
 because they don't view us that you deserve your worthy of it.

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:38.640
 Yeah, that's right.

1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:43.640
 So it's not like he even feels, he doesn't even recognize that's a suffering.

1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:50.640
 Like of course you, this is what you do serving me, because I am this.

1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:52.640
 So I think that's like beyond that.

1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:55.640
 It's not like suffering is enters his mind.

1:02:55.640 --> 1:02:57.640
 He doesn't even think what we go through.

1:02:57.640 --> 1:03:00.640
 So he thinks of himself as a God.

1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:04.640
 And then everybody else is just tools that they're disposable.

1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:08.640
 There was rumors several times of him dying.

1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:14.640
 Do you think he is, obviously his health is not good.

1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:16.640
 Do you think he will die soon?

1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:20.640
 What happens if Kim Jong Un dies?

1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:24.640
 Well, when it comes to North Korea, anybody knows what Kim Jong Un does.

1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:25.640
 It's lie, right?

1:03:25.640 --> 1:03:26.640
 Nobody knows.

1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:29.640
 I'm sure CIA knows, but they may never reveal that.

1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:34.640
 CIA has enough intelligence to can tell where Kim Jong Un is, what he's doing.

1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:39.640
 They just don't assassinate him because they don't see the means of it right now.

1:03:39.640 --> 1:03:41.640
 Do you think they can't assassinate him?

1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:42.640
 They can.

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:43.640
 They do have ability to assassinate him.

1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:45.640
 Why the hell do they not assassinate him?

1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:46.640
 Because they don't care.

1:03:46.640 --> 1:03:49.640
 They don't care about the suffering of 25 million people.

1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:50.640
 They gotta pay the price.

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:54.640
 If they assassinate Kim Jong Un, they gotta pay the price afterwards.

1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:57.640
 There'll be financial, there'll be political price to pay.

1:03:57.640 --> 1:03:59.640
 It'll anger China.

1:03:59.640 --> 1:04:00.640
 Absolutely.

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:01.640
 That is a huge piece for them.

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:03.640
 And then they'll have to deal.

1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:09.640
 Obviously there'll be financial military consequences of having to deal with the turmoil, the uncertainty,

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:11.640
 the revolutions that will spring up.

1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:12.640
 Yeah.

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:13.640
 That's the thing.

1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:15.640
 That's why they don't want to take that risk.

1:04:15.640 --> 1:04:16.640
 They don't want to do anything.

1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:22.640
 The U.S. now became very passive when they pursued these moral values to the rest of the world.

1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:25.640
 They did the same thing with the Holocaust in the early days, actually.

1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:26.640
 Yeah.

1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:27.640
 They didn't care.

1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:30.640
 And that's what their policy has always been.

1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:31.640
 They don't care.

1:04:31.640 --> 1:04:38.640
 So if Kim Jong Un dies, it's gonna be very hard for North Korea to replace anybody in his position

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.640
 because Kim's is a brand.

1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:43.640
 It's not just a leader for us, right?

1:04:43.640 --> 1:04:46.640
 Whenever we think of Kim, who came with my mind.

1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:48.640
 Like who's like almost God figure.

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:52.640
 The North Korea is the number 10 religions in the world.

1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:54.640
 They copy the Bible.

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:59.640
 So if you believe that, if there are people believing that God and just Christ,

1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:02.640
 how do you not believe that North Korea believe in the same thing?

1:05:02.640 --> 1:05:08.640
 So Kim Il Sung's grandfather and his parents were devout Christians.

1:05:08.640 --> 1:05:13.640
 So Kim Il Sung grew up this Christian like word versus.

1:05:13.640 --> 1:05:16.640
 So when he found his country, he said,

1:05:16.640 --> 1:05:20.640
 I love my people so much that I'm giving you my son Kim Jong Il.

1:05:20.640 --> 1:05:23.640
 His body dies, but his spirit with us forever.

1:05:23.640 --> 1:05:26.640
 Who can know how many here I have, what I think.

1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:29.640
 And when we suffer, we go to paradise, really.

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:35.640
 And when you block every single information going into country, of course people will not believe it.

1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:38.640
 So who would be the successor if he dies?

1:05:38.640 --> 1:05:46.640
 He has a son, first son born 2009 and not old enough if he dies now.

1:05:46.640 --> 1:05:52.640
 So either his sister might rule for a short amount of time as not like a leader,

1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:56.640
 but like temporary placement.

1:05:56.640 --> 1:05:59.640
 And then when the son is older enough, he might take it off.

1:05:59.640 --> 1:06:01.640
 This is a kingdom that's most likely.

1:06:01.640 --> 1:06:09.640
 And China will do everything they can to maintain that status quo for the North Korean regime.

1:06:09.640 --> 1:06:12.640
 So North Korean people have no option here.

1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:18.640
 We just need some leader to courageously come up and do the right thing.

1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:20.640
 So we can't just wait this out?

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:21.640
 No, we can't.

1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:24.640
 It's not something going to take its course and not going to change.

1:06:24.640 --> 1:06:29.640
 Like we not even know that economic freedom does not bring political freedom.

1:06:29.640 --> 1:06:31.640
 It doesn't.

1:06:31.640 --> 1:06:33.640
 That's the unique thing about freedom.

1:06:33.640 --> 1:06:34.640
 You got to fight for it.

1:06:34.640 --> 1:06:36.640
 Otherwise you don't never get it.

1:06:36.640 --> 1:06:38.640
 Freedom is something has to be fought.

1:06:38.640 --> 1:06:43.640
 And if nobody fighting for freedom, it's not going to be there.

1:06:43.640 --> 1:06:45.640
 Can we talk a little bit about freedom?

1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:47.640
 What does it mean to you?

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:53.640
 Having had, we talked about love in the same way about freedom.

1:06:53.640 --> 1:06:56.640
 Having sort of discovered it later in life.

1:06:56.640 --> 1:06:58.640
 What does it mean to you?

1:06:58.640 --> 1:07:03.640
 I think every day I get new definition of freedom.

1:07:03.640 --> 1:07:09.640
 It is a never ending journey having this relationship with being free.

1:07:09.640 --> 1:07:12.640
 And what it means to be free, right?

1:07:12.640 --> 1:07:21.640
 I think you definitely can live life without being free and also happy life too.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:27.640
 I saw a lot of North Korean elites who were fat and have power but didn't have freedom or very happy.

1:07:27.640 --> 1:07:34.640
 In a way, happier than the people that I found in New York or investment bankers and consultants in Manhattan.

1:07:34.640 --> 1:07:38.640
 And 70% of them go talk to therapists.

1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:40.640
 I was very confused.

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:42.640
 I remember writing my book in New York.

1:07:42.640 --> 1:07:46.640
 My editor was saying, you know, you're traumatized.

1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:48.640
 You need to go talk to therapists.

1:07:48.640 --> 1:07:50.640
 And I was like, what is therapy?

1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:52.640
 What is trauma?

1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:56.640
 Because in North Korea, they don't have word for stress or trauma.

1:07:56.640 --> 1:07:59.640
 Because how can you be stressed in a socialist paradise?

1:07:59.640 --> 1:08:02.640
 So they don't let you be knowing what that is.

1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:08.640
 And then they were like, yeah, here in people having problems, go talk to therapists.

1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:10.640
 And I was like, how much is it?

1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:12.640
 I give them $200 per hour.

1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:14.640
 And it discounted rate too.

1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:17.640
 I was like, no, thank you.

1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:19.640
 I was like, you know.

1:08:19.640 --> 1:08:23.640
 And we know that freedom comes with responsibility.

1:08:23.640 --> 1:08:27.640
 And in a way, it's not that easy to be free.

1:08:27.640 --> 1:08:30.640
 Thinking for yourself constantly.

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:35.640
 Like when you, in a way, I understand, like, let's give government every power we have.

1:08:35.640 --> 1:08:37.640
 Let them decide what education that I get.

1:08:37.640 --> 1:08:39.640
 Let them decide where I live.

1:08:39.640 --> 1:08:42.640
 Like, you know, let someone figure that out for me.

1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:44.640
 And that's how North Korea began.

1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:47.640
 Hoping the government is going to represent my own interests.

1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:49.640
 Believing that they were good.

1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:54.640
 And with that benefit of that and good faith, it began the nightmare, right?

1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:55.640
 Yeah.

1:08:55.640 --> 1:08:59.640
 So freedom is not like a gateway to be happy at all.

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:02.640
 In a way, it can make life a lot more complex.

1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:04.640
 But then it's fun, isn't it?

1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.640
 You start thinking for yourself.

1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:08.640
 You start making mistakes.

1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:14.640
 And it's so fun to be free, even though you can be suffering way more than the people who are not free.

1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:17.640
 The thing about freedom is when you have freedom,

1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:19.640
 you also have the responsibility for your actions.

1:09:19.640 --> 1:09:21.640
 And that could be a huge burden.

1:09:21.640 --> 1:09:22.640
 Yeah.

1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:26.640
 Because if you succeed, it's you.

1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:29.640
 But if you fail, it's you.

1:09:29.640 --> 1:09:32.640
 And if you do horrible things, it's you.

1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:37.640
 If you don't do something, for example, if you don't help people in North Korea, it's you.

1:09:37.640 --> 1:09:39.640
 And that's a huge burden.

1:09:39.640 --> 1:09:43.640
 And living with that burden is a kind of suffering.

1:09:43.640 --> 1:09:46.640
 I mean, there's some aspect in which freedom is suffering.

1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:47.640
 It is suffering.

1:09:47.640 --> 1:09:49.640
 Because life is suffering.

1:09:49.640 --> 1:09:55.640
 And then freedom is you as an individual fully living through that.

1:09:55.640 --> 1:09:59.640
 So you talked, you're friends with Michael Malis.

1:09:59.640 --> 1:10:03.640
 He believes, and so I want to kind of ask you about government.

1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:05.640
 He believes he's an anarchist.

1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:06.640
 Yeah.

1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:08.640
 And he believes kind of in,

1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:19.640
 freedom fully implemented in human societies, meaning that humans should all be free

1:10:19.640 --> 1:10:25.640
 to choose how they transact with each other, how they live together.

1:10:25.640 --> 1:10:29.640
 There shouldn't be a centralized force that tells you what to do.

1:10:29.640 --> 1:10:35.640
 Do you think there's some role for government in a healthy society?

1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:36.640
 Yeah.

1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:42.640
 If we look at North Korea, there's the most horrible implementation of government.

1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:49.640
 But then if we look at what the United States strives to be, at least in principle,

1:10:49.640 --> 1:10:54.640
 there's an ideal of a government that represents the people and helps the people.

1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:57.640
 Is there a place for that kind of ideal?

1:10:57.640 --> 1:11:00.640
 Or is government always going to get us into trouble?

1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:06.640
 I mean, I spoke to Michael Malis, I kept asking why he's anarchist, right?

1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:09.640
 And he doesn't believe in military, none of it.

1:11:09.640 --> 1:11:13.640
 And I was like, I don't think I want to be in that world.

1:11:13.640 --> 1:11:14.640
 You're describing.

1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:15.640
 That's pretty scary.

1:11:15.640 --> 1:11:17.640
 I want the law enforcement.

1:11:17.640 --> 1:11:20.640
 I want like, I don't...

1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:22.640
 In a way that...

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:28.640
 So why equality makes no sense is that the fact that when you and I were born,

1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:32.640
 we were born in a very different capability of thinking, different intelligence,

1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:34.640
 different capability in our physics, right?

1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:36.640
 So equality is nonsense.

1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:39.640
 You can never achieve that, right?

1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:42.640
 So to me, that's when it's very scary.

1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:44.640
 When the government tries to enforce...

1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:46.640
 To make equality on everybody.

1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:47.640
 That is impossible.

1:11:47.640 --> 1:11:48.640
 That's...

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:50.640
 Specifically, equality of outcomes.

1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:52.640
 So given that we all start at different places,

1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:57.640
 enforce, like, measure in some kind of way where people stand.

1:11:57.640 --> 1:12:00.640
 And if they're an equal, enforce equality.

1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:05.640
 And that's what leads to the kind of things that you mentioned with the class system

1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:07.640
 in North Korea.

1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:10.640
 So I think that's why government can be bad.

1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.640
 They can be very dumb.

1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:15.640
 Another thing is that they cannot know what you want.

1:12:15.640 --> 1:12:19.640
 A lot of times, people don't even know what they want in the vision.

1:12:19.640 --> 1:12:23.640
 Like, how the heck do you assume government is going to know what is best for you?

1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:24.640
 Nobody knows.

1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:26.640
 We just all do our best.

1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:30.640
 I do think that some governments, like, in Switzerland,

1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:31.640
 you know, have more...

1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:33.640
 Give power to the different states.

1:12:33.640 --> 1:12:34.640
 Can be good.

1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:37.640
 I think I'm more, you know, like, giving power to the state.

1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:41.640
 And let individuals decide where they want to go in within states.

1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:44.640
 Like, I mean, why did you choose Texas, right?

1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:47.640
 There's no income tax, right?

1:12:47.640 --> 1:12:52.640
 There's a lot of things people find Texas, like, you know, charming, and they come here.

1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:56.640
 So in a way that I don't want to be in a one strong government

1:12:56.640 --> 1:12:59.640
 that makes every single thing the same way.

1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:02.640
 In a way, I want to kind of experiment with everything.

1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:04.640
 We can have anarchy state.

1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:07.640
 There's no police, nothing going on.

1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:09.640
 You can be whatever you want.

1:13:09.640 --> 1:13:11.640
 And you can go on a state where it's like,

1:13:11.640 --> 1:13:16.640
 abortion is bad, blah, blah, this is bad, all those conservative values.

1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:21.640
 And let the ideas compete and let them how they are being practiced in real life.

1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:26.640
 But I think it's very scary when the US government is getting bigger and bigger

1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:31.640
 and then they try to, you know, make every state under one big government.

1:13:31.640 --> 1:13:34.640
 And that's like when I get really alarmed.

1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:38.640
 Are there things that you see in the United States in the current culture

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:47.640
 that kind of has echoes of the same things you saw in North Korea that worry you that much?

1:13:47.640 --> 1:13:54.640
 Absolutely. It's in America now, the meritocracy doesn't matter, right?

1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:55.640
 It's evil.

1:13:55.640 --> 1:14:00.640
 That white man's idea of like talking about if you're competent enough,

1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:04.640
 it's like, oh, if you're coming from rich white family, you are going to be competent.

1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:09.640
 So other people don't have a chance but look at Asians who came from nothing as competent

1:14:09.640 --> 1:14:12.640
 and go to like Harvard Law School and medical school.

1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:19.640
 So it doesn't, it's like there's no incentive for you to work hard anymore in the system right now.

1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:24.640
 That is North Korea, there's no incentive because you're born with your class already.

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:27.640
 So no matter what you do, you can never.

1:14:27.640 --> 1:14:32.640
 The horrible thing about North Korean system is that there's nothing even holding Mary up.

1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:37.640
 So if you're coming from other cultures that like make a market join the royal family

1:14:37.640 --> 1:14:39.640
 and she became a royal, you go up.

1:14:39.640 --> 1:14:43.640
 But in North Korea, if someone from high class is going to marry somebody down,

1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:45.640
 you only go down with them.

1:14:45.640 --> 1:14:48.640
 That's how they prevent classmates.

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:54.640
 Right. That kind of enforces the separation because there's like huge disincentives to go to marry,

1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:57.640
 to integrate between classes.

1:14:57.640 --> 1:15:05.640
 What do you do about this kind of, you know, especially in universities, but in companies,

1:15:05.640 --> 1:15:09.640
 I'm thinking about starting a company, so I'm looking at this very carefully.

1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:15.640
 There's these ideas of diversity and meritocracy that's a tension.

1:15:15.640 --> 1:15:27.640
 So I think there's a big way in which diversity broadly defined is not at all in tension with meritocracy.

1:15:27.640 --> 1:15:36.640
 So having a variety of people backgrounds, way of thinking, all those kinds of things is a huge benefit to any group.

1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:43.640
 But the way diversity is often defined is by sort of very crude classes of people,

1:15:43.640 --> 1:15:49.640
 whether it's by skin color or gender or some very kind of large group way.

1:15:49.640 --> 1:15:54.640
 And that actually does two things in my mind.

1:15:54.640 --> 1:16:00.640
 One, it drowns out real diversity, or not real, but the full spectrum of diversity,

1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:11.640
 which is like within class diversity of like, are you somebody who is,

1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:13.640
 are you somebody who's exceptionally good at mathematics?

1:16:13.640 --> 1:16:15.640
 Are you somebody who's exceptionally good at psychology?

1:16:15.640 --> 1:16:16.640
 Are you good with people?

1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:17.640
 Are you good with numbers?

1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:25.640
 All that kind of stuff that I think spans or intersects in fascinating ways with these kinds of groups.

1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:26.640
 So that's diversity.

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:33.640
 And then meritocracy is this thing that probably the reason I wanted to move to Silicon Valley

1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:38.640
 and the reason I didn't is like having a fire to change the world within you.

1:16:38.640 --> 1:16:42.640
 Like meritocracy is like, I want to be the best in the world at this.

1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:47.640
 And I will strive and work hard, not stepping on others, but like purely within yourself,

1:16:47.640 --> 1:16:49.640
 be the best version of yourself.

1:16:49.640 --> 1:16:59.640
 That idea is in some ways being not celebrated or demonized.

1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:04.640
 It's literally meritocracy is being demonized right now in America.

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:09.640
 Working hard is a symbol of you coming from some established family.

1:17:09.640 --> 1:17:16.640
 The fact that you celebrate accomplishment, hard work is a sign of your patriarchy,

1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:18.640
 or whatever thing they call it.

1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:21.640
 And they want to abolish that.

1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:24.640
 They want to like stop giving kids grades.

1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:26.640
 That's what they're already doing, right?

1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:27.640
 They want to stop.

1:17:27.640 --> 1:17:32.640
 We should abolish like SAT in America they take to go to college, right?

1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:34.640
 They won't even abolish that.

1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:37.640
 Yeah, some kids have no ability to do math.

1:17:37.640 --> 1:17:39.640
 So why do we have to force them to learn math?

1:17:39.640 --> 1:17:43.640
 And that's what comes with humans overcome challenges.

1:17:43.640 --> 1:17:45.640
 That's what makes us special.

1:17:45.640 --> 1:17:49.640
 But then like because these kids coming from this family, let's find the reason why they cannot.

1:17:49.640 --> 1:17:51.640
 And then they don't have to do that thing.

1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:53.640
 But they still deserve the same job.

1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:55.640
 They need to be a lawyer and doctors.

1:17:55.640 --> 1:18:02.640
 And that's like what in North Korea was like not, there was not even meritocracy.

1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:07.640
 Did you go in the same family, the family, the blood, right?

1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:12.640
 Like if one person does something wrong, it's like collective guilt.

1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:17.640
 Because I spoke out, three generations of my family got punished, who are left behind.

1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:20.640
 And then in America, I see the same thing.

1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:27.640
 Like if you're somehow great, great grandfather on the slave, now you are privileged and you're guilty.

1:18:27.640 --> 1:18:29.640
 Because you are white and guilty.

1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:31.640
 But how do you change your ancestor?

1:18:31.640 --> 1:18:34.640
 How did you have a saying on it?

1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:37.640
 And that is where there's no way out.

1:18:37.640 --> 1:18:39.640
 There's no forgiving, there's no moving forward.

1:18:39.640 --> 1:18:47.640
 And this current culture in America now, like I remember at Columbia, like before class, everybody had to go round of saying,

1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:50.640
 tell us what your pronoun is.

1:18:50.640 --> 1:18:54.640
 And my English, my third language I learned as an adult.

1:18:54.640 --> 1:18:56.640
 Even saying he and she, I'm confused.

1:18:56.640 --> 1:19:01.640
 But this is a pure mistake. And they say, call me day, because I'm gender fluid.

1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:03.640
 Basically, I can be a girl.

1:19:03.640 --> 1:19:06.640
 But next hour, you talk to me, I'm a boy, right?

1:19:06.640 --> 1:19:10.640
 And if you don't do it right, they look at you, why are you big?

1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:13.640
 It makes me so nervous.

1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:17.640
 And this is where I come to, this is a regression of civilization.

1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:21.640
 We are regressing as a humanity here.

1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:26.640
 Like the enlightenment, all of those things made us so much brighter and looking forward.

1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:28.640
 And now we are going backwards.

1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:33.640
 Well, I think there's a pendulum aspect to it, because it's my hope in terms of backwards.

1:19:33.640 --> 1:19:37.640
 So pendulum goes backwards too, but it just goes back and forth, I think.

1:19:37.640 --> 1:19:41.640
 And then in the long arc of history, we're making progress.

1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:47.640
 I think all of the discussions of diversity and inclusion and all those kinds of things,

1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:51.640
 I always thought that they're healthy in moderation, right?

1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:55.640
 There should be a small part of the conversation amongst other things.

1:19:55.640 --> 1:20:02.640
 The natural aspect, it seems that they kind of have this way of just consuming all conversations.

1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:07.640
 It's like the meetings, like diversity and inclusion meetings multiplies somehow,

1:20:07.640 --> 1:20:09.640
 where it's like the only thing that you're talking about.

1:20:09.640 --> 1:20:11.640
 And it's very kind of absurd.

1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:19.640
 And when I look at, even at MIT, it's a strangely disproportionate amount of discussions about that.

1:20:19.640 --> 1:20:24.640
 And also to me as an engineer, those discussions are very frustrating,

1:20:24.640 --> 1:20:26.640
 because they don't seem to actually do anything.

1:20:26.640 --> 1:20:27.640
 No.

1:20:27.640 --> 1:20:38.640
 So they want to bully people instead of creating systems that fix definitive problems.

1:20:38.640 --> 1:20:43.640
 And that in itself, that kind of bullying, that's the same kind of thing you saw

1:20:43.640 --> 1:20:47.640
 in terms of McCarthyism in America against the communists.

1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:51.640
 You certainly saw that in Soviet Union against everybody who's not communist.

1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:55.640
 It creates hate, not progress.

1:20:55.640 --> 1:20:59.640
 When you talk to Jordan Peterson recently and people should listen to that conversation,

1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:01.640
 it wasn't fascinating anyone.

1:21:01.640 --> 1:21:10.640
 I think he almost got emotional on the discussion about universities

1:21:10.640 --> 1:21:16.640
 and your experience with Columbia, because he, like myself, for perhaps different reasons,

1:21:16.640 --> 1:21:19.640
 have a hope for our academic institutions.

1:21:19.640 --> 1:21:23.640
 Some of the most incredible people, some of the most incredible engineering

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:27.640
 and idea development innovations happens in universities.

1:21:27.640 --> 1:21:31.640
 So we both deeply care about them.

1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:33.640
 Is there something...

1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:41.640
 So the reason he got emotional, the reason he was kind of hurt is the fact that you did not...

1:21:41.640 --> 1:21:44.640
 You were not deeply inspired by your experience.

1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:45.640
 I didn't deeply.

1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:47.640
 It made me dumber.

1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:49.640
 It made me scared.

1:21:49.640 --> 1:21:54.640
 It made me terrified that I had to censor myself in America.

1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:59.640
 Are you seriously telling me that you don't ever censor yourself?

1:21:59.640 --> 1:22:06.640
 Can you truly say what we want about race, about anything, gender?

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:08.640
 We all censor ourselves.

1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:09.640
 Let's be honest.

1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:11.640
 We are all doing that.

1:22:11.640 --> 1:22:13.640
 And that's what I learned.

1:22:13.640 --> 1:22:17.640
 I thought I was coming to a country where I never needed that.

1:22:17.640 --> 1:22:20.640
 The first thing my mom taught me growing up in North Korea was,

1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:25.640
 don't even whisper because the birds and mice could hear you.

1:22:25.640 --> 1:22:30.640
 And I thought, okay, now America is truly the land of the free home of the brave.

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:32.640
 You can say anything you want.

1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:36.640
 And then you have freedom to change your mind and evolve.

1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:41.640
 But the people now demand you to be the perfect version they demand you to be.

1:22:41.640 --> 1:22:43.640
 You cannot change your mind.

1:22:43.640 --> 1:22:45.640
 And then what is the meaning of life?

1:22:45.640 --> 1:22:46.640
 You cannot grow.

1:22:46.640 --> 1:22:51.640
 You should feel safe to talk about anything and then later, okay, I was wrong.

1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:54.640
 But now if you do that, you got to get penalized for it.

1:22:54.640 --> 1:22:59.640
 I mean, censorship is a funny thing because you probably should not say dumb things.

1:22:59.640 --> 1:23:05.640
 You should try to say things you want to say in the most eloquent, the most effective way you can.

1:23:05.640 --> 1:23:07.640
 I mean, that's what editing is, right?

1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:08.640
 Yeah.

1:23:08.640 --> 1:23:12.640
 So there's some level of being careful with what you say,

1:23:12.640 --> 1:23:17.640
 because you're afraid of some overarching kind of group of bullies,

1:23:17.640 --> 1:23:21.640
 but you want to be the best version of yourself when you express stuff.

1:23:21.640 --> 1:23:24.640
 But there's some sense where in the university setting,

1:23:24.640 --> 1:23:31.640
 you can put that self sense you should like level down more and say stupid stuff and explain and play,

1:23:31.640 --> 1:23:35.640
 because you should be forgiven for that kind of play,

1:23:35.640 --> 1:23:39.640
 especially when you're discussing difficult aspects of human history,

1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:44.640
 whether that include racism, that include atrocities.

1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:51.640
 I'm still nevertheless sort of hopeful, but at the same time, I'm surrounded by engineers.

1:23:51.640 --> 1:23:52.640
 Yeah.

1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:55.640
 So I don't get to interact with people in humanities much.

1:23:55.640 --> 1:23:57.640
 And it seems like there's getting worse.

1:23:57.640 --> 1:23:58.640
 It's a good thing.

1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:00.640
 It's a good thing.

1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:03.640
 I don't know.

1:24:03.640 --> 1:24:08.640
 Well, I do sort of interact with psychologists, but they haven't touched on those kinds of topics yet.

1:24:08.640 --> 1:24:15.640
 I still sort of in defense of psychology, I still, I wish I had more numbers,

1:24:15.640 --> 1:24:22.640
 but I still feel like most psychology people don't partake in this kind of stuff either.

1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:24.640
 They're just doing excellent research.

1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:27.640
 We're just highlighting, this is what America does well,

1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:35.640
 you're kind of highlighting anecdotal experiences and making a big deal out of them.

1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:38.640
 But that's good because it's a slippery slope.

1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:41.640
 If those things start to overtake all of academia,

1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:43.640
 it starts becoming a big problem even in the engineering field.

1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:45.640
 So we should be concerned.

1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:50.640
 But it is truly tragic that somebody who's exceptionally well read like you,

1:24:50.640 --> 1:24:56.640
 whose fire was stoked first with Orwell, that fire should burn bright.

1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:01.640
 This should not be, you should be writing many books.

1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:08.640
 You talk to Jordan, it's very possible, depending on what you want to do with your life,

1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:11.640
 that you'll be a future Jordan Peterson.

1:25:11.640 --> 1:25:19.640
 And Columbia should be a place that enriches your mind.

1:25:19.640 --> 1:25:22.640
 And the fact that it didn't is tragic.

1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:25.640
 I was there four years.

1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:29.640
 It wasn't like I had one class that was bad in one semester.

1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:33.640
 That was the thing when Dr. Peer was asking, is there any one class

1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:38.640
 that had no sentiment of this virtue signaling politically right?

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:41.640
 There was none.

1:25:41.640 --> 1:25:46.640
 Entire course, I think I took 126 credits total.

1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:48.640
 Not even one class.

1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:52.640
 It doesn't matter we were talking about classic art and that's the thing.

1:25:52.640 --> 1:25:57.640
 I literally thought, okay, I pushed the last semester to the core like the art and music, right?

1:25:57.640 --> 1:26:01.640
 I thought this is going to be the least politically correct class I can take.

1:26:01.640 --> 1:26:05.640
 And then it begins with who has problem with calling this course

1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:08.640
 the Western Civilization of Art and Music.

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:11.640
 And it was raising their hands.

1:26:11.640 --> 1:26:15.640
 Because why do we have to learn about this better than Mozart, the bigots,

1:26:15.640 --> 1:26:20.640
 or the people, like everything ruined by white men.

1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:25.640
 And it's even music, even these paintings.

1:26:25.640 --> 1:26:28.640
 I didn't raise my hand. Everyone was looking at me.

1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:30.640
 How do you not have the problem with the West?

1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:33.640
 You should hate the West. You're Asian.

1:26:33.640 --> 1:26:35.640
 So I think that's the thing.

1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:39.640
 I think the problems are way deeper than what people think.

1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:42.640
 And that's what I learned.

1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:45.640
 It's not that safe in America.

1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:47.640
 We can't go complete to the South.

1:26:47.640 --> 1:26:54.640
 And looking at even Europe, I used to be way more optimistic.

1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:58.640
 And now I actually see, wow, this country can't go to the South.

1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:02.640
 And we might, if the U.S. forced that, right, this is the only country left

1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:05.640
 to battle with the Communist Party in China.

1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:10.640
 We may lose the opportunity to be free ever again as a humanity.

1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:15.640
 Wow. So I mean, that puts a lot of value on having these kinds of conversations.

1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:22.640
 I mean, I'm troubled by a lot of things, but like censorship on YouTube, for example.

1:27:22.640 --> 1:27:26.640
 Yeah, it was very annoying to have to listen to Donald Trump all the time.

1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:28.640
 Just create drama.

1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:31.640
 The news cycle was completely drowned out by Donald Trump.

1:27:31.640 --> 1:27:37.640
 But banning him from Twitter, it was like...

1:27:37.640 --> 1:27:47.640
 That was scary for me because that's a step towards a direction where you're going to...

1:27:47.640 --> 1:27:51.640
 Where does that take us? You're going to silence people.

1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:53.640
 Like Jordan Peterson is next.

1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:57.640
 That's why we need to promote freedom of thinking and speech, right?

1:27:57.640 --> 1:28:03.640
 And one thing that I love about Dr. Peterson is humans, he's psychologist, right?

1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:08.640
 He talks about we think by talking.

1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:11.640
 That's why when you go to therapy, you talk and then you'll hear yourself

1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:14.640
 and then you think and you come up to the answer.

1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:19.640
 It's so important for humans to talk so we can think.

1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:22.640
 So when they say you cannot talk, means you cannot think.

1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:25.640
 And they don't know the consequences of that.

1:28:25.640 --> 1:28:29.640
 And this is why I promote, I want the freedom of speech.

1:28:29.640 --> 1:28:35.640
 Even though it hurts, ridiculous, sometimes it can be dangerous.

1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:40.640
 But the price, the alternative is so bad that we should take the...

1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:43.640
 Make this trade off. Everything has a trade off in this world.

1:28:43.640 --> 1:28:46.640
 And it comes through the sacrifice, right?

1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:50.640
 So I think that's what I've never seen in America.

1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:55.640
 But it's unfortunately like the people like you say, who decides what is hate speech?

1:28:55.640 --> 1:28:59.640
 What is dangerous? That's what I've been getting scared.

1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:02.640
 Because everybody is imperfect.

1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:04.640
 How do we want to give that power to them?

1:29:04.640 --> 1:29:07.640
 And they're going to decide, today they might agree with me.

1:29:07.640 --> 1:29:10.640
 Say, okay, your speech is good, promotes good.

1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:14.640
 And then they might come back next year and say, your speech is bad.

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:16.640
 What are you going to do when that happens to you?

1:29:16.640 --> 1:29:20.640
 We have to almost get ideas out and then play with them.

1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:23.640
 I think what's a really important component of that is forgiving each other

1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:30.640
 for realizing that we're a different person day by day and certainly years later.

1:29:30.640 --> 1:29:35.640
 And I think some of that is both cultural mechanisms of saying

1:29:35.640 --> 1:29:39.640
 we forgive each other for wrong ideas or not wrong ideas,

1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:45.640
 but for who we are, the full evolution of the human being for the steps we've taken on that evolution.

1:29:45.640 --> 1:29:54.640
 And also creating mechanisms that allow us to forgive each other.

1:29:54.640 --> 1:30:00.640
 For example, on Twitter is horrible with this because one of the main viral ways

1:30:00.640 --> 1:30:06.640
 that people create drama on Twitter is pulling up an old tweet that somebody said, right?

1:30:06.640 --> 1:30:10.640
 And then saying, oh, this is the guy that thinks that.

1:30:10.640 --> 1:30:15.640
 But that's like the opposite of the mechanisms we need to forgive ourselves,

1:30:15.640 --> 1:30:18.640
 forgive each other for the things we've said in the past.

1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:27.640
 So part of that is the cultural, part of this is the technological mechanisms.

1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:31.640
 You mentioned Jordan, Jordan Peterson, you had a great conversation with him.

1:30:31.640 --> 1:30:34.640
 What was chatting with him like?

1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:38.640
 I'm just curious because he's deeply passionate,

1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:42.640
 especially on the Soviet Union side about the atrocities of these kinds of systems.

1:30:42.640 --> 1:30:44.640
 What was it like?

1:30:44.640 --> 1:30:47.640
 What did you agree with him on?

1:30:47.640 --> 1:30:49.640
 What did you disagree?

1:30:49.640 --> 1:30:55.640
 What were some things you both kind of learned from each other through that conversation, do you think?

1:30:55.640 --> 1:30:59.640
 So here's a my story to Jordan Peterson, a very long one.

1:30:59.640 --> 1:31:06.640
 So one day I was walking down in Chicago and they were like, huge theater were sold out.

1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:09.640
 He says a big little Jordan Peterson sold out.

1:31:09.640 --> 1:31:12.640
 And then it was a huge theater in the middle of Chicago, right?

1:31:12.640 --> 1:31:18.640
 Like, it was on my committee, like who can be selling this entire thing out at like 7 p.m.

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:26.640
 And then with my ex husband, we were walking the street and then we saw people were like selling this like tickets,

1:31:26.640 --> 1:31:29.640
 like for a very higher price, right?

1:31:29.640 --> 1:31:32.640
 And then they were on the ticket and then he was like, yeah, sure.

1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:35.640
 We ran in. It's packed.

1:31:35.640 --> 1:31:43.640
 And then I was just a keeper or like, but I wasn't able to understand his English that much.

1:31:43.640 --> 1:31:45.640
 My English was still...

1:31:45.640 --> 1:31:47.640
 And you didn't know who he was really?

1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:48.640
 No, no.

1:31:48.640 --> 1:31:49.640
 You were just curious?

1:31:49.640 --> 1:31:50.640
 Yeah, it was like 2018.

1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:52.640
 Who's the guy that sells out a theater?

1:31:52.640 --> 1:31:56.640
 Yes, I saw Dave Rubin came out before him and make jokes.

1:31:56.640 --> 1:31:58.640
 I still don't know who Dave Rubin is.

1:31:58.640 --> 1:31:59.640
 Afterwards, I met them all.

1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:01.640
 But back then I had no clue what that is.

1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:03.640
 And then he was giving lessons.

1:32:03.640 --> 1:32:10.640
 But what I got from that night was not what Jordan said, but what people did on the audience.

1:32:10.640 --> 1:32:17.640
 These people like, I don't know, thousands of people in this big theater crying like babies.

1:32:17.640 --> 1:32:22.640
 And that was like, whatever that guy is doing is very special, right?

1:32:22.640 --> 1:32:24.640
 He wasn't like making any jokes.

1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:25.640
 He had no slides.

1:32:25.640 --> 1:32:30.640
 Just a warm, simple person standing in the huge, giant theater talk.

1:32:30.640 --> 1:32:32.640
 And long time too.

1:32:32.640 --> 1:32:33.640
 And people cry.

1:32:33.640 --> 1:32:37.640
 And I was like, wow, okay, whatever that is, I gotta check it out.

1:32:37.640 --> 1:32:39.640
 And then I got home.

1:32:39.640 --> 1:32:41.640
 And then later many years later, I got a book.

1:32:41.640 --> 1:32:44.640
 And I would start reading his book.

1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:47.640
 And it talks about, it explains so much, right?

1:32:47.640 --> 1:32:52.640
 Like now at Columbia Learn, like everything generally is like a matter of concept, construct.

1:32:52.640 --> 1:32:57.640
 Like the hierarchy is my man's idea of making the hierarchy.

1:32:57.640 --> 1:33:04.640
 And then he begins with the number one, the laughter, how the hierarchies, evolution of history that is within us.

1:33:04.640 --> 1:33:06.640
 That we want a hierarchy, right?

1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:10.640
 And then chapter five about socialization of child.

1:33:10.640 --> 1:33:12.640
 How do you raise them?

1:33:12.640 --> 1:33:14.640
 And all of it.

1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:17.640
 And then what's why telling the truth is matters, right?

1:33:17.640 --> 1:33:22.640
 And there's a why, like in his entire 12 lessons I read it.

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:26.640
 And then it's like, I was so grateful that I'm alive.

1:33:26.640 --> 1:33:31.640
 There were people always say, if Socrates alive, how much would you pay to have lunch with him?

1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:33.640
 That kind of thing, right?

1:33:33.640 --> 1:33:41.640
 So for me, it was like, okay, I'm like alive in the same contemporary world, one of the greatest thinkers of my entire generation.

1:33:41.640 --> 1:33:43.640
 And then like, how much money?

1:33:43.640 --> 1:33:44.640
 Get the hang out of them.

1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:45.640
 Exactly, right?

1:33:45.640 --> 1:33:47.640
 How much money would I pay?

1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:49.640
 No limit amount.

1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:54.640
 And I like reached out to Michaela on her pockets on Twitter and connected.

1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:58.640
 And then one day she said, do you want to go on my father's podcast?

1:33:58.640 --> 1:34:00.640
 I was like, what?

1:34:00.640 --> 1:34:02.640
 I was like, of course.

1:34:02.640 --> 1:34:10.640
 And I was very nervous, but I didn't expect him to be like that connected.

1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:11.640
 Yeah.

1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:13.640
 Because I thought he was psychologist.

1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:15.640
 Like he saw so much suffering in the world.

1:34:15.640 --> 1:34:17.640
 He studied Soviet Union.

1:34:17.640 --> 1:34:21.640
 He's always collecting those things to remind him of the suffering of a human being.

1:34:21.640 --> 1:34:29.640
 So sometimes some people hear so much atrocity, they become like very, you know, not engaged.

1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:30.640
 Yeah, desensitized.

1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:31.640
 Desensitized.

1:34:31.640 --> 1:34:37.640
 He felt, he was feeling, he was like, he was living through the experiences with you as you were talking about it.

1:34:37.640 --> 1:34:38.640
 It was an amazing conversation.

1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:44.640
 So Jordan is one of the great thinkers of our time, but I would say the greatest thinkers of our time is Michael Malis.

1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:47.640
 You've also got the chance to talk to him.

1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:50.640
 So he wrote a book on North Korea.

1:34:50.640 --> 1:34:51.640
 Yeah.

1:34:51.640 --> 1:34:53.640
 It's an interesting style book.

1:34:53.640 --> 1:34:54.640
 I learned a lot from it.

1:34:54.640 --> 1:34:56.640
 I learned a lot from Michael about it.

1:34:56.640 --> 1:35:02.640
 And it's interesting that he chose North Korea as a thing to study.

1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:12.640
 That he, of all people, this fascinating human being that is Michael, chose this darkest of aspects of humanity to study.

1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:15.640
 What do you think of Michael?

1:35:15.640 --> 1:35:20.640
 What do you think of his book on North Korea called Dear Reader that people should definitely check out?

1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:21.640
 Absolutely.

1:35:21.640 --> 1:35:26.640
 So back then when I reached out, Michael told me true friends of South Korea.

1:35:26.640 --> 1:35:28.640
 My English wasn't good.

1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:30.640
 So I got a copy in my hand.

1:35:30.640 --> 1:35:35.640
 I tried to read and a lot of them I didn't understand.

1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:42.640
 So, but I thought it was very fascinating how he explained North Korea through the Dear Reader's perspective.

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:43.640
 Right?

1:35:43.640 --> 1:35:45.640
 There's nobody has ever done that.

1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:51.640
 And you can review so much about the state and absurdity of entire situation.

1:35:51.640 --> 1:35:53.640
 And also through humor.

1:35:53.640 --> 1:35:55.640
 And that's what's amazing about Michael.

1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:58.640
 He knows full gravity of tragedy.

1:35:58.640 --> 1:36:00.640
 He knows a full suffering.

1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:05.640
 He's not just like people here in America on the bus feed making fun of Kim Jong's haircut.

1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:07.640
 They don't care what people go through.

1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:08.640
 Michael cares.

1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:10.640
 He deeply cares.

1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:12.640
 And then he still does ridiculous jokes.

1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:19.640
 So that kind of reveals in a dark way the absurdity of evil.

1:36:19.640 --> 1:36:21.640
 And he does that masterfully.

1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:22.640
 Do you?

1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:23.640
 He's a genius.

1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:25.640
 He is definitely a genius.

1:36:25.640 --> 1:36:32.640
 All right. If you watch this, let's make his head too big here.

1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:36.640
 But is there some aspect to...

1:36:36.640 --> 1:36:40.640
 I mean, there is an absurdity to the whole thing.

1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:45.640
 Kim Jong Un is almost like a caricature of evil.

1:36:45.640 --> 1:36:46.640
 It's a joke.

1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:48.640
 A lot of people think it's a joke.

1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:52.640
 They just think that this is too absurd.

1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:53.640
 They laugh.

1:36:53.640 --> 1:36:56.640
 Like, can you imagine you laugh at Holocaust?

1:36:56.640 --> 1:36:58.640
 This is that ridiculous.

1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:04.640
 Can you maybe psychoanalyze that a little bit because that's where my mind goes too.

1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:08.640
 Like, he's so ridiculous that you can't...

1:37:08.640 --> 1:37:11.640
 It's almost like hard to believe this is real.

1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:25.640
 Is that just my kind of and people's desire to escape the cruelty of reality by just kind of making a joke out of it?

1:37:25.640 --> 1:37:28.640
 I think it is a few things, right?

1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:32.640
 Like, it's a North Korea as a nation.

1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:39.640
 Number one or number two smartest IQ people in the world, despite their magnetition.

1:37:39.640 --> 1:37:43.640
 So there's...

1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:45.640
 I mean, that's an interesting point.

1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:51.640
 So in your sense, the people still carry the brilliance.

1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:57.640
 There's a culture there that's like hungry to become realized.

1:37:57.640 --> 1:38:05.640
 Like the people that are silenced by the electricity, by actually having no food, all those kinds of things.

1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:10.640
 Like, if you add the electricity, if you add the food, you're going to have a cultural center of the world.

1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:11.640
 Like South Korea.

1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:13.640
 That's what they exactly did, right?

1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:14.640
 The exact same Korea.

1:38:14.640 --> 1:38:18.640
 One became more like 11th largest economy.

1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:22.640
 One became the world's most like Polish nation, right?

1:38:22.640 --> 1:38:24.640
 And this is the perfect example.

1:38:24.640 --> 1:38:27.640
 Like, if I don't know if you read that book, Why Nation Fairs?

1:38:27.640 --> 1:38:29.640
 The system.

1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:31.640
 It's not about a culture.

1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:32.640
 It is not about people.

1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:33.640
 It is not about IQ.

1:38:33.640 --> 1:38:36.640
 What makes us to different is a system.

1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:40.640
 South Korea, North Korea is a perfect example of that.

1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:42.640
 One is exact same capability.

1:38:42.640 --> 1:38:44.640
 We were homogeneous like country.

1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:47.640
 Same language, tradition, all of that.

1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:49.640
 We gave them different system.

1:38:49.640 --> 1:38:50.640
 One is free democracy.

1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:51.640
 One is dictatorship.

1:38:51.640 --> 1:38:54.640
 And came up with the biggest different result.

1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:59.640
 And I think North Korea reveals that to us.

1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:03.640
 It's not because we are great that we are living in this prosperity.

1:39:03.640 --> 1:39:05.640
 Free market.

1:39:05.640 --> 1:39:07.640
 The ideas gave us to this.

1:39:07.640 --> 1:39:12.640
 The system we built, our ancestors built, gave us this privilege.

1:39:12.640 --> 1:39:13.640
 It's not us.

1:39:13.640 --> 1:39:16.640
 Nothing is about us being special here, right?

1:39:16.640 --> 1:39:19.640
 The system that we have is quite special.

1:39:19.640 --> 1:39:22.640
 And North Korea proves that to us.

1:39:22.640 --> 1:39:24.640
 It doesn't matter even if you're smart.

1:39:24.640 --> 1:39:27.640
 That's all irrelevant.

1:39:27.640 --> 1:39:30.640
 And I think that's why people just keep denying it.

1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:31.640
 They want to feel special.

1:39:31.640 --> 1:39:33.640
 Like because I'm awesome.

1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:34.640
 I got all of this.

1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:35.640
 Like, no, it's not you.

1:39:35.640 --> 1:39:37.640
 You got this.

1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:40.640
 And when people say like, I hate capitalism.

1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:44.640
 Without capitalism, how do you came up with this thing?

1:39:44.640 --> 1:39:45.640
 Literally.

1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:47.640
 How did you come up with this?

1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:49.640
 The systems matter.

1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:50.640
 Matter.

1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:56.640
 They matter like way more than this individualistic society

1:39:56.640 --> 1:40:00.640
 would like to imagine.

1:40:00.640 --> 1:40:03.640
 It is the most important thing you can have in life,

1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:07.640
 choosing the right system.

1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:11.640
 Do you have advice for young people today?

1:40:11.640 --> 1:40:15.640
 You've lived an incredible life and you have, I hope,

1:40:15.640 --> 1:40:17.640
 an incredible life ahead of you.

1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:20.640
 What advice would you give to young people today,

1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:23.640
 high schoolers, college students,

1:40:23.640 --> 1:40:27.640
 how to be successful in their career,

1:40:27.640 --> 1:40:30.640
 maybe successful in life?

1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:34.640
 Last thing I want them to fear is guilty.

1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:37.640
 It doesn't do anything, right?

1:40:37.640 --> 1:40:40.640
 So I hate when people talk about a white guilt.

1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:43.640
 It's like that doesn't make even any sense, right?

1:40:43.640 --> 1:40:47.640
 I think the fact that they're born with freedom

1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:50.640
 is a blessing for all of us.

1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:53.640
 It's not like I want them to want to do something

1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:55.640
 because they are guilty.

1:40:55.640 --> 1:40:59.640
 I want them to do something because they are grateful.

1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:00.640
 It is true.

1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:01.640
 We are sitting here.

1:41:01.640 --> 1:41:03.640
 The fact why I have children is suffering.

1:41:03.640 --> 1:41:06.640
 Having kids, you don't sleep, costly.

1:41:06.640 --> 1:41:08.640
 So much work.

1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:13.640
 Any logical rational mind, you should never want children.

1:41:13.640 --> 1:41:15.640
 Why would you do that to yourself?

1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:17.640
 Especially as a woman, right?

1:41:17.640 --> 1:41:19.640
 You don't want to do that to yourself.

1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:22.640
 But think about, like, we are sitting here today,

1:41:22.640 --> 1:41:26.640
 two of us, in this amazing technology, this country,

1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:30.640
 because somebody in Savannah, hundreds of thousands of years ago,

1:41:30.640 --> 1:41:33.640
 they're hunting berries and surviving cold.

1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:36.640
 Every suffering they can imagine, they fall for us.

1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:39.640
 That's what we ended up here.

1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:43.640
 So life is ultimately bigger than us.

1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:45.640
 And I think that's what I want them.

1:41:45.640 --> 1:41:47.640
 It's not like I want them to do the right thing

1:41:47.640 --> 1:41:49.640
 and be the best version of themselves.

1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:52.640
 It's like I want them to feel grateful.

1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:53.640
 And we should be grateful.

1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:55.640
 For the freedom.

1:41:55.640 --> 1:41:57.640
 And take full advantage of that.

1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:01.640
 I mean, it starts with the freedom to experience everything in life.

1:42:01.640 --> 1:42:03.640
 And for your life, literally.

1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:04.640
 Like life.

1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:11.640
 My father, you know, working, dying is a lot easier than living.

1:42:11.640 --> 1:42:17.640
 Dying takes, like, a few minutes, right, maximum, and living takes forever.

1:42:17.640 --> 1:42:21.640
 So when I was facing this unbelievable challenge,

1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:23.640
 I thought, okay, this is the most rational thing I can do

1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:25.640
 is killing myself right now.

1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:28.640
 But the hardest thing I can choose to live,

1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:32.640
 and my father did that, even in the concentration camp,

1:42:32.640 --> 1:42:35.640
 even no matter what he said, life is a gift.

1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:37.640
 You need to fight for it.

1:42:37.640 --> 1:42:43.640
 And I think that's what's missing here, that we don't think life as a gift.

1:42:43.640 --> 1:42:44.640
 It's a gift.

1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:48.640
 Like, how many people had to fight for me to be here today?

1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:52.640
 Think about the sacrifice they made for many, many, many generations.

1:42:52.640 --> 1:42:54.640
 I don't even know what they went through.

1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:56.640
 I can't even fathom what they went through.

1:42:56.640 --> 1:42:58.640
 They fought for life.

1:42:58.640 --> 1:42:59.640
 Yeah.

1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:01.640
 And that is my responsibility enough.

1:43:01.640 --> 1:43:06.640
 So it doesn't make them, therefore, fire was not meaningless, right?

1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:10.640
 I want something, because now I'm carrying on that fight.

1:43:10.640 --> 1:43:14.640
 You mentioned considering suicide,

1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:18.640
 do you think about your mortality now?

1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:24.640
 Now that you're perhaps in slightly more comfortable place,

1:43:24.640 --> 1:43:27.640
 do you still think about death?

1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:32.640
 I do, because I was informed actually when I was 21

1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:38.640
 I was on the killing list of Kim Jong Un by South Korean intelligence.

1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:43.640
 And then I had to live with that, right?

1:43:43.640 --> 1:43:46.640
 But now I actually feel more because I don't know if you follow

1:43:46.640 --> 1:43:49.640
 German Kastrige story, the Saudi journalist,

1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:52.640
 who got chopped off in Turkey embassy, right?

1:43:52.640 --> 1:43:57.640
 His reason why he got killed was he became very prominent on Twitter.

1:43:57.640 --> 1:44:01.640
 He had a huge voice and Saudis followed him.

1:44:01.640 --> 1:44:06.640
 And now I became very first North Korean to have this many social media followings.

1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:13.640
 And recently North Korea started an investigation team to analyze whatever I do.

1:44:13.640 --> 1:44:15.640
 Even though it's the first time for them.

1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:17.640
 So they don't even know what to do at this point.

1:44:17.640 --> 1:44:19.640
 They're like, this is so new.

1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:20.640
 What do we do?

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:22.640
 We do Kim Jong Nam.

1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:26.640
 Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of Kim Jong Un got killed in Malaysia.

1:44:26.640 --> 1:44:30.640
 That is another tragedy that I feel so sorry for the US government is that

1:44:30.640 --> 1:44:35.640
 Kim Jong Nam was giving information to the CIA for the past like 10 years.

1:44:35.640 --> 1:44:38.640
 That trip, when he got killed in Malaysian airport,

1:44:38.640 --> 1:44:42.640
 he was meeting up with the CIA agent for two days on the Northern Ireland.

1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:45.640
 CIA could have protected him.

1:44:45.640 --> 1:44:46.640
 They didn't.

1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:48.640
 They let him die.

1:44:48.640 --> 1:44:50.640
 Who killed them?

1:44:50.640 --> 1:44:51.640
 North Korean Kim Jong Un cared.

1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:55.640
 Do you know the Malaysian, the ladies, the VX, the nerve agent?

1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:58.640
 North Koreans cared them.

1:44:58.640 --> 1:45:01.640
 In Malaysian airport, in the international land.

1:45:01.640 --> 1:45:06.640
 So even Jamal Khashoggi, who was a US resident and the Washington Post journalist,

1:45:06.640 --> 1:45:11.640
 when he got killed in Saudi like a lamb, they chopped them into pieces.

1:45:11.640 --> 1:45:15.640
 In that most inhuman death, what was the consequences for the Saudis?

1:45:15.640 --> 1:45:17.640
 Nothing.

1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:20.640
 The word is we think we're living in justice.

1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:22.640
 No, there's no justice.

1:45:22.640 --> 1:45:27.640
 There is no accountability for killing any decent, no matter how big their names are.

1:45:27.640 --> 1:45:33.640
 So you don't think your vast and quickly growing social media presence protects you?

1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:34.640
 No.

1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:35.640
 It does opposite.

1:45:35.640 --> 1:45:40.640
 Because Kim Jong Un, initially when I spoke out, I don't know if you went through it,

1:45:40.640 --> 1:45:44.640
 they did everything they could to character assassinate me.

1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:45.640
 Saying, I'm a liar.

1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:46.640
 I'm a CIA spy.

1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:47.640
 I get paid.

1:45:47.640 --> 1:45:51.640
 And then they reached out to Penguin saying, we're going to blow up.

1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:53.640
 You cannot write this book.

1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:54.640
 And they did it with Sony.

1:45:54.640 --> 1:45:58.640
 They had the Sony studio for making that stupid movie interview, right?

1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:01.640
 And then Penguin did their investigation.

1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:04.640
 They met every survivor that I went through in the desert.

1:46:04.640 --> 1:46:08.640
 They got the voice recording of them because they don't want them to change their mind later, right?

1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:10.640
 People remember differently.

1:46:10.640 --> 1:46:12.640
 So they got the voice recordings.

1:46:12.640 --> 1:46:14.640
 The Penguin recording got the old audience.

1:46:14.640 --> 1:46:16.640
 And now we are ready for the lawsuit.

1:46:16.640 --> 1:46:21.640
 We are going to publish this book because we check the verified every single thing that was going to book.

1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:24.640
 And North Korea couldn't do anything anymore.

1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:26.640
 But that's character assassination.

1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:31.640
 Which by the way, that's a whole nother conversation that you were able to survive that.

1:46:31.640 --> 1:46:35.640
 I appreciate the kind of strength that requires to survive that because you don't know.

1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:42.640
 And your character being assassinated is in some ways can be as painful as actual assassination.

1:46:42.640 --> 1:46:43.640
 It's worse.

1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:45.640
 Everybody think you're a liar.

1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:47.640
 Everybody think you're a liar.

1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:55.640
 And now everybody, like you said, the nature of internet is that as long as something is written internet, they think that's a fact.

1:46:55.640 --> 1:46:59.640
 Any stupid person can start a blog and write about you.

1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:02.640
 But they think, oh, because it's written on internet, it's legit.

1:47:02.640 --> 1:47:03.640
 Especially negative stuff.

1:47:03.640 --> 1:47:06.640
 That's the thing I was kind of trying to elaborate on.

1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:13.640
 There's a viral aspect to calling somebody a fraud or a liar that nobody questions whether it's true or not.

1:47:13.640 --> 1:47:15.640
 It just spreads.

1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:23.640
 And it's a dark side of our human nature that we want to destroy the people who are rising.

1:47:23.640 --> 1:47:25.640
 We cannot stand it.

1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:33.640
 Any changing maker in this world who wasn't controversial, like Martin Luther King Jr., like Nelson Mandela, he was called as a terrorist.

1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:37.640
 So I just did not know.

1:47:37.640 --> 1:47:41.640
 So the character assassination is the thing, you know, probably continue with you.

1:47:41.640 --> 1:47:43.640
 It will continue with you forever.

1:47:43.640 --> 1:47:46.640
 It gets stronger and stronger, I think, in the face of that.

1:47:46.640 --> 1:47:55.640
 But actual assassination, perhaps it's me being hopeful because I have a situation with Russia that I hope I'm not under.

1:47:55.640 --> 1:47:57.640
 Well, I don't care actually.

1:47:57.640 --> 1:48:10.640
 But there's some aspect in which social media presence, I thought protects you a little bit because just imagine the outrage from an attempted assassination of you.

1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:14.640
 But what was the outrage when John McCushy got killed like that?

1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:17.640
 Was the social media presence large?

1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:20.640
 Over one million people, I don't have that following.

1:48:20.640 --> 1:48:23.640
 He was 1.6 million Twitter followers.

1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:25.640
 And the outrage wasn't there?

1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:26.640
 No.

1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:30.640
 Because Saudis spoke to Amazon, the Prime Studio, Netflix.

1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:35.640
 There were people made a documentary about it but told everybody, don't cannot get that deal.

1:48:35.640 --> 1:48:38.640
 So there was a huge censorship on that.

1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:41.640
 And people, of course, they can talk about it one day.

1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:44.640
 Some distance from Saudis got killed.

1:48:44.640 --> 1:48:45.640
 Horrible.

1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:46.640
 But it just dissipates.

1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:50.640
 They move on to the next cute puppy, the next cute cat.

1:48:50.640 --> 1:48:53.640
 That's what the nature of this new generation does.

1:48:53.640 --> 1:48:54.640
 They desensitize.

1:48:54.640 --> 1:48:55.640
 It doesn't affect them.

1:48:55.640 --> 1:48:59.640
 They keep following this instant pleasure, instant high.

1:48:59.640 --> 1:49:01.640
 That's what Instagram does to you.

1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:03.640
 It changes your brain.

1:49:03.640 --> 1:49:04.640
 That's what I was reading.

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:05.640
 It spoke to shallows.

1:49:05.640 --> 1:49:09.640
 We became shallow and shallow and our brain changed permanently.

1:49:09.640 --> 1:49:13.640
 So this new generation, we can get them angry for like 10 minutes.

1:49:13.640 --> 1:49:15.640
 Create hashtags for one day.

1:49:15.640 --> 1:49:19.640
 But then as quick as that was, it goes down like instantly.

1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:21.640
 And I think that's the...

1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:23.640
 Well, that means that...

1:49:23.640 --> 1:49:25.640
 Okay, so that means that there is...

1:49:25.640 --> 1:49:30.640
 It's an effective way to get rid of opposition is by murdering them.

1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:39.640
 And that means the United States, if it stands for freedom, if it stands for the freedom of exchange of ideas should be protecting people like you.

1:49:39.640 --> 1:49:40.640
 But they don't.

1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:42.640
 Because they don't want to be involved.

1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:48.640
 They didn't even protect Kim Jong Nam, who was giving information 10 years, risking his life.

1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:50.640
 That's what is so...

1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:52.640
 I mean, working for CI is not bad.

1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:54.640
 I don't...

1:49:54.640 --> 1:49:55.640
 I hope...

1:49:55.640 --> 1:49:59.640
 The thing is, he was giving information to bring down the vision.

1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:00.640
 That is valuable.

1:50:00.640 --> 1:50:02.640
 That is something novel about him.

1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:05.640
 But then you just don't go extra miles to that.

1:50:05.640 --> 1:50:09.640
 That's when I lost my faith in the U.S. system as well.

1:50:09.640 --> 1:50:12.640
 Like this country just cares about saving face.

1:50:12.640 --> 1:50:16.640
 What is most minimum cost they pay for anything.

1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:22.640
 And like I went up South Korea constantly every single day intelligence calling me.

1:50:22.640 --> 1:50:25.640
 You're like the North Korean agent going this place, where are you going?

1:50:25.640 --> 1:50:29.640
 The U.S. intelligence came to U.S., nobody.

1:50:29.640 --> 1:50:31.640
 There's a lot of people that said that you are CIA agent.

1:50:31.640 --> 1:50:33.640
 I wish they called me.

1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:34.640
 I wish they called me.

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:35.640
 I wish they...

1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:36.640
 I really truly do.

1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:38.640
 But nobody, nobody does here.

1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:40.640
 I'm sure they know what's going on.

1:50:40.640 --> 1:50:46.640
 But the South Korean agent is more like, oh my gosh, we don't want you to kill your South Korean citizen, right?

1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:49.640
 And now I'm trying to become your citizen.

1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:51.640
 So it's in a way it's...

1:50:51.640 --> 1:50:53.640
 I don't know what's worse.

1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:56.640
 Are you afraid for your life?

1:50:56.640 --> 1:50:58.640
 I was afraid.

1:50:58.640 --> 1:51:01.640
 For the several, three, four years I was afraid.

1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:02.640
 And it was...

1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:04.640
 But I had to came terms with it.

1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:08.640
 Like my enemy is not some crazy psychopath.

1:51:08.640 --> 1:51:13.640
 It's a state with a nuclear power to attack the most powerful country.

1:51:13.640 --> 1:51:16.640
 If Kim Jong Un decides if I die, I'm gonna die.

1:51:16.640 --> 1:51:18.640
 It's not up to me, right?

1:51:18.640 --> 1:51:23.640
 So in a way or just liberating that you...

1:51:23.640 --> 1:51:27.640
 It's like if you are afraid of some mobs or some gangsters on the street.

1:51:27.640 --> 1:51:30.640
 It's almost like you have power over it a little bit.

1:51:30.640 --> 1:51:32.640
 You gotta be thinking that's my fault.

1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:34.640
 I went that way, right?

1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:39.640
 But when it comes to Kim Jong Un, I know my enemy is so much bigger than me.

1:51:39.640 --> 1:51:41.640
 It's in a way it's a liberation.

1:51:41.640 --> 1:51:44.640
 And also I live a lot.

1:51:44.640 --> 1:51:46.640
 So I have seen a lot.

1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:47.640
 I've seen everything.

1:51:47.640 --> 1:51:49.640
 I don't have that much regret left here.

1:51:49.640 --> 1:51:51.640
 Like, okay, I'm going too soon, you know?

1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:53.640
 It's like, okay, maybe it's time.

1:51:53.640 --> 1:51:56.640
 Like death is a part of life, so...

1:51:56.640 --> 1:52:03.640
 In some sense you're willing to accept death to keep fighting for freedom in your...

1:52:03.640 --> 1:52:06.640
 In at least in part a place you call home.

1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:07.640
 Yeah, that is...

1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:10.640
 Do you hope that one day you can return to North Korea?

1:52:10.640 --> 1:52:11.640
 I hope so.

1:52:11.640 --> 1:52:18.640
 I hope I bring my son and tell him this is like where your ancestors from too.

1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:24.640
 It would look very different than the place you came from in your...

1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:26.640
 As you hope.

1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:35.640
 Do you hope that there's a democracy one day that North Korea looks like South Korea?

1:52:35.640 --> 1:52:39.640
 Well, that would be in paradise, right?

1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:42.640
 That's... But I'm a rational optimist.

1:52:42.640 --> 1:52:46.640
 I'm not like just optimistic because I have to be.

1:52:46.640 --> 1:52:50.640
 I think as long as there are people who have changed the world, right?

1:52:50.640 --> 1:52:54.640
 Like who believed in something and worked for it.

1:52:54.640 --> 1:52:56.640
 And like, I don't know like this though.

1:52:56.640 --> 1:53:00.640
 Like Alex Shiro has a few people holding entire this world, right?

1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:02.640
 I really believe in that.

1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:07.640
 I think as long as that continues, that can happen in my country.

1:53:07.640 --> 1:53:12.640
 As long as people like you someday decide to do something North Korea and working for it

1:53:12.640 --> 1:53:16.640
 using your brain power to solve this puzzle, how fascinating would that be?

1:53:16.640 --> 1:53:20.640
 That's why I continue to speak, continue to recruit.

1:53:20.640 --> 1:53:25.640
 To inspire millions to do something.

1:53:25.640 --> 1:53:28.640
 The books you like are all the books I love.

1:53:28.640 --> 1:53:30.640
 I have to mention this.

1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:38.640
 And briefly with Jordan Siddhartha by Herman Hesse is an incredible book.

1:53:38.640 --> 1:53:41.640
 I mean, I don't know exactly what I want to ask here.

1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:48.640
 But there's some... I think the book kind of through telling a story

1:53:48.640 --> 1:53:53.640
 reveals that life is suffering and yet there's beauty in it.

1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:59.640
 The beauty in every moment that it uses kind of a river to paint a metaphor.

1:53:59.640 --> 1:54:06.640
 Is there something that you could say, speak to, like, how that book impacted your life

1:54:06.640 --> 1:54:09.640
 and the way you live life, maybe the way you see life,

1:54:09.640 --> 1:54:14.640
 whether it's on the life of suffering side or that life is beautiful side?

1:54:14.640 --> 1:54:17.640
 I mean, he goes through entire journey, right?

1:54:17.640 --> 1:54:22.640
 He goes into state, like, I'm so enlightened that I cannot deal with the people who are there in love

1:54:22.640 --> 1:54:24.640
 and quiet about it, right?

1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:27.640
 They're like that's so primitive.

1:54:27.640 --> 1:54:32.640
 Once he has his own son, he actually being attached.

1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:36.640
 He actually cares. He actually really does the whole thing, right?

1:54:36.640 --> 1:54:38.640
 That's the thing that he used to think not.

1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:43.640
 Once his son comes finding him, he looks at life differently.

1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:48.640
 I think that's the thing. I did have the kind of journey where nothing matters, right?

1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:53.640
 So bitter, so, so like, so cynical.

1:54:53.640 --> 1:55:01.640
 And after I met so many incredible people, I was talking about that person who told me he was gay.

1:55:01.640 --> 1:55:05.640
 He told me, I love you. And I was like, why do you love me?

1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:09.640
 In the past, people when they wanted me was because they want to rape me.

1:55:09.640 --> 1:55:13.640
 Everybody wanted something from me. That's why they wanted me.

1:55:13.640 --> 1:55:17.640
 And I never understood, you can love somebody unconditionally.

1:55:17.640 --> 1:55:20.640
 And this gay guy, the last one was the one who sleep with me, right?

1:55:20.640 --> 1:55:22.640
 And he loves me.

1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:28.640
 And I think I had a blessing after my journey meeting people who loved me unconditionally

1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:30.640
 because I was just being a human.

1:55:30.640 --> 1:55:36.640
 And I think that's what it is now for me that like him, I live for love now.

1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:39.640
 I live for love. Any kinds of love.

1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:44.640
 Love for knowledge, I like, I read so many books because I love books, right?

1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:48.640
 I love what I do. I love my people. I love humanity.

1:55:48.640 --> 1:55:52.640
 You know, even it sometimes annoys me. I love myself.

1:55:52.640 --> 1:55:55.640
 And that's beautiful too. The annoying parts are beautiful too.

1:55:55.640 --> 1:55:57.640
 What do you, let me ask the ridiculous question.

1:55:57.640 --> 1:56:00.640
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?

1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:04.640
 Of what's the meaning of life?

1:56:04.640 --> 1:56:09.640
 Well, I think at this point, I stopped questioning why I'm here, right?

1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:12.640
 Like, it doesn't matter someone put that out on there or a big bang.

1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:15.640
 I'm here, that's truth, right? I'm going to accept that fully.

1:56:15.640 --> 1:56:19.640
 So what, instead of me keep asking the impossible question, what I'm here,

1:56:19.640 --> 1:56:22.640
 I'm going to let you do that, let the science do that, right?

1:56:22.640 --> 1:56:25.640
 You have to go out into space and look for the evidence.

1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:27.640
 I'm content.

1:56:27.640 --> 1:56:31.640
 You accept that you're here and you're just going to enjoy,

1:56:31.640 --> 1:56:34.640
 like you're here for love, as you said.

1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:40.640
 That's the thing. I think I'm here for the process of pursuing something bigger than me.

1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:46.640
 The process of doing something. It's not a moral, it's not a virtue signalling thing.

1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:50.640
 It just makes me happy that I fight for something bigger.

1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:52.640
 Like that me, right?

1:56:52.640 --> 1:56:56.640
 It's how boring is that every day you get up, oh my God, I'm going to buy myself this,

1:56:56.640 --> 1:56:59.640
 I'm going to get this for myself. It's so boring, isn't it?

1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:02.640
 So in a way, I think that's what it is.

1:57:02.640 --> 1:57:07.640
 I'm grateful that I'm in a state, I don't have to fight for myself anymore.

1:57:07.640 --> 1:57:12.640
 But many people have to do that. And that's sometimes more than enough they have to do.

1:57:12.640 --> 1:57:16.640
 And I salute them. They are fighting, saving themselves every day.

1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:21.640
 But now I'm not there. I'm very blessed. That's why I'm very grateful.

1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:24.640
 So fighting for something much bigger than you.

1:57:24.640 --> 1:57:28.640
 But do you still believe that you can change the world?

1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:37.640
 That you can be a thing that, at least in part, helps North Korea,

1:57:37.640 --> 1:57:40.640
 or even broader, helps alleviate some suffering in the world?

1:57:40.640 --> 1:57:44.640
 So that's the thing. I was reading this book, Fooled by Randomness, right?

1:57:44.640 --> 1:57:46.640
 Yeah.

1:57:46.640 --> 1:57:50.640
 I was like, they're up here like, oh my God, you're so courageous.

1:57:50.640 --> 1:57:52.640
 You're amazing. I was like, no, I'm not. I'm horrible.

1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:55.640
 I know myself. You don't want to tell me that.

1:57:55.640 --> 1:57:59.640
 It's random why I end up here. Why did I pick up English so quickly?

1:57:59.640 --> 1:58:03.640
 Why do I love books? I don't know why. It's random.

1:58:03.640 --> 1:58:05.640
 Don't ask why. Just enjoy it.

1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:10.640
 Yeah, it's random. I don't know how the history will remember me.

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:16.640
 I think the only thing I have to at this point is to make sure that people,

1:58:16.640 --> 1:58:20.640
 after consulting a lot of security teams, like now North Korea became a lot smarter.

1:58:20.640 --> 1:58:26.640
 Like you said, they make it more disguised as a suicide and a car accident.

1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:29.640
 So when I die, they don't even know I got cared.

1:58:29.640 --> 1:58:31.640
 I think that's a higher chance.

1:58:31.640 --> 1:58:35.640
 So I think that's the thing. People are suffering.

1:58:35.640 --> 1:58:37.640
 Take it or not is your choice.

1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:41.640
 And at least it's my responsibility for them to know what's going on.

1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:45.640
 I think if you did not know and didn't do anything, you are not even guilty of a thing.

1:58:45.640 --> 1:58:51.640
 But once you know, then you are not doing it. Then something is not right.

1:58:51.640 --> 1:58:56.640
 So that's what I'm doing. I want people to know.

1:58:56.640 --> 1:59:01.640
 And then what they want to do is not my problem afterwards.

1:59:01.640 --> 1:59:04.640
 So my role is very small in that regard.

1:59:04.640 --> 1:59:11.640
 And I just hope that we'll humanize North Koreans for the first time.

1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:14.640
 Because we have been so dehumanized.

1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:16.640
 Like we are looking like robots.

1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:21.640
 If you look at us marching and crying like when you later dies,

1:59:21.640 --> 1:59:24.640
 it almost seems like we don't even have the same emotions.

1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:27.640
 People cannot connect us in the same level.

1:59:27.640 --> 1:59:35.640
 And I think that's something media have done to us.

1:59:35.640 --> 1:59:42.640
 And you're shining a small light on this dark part of the world that I think...

1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:44.640
 And you make it, you're so modest.

1:59:44.640 --> 1:59:49.640
 But I think you will have that little light.

1:59:49.640 --> 1:59:59.640
 It just might be a big thing that changes that incredible amount of suffering that's happening on that part of the world.

1:59:59.640 --> 2:00:02.640
 You know what I mean? You're an amazing person.

2:00:02.640 --> 2:00:05.640
 I'm so fortunate to get a chance to talk with you.

2:00:05.640 --> 2:00:07.640
 I can't wait what you do in the future.

2:00:07.640 --> 2:00:09.640
 I hope you write many more books.

2:00:09.640 --> 2:00:12.640
 I do hope you continue making videos.

2:00:12.640 --> 2:00:14.640
 Continue having conversations.

2:00:14.640 --> 2:00:17.640
 You're an inspiration to me and millions of others.

2:00:17.640 --> 2:00:19.640
 I really appreciate you talking with me today.

2:00:19.640 --> 2:00:22.640
 I'm solid. Thank you.

2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:26.640
 Thank you for listening to this conversation with Younmi Park.

2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:31.640
 And thank you to Belcampo, Gala Games, BetterHelp, and Aidsleep.

2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:34.640
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

2:00:34.640 --> 2:00:38.640
 And now, let me leave you some words from Bob Marley.

2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:44.640
 Better to die fighting for freedom than be a prisoner all the days of your life.

2:00:44.640 --> 2:01:09.640
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
