00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
 The following is a conversation with Dan Carlin, host of Hardcore History and Common Sense

00:07.360 --> 00:17.040
 podcasts. To me, Hardcore History is one of, if not the greatest podcast ever made. Dan and Joe

00:17.040 --> 00:22.800
 Rogan are probably the two main people who got me to fall in love with the medium of podcasting

00:22.800 --> 00:31.120
 as a fan and eventually as a podcaster myself. Meeting Dan was surreal. To me, he was not just

00:31.120 --> 00:37.200
 the mere human like the rest of us, since his voice has been a guide through some of the darkest

00:37.200 --> 00:43.680
 moments of human history for me. Meeting him was like meeting Jenkins Kahn, Stalin, Hitler,

00:43.680 --> 00:49.520
 Alexander the Great, and all of the most powerful leaders in history all at once in a crappy hotel

00:49.520 --> 00:57.200
 room in the middle of Oregon. It turns out that he is in fact just the human and truly one of the

00:57.200 --> 01:04.720
 good ones. This was a pleasure and an honor for me. Quick mention of his sponsor, followed by

01:04.720 --> 01:10.480
 some thoughts related to the episode. First is Athletic Greens, the all in one drink that I

01:10.480 --> 01:16.720
 start every day with to cover all my nutritional bases. Second is Simply Safe, a home security

01:16.720 --> 01:23.600
 company I use to monitor and protect my apartment. Third is Magic Spoon, low carb, keto friendly

01:23.600 --> 01:29.440
 cereal that I think is delicious. And finally, Cash App, the app I use to send money to friends

01:29.440 --> 01:34.560
 for food and drinks. Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount

01:34.560 --> 01:41.120
 and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that I think we're living through one of

01:41.120 --> 01:47.920
 the most challenging moments in American history. To me, the way out is the reason and love.

01:49.040 --> 01:55.600
 Both require a deep understanding of human nature and of human history. This conversation is about

01:55.600 --> 02:05.120
 both. I am perhaps hopelessly optimistic about our future. But if indeed we stand at the precipice

02:05.120 --> 02:12.240
 of the great filter watching our world consumed by fire, think of this little podcast conversation

02:12.240 --> 02:18.960
 as the appetizer to the final meal before the apocalypse. If you enjoy this thing,

02:30.880 --> 02:37.200
 here's my conversation with the great Dan Carlin. Let's start with the highest

02:37.200 --> 02:44.640
 philosophical question. Do you think human beings are fundamentally good? Or are all of us capable

02:44.640 --> 02:51.840
 of both good and evil? And it's the environment that molds how we, the trajectory that we take

02:51.840 --> 02:59.360
 through life. How do we define evil? Evil seems to be a situational eye of the beholder kind of

02:59.360 --> 03:06.160
 question. So if we define evil, maybe I can get a better idea of, and that could be a whole show,

03:06.160 --> 03:12.480
 couldn't be defining evil. But when we say evil, what do we mean? That's a slippery one. But I think

03:12.480 --> 03:20.640
 there's some way in which your existence, your presence in the world leads to pain and suffering

03:20.640 --> 03:27.840
 and destruction for many others in the rest of the world. So you, you steal the resources and you

03:27.840 --> 03:35.040
 use them to create more suffering than there was before in the world. So I suppose it's somehow

03:35.040 --> 03:41.120
 deeply connected to this other slippery word, which is suffering. As you create suffering in the

03:41.120 --> 03:45.920
 world, you bring suffering to the world. But here's the problem, I think with it, because I fully

03:45.920 --> 03:52.400
 see where you're going with that. And I understand it. The problem is, is the question of the reason

03:52.400 --> 04:00.720
 for inflicting suffering. So sometimes one might inflict suffering upon one group of individuals

04:00.720 --> 04:06.880
 in order to maximize a lack of suffering with another group of individuals, or one who might not

04:06.880 --> 04:12.720
 be considered evil at all, might make the rational, seemingly rational choice of inflicting pain and

04:12.720 --> 04:18.000
 suffering on a smaller group of people in order to maximize the opposite of that for a larger group

04:18.000 --> 04:22.560
 of people. Yeah, that's one of the dark things about, I've spoken and read the work of Stephen

04:22.560 --> 04:26.880
 Codkin, I'm not sure if you're familiar with the historian, and he's basically a Stalin,

04:27.760 --> 04:33.920
 Joseph Stalin scholar. And one of the things I realized, I'm not sure where to put Hitler,

04:34.480 --> 04:43.600
 but with Stalin, it really seems that he was sane and he thought he was doing good for the world.

04:43.600 --> 04:50.000
 I really believe from everything I've read about Stalin, that he believed that communism

04:50.880 --> 04:56.800
 is good for the world. And if you have to kill a few people along the way, it's like you said,

04:56.800 --> 05:03.440
 the small groups, if you have to sort of remove the people that stand in the way of this utopian

05:03.440 --> 05:12.560
 system of communism, then that's actually good for the world. And it didn't seem to me that he

05:12.560 --> 05:17.760
 could even consider the possibility that he was evil. He really thought he was doing good for

05:17.760 --> 05:23.600
 the world. And that's stuck with me because he's one of the most, it's to our definition of evil.

05:24.480 --> 05:31.360
 He seems to have brought more evil onto this world than almost any human in history.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.800
 And I don't know what to do with that. Well, I'm fascinated with the concept,

05:36.800 --> 05:40.320
 so fascinated by it that the very first hardcore history show we ever did,

05:40.320 --> 05:47.680
 which was a full 15 or 16 minutes, was called Alexander versus Hitler. And the entire question

05:47.680 --> 05:54.880
 about it was the motivations. So if you go to a court of law because you killed somebody,

05:54.880 --> 06:00.160
 one of the things they're going to consider is why did you kill them? And if you killed somebody,

06:00.160 --> 06:04.800
 for example, in self defense, you're going to be treated differently than if you maliciously

06:04.800 --> 06:11.120
 killed somebody maliciously to take their wallet. And in the show, we wondered, because I don't

06:11.120 --> 06:17.760
 really make pronouncements, but we wondered about if you believe Hitler's writings, for example,

06:17.760 --> 06:22.880
 Mein Kampf, which is written by a guy who's a political figure who wants to get on. So I mean,

06:22.880 --> 06:28.720
 it's about as believable as any other political tract would be. But in his mind, the things that

06:28.720 --> 06:34.880
 he said that he had to do were designed for the betterment of the German people, right?

06:34.880 --> 06:39.280
 Whereas Alexander the Great, once again, this is somebody from more than 2000 years ago,

06:39.280 --> 06:44.800
 so with lots of propaganda in the intervening years. But one of the views of Alexander the Great

06:44.800 --> 06:50.400
 is that the reason he did what he did was, to, for lack of a better word, write his name in a

06:50.400 --> 06:55.200
 more permanent graffiti on the pages of history, right? In other words, to glorify himself. And

06:55.200 --> 07:01.520
 if that's the case, does that make Alexander a worse person than Hitler? Because Hitler thought

07:01.520 --> 07:06.560
 he was doing good, whereas Alexander, if you believe the interpretation, was simply trying to

07:06.560 --> 07:12.960
 exalt Alexander. So the motivations of the people doing these things, it seems to me, matter.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.600
 I don't think you can just sit there and go, the only thing that matters is the end result,

07:17.600 --> 07:22.880
 because that might have been an unintentional byproduct. In which case, that person, had you

07:22.880 --> 07:28.000
 been able to show them the future, might have changed what they were doing. So were they evil,

07:28.000 --> 07:32.720
 or misguided, or wrong, or made the right... And I hate to do that, because there's certain

07:32.720 --> 07:37.200
 people like Hitler that I don't feel deserve the benefit of the doubt. At the same time,

07:37.200 --> 07:42.480
 if you're fascinated by the concept of evil, and you delve into it deeply enough, you're going to

07:42.480 --> 07:48.560
 want to understand why these evil people did what they did. And sometimes, it can confuse the hell

07:48.560 --> 07:52.240
 out of you. Who wants to sit there and try to see things from Hitler's point of view, to get a

07:52.240 --> 07:57.040
 better understanding, and sort of commiserate with... But obviously, first history show,

07:57.040 --> 08:03.040
 I'm fascinated with the concept. So do you think it's possible, if we put ourselves in the mindset

08:03.040 --> 08:09.280
 of some of the people that have created so much suffering in the world, that all of them

08:10.160 --> 08:17.360
 had their motivations, had good intentions underlying them? No. It's simply because there's

08:17.360 --> 08:21.920
 so many. I mean, the law of averages would suggest that that's not true. I guess as

08:21.920 --> 08:30.640
 pure evil possible. Meaning, you, again, it's slippery, but the suffering is the goal.

08:32.000 --> 08:38.000
 Intentional suffering. Yes. And I think that there's historical figures that one could point...

08:38.000 --> 08:42.960
 But that gets to the deeper question of, are these people sane? Do they have something wrong

08:42.960 --> 08:50.640
 with them? Are they twisted from something in their youth? These are the kinds of things where

08:50.640 --> 08:55.440
 you start to delve into the psychological makeup of these people. In other words, is anybody born

08:55.440 --> 09:01.360
 evil? And I actually believe that some people are. I think the DNA can get scrambled up in ways.

09:01.360 --> 09:05.360
 I think the question of evil is important too, because I think it's an eye of the beholder

09:05.360 --> 09:11.600
 thing. I mean, if Hitler, for example, had been successful, and we were today on the sixth or

09:11.600 --> 09:17.680
 seventh leader of the Third Reich since I think his entire history would be viewed through a

09:17.680 --> 09:22.160
 different lens, because that's the way we do things. Genghis Khan looks different to the

09:22.160 --> 09:28.400
 Mongolians than he does to the residents of Baghdad. And I think so an eye of the beholder

09:28.400 --> 09:32.000
 question, I think, comes into all these sorts of things. As you said, it's a very slippery question.

09:34.000 --> 09:42.000
 As somebody who's fascinated by military history, where do you put violence in terms of

09:42.000 --> 09:47.920
 the human condition? Is it core to being human or is it just a little tool that we use every once

09:47.920 --> 09:53.360
 in a while? So I'm going to respond to your question with a question. What do you see the

09:53.360 --> 10:02.080
 difference being between violence and force? Let me go farther. I'm not sure that violence

10:02.080 --> 10:07.200
 is something that we have to put up with as human beings forever, that we must resign ourselves to

10:07.200 --> 10:16.480
 violence forever. But I have a much harder time seeing us able to abolish force. And there's

10:16.480 --> 10:22.640
 going to be some ground where if those two things are not the same, and I don't know that maybe they

10:22.640 --> 10:28.960
 are, where there's certainly some crossover. And I think force, you're an engineer, you'll

10:28.960 --> 10:33.920
 understand this better than I did, but think about it as a physical law. If you can't stop

10:33.920 --> 10:38.080
 something from moving in a certain direction without pushing back in that same direction,

10:39.120 --> 10:45.840
 I'm not sure that you can have a society or a civilization without the ability to

10:46.560 --> 10:52.320
 use a counter force when things are going wrong, whether it's on an individual level,

10:53.280 --> 10:59.840
 person attacks another person, so you step in to save that person. Or even at the highest

10:59.840 --> 11:06.400
 levels of politics or anything else, a counter force to stop the inertia or the impetus of

11:06.400 --> 11:13.840
 another movement. So I think that force is a simple, almost law of physics in human interaction,

11:13.840 --> 11:18.480
 especially at the civilizational level. I think civilization requires a certain amount of,

11:18.480 --> 11:25.600
 if not violence, then force. And again, they've talked, I mean, it goes back into St. Augustine,

11:25.600 --> 11:30.800
 all kinds of Christian beliefs about the proper use of force, and people have philosophically

11:30.800 --> 11:37.920
 tried to decide between, can you have sort of an ahinza, Buddhist sort of, we would be nonviolent

11:37.920 --> 11:43.120
 toward everything and exert no force, or there's a reason to have force in order to create the

11:43.120 --> 11:50.320
 space for good. I think force is inevitable. Now, we can talk, and I've not come up to the

11:50.320 --> 11:54.880
 conclusion myself, if there is a distinction to be made between force and violence, I mean,

11:54.880 --> 12:02.800
 is a nonviolent force enough or is violence when done for the cause of good, a different thing

12:02.800 --> 12:08.640
 than violence done either for the cause of evil, as you would say, or simply for random reasons.

12:08.640 --> 12:13.760
 I mean, we humans lack control sometimes. We can be violent for no apparent reason or goal.

12:14.480 --> 12:18.400
 And that's, I mean, listen, you look at the criminal justice system alone and the way we

12:18.400 --> 12:25.280
 interact with people who are acting out in ways that we as a society have decided is intolerable.

12:25.280 --> 12:30.320
 Can you deal with that without force and at some level violence? I don't know. Can you maintain

12:30.320 --> 12:37.040
 peacefulness without force? I don't know. Just to be a little bit more specific about the idea of

12:37.040 --> 12:46.720
 force. Do you put force as general enough to include force in the space of ideas? So you

12:46.720 --> 12:55.680
 mentioned Buddhism or religion or just Twitter. I can think of no things farther apart than that.

12:55.680 --> 13:06.000
 Okay. Is the battles we do in the space of ideas of the great debates throughout history,

13:06.000 --> 13:13.840
 do you put force into that? Or do you, in this conversation, are we trying to right now keep

13:13.840 --> 13:21.520
 it to just physical force in saying that you have an intuition that force might be with us

13:21.520 --> 13:32.320
 much longer than violence? I think the two bleed together. So take, because it's always my go to

13:32.320 --> 13:38.720
 example. I'm afraid and I'm sure that the listeners all hate it, but take Germany during the 1920s,

13:38.720 --> 13:44.720
 early 1930s, before the Nazis came to power. And they were always involved in some level of force,

13:44.720 --> 13:48.160
 you know, beating up in the streets or whatever it might be. But think about it more like an

13:48.160 --> 13:56.960
 intellectual discussion until a certain point. It would be difficult, I imagine, to keep the

13:56.960 --> 14:03.040
 intellectual counterforce of ideas from at some point degenerating into something that's more

14:03.040 --> 14:09.520
 coercion, counterforce if we want to use the phrases we were just talking about. So I think the two

14:09.520 --> 14:15.760
 are intimately connected. I mean, actions follow thought, right? And at a certain point, I think

14:15.760 --> 14:23.280
 especially when one is not achieving the goals that they want to achieve through peaceful discussion

14:23.280 --> 14:29.200
 or argumentation or trying to convince the other side that sometimes the next level of operations

14:29.200 --> 14:34.240
 is something a little bit more physically imposing, if that makes sense, we go from the intellectual

14:34.240 --> 14:39.840
 to the physical. Yeah, so it too easily spills over into violence. Yes. And one leads to the other

14:39.840 --> 14:46.400
 often. So you kind of implied a perhaps a hopeful message. Let me ask you in the form of a question,

14:46.400 --> 14:52.880
 do you think we'll always have war? I think it goes to the forced question too. So for example,

14:52.880 --> 15:01.280
 what do you do? I mean, let's play with nation states now, although I don't know that nation

15:01.280 --> 15:07.280
 states are something we should think of as a permanent construct or whatever. But how is one

15:07.280 --> 15:12.480
 nation state supposed to prevent another nation state from acting in ways that it would see as

15:12.480 --> 15:17.200
 either detrimental to the global community or detrimental to the interest of their own nation

15:17.200 --> 15:26.240
 state? I think we've had this question of going back to ancient times, but certainly in the 20th

15:26.240 --> 15:30.640
 century, this has come up quite a bit. I mean, the whole Second World War argument sometimes

15:30.640 --> 15:36.080
 revolves around the idea of what the proper counterforce should be. Can you create an entity,

15:36.080 --> 15:43.280
 a League of Nations, a United Nations, a one world entity maybe even, that alleviates the need

15:43.280 --> 15:48.080
 for counterforce involving mass violence and armies and navies and those things. I think

15:48.080 --> 15:55.200
 that's an open discussion we're still having. It's good to think through that because having

15:55.200 --> 16:01.360
 a United Nations, there's usually a centralized control. So there's humans at the top. There's

16:02.080 --> 16:10.000
 committees and usually leaders emerge as singular figures that then can become corrupted by power.

16:10.000 --> 16:14.480
 And it's just a really important, it feels like a really important thought experiment

16:15.040 --> 16:20.720
 and something to really rigorously think through. How can you construct systems of government

16:21.920 --> 16:29.040
 that are stable enough to push us towards less and less war and less and less

16:29.040 --> 16:38.800
 unstable and another tough word, which is unfair of application of force.

16:40.800 --> 16:44.560
 That's really at the core of the question that we're trying to figure out as humans.

16:44.560 --> 16:49.120
 As our weapons get better and better and better at destroying ourselves, it feels like it's

16:49.120 --> 16:56.560
 important to think about how we minimize the over application or unfair application of force.

16:56.560 --> 17:01.200
 There's other elements that come into play too. You and I are discussing this at the very high

17:01.200 --> 17:05.680
 intellectual level of things, but there's also a tail wagging the dog element to this. So think

17:05.680 --> 17:13.200
 of a society of warriors, a tribal society from a long time ago. How much do the fact that you

17:13.200 --> 17:18.560
 have warriors in your society and that their reason for existing, what they take pride in,

17:18.560 --> 17:25.680
 what they train for, their status in their own civilization, how much does that itself drive

17:25.680 --> 17:31.680
 the responses of that society? How much do you need war to legitimize warriors?

17:32.880 --> 17:36.400
 That's the old argument that you get to, and we've had this in the 20th century too, that

17:36.960 --> 17:43.920
 the creation of arms and armies creates an incentive to use them and that they themselves

17:43.920 --> 17:50.880
 can drive that incentive as a justification for their reasons for existence. That's where we

17:50.880 --> 17:55.040
 start to talk about the interactivity of all these different elements of society upon one

17:55.040 --> 18:00.240
 another. So when we talk about governments and war, well, you need to take into account the

18:00.240 --> 18:04.080
 various things those governments have put into place in terms of systems and armies and things

18:04.080 --> 18:09.760
 like that to protect themselves. For reasons we can all understand, but they exert a force on

18:09.760 --> 18:16.880
 your range of choices, don't they? It's true. You're making me realize that in my upbringing,

18:16.880 --> 18:23.840
 and I think I'm bringing of many, warriors are heroes. To me, I don't know where that feeling

18:23.840 --> 18:33.680
 comes from, but the sort of die fighting is an honorable way to die. It feels like that.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.080
 I've always had a problem with this because as a person interested in military history,

18:38.080 --> 18:44.480
 the distinction is important, and I try to make it at different levels. So at base level, the

18:44.480 --> 18:50.960
 people who are out there on the front lines doing the fighting, to me, those people can be compared

18:50.960 --> 18:59.680
 with police officers and firemen and people that fire persons. But I mean, people that are involved

18:59.680 --> 19:08.800
 in an ethical attempt to perform a task, which ultimately, one can see in many situations as

19:08.800 --> 19:16.560
 being a saving sort of task, right? Or if nothing else, a self sacrifice for what they see as the

19:16.560 --> 19:22.080
 greater good. Now, I draw a distinction between the individuals and the entity that they're a part

19:22.080 --> 19:27.840
 of, a military. And I certainly draw a distinction between the military and then the entire, for

19:27.840 --> 19:34.080
 lack of a better word, military industrial complex that that service is a part of. I feel a lot less

19:35.280 --> 19:40.960
 moral attachment to those upper echelons than I do the people on the ground. The people on the

19:40.960 --> 19:45.760
 ground could be any of us and have been in a lot of... We have a very professional sort of

19:45.760 --> 19:53.600
 military now where it's a subset of the population. But in other periods of time, we've had conscription

19:53.600 --> 19:58.480
 and drafts and it hasn't been a subset of the population. It's been the population, right?

19:58.480 --> 20:04.320
 And so it is the society oftentimes going to war. And I make a distinction between those warriors

20:04.320 --> 20:09.920
 and the entities either in the system that they're part of the military or the people that control

20:09.920 --> 20:16.160
 the military at the highest political levels. I feel a lot less moral attachment to them and I

20:16.160 --> 20:24.960
 have a much harsher about how I feel about them. I do not consider the military itself to be heroic

20:24.960 --> 20:29.920
 and I do not consider the military industrial complex to be heroic. I do think that is a tail

20:29.920 --> 20:37.440
 wagging the dog situation. I do think that draws us into looking at military endeavors as a solution

20:37.440 --> 20:42.800
 to the problem much more quickly than we otherwise might. And to be honest, to tie it all together,

20:42.800 --> 20:49.360
 I actually look at the victims of this as the soldiers we were talking about. If you set a fire

20:49.920 --> 20:57.120
 to send firemen into to fight, then I feel bad for the firemen. I feel like you've abused the

20:57.120 --> 21:02.000
 trust that you give those people, right? So when people talk about war, I always think that the

21:02.000 --> 21:07.840
 people that we have to make sure that a war is really necessary in order to protect are the

21:07.840 --> 21:11.920
 people that you're going to send over there to fight that. The greatest victims in our society

21:11.920 --> 21:18.560
 of war are often the warriors. So in my mind, when we see these people coming home from places

21:18.560 --> 21:23.360
 like Iraq, a place where I would have made the argument and did at the time that we didn't belong,

21:23.920 --> 21:28.080
 to me, those people are victims. And I know they don't like to think about themselves that way

21:28.080 --> 21:35.040
 because it runs totally counter to the ethos. But if you're sending people to protect this country

21:35.040 --> 21:40.560
 shores, those are heroes. If you're sending people to go do something that they otherwise

21:40.560 --> 21:44.160
 probably don't need to do, but they're there for political reasons or anything else you

21:44.160 --> 21:48.560
 want to put in that's not defense related, well, then you've made victims of our heroes.

21:48.560 --> 21:54.400
 And so I feel like we do a lot of talk about our troops and our soldiers and stuff,

21:54.400 --> 22:00.400
 but we don't treat them as valuable as the rhetoric makes them sound. Otherwise, we would be

22:02.480 --> 22:07.280
 much more careful about where we put them. If you're going to send my son, and I don't have a son,

22:07.280 --> 22:13.200
 I have daughters, but if you're going to send my son into harm's way, I'm going to demand

22:13.200 --> 22:17.200
 that you really need to be sending him into harm's way. And I'm going to be angry at you

22:17.200 --> 22:22.800
 if you put him into harm's way, if it doesn't warrant it. And so I have much more suspicion

22:22.800 --> 22:27.360
 about the system that sends these people into these situations where they're required to be

22:27.360 --> 22:33.280
 heroic than I do the people on the ground that I look at as either the people that are defending

22:33.280 --> 22:39.920
 us in situations like the Second World War, for example, or the people that turn out to be

22:39.920 --> 22:44.720
 the individual victims of a system where they're just a cog and a machine and the machine doesn't

22:44.720 --> 22:51.120
 really care as much about them as the rhetoric and the propaganda would insinuate.

22:51.120 --> 22:56.320
 Yeah. And as my own family history, it would be nice if we could talk about

22:57.440 --> 23:00.880
 there's a gray area in the places that you're talking about.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.960
 There's a gray area in everything.

23:02.960 --> 23:09.520
 In everything. But when that gray area is part of your own blood, as it is for me,

23:10.080 --> 23:15.440
 it's worth shining a light on somehow.

23:15.440 --> 23:17.600
 Sure. Give me an example of what you mean.

23:17.600 --> 23:22.080
 So you did a program of four episodes of Ghosts of the Ostfront.

23:22.080 --> 23:22.640
 Yeah.

23:22.640 --> 23:29.920
 So I was born in the Soviet Union. I was raised in Moscow. My dad was born and raised in Kiev.

23:30.480 --> 23:37.760
 My grandmother, who just recently passed away, was raised in Ukraine.

23:38.320 --> 23:38.800
 She...

23:38.800 --> 23:39.440
 City.

23:39.440 --> 23:44.000
 It's a small city on the border between Russia and Ukraine.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.600
 I have a grandfather born in Kiev.

23:45.600 --> 23:48.800
 In Kiev. The interesting thing about the timing of everything,

23:49.520 --> 23:52.800
 as you might be able to connect, is she survived...

23:52.800 --> 23:57.040
 She's the most badass woman I've ever encountered in my life.

23:57.040 --> 24:00.640
 And most of the warrior spirit I carry is probably from her.

24:01.520 --> 24:05.200
 She survived the Ukrainian starvation of the 30s.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.920
 She was a beautiful teenage girl during the Nazi occupation.

24:09.920 --> 24:17.120
 So she survived all of that. And, of course, family that everybody, you know,

24:17.680 --> 24:20.560
 and so many people died through that whole process.

24:21.120 --> 24:28.160
 And one of the things you talk about in your program is that the gray area is...

24:28.160 --> 24:32.880
 Even with the warriors, it happened to them, just like you're saying now.

24:33.760 --> 24:34.720
 They didn't have a choice.

24:34.720 --> 24:44.240
 So my grandfather, on the other side, he was a machine gunner that was in Ukraine that...

24:44.240 --> 24:45.440
 In the Red Army?

24:45.440 --> 24:47.200
 In the Red Army, yeah.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.320
 And they threw...

24:49.600 --> 24:52.640
 Like, the statement was that there's...

24:53.360 --> 24:56.480
 I don't know if it's obvious or not, but the rule was there's no surrender.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.560
 So you better die.

24:58.560 --> 25:05.040
 So you... I mean, basically, the goal was when he was fighting, and he was lucky enough,

25:05.040 --> 25:13.680
 one of the only to survive by being wounded early on, is there was a march of Nazis towards,

25:13.680 --> 25:22.080
 I guess, Moscow, and the whole goal in Ukraine was to slow them into the winter.

25:22.080 --> 25:31.520
 I mean, I view him as such a hero, and he believed that he's indestructible, which is survivor bias,

25:31.520 --> 25:37.680
 and that, you know, bullets can't hurt him, and that's what everybody believed.

25:37.680 --> 25:41.280
 And of course, basically, everyone that...

25:41.280 --> 25:46.160
 He quickly rose to the ranks, let's just put it this way, because everybody died.

25:46.160 --> 25:54.080
 It was just bodies dragging these heavy machine guns, always slowly retreating,

25:54.080 --> 26:00.240
 shooting, and retreating, shooting, and retreating, and I don't know, he was a hero to me.

26:01.520 --> 26:08.320
 Like, I grew up thinking that he was the one that sort of defeated the Nazis, right?

26:08.320 --> 26:13.360
 But the reality, there could be another perspective, which is all of this happened to him,

26:13.360 --> 26:21.520
 by the incompetence of Stalin, the incompetence, and men of the Soviet Union being used like pawns,

26:21.520 --> 26:26.480
 in a shittily played game of chess, right?

26:26.480 --> 26:33.520
 So, like, one narrative of him as a victim, as you're kind of describing,

26:33.520 --> 26:40.560
 and then somehow that's more parallel to what I'm talking about,

26:40.560 --> 26:46.480
 and then somehow that's more paralyzing, and that's more...

26:46.480 --> 26:53.440
 I don't know, it feels better to think of him as a hero, and as Russia,

26:53.440 --> 26:55.200
 Soviet Union saving the world.

26:55.200 --> 27:00.240
 I mean, that narrative also is in the United States, that the United States was key

27:00.240 --> 27:02.560
 in saving the world from the Nazis.

27:02.560 --> 27:05.520
 It feels like that narrative is powerful for people.

27:05.520 --> 27:09.360
 I'm not sure, and I carry it still with me,

27:09.360 --> 27:13.840
 but when I think about the right way to think about that war,

27:13.840 --> 27:17.120
 I'm not sure if that's the correct narrative.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.400
 Let me suggest something.

27:18.400 --> 27:24.480
 There's a line that a marine named Eugene Sledge had said once,

27:24.480 --> 27:28.720
 and I keep it on my phone because it makes a real distinction,

27:28.720 --> 27:33.200
 and he said, the front line is really where the war is.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.720
 And anybody, even a hundred yards behind the front line,

27:36.720 --> 27:39.600
 doesn't know what it's really like.

27:39.600 --> 27:44.880
 The difference is, there are lots of people miles behind the front line that are in danger.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.120
 You can be in a medical unit in the rear,

27:47.120 --> 27:50.000
 and artillery could strike you, planes could strike you.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.480
 You could be in danger, but at the front line,

27:52.480 --> 27:53.760
 there are two different things.

27:53.760 --> 27:58.480
 One is that, and I'm doing a lot of reading on this right now,

27:58.480 --> 27:59.840
 and reading a lot of veterans accounts,

28:00.800 --> 28:04.720
 James Jones who wrote books like From Here to Eternity,

28:04.720 --> 28:08.480
 fictional accounts of the Second World War, but he based them on his own service.

28:08.480 --> 28:11.920
 He was at Guadalcanal, for example, in 1942.

28:11.920 --> 28:17.520
 And Jones had said that the evolution of a soldier in front line action

28:17.520 --> 28:22.240
 requires an almost surrendering to the idea that you're going to live,

28:22.240 --> 28:26.160
 that you become accustomed to the idea that you're going to die.

28:26.160 --> 28:31.200
 And he said, you're a different person simply for considering that thought seriously,

28:31.200 --> 28:32.800
 because most of us don't.

28:32.800 --> 28:36.560
 But what that allows you to do is to do that job at the front line, right?

28:36.560 --> 28:39.200
 If you're too concerned about your own life,

28:40.240 --> 28:44.240
 you become less of a good guy at your job, right?

28:44.240 --> 28:47.920
 The other thing that the people in the 100 yards at the front line do,

28:47.920 --> 28:50.880
 that the people in the rear medical unit really don't,

28:51.440 --> 28:53.920
 is you kill, and you kill a lot, right?

28:53.920 --> 28:56.640
 You don't just, oh, there's a sniper back here, so I shot him.

28:56.640 --> 29:00.000
 It's we go from one position to another, and we kill lots of people.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.920
 Those things will change you.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.560
 And what that tends to do, not universally,

29:04.560 --> 29:07.680
 because I've read accounts from Red Army soldiers,

29:07.680 --> 29:09.600
 and they're very patriotic, right?

29:09.600 --> 29:15.760
 But a lot of that patriotism comes through years later as part of the nostalgia and the remembering.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.160
 When you're down at that front 100 yards,

29:18.160 --> 29:21.280
 it is often boiled down to a very small world.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.760
 So your grandfather, was it your grandfather?

29:23.760 --> 29:24.320
 Grandfather.

29:24.320 --> 29:29.360
 At the machine gun, he's concerned about his position and his comrades.

29:29.360 --> 29:32.080
 And the people who he owes a responsibility to.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.640
 And those, it's a very small world at that point.

29:34.640 --> 29:36.800
 And to me, that's where the heroism is, right?

29:36.800 --> 29:40.240
 He's not fighting for some giant world, civilizational thing.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.800
 He's fighting to save the people next to him,

29:42.800 --> 29:45.760
 and his own life at the same time, because they're saving him too.

29:45.760 --> 29:49.120
 And that there is a huge amount of heroism to that.

29:49.120 --> 29:51.360
 And that gets to our question about force earlier.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.800
 Why would you use force?

29:52.800 --> 29:56.080
 Well, how about to protect these people on either side of me, right?

29:56.080 --> 29:56.720
 They're lives.

29:56.720 --> 29:57.840
 They're lives.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.080
 Now, is there hatred?

30:00.880 --> 30:03.120
 Yeah, he hated the Germans for what they were doing.

30:03.120 --> 30:07.360
 As a matter of fact, I got a note from a poll not that long ago.

30:07.360 --> 30:10.560
 And I have this tendency to refer to the Nazis, right?

30:10.560 --> 30:11.760
 The regime that was...

30:11.760 --> 30:13.920
 And he said, why do you keep calling them Nazis?

30:13.920 --> 30:15.600
 He says, say what they were.

30:15.600 --> 30:17.120
 They were Germans.

30:17.120 --> 30:21.680
 And this guy wanted me to not absolve Germany by saying,

30:21.680 --> 30:24.400
 oh, it was this awful group of people that took over your country.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.560
 He said the Germans did this.

30:26.560 --> 30:28.400
 And there's that bitterness where he says,

30:28.400 --> 30:32.800
 let's not forget what they did to us and what we had to do back, right?

30:33.600 --> 30:36.960
 So for me, when we talk about these combat situations,

30:36.960 --> 30:39.520
 the reason I call these people heroic is because of...

30:40.320 --> 30:42.720
 They're fighting to defend things we could all understand.

30:42.720 --> 30:47.280
 I mean, if you come after my brother and I take a machine gun and shoot you,

30:48.320 --> 30:50.560
 and you're going to overrun me, I mean, you're going to...

30:50.560 --> 30:53.600
 That becomes a situation when we talked about counter force earlier.

30:53.600 --> 30:56.640
 Much easier to call yourself a hero when you're saving people,

30:56.640 --> 30:58.560
 or you're saving this town right behind you.

30:58.560 --> 31:00.880
 And you know, if they get through your machine gun,

31:00.880 --> 31:02.320
 they're going to burn these villages.

31:02.320 --> 31:05.120
 They're going to throw these people out in the middle of winter, these families.

31:05.120 --> 31:08.160
 That to me is a very different sort of heroism

31:08.160 --> 31:11.760
 than this amorphous idea of patriotism.

31:11.760 --> 31:16.400
 You know, patriotism is a thing that we often get used with, right?

31:16.400 --> 31:20.160
 People manipulate us through love of country and all this,

31:20.160 --> 31:22.960
 because they understand that this is something we feel very strong.

31:22.960 --> 31:25.760
 We feel very strongly, but they use it against us sometimes

31:26.320 --> 31:29.360
 in order to whip up a war fever or to get people...

31:29.360 --> 31:32.560
 I mean, there's a great line, and I wish I could remember it in its entirety,

31:32.560 --> 31:37.040
 that Herman Göring had said about how easy it was to get the people into a war.

31:37.040 --> 31:39.440
 He says, you know, you just appeal to their patriotism.

31:39.440 --> 31:41.360
 I mean, there's buttons that you can push,

31:41.360 --> 31:44.400
 and they take advantage of things like love of country,

31:44.400 --> 31:48.560
 and the way we have a loyalty and admiration to the warriors

31:48.560 --> 31:50.000
 who put their lives on the line.

31:50.000 --> 31:53.680
 These are manipulatable things in the human species

31:53.680 --> 31:58.800
 that reliably can be counted on to move us in directions that,

31:58.800 --> 32:04.960
 in a more sober, reflective state of mind, we would consider differently.

32:04.960 --> 32:06.880
 It gets the... I mean, you get this war fever up,

32:06.880 --> 32:09.760
 and people wave flags, and they start denouncing the enemy,

32:09.760 --> 32:12.880
 and they start saying, you know, we've seen it over and over and over again.

32:12.880 --> 32:14.560
 In ancient times, this happened.

32:14.560 --> 32:17.280
 But the love of country is also beautiful.

32:17.280 --> 32:22.080
 So, I haven't seen it in America as much, so people in America love their country.

32:22.080 --> 32:24.080
 Like, this patriotism is strong in America,

32:24.640 --> 32:27.440
 but it's not as strong as I remember,

32:27.440 --> 32:32.560
 even with my sort of being younger, the love of the Soviet Union.

32:33.680 --> 32:36.560
 Now, was it the Soviet Union that requires a distinction,

32:36.560 --> 32:38.240
 or was it Mother Russia?

32:39.040 --> 32:41.200
 What it really was, was the Communist Party.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.520
 Okay, so it was the system in place, okay.

32:43.520 --> 32:47.600
 The system in place, like loving, I haven't quite deeply

32:47.600 --> 32:49.920
 psychoanalyzed exactly what you love.

32:49.920 --> 32:58.560
 I think you love that populist message of the worker, of the common man, the common...

32:58.560 --> 33:00.480
 So, let me draw the comparison, then.

33:01.280 --> 33:06.160
 And I often say this, that the United States, like the Soviet Union,

33:06.160 --> 33:09.840
 is an ideological based society, right?

33:09.840 --> 33:12.160
 So, you take a country like France.

33:12.160 --> 33:15.280
 It doesn't matter which French government you're in now.

33:15.280 --> 33:17.760
 The French have been the French for a long time, right?

33:18.560 --> 33:21.520
 It's not based on an ideology, right?

33:21.520 --> 33:27.600
 Whereas what unites the United States is an ideology, freedom, liberty, the Constitution.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.040
 This is what draws the E pluribus unum, kind of the idea, right?

33:31.040 --> 33:35.840
 That out of many one, well, what binds all these unique different people,

33:35.840 --> 33:38.400
 these shared beliefs, this ideology.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.560
 The Soviet Union was the same way, because as you know,

33:40.560 --> 33:45.280
 the Soviet Union, Russia was merely one part of this Soviet Union.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.920
 And if you believe the rhetoric until Stalin's time,

33:48.480 --> 33:53.680
 everybody was going to be united under this ideological banner someday, right?

33:53.680 --> 33:55.200
 It was a global revolution.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.400
 So, ideological societies are different.

33:58.400 --> 34:05.200
 And to be a fan of the ideological framework and goal, I mean, I'm a liberty person, right?

34:05.200 --> 34:09.120
 I would like to see everybody in the world have my system of government,

34:09.120 --> 34:11.760
 which is part of a bias, right?

34:11.760 --> 34:13.520
 Because they might not want that.

34:13.520 --> 34:17.040
 But I think it's better for everyone, because I think it's better for me.

34:17.040 --> 34:21.600
 At the same time, when the ideology, if you consider, and you know,

34:21.600 --> 34:25.920
 this stems from ideas of the Enlightenment, and there's a bias there,

34:25.920 --> 34:28.880
 so my bias are toward the, but you feel, and this is why you say,

34:28.880 --> 34:30.960
 we're going to bring freedom to Iraq, we're going to bring freedom to here,

34:30.960 --> 34:33.680
 we're going to bring freedom because we think we're spreading to you

34:33.680 --> 34:37.040
 something that is just undeniably positive.

34:37.040 --> 34:39.840
 We're going to free you and give you this.

34:41.840 --> 34:46.880
 It's hard for me to wipe my own bias away from there, right?

34:46.880 --> 34:50.880
 Because if I were in Iraq, for example, I would want freedom, right?

34:50.880 --> 34:55.120
 But if you then leave and let the Iraqis vote for whomever they want,

34:55.120 --> 34:58.480
 are they going to vote for somebody that will, I mean, you know,

34:58.480 --> 35:05.920
 you look at Russia now, and I hear from Russians quite a bit because so much of my views on Russia

35:05.920 --> 35:11.920
 and the Soviet Union were formed in my formative years, and we were not hearing from many people

35:11.920 --> 35:13.920
 in the Soviet Union back then, but now you do.

35:13.920 --> 35:18.720
 You hear from Russians today who will say, your views on Stalin are archaic and cold.

35:18.720 --> 35:23.920
 So you try to reorient your beliefs a little bit, but it goes to this idea of if you gave the people

35:23.920 --> 35:29.920
 in Russia a free and fair vote, will they vote for somebody who promises them a free and open society

35:29.920 --> 35:34.800
 based on Enlightenment democratic principles, or will they vote for somebody we in the US would go,

35:34.800 --> 35:38.800
 what are they doing? They're voting for some strong man who's just going, you know, so,

35:39.680 --> 35:45.840
 I think it's very hard to throw away our own biases and preconceptions, and, you know,

35:45.840 --> 35:50.960
 it's an all eye of the beholder kind of thing. But when you're talking about ideological societies,

35:51.840 --> 35:58.880
 it is very difficult to throw off all the years of indoctrination into the superiority of your

35:58.880 --> 36:03.840
 system. I mean, listen, in the Soviet Union, Marxism one way or another was part of every

36:03.840 --> 36:08.960
 classrooms, you know, you could be studying geometry and they'll throw Marxism in there somehow,

36:08.960 --> 36:14.080
 because that's what united the society. And that's what gave it a higher purpose. And that's what

36:14.080 --> 36:20.320
 made it in the minds of the people who were its defenders, a superior morally superior system.

36:20.320 --> 36:25.040
 And we do the same thing here. In fact, most people do. But see, you're still French, no matter

36:25.040 --> 36:30.640
 what the ideology or the government might be. So in that sense, it's funny that there would be

36:30.640 --> 36:36.560
 a Cold War with these two systems, because they're both ideologically based systems involving peoples

36:36.560 --> 36:40.960
 of many different backgrounds who are united under the umbrella of the ideology.

36:41.840 --> 36:48.400
 First of all, that's brilliantly put. I'm in a funny position that in my formative years,

36:48.400 --> 36:55.600
 I came here when I was 13, is when I, you know, teenage is your first love or whatever,

36:55.600 --> 37:00.800
 is I fall in love with the American set of ideas of freedom and individuals.

37:00.800 --> 37:02.560
 They're telling, aren't they? They're telling, yes.

37:02.560 --> 37:07.280
 But I also remember, it's like you remember like maybe an ex girlfriend or something like that.

37:07.280 --> 37:17.600
 I also remember loving as a very different human, the Soviet idea, like we had the national anthem,

37:17.600 --> 37:22.400
 which is still I think the most badass national anthem, which is the Soviet Union,

37:22.400 --> 37:28.320
 like saying we're the indestructible nation. I mean, just the words are so like American words

37:28.320 --> 37:34.240
 are like, oh, we're nice. Like we're freedom. But like a Russian Soviet Union national anthem was

37:34.240 --> 37:41.280
 like, we're bad motherfuckers. Nobody will destroy us. I just remember feeling pride in a nation as

37:41.280 --> 37:46.960
 a kid, like dumb, not knowing anything, because we all had to recite the stuff. It was there's

37:46.960 --> 37:51.440
 a uniformity to everything. There's pride underlying everything. I didn't think about

37:51.440 --> 37:58.480
 all the destructive nature of the bureaucracy, the incompetence, the, you know, all the things

37:58.480 --> 38:07.120
 that come with the implementation of communism, especially around the 80s and 90s. But I remember

38:07.120 --> 38:13.520
 what it's like to love that set of ideas. So in a funny place of like, remember, like,

38:13.520 --> 38:17.280
 switching the love because I'm, you know, I kind of joke around about being Russian.

38:17.280 --> 38:23.600
 But, you know, my long term monogamous relationship is now with the idea, the American ideal,

38:23.600 --> 38:29.840
 like I'm stuck with it in my mind. But I remember what it was like to love it. And I think about

38:29.840 --> 38:34.720
 that too, when people criticize China or they criticize the current state of affairs with

38:35.440 --> 38:43.920
 how Stalin is remembered and how Putin is to know that the, you can't always wear

38:43.920 --> 38:52.240
 the American ideal of individualism, radical individualism and freedom in analyzing the ways

38:52.240 --> 38:59.680
 of the world elsewhere, like in China, in Russia, that it does, if you don't take yourself too

38:59.680 --> 39:07.520
 seriously, as Americans all do, as I do, it's kind of a beautiful love to have for your government,

39:07.520 --> 39:13.440
 to believe in the nation, to let go of yourself and your rights and your freedoms,

39:13.440 --> 39:20.400
 to believe in something bigger than yourself. That's actually, that's a kind of freedom.

39:20.400 --> 39:25.760
 That's, you're actually liberating yourself, if you think like life is suffering, you're

39:25.760 --> 39:32.640
 giving into the flow of the water, the flow, the way of the world by giving away more power

39:32.640 --> 39:38.560
 from yourself and giving it to what you would conceive as, as the power of the people together.

39:38.560 --> 39:46.240
 Together, we'll do great things and really believing in the ideals of what, in that case,

39:46.240 --> 39:50.240
 in this case, I don't even know what you would call Russia, but whatever the heck that is,

39:50.240 --> 39:59.200
 authoritarian, powerful state, powerful leader, believing that can be as beautiful as believing

39:59.200 --> 40:08.240
 the American ideal. Not just that. Let me add to what you're saying. I spend a lot of time trying

40:08.240 --> 40:15.440
 to get out of my own biases. It is a fruitless endeavor long term, but you try to be better than

40:15.440 --> 40:21.040
 you normally are. One of the critiques that China, and I always, as an American, I tend to think

40:21.040 --> 40:25.040
 about this as their government. This is a rationale that their government puts forward,

40:25.040 --> 40:30.320
 but what you just said is actually, if you can make that viewpoint beautiful,

40:30.320 --> 40:35.520
 is kind of a beautiful way of approaching it. The Chinese would say that what we call human

40:35.520 --> 40:39.760
 rights in the United States and what we consider to be everybody's birthright around the world

40:40.400 --> 40:46.480
 is instead Western rights. That's the words they use, Western rights. It's a fundamentally

40:46.480 --> 40:53.680
 Western oriented, and I'll go back to the Enlightenment based ideas on what constitutes

40:53.680 --> 41:00.160
 the rights of man. They would suggest that that's not internationally and always applicable,

41:00.160 --> 41:05.120
 that you can make a case. Again, I don't believe this. This runs against my own personal views,

41:05.120 --> 41:10.960
 but that you could make a case that the collective well being of a very large group of people

41:11.440 --> 41:17.920
 outweighs the individual needs of any single person, especially if those things are in conflict

41:17.920 --> 41:24.080
 with each other. If you cannot provide for the greater good because everyone's so individualistic,

41:24.080 --> 41:29.040
 well then, really, what is the better thing to do, to suppress individualism so everybody's

41:29.040 --> 41:35.360
 better off? I think trying to recognize how someone else might see that is important.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.120
 You had talked about eliminating war. We talked about eliminating conflict.

41:39.840 --> 41:44.000
 The first need to do that is to try to understand how someone else might view

41:44.000 --> 41:49.760
 something differently than yourself. I am famously one of those people who buys in

41:50.320 --> 41:56.640
 to the ideas of traditional Americanism. A lot of people who live today, I mean,

41:56.640 --> 42:03.440
 they would seem to think that things like patriotism requires a belief in the strong

42:03.440 --> 42:07.280
 military and all these things we have today, but that is a corruption of traditional Americanism,

42:07.280 --> 42:12.160
 which viewed all those things with suspicion in the first 100 years of the Republic because

42:12.160 --> 42:19.040
 they saw it as an enemy to the very things that Americans celebrated. How could you have freedom

42:19.040 --> 42:25.360
 and liberty and individualistic expression if you had an overriding military that was always

42:25.360 --> 42:30.640
 fighting wars and the founders of this country looked to other examples, like Europe, for example,

42:30.640 --> 42:36.560
 and saw that standing militaries, for example, standing armies, were the enemy of liberty.

42:36.560 --> 42:43.200
 Well, we have a standing army now and one that is totally interwoven in our entire society.

42:43.200 --> 42:49.040
 If you could go back in time and talk to John Quincy Adams, early president of the United

42:49.040 --> 42:55.680
 States, and show him what we have now, he would think it was awful and horrible and that somewhere

42:55.680 --> 43:01.600
 along the line, the Americans had lost their way and forgotten what they were all about.

43:01.600 --> 43:08.880
 But we have so successfully interwoven this modern military industrial complex with the

43:08.880 --> 43:15.440
 traditional benefits of the American system and ideology so that they've become intertwined in

43:15.440 --> 43:21.280
 our thinking, whereas 150 years ago, they were actually considered to be at opposite polarities

43:21.280 --> 43:27.600
 and a threat to one another. So when you talk about the love of the nation, I tend to be

43:27.600 --> 43:33.440
 suspicious of those things. I tend to be suspicious of government. I tend to try very hard to not be

43:33.440 --> 43:40.080
 manipulated and I feel like a large part of what they do is manipulation and propaganda.

43:40.080 --> 43:48.000
 And so I think a healthy skepticism of the nation state is actually 100% Americanism in the

43:48.000 --> 43:52.880
 traditional sense of the word. But I also have to recognize, as you so eloquently stated,

43:52.880 --> 44:01.760
 Americanism is not necessarily universal at all. And so I think we have to try to be more

44:01.760 --> 44:08.160
 understanding. The traditional American viewpoint is that if a place like China does not allow their

44:08.160 --> 44:14.160
 people individual human rights, then they're being denied something. They're being denied and 100

44:14.160 --> 44:19.280
 years ago, they would have said they're God given rights. Man is born free. And if he's not free,

44:19.280 --> 44:25.360
 it's because of something done to him. The government has taken away his God given rights.

44:25.360 --> 44:31.200
 I'm getting excited just listening to that. But I mean, I think the idea that this is universal

44:31.200 --> 44:37.360
 is in and of itself a bias. Now, do I want freedom for everybody else? I sure do. But the people in

44:37.360 --> 44:42.880
 the Soviet Union who really bought into that wanted the workers of the world to unite and not be

44:42.880 --> 44:49.760
 exploited by the greedy bloodsucking people who worked them to death and pocketed all of the

44:49.760 --> 44:55.840
 fruits of their labor. If you frame it that way, that sounds like justice as well. So it is an

44:55.840 --> 45:05.680
 eye of the beholder sort of thing. I'd love to talk to you about Vladimir Putin while we're on

45:05.680 --> 45:10.800
 this feeling and wave of empathy and trying to understand others that are not like us.

45:10.800 --> 45:17.760
 One of the reasons I started this podcast is because I believe that there's a few people I could talk

45:17.760 --> 45:27.520
 to. Some of it is ego. Some of it is stupidity. Is there some people I could talk to that not many

45:27.520 --> 45:32.640
 others can talk to? The one person I was always thinking about was Vladimir Putin.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.640
 Do you still speak the language?

45:34.640 --> 45:36.160
 I speak the language very well.

45:36.160 --> 45:40.240
 That makes it even easier. I mean, you might be appointed for that job.

45:40.240 --> 45:47.280
 That's the context in which I'm asking you this question. What are your thoughts about

45:47.280 --> 45:53.680
 Vladimir Putin from historical context? Have you studied him? Have you thought about him?

45:53.680 --> 46:02.880
 Yes. Studied is a loaded word. I find it hard sometimes to not filter

46:02.880 --> 46:09.600
 things through an American lens. So as an American, I would say that the Russian should

46:09.600 --> 46:14.400
 be allowed to have any leader that they want to have. But what an American would say is,

46:14.960 --> 46:21.280
 but there should be elections. If the Russians choose Vladimir Putin and they keep choosing him,

46:21.840 --> 46:28.080
 that's their business. Whereas an American, I would have a problem is when that leader

46:28.080 --> 46:34.240
 stops letting the Russians make that decision. We would say, well, now you're no longer ruling

46:34.240 --> 46:39.920
 by the consent of the governed. You've become the equivalent of a person who may be oppressing

46:39.920 --> 46:45.120
 your people. You might as well be a dictator. Now, there's a difference between a freely

46:45.120 --> 46:50.240
 elected and reelected and reelected and reelected dictator if that's what they want.

46:52.160 --> 46:56.640
 It would be silly to broad brush the Russians like it would be silly to broad brush anyone,

46:56.640 --> 47:00.960
 millions and millions of people with different opinions amongst them all. But they seem to like

47:00.960 --> 47:05.760
 a strong person at the helm. And listen, there's a giant chunk of Americans who do too

47:06.720 --> 47:13.520
 in their own country. But an American would say, as long as the freedom of choice is given to the

47:13.520 --> 47:18.400
 Russians to decide this and not taken away from them. It's one thing to say he was freely elected,

47:18.400 --> 47:23.200
 but a long time ago, and we've done away with elections since then, is a different story too.

47:23.200 --> 47:28.480
 So my attitude on Vladimir Putin is if that's who the Russian people want and you give them the

47:28.480 --> 47:32.640
 choice, right? If he's only there because they keep electing him, that's a very different story.

47:32.640 --> 47:38.880
 When he stops offering them the option of choosing him or not choosing him, that's when it begins

47:38.880 --> 47:44.720
 to look nefarious to someone born and raised with the mindset and the ideology that is an integral

47:44.720 --> 47:49.680
 part of yours truly and that I can't, you know, you can see gray areas and nuance all you like,

47:49.680 --> 47:54.080
 but it's hard to escape as you wish. And you alluded to this too. It's hard to escape

47:54.080 --> 48:00.720
 what was indoctrinated into your bones in your formative years. It's like exit, you know, your

48:00.720 --> 48:05.440
 bones are growing, right? And you can't go back. I mean, so to me, this is so much a part of who

48:05.440 --> 48:10.880
 I am that I have a hard time jettisoning that and saying, oh, no, Vladimir Putin not being

48:10.880 --> 48:16.880
 elected anymore is just fine. I'm too much of a product of my upbringing to go there. Does that

48:16.880 --> 48:21.120
 make sense? Yeah, absolutely. But of course, there's, like we were saying, there's gray areas,

48:21.120 --> 48:27.600
 which is, I believe I have to think through this, but I think there is a point at which

48:27.600 --> 48:36.000
 Adolf Hitler became the popular choice in Nazi Germany in the 30s. There is a, in the same way,

48:36.000 --> 48:43.440
 from an American perspective, you can start to criticize some in a shallow way, some in a deep

48:43.440 --> 48:49.680
 way, the way that Putin has maintained power is by controlling the press. So limiting one other

48:49.680 --> 48:54.160
 freedom that we Americans value, which is the freedom of the press or freedom of speech,

48:55.040 --> 49:03.360
 that he, it is very possible. Now things are changing now, but for most of his presidency,

49:03.360 --> 49:10.560
 he was the popular choice and sometimes by far. And, you know, I have, I actually don't have

49:10.560 --> 49:16.960
 real family in Russia who don't love Putin. I, the only people who write to me about Putin

49:16.960 --> 49:26.240
 and not liking him are like sort of activists who are young, right? But like, to me, they're

49:26.240 --> 49:30.800
 strangers. I don't know anything about them. The people I do know who have a big family in Russia,

49:32.320 --> 49:36.720
 they love Putin. Do they miss elections?

49:36.720 --> 49:48.960
 Would they want the choice to prove it at the ballot box and, and, or, or are they so in love

49:48.960 --> 49:53.920
 with him that they're, they wouldn't want to take a chance that someone might vote him out?

49:54.480 --> 50:00.960
 No, they don't think of it this way. And they are aware of the incredible bureaucracy and corruption

50:01.520 --> 50:04.880
 that is lurking in the shadows, which is true in Russia.

50:04.880 --> 50:10.480
 Right. Everywhere, everywhere, but like there's something about the Russian, it's the remnants,

50:11.520 --> 50:17.840
 it's corruption is so deeply part of the Russian, so the Soviet system that even the overthrow of

50:17.840 --> 50:25.280
 the Soviet, the, the, the breaking apart of the Soviet Union and Putin coming and reforming a

50:25.280 --> 50:31.920
 lot of the system, it's still deeply in there. And, and they're aware of that. That's part of the,

50:31.920 --> 50:40.080
 like the love for Putin is partially grounded in the fear of what happens when the corrupt take

50:40.080 --> 50:46.400
 over, the greedy take over. And they, they see Putin as the stabilizer, as like a hard

50:47.440 --> 50:52.880
 like force that says, a counter force, a counter force that gets your shit together.

50:52.880 --> 51:00.880
 Like basically from the Western perspective, Putin is, is terrible, but from, from the Russian

51:00.880 --> 51:07.280
 perspective, Putin is the only thing holding this thing together before it goes, if it collapses.

51:07.280 --> 51:12.880
 Now the, from the, like Gary Kasparov has been loud on this, you know, a lot of people from the

51:12.880 --> 51:18.320
 Western perspective say, well, if it has to collapse, let it collapse, you know, that's easier

51:18.320 --> 51:22.720
 said than done when you don't have to live through that. Exactly. And so anyone worrying about their

51:22.720 --> 51:30.560
 family about, and they also remember the, the inflation and the economic instability and the

51:30.560 --> 51:34.960
 suffering and the starvation that happened in the nineties with the collapse of the Soviet Union.

51:34.960 --> 51:40.320
 And they saw the kind of reform and the economic vibrancy that happened when Putin took power,

51:40.320 --> 51:47.840
 that they think like this guy's holding it together. And they see elections as potentially

51:49.280 --> 51:55.680
 being mechanisms by which the corrupt people can manipulate the system unfairly as opposed to

51:55.680 --> 52:02.960
 letting the people speak with their voice. They somehow figure out a way to manipulate the elections

52:02.960 --> 52:10.400
 to elect somebody like one of them Western revolutionaries. And so I think one of the

52:10.400 --> 52:18.240
 beliefs that's important to the American system is the belief in the electoral system that the

52:18.240 --> 52:23.360
 voice of the people can be heard in the various systems of government, whether it's judicial,

52:23.360 --> 52:32.080
 whether it's, I mean, basically the assumption is that the system works well enough for you to be

52:32.080 --> 52:39.680
 able to elect the popular choice. Okay. So there's a couple of things that come to mind on that.

52:40.800 --> 52:47.200
 The first one has to do with the idea of oligarchs. There's a belief in political science,

52:47.200 --> 52:53.440
 you know, it's not the overall belief, but that every society is sort of an oligarchy really

52:53.440 --> 52:58.400
 if you break it down, right? So what you're talking about are some of the people who would form

52:59.200 --> 53:07.600
 an oligarchic class in Russia and that Putin is the guy who can harness the power of the state

53:07.600 --> 53:13.360
 to keep those people in check. The problem, of course, in a system like that, a strongman system,

53:13.360 --> 53:18.880
 right, where you have somebody who can hold the reins and steer the ship when the ship is violently

53:18.880 --> 53:26.960
 in a storm is the succession. So if you're not creating a system that can operate without you,

53:27.520 --> 53:34.400
 then that terrible instability and that terrible future that you justify the strongman for

53:35.120 --> 53:41.360
 is just awaiting your future, right? I mean, unless he's actively building the system that

53:41.360 --> 53:48.080
 will outlive him and allow successors to do what he's doing, then what you've done here is create

53:48.080 --> 53:52.720
 a temporary, I would think, a temporary stability here because it's the same problem you have in

53:52.720 --> 53:57.920
 a monarchy, right? Where you have this one king and he's particularly good or you think he's

53:57.920 --> 54:02.720
 particularly good, but he's going to turn that job over to somebody else down the road and the

54:02.720 --> 54:09.200
 system doesn't guarantee because no one's really worked on it. And again, you would tell me if

54:09.200 --> 54:13.840
 Putin is putting into place, I know he's talked about it over the years, putting into place a

54:13.840 --> 54:19.520
 system that can outlive him and that will create the stability that the people in Russia like him

54:19.520 --> 54:25.440
 for when he's gone. Because if the oligarchs just take over afterwards, then one might argue,

54:25.440 --> 54:31.040
 well, we had 20 good years of stability. But I mean, I would say that if we're talking about a

54:31.040 --> 54:35.280
 ship of state here, the guy steering the ship maybe, if you want to look at it from the Russian

54:35.280 --> 54:39.840
 point of view, has done a great job maybe, just saying. But the rocks are still out there and

54:39.840 --> 54:45.040
 he's not going to be at the helm forever. So one would think that his job is to make sure that

54:45.600 --> 54:50.320
 there's going to be someone who can continue to steer the ship for the people of Russia after

54:50.320 --> 54:57.840
 he's gone. Now, let me ask, because I'm curious, and ignorant. So is he doing that, do you think?

54:58.720 --> 55:03.120
 Is he setting it up so that when there is no Putin, the state is safe?

55:03.120 --> 55:09.920
 From the beginning, that was the idea, whether one of the fascinating things, now I read every

55:09.920 --> 55:16.720
 biography, English written biography on Putin. So I need to think more deeply. But one of the

55:16.720 --> 55:22.800
 fascinating things is how did power change Vladimir Putin? He was a different man when he took power

55:22.800 --> 55:31.200
 than he is today. I actually, in many ways, admire the man that took power, I think is very different

55:31.200 --> 55:38.160
 than Stalin and then Hitler at the moment they took power. I think Hitler and Stalin were both

55:38.960 --> 55:46.240
 in our previous discussion already on the trajectory of evil. I think Putin was a humble,

55:47.120 --> 55:54.400
 loyal, honest man when he took power. The man he is today is worth thinking about and studying.

55:54.400 --> 55:59.680
 I'm not sure. That's an old line, though, about absolute power corrupting absolutely.

55:59.680 --> 56:06.960
 But it's kind of a line. It's a beautiful quote, but you have to really think about it.

56:08.400 --> 56:14.640
 What does that actually mean? One of the things I still have to do, I've been focusing on securing

56:14.640 --> 56:20.000
 the conversation. I haven't gone through a dark place yet because I feel like I can't do the

56:20.000 --> 56:26.800
 dark thing for too long. So I really have to put myself in the mind of Putin leading up to the

56:26.800 --> 56:36.400
 conversation. But for now, my sense is he took power when Yeltsin gave him one of the big acts

56:36.400 --> 56:44.960
 of the new Russia was for the first time in his history, a leader could have continued being in

56:44.960 --> 56:50.640
 power and chose to give away power. That was the George Washington. Right. We in the United States

56:50.640 --> 56:55.520
 would look at that as absolute positive. Yeah. A sign of good things. Yes. And so that was a huge

56:55.520 --> 57:03.520
 act. And Putin said that that was the defining thing that will define Russia for the 21st century,

57:03.520 --> 57:12.000
 that act, and he will carry that flag forward. That's why in rhetoric, after two terms,

57:12.000 --> 57:17.760
 he gave away power. To Medvedev. Yeah. But it was a puppet, right? Yeah. Yes. But it was,

57:17.760 --> 57:27.280
 but still the story was being told. I think he believed it early on. I believe he still believes

57:27.280 --> 57:34.000
 it, but I think he's deeply suspicious of the corruption that lurks in the shadows. And I do

57:34.000 --> 57:39.360
 believe that as somebody who thinks clickbait journalism is broken, journalists annoy the

57:39.360 --> 57:43.520
 hell out of me. Clickbait journalism is working perfectly. Journalism is broken.

57:43.520 --> 57:52.320
 Clickbait things work great. So I understand from Putin's perspective that journalists can

57:52.320 --> 57:57.760
 be seen as the enemy of the state because people think journalists write these deep,

57:57.760 --> 58:03.840
 beautiful philosophical pieces about criticizing the structure of government and the proper policy

58:03.840 --> 58:10.080
 with the steps that we need to take to make a greater nation. No, they unfairly take stuff out

58:10.080 --> 58:18.880
 of context. They're critical in ways that's shallow and not interesting. They call you a racist or

58:18.880 --> 58:25.280
 sexist or they make up stuff all the time. So I can put myself in the mindset of a person

58:25.280 --> 58:34.080
 that thinks that it is okay to remove that kind of shallow fake news voice from the system. The

58:34.080 --> 58:40.160
 problem is, of course, that is a slippery slope to then you remove all the annoying people from

58:40.160 --> 58:45.360
 the system and then you change what annoying means, which annoying starts becoming a thing that

58:45.360 --> 58:54.720
 like anyone who opposes the system. I mean, I get the... It's obvious that it becomes a slippery

58:54.720 --> 59:00.080
 slope, but I can also put myself in the mindset of the people that see it's okay to remove the

59:00.080 --> 59:06.320
 liars from the system as long as it's good for Russia. Okay. So herein lies, and this again,

59:06.320 --> 59:11.120
 the traditional American perspective because we've had yellow so called yellow journalism

59:11.120 --> 59:16.960
 since the founding of the Republic. That's nothing new. But the problem then comes into play. When

59:16.960 --> 59:23.840
 you remove journalists, even... It's a broad brush thing because you remove both the crappy ones who

59:23.840 --> 59:29.600
 are lying and the ones who are telling the truth too. You're left with simply the approved

59:29.600 --> 59:35.680
 government journalists, the ones who are towing the government's line, in which case the truth,

59:35.680 --> 59:41.280
 as you see it, is a different kind of fake news. It's the fake news from the government

59:41.280 --> 59:47.040
 instead of the clickbait news and, oh yeah, maybe truth mixed into all that too in some of the

59:47.040 --> 59:51.360
 outlets. The problem I always have with our system here in the United States right now is

59:51.360 --> 59:58.560
 trying to tease the truth out from all the falsehoods. And look, I've got 30 years in journalism.

59:58.560 --> 1:00:03.040
 My job used to be to go through before the internet all the newspapers and find the...

1:00:03.040 --> 1:00:09.360
 I used to know all the journalists by name and I could pick out who they were and I have a hard

1:00:09.360 --> 1:00:15.200
 time picking out the truth from the falsehood. So I think constantly, how are people who don't have

1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:19.920
 all this background, who have lives or who are trained in other specialties, how do they do it?

1:00:20.480 --> 1:00:26.880
 But if the government is the only approved outlet for truth, a traditional American and a lot of

1:00:26.880 --> 1:00:31.120
 other traditional societies based on these ideas of the Enlightenment that I talked about earlier

1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:35.840
 would see that as a disaster waiting to happen or a tyranny in progress. Does that make sense?

1:00:35.840 --> 1:00:42.000
 It totally makes sense. And I would agree with you. I still agree with you. But it is clear that

1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:48.080
 something about the freedom of the press and freedom of speech in today, like literally the

1:00:48.080 --> 1:00:55.360
 last few years with the internet is changing. And the argument, you could say that the American

1:00:55.360 --> 1:01:05.120
 system of freedom of speech is broken. Because here's the belief I grew up on. And I still hold,

1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:11.840
 but I'm starting to be sort of trying to see multiple views on it. My belief was that freedom

1:01:11.840 --> 1:01:19.760
 of speech results in a stable trajectory towards truth always. So like truth will emerge. That

1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:24.640
 was my sort of faith and belief that, yeah, there's going to be lies all over the place,

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:30.880
 but there'll be like a stable thing that is true that's carried forward to the public.

1:01:31.680 --> 1:01:40.400
 Now it feels like it's possible to go towards a world where nothing is true, where truth is

1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:47.360
 something that groups of people convince themselves of and there's multiple groups of people.

1:01:47.360 --> 1:01:54.320
 And the idea of some universal truth as opposed to the butter thing is something that we can no

1:01:54.320 --> 1:02:01.760
 longer exist under. Like some people believe that the Green Bay Packers is the best football team

1:02:01.760 --> 1:02:08.160
 and some people can think the Patriots and they deeply believe it to where they call the other

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:14.240
 groups liars. Now that's fun for sports, that's fun for favorite flavors of ice cream, but they

1:02:14.240 --> 1:02:24.240
 might believe that about science, about the various aspects of politics, various aspects

1:02:24.240 --> 1:02:32.160
 of sort of different policies within the function of our government. And that's not just like some

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:36.080
 weird thing we complain about, but that'll be the nature of things. Like truth is something we

1:02:36.080 --> 1:02:42.640
 can no longer have. Well, let's, and let me de romanticize the American history of this too,

1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:51.040
 because the American press was often just as biased. I mean, I always looked to the 1970s

1:02:51.040 --> 1:02:57.680
 as the high watermark of the American journalistic, I mean, the post Watergate era, where it was

1:02:57.680 --> 1:03:03.840
 actively going after the abuses of the government and all these things. But there was a famous

1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:09.120
 speech, very quiet though, very quiet, given by Catherine Graham, who was a Washington Post

1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:14.400
 editor, I believe. And I actually, somebody sent it to me, we had to get it off of a journalism,

1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:22.560
 like a J store kind of thing. And she had a at a luncheon assured that the government people

1:03:22.560 --> 1:03:27.680
 at the luncheon, don't worry, this is not going to be something that we make a trend. Because

1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:35.680
 the position of the government is still something that was carried on the newspapers were the water

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:40.400
 and the newspapers were the big thing up until certainly the late 60s, early 70s. The newspapers

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:45.280
 were still the water carrier of the government, right? And they were the water carriers of the

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:50.560
 owners of the newspaper. So let's not pretend there was some angelic, wonderful time. And

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:54.320
 I'm saying to me, because I was the one who brought it up, let's not pretend there was any

1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:00.240
 super age of truthful journalism and all that. And I mean, you go to the revolutionary period

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:05.120
 in American history, and it looks every bit as bad as today, right? That's a hopeful message

1:04:05.120 --> 1:04:10.400
 actually. So things may not be as bad as they look. Well, let's look at it more like a stock market

1:04:10.400 --> 1:04:15.840
 and that you have fluctuations in the truthfulness or believability of the press. And there are

1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:21.440
 periods where it was higher than other periods. The funny thing about the so called clickbait era,

1:04:21.440 --> 1:04:28.080
 and I do think it's terrible. But I mean, it resembles earlier eras to me. So I always compare

1:04:28.080 --> 1:04:33.200
 it to when I was a kid growing up, when I thought journalism was as good as it's ever gotten, it

1:04:33.200 --> 1:04:40.080
 was never perfect. But it's also something that you see very rarely in other governments around

1:04:40.080 --> 1:04:45.600
 the world. And there's a reason that journalists are often killed regularly in a lot of countries.

1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:49.760
 And it's because they report on things that the authorities do not want reported on. And I've

1:04:49.760 --> 1:04:55.040
 always thought that that was what journalism should do. But it's got to be truthful. Otherwise,

1:04:55.040 --> 1:05:01.440
 it's just a different kind of propaganda, right? Can we talk about Genghis Khan? Genghis Khan?

1:05:01.440 --> 1:05:05.520
 Sure. Sure. By the way, is it Genghis Khan or Genghis Khan?

1:05:05.520 --> 1:05:08.240
 It's not Genghis Khan. It's either Genghis Khan or Genghis Khan.

1:05:08.960 --> 1:05:14.400
 So let's go with Genghis Khan. The only thing I'll be able to say with any certain last certain

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:20.720
 thing I'll say about it. It's like, I don't know, GIF versus GIF. I don't know if you know about

1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:25.360
 those things. I don't know how it ever got started the wrong way. Yeah. So first of all,

1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:32.160
 your episodes on Genghis Khan for many people are the favorite. It's fascinating to think about

1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:40.320
 events that had so much like inner ripples had so much impact on so much of human civilization.

1:05:40.320 --> 1:05:50.320
 In your view, was he an evil man? Let's go start discussion of evil. Another way to put it is I've

1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:58.320
 read, he's much loved in many parts of the world like Mongolia. And I've also read arguments

1:05:58.320 --> 1:06:05.040
 that say that he was quite a progressive for the time. So where do you put him? Is he a progressive

1:06:05.040 --> 1:06:10.880
 or is he an evil destroyer of humans? As I often say, I'm not a historian, which is why

1:06:11.520 --> 1:06:18.800
 what I try to bring to the hardcore history podcasts are these sub themes. So each show has

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:22.720
 and they're not, I try to kind of soft peddle them. So they're not always like really right in

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:29.440
 front of your face. In that episode, the soft peddling sub theme had to do with what we

1:06:29.440 --> 1:06:36.080
 referred to as a historical arsonist. And it's because some historians have taken the position

1:06:36.080 --> 1:06:40.320
 that sometimes, and most of this is earlier stuff, historians don't do this very much anymore,

1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:45.520
 but these were the wonderful questions I grew up with that blend. It's almost the intersection

1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:52.640
 between history and philosophy. And the idea was that sometimes the world has become so

1:06:53.280 --> 1:07:00.640
 overwhelmed with bureaucracy or corruption or just stagnation, that somebody has to come in

1:07:00.640 --> 1:07:06.080
 or some group of people or some force has to come in and do the equivalent of a forest fire

1:07:06.080 --> 1:07:12.240
 to clear out all the dead wood so that the forest itself can be rejuvenated and society

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:16.720
 can then move forward. And there's a lot of these periods where the historians of the past

1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:23.280
 will portray these figures who come in and do horrific things as creating an almost service

1:07:23.280 --> 1:07:29.360
 for mankind, right? Creating the foundations for a new world that will be better than the

1:07:29.360 --> 1:07:34.240
 old one. And it's a recurring theme. And so this was the sub theme of the cons podcast,

1:07:34.240 --> 1:07:37.680
 because otherwise you don't need me to tell you the story of the Mongols, but I'm going to bring

1:07:37.680 --> 1:07:44.160
 up the historical arsonist element. But this gets to how the Khan has been portrayed, right?

1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:47.920
 If you want to say, oh, yes, he cleared out the dead wood and made for it, well,

1:07:47.920 --> 1:07:52.720
 then it's a positive thing. If you say, my family was in the forest fire that he set,

1:07:52.720 --> 1:07:59.200
 you're not going to see it that way. Much of what Genghis Khan is credited with on the upside,

1:07:59.200 --> 1:08:07.440
 right? So things like religious toleration. And you'll say, well, the Mongols were religiously

1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:12.080
 tolerant. And so this makes them almost like a liberal reformer kind of thing. But this needs

1:08:12.080 --> 1:08:18.480
 to be seen within the context of their empire, which was very much like the Roman viewpoint,

1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:22.560
 which is the Romans didn't care at a lot of times what your local people worshipped.

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:27.520
 They wanted stability. And if that kept stability and kept you paying taxes and didn't require the

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:32.800
 legionaries to come in and then they didn't care, right? And the Khans were the same way,

1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:36.720
 like they don't care what you're practicing, as long as it doesn't disrupt their empire and cause

1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:41.600
 them trouble. But what I always like to point out is, yes, but the Khan could still come in with his

1:08:41.600 --> 1:08:45.920
 representatives to your town, decide your daughter was a beautiful woman that they wanted in the

1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:53.280
 Khan's concubine, and they would take them. So how liberal an empire is this, right? So many of

1:08:53.280 --> 1:08:58.240
 the things that they get credit for as though there's some kind of nice guys may in another way of

1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:04.560
 looking at it just be a simple mechanism of control, right? A way to keep the empire stable.

1:09:04.560 --> 1:09:09.040
 They're not doing it out of the goodness of their heart. They have decided that this is the best.

1:09:09.040 --> 1:09:16.080
 And I love because the Mongols were what we would call a pagan people. Now, I love the fact that

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:20.560
 I think we call it, I forgot the term we used it had to do with like, like they were hedging

1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:25.760
 their bets religiously, right? They didn't know which God was the right one. So as long as you're

1:09:25.760 --> 1:09:30.320
 all praying for the health of the Khan, we're maximizing the chances that whoever the gods are,

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:36.080
 they get the message, right? So I think it's been portrayed as something like a liberal empire.

1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:44.000
 The idea of Mongol universality, universality is more about conquering the world. And it's like

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:47.040
 saying, you know, we're going to bring stability to the world by conquering it. Well, what if that's

1:09:47.040 --> 1:09:51.920
 Hitler, right? He could make the same case or Hitler wasn't really the world conqueror like

1:09:51.920 --> 1:09:55.440
 that because he wouldn't have been, he wouldn't have been trying to make it equal for all peoples.

1:09:55.440 --> 1:10:02.640
 But my point being that it kind of takes the positive moral slant out of it if their motivation

1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:10.240
 wasn't a positive moral slant to the motivate. And the Mongols didn't see it that way. And I think

1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:16.800
 the way that it's portrayed is like, and I always like to use this analogy, but it's like shooting

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:22.960
 an arrow and painting a bullseye around it afterwards, right? How do we justify and make

1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:28.320
 them look good in a way that they themselves probably, and listen, we don't have the Mongol

1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:31.920
 point of view per se. I mean, there's something called the secret history of the Mongols. And

1:10:31.920 --> 1:10:38.000
 there's things written down by Mongolian overlords through people like Persian and Chinese scribes

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:44.080
 later. We don't have their point of view. But it sure doesn't look like this was an attempt to

1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:48.480
 create some wonderful place where everybody was living a better life than they were before.

1:10:48.480 --> 1:10:53.360
 I think that's later people putting a nice rosy spin on it.

1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:59.120
 So, but there's an aspect to it. Maybe you can correct me, because I'm projecting sort of my

1:10:59.120 --> 1:11:10.720
 idea of what it would take to conquer so much land is the ideology is emergent. So if I were to guess,

1:11:10.720 --> 1:11:21.600
 the Mongols started out as exceptionally as warriors who valued excellence in skill of

1:11:21.600 --> 1:11:27.840
 killing, not even killing, but like the actual practice of war, and you can start out small,

1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:32.640
 and you can grow and grow and grow. And then in order to maintain the stability of the things

1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:39.440
 over which of the conquered lands, you developed a set of ideas with which you can,

1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:45.280
 like you said, establish control. But it was emergent. And it seems like the core

1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:54.640
 first principle idea of the Mongols is just to be excellent warriors. That felt to me like the

1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:02.400
 starting point. It wasn't some ideology. Like with Hitler and Stalin, with Hitler, there was an

1:12:02.400 --> 1:12:08.320
 ideology that didn't have anything to do with war underneath it. It was more about conquering. It

1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:15.600
 feels like the Mongols started out more organically, I would say it's like this phenomenon started

1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:20.160
 emergently. And they were just like similar to the Native Americans with the Comanches,

1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:27.520
 like the different warrior tribes that Joe Rogan's currently obsessed with that led me to look into

1:12:27.520 --> 1:12:34.320
 it more. They seem to just start out just valuing the skill of fighting, whatever the tools of war

1:12:34.320 --> 1:12:39.200
 they had, which were pretty primitive, but just to be the best warriors that could possibly make

1:12:39.200 --> 1:12:44.960
 a science out of it. Is that crazy to think that there was no ideology behind it in the beginning?

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:50.240
 I'm going to back up a second. I'm reminded of the line said about the Romans that they create

1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:58.800
 a wasteland and call it peace. But there's a lot of conquerors like that, right? Where you will sit

1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:04.560
 there and listen, historians forever have, it's the famous tradeoffs of empire. And they'll say,

1:13:04.560 --> 1:13:09.280
 well, look at the trade that they facilitated and look at the religion, all those kinds of things,

1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:17.280
 but they come at the cost of all those peoples that they conquered forcibly and by force integrated

1:13:17.280 --> 1:13:21.440
 into their empire. The one thing we need to remember about the Mongols that makes them different

1:13:21.440 --> 1:13:26.720
 than, say, the Romans. And this is complex stuff and way above my pay grade, but I'm fascinated

1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:31.680
 with it. And it's more like the Comanches that you just brought up, is that the Mongols are not a

1:13:31.680 --> 1:13:38.320
 settled society. They come from a nomadic tradition. Now, several generations later,

1:13:39.200 --> 1:13:46.560
 when you have Kublai Khan as the emperor of China, it's beginning to be a different thing, right?

1:13:46.560 --> 1:13:51.680
 And the Mongols, when their empire broke up, the ones that were in the so called settled

1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:57.280
 societies, right? Iran, places like that, they will become more like over time, the rulers of

1:13:57.280 --> 1:14:03.520
 those places were traditionally. And the Mongols and, say, like the Cognate of the Golden Horde,

1:14:03.520 --> 1:14:08.560
 which is still in their traditional nomadic territories, will remain traditionally more

1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:15.600
 Mongol. But when you start talking about who the Mongols were, I try to make a distinction. They're

1:14:15.600 --> 1:14:24.640
 not some really super special people. They're just the latest confederacy in an area that saw

1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:32.560
 nomadic confederacies going back to the beginning of recorded history, the Skithians, the Sarmatians,

1:14:32.560 --> 1:14:39.200
 the Avars, the Huns, the Magyars. I mean, these are all the nomadic. The nomads of the Eurasian

1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:45.760
 steppe were huge, huge players in the history of the world until gunpowder nullified their

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:51.680
 traditional weapon system, which I've been fascinated with because their traditional

1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:56.240
 weapon system is not one you could copy. Because you were talking about being the greatest warriors,

1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:04.720
 you could be every warrior society I've ever seen values that. What the nomads had of the Eurasian

1:15:04.720 --> 1:15:12.640
 steppe was this relationship between human beings and animals that changed the equation.

1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:19.840
 It was how they rode horses. Societies like the Byzantines, which would form one flank of the

1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:24.240
 steppe and then all the way on the other side, you had China and below that you had Persia,

1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:31.040
 these societies would all attempt to create mounted horsemen who used archery. They did a

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:36.720
 good job, but they were never the equals of the nomads because those people were literally

1:15:36.720 --> 1:15:42.800
 raised in the saddle. They compared them to centaurs. The Comanches, great example,

1:15:42.800 --> 1:15:49.840
 considered to be the best horse riding warriors in North America. The Comanches, I always loved

1:15:49.840 --> 1:15:56.000
 watching, there's paintings, George Catlin, the famous painter who painted the Comanches,

1:15:56.000 --> 1:16:01.760
 illustrated it, but the Mongols and the Scythians and Scythians and the Avars and all these people

1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:08.560
 did it too, where they would shoot from underneath the horse's neck, hiding behind the horse the whole

1:16:08.560 --> 1:16:15.120
 way. You look at a picture of somebody doing that and it's insane. This is what the Byzantines

1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:22.800
 couldn't do and the Chinese couldn't do. It was a different level of harnessing a human animal

1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:29.680
 relationship that gave them a military advantage that could not be copied. It could be emulated,

1:16:29.680 --> 1:16:34.640
 but they were never as good. That's why they always hired these people. They hired mercenaries

1:16:34.640 --> 1:16:40.160
 from these areas because they were incomparable. It's the combination of people who were shooting

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:44.960
 bows and arrows from the time they were toddlers, who were riding from the time they were trying,

1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:50.720
 who rode all the time. The Huns were bow legged, the Romans said, because they were never,

1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:56.880
 they ate, slept, everything in the saddle. That creates something that is difficult to copy.

1:17:00.400 --> 1:17:07.120
 I enjoy reading actually about when that military advantage ended, so 17th and 18th century,

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:12.080
 when the Chinese on one flank and the Russians on the other are beginning to use firearms and

1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:19.760
 stuff to break this military power of these various cons. The Mongols were simply the most

1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:24.400
 dominating and most successful of the Confederacies, but if you break it down,

1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:30.960
 they really formed the nucleus at the top of the pyramid of the apex of the food chain. A lot of

1:17:30.960 --> 1:17:36.960
 the people that were known as Mongols were really lots of other tribes, non Mongolian tribes,

1:17:36.960 --> 1:17:41.760
 that when the Mongols conquered you after they killed a lot of you, they incorporated you into

1:17:41.760 --> 1:17:46.400
 their Confederacy and often made you go first. You're going to fight somebody. We're going to

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:51.360
 make these people go out in front and suck up all the arrows before we go in and finish the job.

1:17:51.360 --> 1:17:56.560
 So to me, and I guess a fan of the Mongols would say that the difference

1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:01.680
 and what made the Mongols different wasn't the weapon system or the fighting or the warriors

1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:07.280
 or the armor or anything, it was Genghis Khan. And if you go look at the other really dangerous,

1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:12.480
 from the outside world's perspective, dangerous step, nomadic Confederacies from past history,

1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:17.920
 was always when some great leader emerged that could unite the tribes. And you see the same

1:18:17.920 --> 1:18:24.960
 thing in Native American history to a degree too. You had people like Attila, right? Or there's one

1:18:24.960 --> 1:18:30.400
 called Tumen. You go back in history and these people make the history books because they caused

1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:35.600
 an enormous amount of trouble for their settled neighbors that normally, I mean Chinese Byzantine

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:41.120
 and Persian approaches to the step people were always the same. They would pick out tribes to

1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:45.520
 be friendly with, they would give them money, gifts, hire them, and they would use them against

1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:50.720
 the other tribes. And generally, Byzantine, especially in Chinese diplomatic history,

1:18:50.720 --> 1:18:56.400
 was all about keeping these tribes separated. Don't let them form confederations of large

1:18:56.400 --> 1:19:01.920
 numbers of them because then they're unstoppable. Attila was a perfect example. The Huns were

1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:06.000
 another large, the Turks, another large Confederacy of these people and they were

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:10.480
 devastating when they could unite. So the diplomatic policy was don't let them.

1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:15.040
 That's what made the Mongols different is Genghis Khan united them and then unlike most of the

1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:18.880
 tribal Confederacies, he was able, they were able to hold it together for a few generations.

1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:27.440
 To linger on the little thread that you started pulling on this man, Genghis Khan,

1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:33.040
 that was a leader. Temujin, yeah. What do you think makes a great leader? Maybe if you have

1:19:33.040 --> 1:19:41.360
 other examples throughout history and great, again, let's use that term loosely. Now I was

1:19:41.360 --> 1:19:47.600
 going to ask for a definition. Great uniter of whether it's evil or good, it doesn't matter.

1:19:49.680 --> 1:19:54.560
 Is there somebody who stands out to you, Alexander the Great, talking about military

1:19:55.440 --> 1:20:02.400
 or ideologies? Some people bring up FDR or, I mean, it could be the founding fathers of this

1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:12.560
 country or we can go to, was he a man of the century, up there, Hitler of the 20th century,

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:20.080
 then Stalin and these people had really amassed the amount of power that probably has never

1:20:20.080 --> 1:20:23.760
 been seen in the history of the world. Is there somebody who stands out to you

1:20:24.560 --> 1:20:30.480
 by way of trying to define what makes a great uniter, great leader in one man

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:35.760
 and or a woman maybe in the future? It's an interesting question and I want to

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:38.960
 have thought a lot about, because let's take Alexander the Great as an example,

1:20:38.960 --> 1:20:43.520
 because Alexander fascinated the world of his time, fascinated ever since people have been

1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:52.000
 fascinated with the guy. But Alexander was a hereditary monarch. He was handed the kingdom.

1:20:53.040 --> 1:20:59.360
 But he did not need to rise from nothing to get that job. In fact, he reminds me of a lot

1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:06.000
 of other leaders of Frederick the Great, for example, in Prussia. These are people who inherited

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:12.560
 the greatest army of their day. Alexander, unless he was an imbecile, was going to be

1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:18.240
 great no matter what, because if you inherit the Wehrmacht, you're going to be able to do

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:25.680
 something with it. Alexander's father may have been greater, Philip. Philip II was the guy who

1:21:25.680 --> 1:21:33.760
 literally did create a strong kingdom from a disjointed group of people that were continually

1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:39.280
 beset by their neighbors. He's the one that reformed that army, took things that he had learned

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:48.320
 from other Greek leaders like the Theban leader of Pemynondas, and then laboriously over his lifetime

1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:54.800
 stabilized the frontiers, built this system. He lost an eye doing it. His leg was made lame.

1:21:54.800 --> 1:22:00.320
 I mean, this was a man who looked like he built the empire and led from the front ranks.

1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:06.000
 And then, who may have been killed by his son, we don't know who assassinated Philip,

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:10.160
 but then handed the greatest army the world had ever seen to his son,

1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:14.400
 who then did great things with it. You see this pattern many times. In my mind,

1:22:16.080 --> 1:22:21.760
 I'm not sure Alexander really can be that great when you compare him to people who arose from

1:22:21.760 --> 1:22:27.040
 nothing. So the difference between what we would call in the United States the self made man or

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:33.280
 the one who inherits a fortune. There's an old line that it's a slur, but it's about rich people.

1:22:35.280 --> 1:22:42.080
 He was born on third base and thought he hit a triple, right? Philip was born at home plate,

1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:48.000
 and Alexander started on third base. And so I try to draw a distinction between them.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:53.600
 Genghis Khan is tough because there's two traditions. The tradition that we grew up with here in the

1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:59.120
 United States and that I grew up learning was that he was a self made man. But there is a tradition,

1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:04.320
 and it may be one of those things that's put after the fact because a long time ago, whether or

1:23:04.320 --> 1:23:09.600
 not you had blue blood in your veins was an important distinction. And so the distinction

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:15.600
 that you'll often hear from Mongolian history is that this was a nobleman who had been deprived

1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:20.800
 of his inheritance. So he was a blue blood anyway. I don't know which is true. There's

1:23:20.800 --> 1:23:25.520
 certainly, I mean, when you look at a Genghis Khan, though, you have to go, that is a wicked

1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:31.280
 amount of things to have achieved. He's very impressive as a figure. Attila is very impressive

1:23:31.280 --> 1:23:36.880
 as a figure. Hitler's an interesting figure. He's one of those people because, you know,

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:43.360
 the more you study about Hitler, the more you wonder where the defining moment was. Because

1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:51.040
 if you look at his life, I mean, Hitler was a relatively common soldier in the First World War.

1:23:51.040 --> 1:23:56.000
 I mean, he was brave. He got some decorations. In fact, the highest decoration he got in the

1:23:56.000 --> 1:24:02.240
 First World War was given to him by a Jewish officer. And he often didn't talk about that

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:06.080
 decoration even though it was the more prestigious one because it would open up a whole can of worms

1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:12.000
 you didn't want to get into. But if you said who was Hitler today, one of the top things you're

1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:16.320
 going to say is he was an antisemite. Well, then you have to draw a distinction between

1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:22.640
 general regular antisemitism that was pretty common in the era and something that was a

1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:28.880
 rabid level of antisemitism. But Hitler didn't seem to show a rabid level of antisemitism until

1:24:28.880 --> 1:24:33.760
 after or at the very end of the First World War. So if this is a defining part of this person's

1:24:33.760 --> 1:24:41.280
 character and much of what we consider to be his evil stems from that, what happened to this guy

1:24:41.280 --> 1:24:46.400
 when he's an adult, right? He's already fought in the war to change him. So I mean, it's almost

1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:50.560
 like the old, there was always a movie theme, somebody gets hit by by something on the head

1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:55.200
 and their whole personality changes, right? I mean, it almost seems something like that.

1:24:55.200 --> 1:24:59.520
 So I don't think I call that necessarily a great leader. To me, the interesting thing

1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:05.680
 about Hitler is what the hell happened to a non descript person who didn't really impress anybody

1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:11.600
 with his skills. And then in the 1920s, it's all of a sudden, as you said, sort of the man of the

1:25:11.600 --> 1:25:16.640
 hour, right? So that to me is kind of fast. I have this feeling that Genghis Khan, and we don't

1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:21.840
 really know, was an impressive human being from the get go. And then he was raised in this environment

1:25:21.840 --> 1:25:26.400
 with pressure on all sides. You start with this diamond, and then you polish it and you harden

1:25:26.400 --> 1:25:32.160
 it his whole life. Hitler seems to be a very unimpressive gemstone most of his life. And then

1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:38.000
 all of a sudden, so I mean, I don't think I can label great leaders. And I'm always fascinated

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:42.560
 by that idea that, and I'm trying to remember who the quote was by that, that great men, oh,

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:49.520
 Lord Acton, so great men are often not good men. And that in order to be great, you would have to

1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:55.200
 jettison many of the moral qualities that we normally would consider a Jesus or a Gandhi or

1:25:55.200 --> 1:26:00.960
 you know, Martin Luther, these qualities that one looks at as the good, upstanding moral qualities

1:26:00.960 --> 1:26:06.000
 that we should all aspire to as examples, right, the Buddha, whatever it might be. Those people

1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:09.600
 wouldn't make good leaders because what you need to be a good leader often requires the kind of

1:26:09.600 --> 1:26:16.320
 choices that a true philosophical, diogenes, moral man wouldn't make. So I don't have an

1:26:16.320 --> 1:26:19.200
 answer to your question. How about that? That's a very long way of saying, I don't know.

1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:26.720
 Just linger a little bit. It does feel like from my study of Hitler that the time molded the man

1:26:26.720 --> 1:26:33.280
 versus Genghis Khan where it feels like he, the man molded his time.

1:26:33.280 --> 1:26:38.480
 Yes. And I feel that way about a lot of those nomadic Confederacy builders, that they really

1:26:38.480 --> 1:26:45.040
 seem to be these figures that stand out as extraordinary in one way or another.

1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:49.360
 And remembering, by the way, that almost all the history of them were written by the enemies that

1:26:49.360 --> 1:26:53.120
 they so mistreated that they were probably never going to get any good press. They didn't write

1:26:53.120 --> 1:26:57.520
 themselves. That's a caveat we should always have to basically nomadic or Native American

1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:02.160
 peoples or tribal peoples anywhere generally do not get the advantage of being able to

1:27:02.160 --> 1:27:09.840
 write the history of their heroes. Okay. I've recently almost done with the rise in the fall

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:18.960
 of the Third Reich. It's one of the historical descriptions of Hitler's rise to power,

1:27:18.960 --> 1:27:27.520
 Nazis rise to power. There's a few philosophical things I'd like to ask you to see if you can help.

1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:37.920
 Like one of the things I think about is how does one be a hero in 1930s in Nazi Germany?

1:27:37.920 --> 1:27:46.240
 What does it mean to be a hero? What do heroic actions look like? I think about that because

1:27:46.240 --> 1:28:00.080
 I think about how I move about in this world today. That we live in really chaotic and tense times

1:28:01.440 --> 1:28:06.400
 where I don't think you want to draw any parallels between Nazi Germany and modern day

1:28:06.400 --> 1:28:12.240
 in any of the nations we can think about. But it's not out of the realm of possibility that

1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:23.680
 authoritarian governments take hold, authoritarian companies take hold. And I'd like to think that

1:28:23.680 --> 1:28:31.520
 I could be in my little small way and inspire others to take the heroic action before things

1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:41.920
 get bad. And I kind of try to place myself in what would 1930s Germany look like? Is it possible

1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:51.360
 to stop a Hitler? Is it even the right way to think about it? And how does one be a hero in it?

1:28:51.360 --> 1:28:56.640
 I mean, you often talk about that living through a moment in history is very different than looking

1:28:56.640 --> 1:29:03.840
 at that history, looking, you know, when you look back. I also think about it. Would it be possible

1:29:03.840 --> 1:29:14.080
 to understand what's happening that the bells of war are ringing? It seems that most people didn't

1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:22.480
 seem to understand, you know, late into the 30s that war is coming. That's fascinating. On the

1:29:22.480 --> 1:29:29.440
 United States side, inside Germany, like the opposing figures, the German military didn't seem

1:29:29.440 --> 1:29:36.160
 to understand this. Maybe the other country, certainly France and England didn't seem to

1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:43.840
 understand this. I kind of try to put myself into the 1930s Germany as I'm Jewish, which is another

1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:53.360
 little twist on the whole. Like what would I do? What should one do? Do you have interesting answers?

1:29:54.320 --> 1:29:58.800
 So earlier we had talked about Putin and we had talked about patriotism and love of country and

1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:09.520
 those sorts of things. In order to be a hero in Nazi Germany by our views here, you would have had

1:30:09.520 --> 1:30:17.440
 to have been anti patriotic to the average German's viewpoint in the 1930s, right? You would have to

1:30:17.440 --> 1:30:23.600
 have opposed your own government and your own country. And that's a very, it would be a very

1:30:23.600 --> 1:30:28.400
 weird thing to go to people in Germany and say, listen, the only way you're going to be seen as

1:30:28.400 --> 1:30:35.920
 a good German and a hero to the country that will be your enemies is we think you should oppose your

1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:42.240
 own government. It's a strange position to put the people in a government in saying you need to be

1:30:42.240 --> 1:30:46.320
 against your leader. You need to oppose your government's policies. You need to oppose your

1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:51.360
 government. You need to hope and work for its downfall. That doesn't sound patriotic. It wouldn't

1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:58.000
 sound patriotic here in this country if you made a similar argument. I will go away from the

1:30:58.000 --> 1:31:05.200
 1930s and go to the 1940s to answer your questions. There is movements like the White Rose Movement

1:31:05.200 --> 1:31:12.240
 in Germany, which involved young people really and from various backgrounds, religious backgrounds

1:31:12.240 --> 1:31:18.880
 often who worked openly against the Nazi government at a time when power was already

1:31:18.880 --> 1:31:24.720
 consolidated. The Gestapo was in full force and they execute people who are against the government

1:31:24.720 --> 1:31:30.080
 and these young people would go out and distribute pamphlets and many of them got their heads cut

1:31:30.080 --> 1:31:35.280
 off with guillotines for their trouble and they knew that that was going to be the penalty.

1:31:35.840 --> 1:31:43.920
 That is a remarkable amount of bravery and sacrifice and willingness to die and almost not

1:31:43.920 --> 1:31:50.880
 even willingness because they were so open about it. It's almost a certainty. That's incredibly

1:31:50.880 --> 1:31:55.520
 moving to me. When we talked earlier about the human spirit and all that kind of thing,

1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:03.600
 there are people in the German military who opposed and worked against Hitler, for example.

1:32:04.480 --> 1:32:10.080
 But to me, that's almost cowardly compared to what these young people did in the White Rose

1:32:10.080 --> 1:32:15.280
 Movement because those people in the Wehrmacht, for example, who were secretly trying to undermine

1:32:15.280 --> 1:32:24.880
 Hitler, they're not really putting their lives on the line to the same degree. I remember once

1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:30.640
 saying there were no conscientious objectors in Germany as a way to point out to people that

1:32:30.640 --> 1:32:34.880
 you didn't have a choice and you were going to serve and I got letters from Jehovah's Witnesses

1:32:34.880 --> 1:32:41.440
 who said, yes, there were and we got sent to the concentration camps. Those are remarkably brave

1:32:41.440 --> 1:32:49.680
 things. It's one thing to have your own set of standards and values. It's another thing to say,

1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:54.800
 oh no, I'm going to display them in a way that with this regime, that's a death sentence and not

1:32:54.800 --> 1:33:00.720
 just for me, for my family. In these regimes, there was not a lot of distinction made between

1:33:00.720 --> 1:33:07.200
 father and son and wives. That's a remarkable sacrifice to make and far beyond what I think

1:33:07.200 --> 1:33:14.640
 I would even be capable of. The admiration comes from seeing people who appear to be more morally

1:33:14.640 --> 1:33:21.040
 profound than you are yourself. When I look at this, I look at that kind of thing and I just say,

1:33:21.920 --> 1:33:28.800
 wow. The funny thing is if you'd have gone to most average Germans on the street in 1942

1:33:29.440 --> 1:33:33.520
 and said, what do you think of these people? They're going to think of them as traders who

1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:39.040
 probably got what they deserved. That's the eye of the beholder thing. It's the power of the state

1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:47.920
 to sow propagandize values and morality in a way that favors the state that you can turn people

1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:54.160
 who today we look at as unbelievably brave and moral and crusading for righteousness

1:33:54.160 --> 1:34:00.320
 and turn them into enemies of the people. In my mind, it would be people like that.

1:34:00.320 --> 1:34:06.960
 See, I think, so hero is a funny word and we romanticize the notion,

1:34:07.600 --> 1:34:16.400
 but if I could drag you back to 1930s Germany from 1940s, I feel like the heroic actions

1:34:16.400 --> 1:34:24.800
 that doesn't accomplish much is not what I'm referring to. There's many heroes I look up to

1:34:24.800 --> 1:34:32.560
 do that like David Goggins, for example, the guy who runs crazy distances. He runs for no

1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:38.800
 purpose except for the suffering in itself. I think his willingness to challenge the limits

1:34:38.800 --> 1:34:46.800
 of his mind is heroic. I guess I'm looking for a different term, which is how could Hitler have

1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:56.720
 been stopped? My sense is that he could have been stopped in the battle of ideas where millions of

1:34:56.720 --> 1:35:03.200
 people were suffering economically or suffering because of the betrayal of World War I in terms

1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:09.920
 of the love of country and how they felt they were being treated. A charismatic leader that

1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:16.400
 inspired love and unity that's not destructive could have emerged and that's where the battle

1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:24.080
 should have been fought. I would suggest that we need to take into account the context of the

1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:30.480
 times that led to Hitler's rise of power and created the conditions where his message resonated.

1:35:31.200 --> 1:35:39.600
 That is not a message that resonates at all times. It is impossible to understand the rise

1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:43.920
 of Hitler without dealing with the First World War and the aftermath of the First World War

1:35:43.920 --> 1:35:50.160
 and the inflationary terrible depression in Germany and all these things. The dissatisfaction

1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:57.280
 with the Weimar Republic's government, which was often seen as something put into place by the

1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:05.600
 victorious powers, Hitler referred to the people that signed the armistice as the November criminals.

1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:11.680
 He used that as a phrase which resonated with the population. This was a population that was

1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:17.760
 embittered. Even if they weren't embittered, the times were so terrible. The options for

1:36:17.760 --> 1:36:24.720
 operating within the system in a nonradical way seemed totally discredited. You could work

1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:29.120
 through the Weimar Republic, but they tried and it wasn't working anyway. Then the alternative to

1:36:29.120 --> 1:36:34.320
 the Nazis who were bully boys in the street were communist agitators that to the average

1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:39.600
 conservative Germans seemed no better. You have three options if you're an average German person.

1:36:39.600 --> 1:36:45.280
 You can go with the discredited government put in power by your enemies that wasn't working

1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:52.000
 anyway. You could go with the Nazis who seemed like a bunch of super patriots calling for the

1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:57.680
 restoration of German authority or you could go with the communists. The entire thing seemed like

1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:04.240
 a litany of poor options. In this realm, Hitler was able to triangulate, if you will.

1:37:04.240 --> 1:37:10.400
 He came off as a person who was going to restore German greatness at a time when this was a powerful

1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:17.840
 message, but if you don't need German greatness restored, it doesn't resonate. The reason that

1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:23.440
 your love idea and all this stuff I don't think would have worked in the time period is because

1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:28.080
 that was not a commodity that the average German was in search of then.

1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:35.360
 Well, it's interesting to think about whether greatness can be restored through mechanisms,

1:37:35.360 --> 1:37:45.440
 through ideas that are not so, from our perspective today, so evil. I don't know what the right term is.

1:37:45.440 --> 1:37:51.440
 But the war continued in a way. So remember that when Germany, when Hitler is rising to power,

1:37:51.440 --> 1:37:58.000
 the French are in control of parts of Germany. The ruler, one of the main industrial heartlands

1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:02.720
 of Germany, was occupied by the French. So there's never this point where you're allowed to let the

1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:09.280
 hate dissipate. Every time, maybe things were calming down, something else would happen to stick

1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:14.000
 the knife in and twist it a little bit more, from the average German's perspective. The

1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:18.640
 reparations. So if you say, okay, well, we're going to get back on our feet. The reparations were

1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:25.680
 crushing. These things prevented the idea of love or brotherhood and all these things from taking hold.

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:31.680
 And even if there were Germans who felt that way, and there most certainly were, it is hard

1:38:31.680 --> 1:38:38.000
 to overcome the power of everyone else. What I always say when people talk to me about humanity

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:44.880
 is I believe on individual levels, we're capable of everything and anything, good, bad, or indifferent.

1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:51.280
 But collectively, it's different, right? And in the time period that we're talking about here,

1:38:51.280 --> 1:38:57.680
 messages of peace on earth and love your enemies and all these sorts of things were absolutely

1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:03.120
 deluged and overwhelmed and drowned out by the bitterness, the hatred, and let's be honest,

1:39:03.120 --> 1:39:08.720
 the sense that you were continually being abused by your former enemies. There were a lot of people

1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:14.480
 in the Allied side that realized this and said, we're setting up the next war. They understood

1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:19.760
 that you can only do certain things to collective human populations for a certain period of time

1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:24.160
 before it is natural for them to want to. And there are, you can see German posters from the

1:39:24.160 --> 1:39:29.280
 region, Nazi propaganda posters that show them breaking off the chains of their enemies. And I

1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:35.840
 mean, Germany awake, right? That was the great slogan. So I think it's very important that you

1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:44.240
 the great slogan. So I think love is always a difficult option. And in the context of those

1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:52.800
 times, it was even more disempowered than normal. Well, this goes to the just a linger in it for

1:39:52.800 --> 1:40:01.040
 a little longer. The question of the inevitability of history. Do you think Hitler could have been

1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:06.720
 stopped? Do you think this kind of force that you're saying that there was a pain and it was

1:40:06.720 --> 1:40:12.640
 building does a hatred that was building? Do you think there was a way to avert?

1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:22.640
 I mean, there's two questions could have been a lot worse. And could have been better in the

1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:27.520
 trajectory of history in the thirties and forties. The most logical, see, we had started this

1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:32.640
 conversation brings a wonderful bow tie into the discussion and buttons it up nicely. We had talked

1:40:32.640 --> 1:40:38.960
 about force and counter force earlier. The most obvious and much discussed way that Hitler could

1:40:38.960 --> 1:40:45.840
 have been stopped has nothing to do with Germans. When he remilitarized the Rhineland, everyone

1:40:45.840 --> 1:40:51.680
 talks about what a couple of French divisions would have done had they simply gone in and

1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:55.200
 contested. And this was something Hitler was extremely, I mean, it might have been the most

1:40:55.200 --> 1:41:00.960
 nervous time in his entire career because he was afraid that they would have responded with force

1:41:00.960 --> 1:41:06.160
 and he was in no position to do anything about it if they did. So this is where you get the people

1:41:06.160 --> 1:41:12.640
 who say, you know, and Churchill is one of these people too, where they talk about that he should

1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:20.240
 have been stopped militarily right at the very beginning when he was weak. I don't think. Listen,

1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:25.520
 there were candidates in the Catholic center party and others in the Weimar Republic that

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:30.880
 maybe could have done things. And it's beyond my understanding of specific German history to talk

1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:36.880
 about it intelligently. But I do think that had the French responded militarily to Hitler's initial

1:41:36.880 --> 1:41:42.000
 moves into that area that he would have been thwarted. And I think he himself believed,

1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:47.840
 if I'm remembering my reading, that this would have led to his downfall. So the potential,

1:41:47.840 --> 1:41:52.560
 see, what I don't like about this is that it almost legitimizes military intervention

1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:58.160
 at a very early stage to prevent worse things from happening. But it might be a pretty clear cut

1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:03.360
 case. But it shows we pointed out that there was a lot of sympathy on the part of the Allies for

1:42:03.360 --> 1:42:07.680
 the fact that, you know, the Germans probably should have Germany back. And this is traditional

1:42:07.680 --> 1:42:14.240
 German land. I mean, they were trying in a funny way, it's almost like the love and the sense of

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:20.400
 justice on the Allies part may have actually stayed their hand in a way that would have prevented

1:42:20.400 --> 1:42:27.680
 much, much, much worse things later. But if the times were such that the message of a Hitler

1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:33.040
 resonated, then simply removing Hitler from the equation would not have removed the context of the

1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:37.840
 times. And that means one of two things, either you could have had another one,

1:42:37.840 --> 1:42:45.520
 or you could have ended up in a situation equally bad in a different direction. I don't know what

1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:51.040
 that means, because it's hard to imagine anything could be worse than what actually occurred. But

1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:55.760
 history's funny that way. And that Hitler's always everyone's favorite example of the

1:42:55.760 --> 1:43:00.480
 difference between the great man theory of history and the trends and forces theories of history,

1:43:00.480 --> 1:43:07.360
 right? The times made a Hitler possible and maybe even desirable to some. If you took him out of

1:43:07.360 --> 1:43:14.000
 the equation, those trends and forces are still in place, right? So what does that mean? If you

1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:20.880
 take him out and the door is still open, does somebody else walk through it? Yeah, it's mathematically

1:43:20.880 --> 1:43:32.320
 speaking, the probability of charismatic leaders emerge. I'm so torn on that. I'm at this point.

1:43:32.320 --> 1:43:39.360
 Here's another way to look at it. The institutional stability of Germany in that time period was not

1:43:39.360 --> 1:43:45.680
 enough to push back. And there are other periods in German history. I mean, that Hitler arose in

1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:52.480
 arisen in 1913, he doesn't get anywhere. Because Germany's institutional power is enough to simply

1:43:53.120 --> 1:43:59.360
 quash that. It's the fact that Germany was unstable anyway, that prevented a united front

1:43:59.360 --> 1:44:04.160
 that would have kept radicalism from getting out of hand. Does that make sense? Yes, absolutely.

1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:10.320
 A tricky question on this, just to stay in this a little longer, because I'm not sure how to think

1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:22.400
 about it, is the World War II versus the Holocaust. We were talking just now about the way that history

1:44:22.400 --> 1:44:30.160
 unrolls itself and could Hitler have been stopped. And I don't quite know what to think about

1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:39.760
 Hitler without the Holocaust. And perhaps in his thinking how essential the anti Semitism and the

1:44:39.760 --> 1:44:51.200
 hatred of Jews was, it feels to me that, I mean, we were just talking about where did he pick up

1:44:51.200 --> 1:44:59.200
 his hatred of the Jewish people. There's stories in Vienna and so on, that it almost is picking up

1:45:00.800 --> 1:45:09.600
 the idea of anti Semitism as a really useful tool, as opposed to actually believing in his core.

1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:17.040
 Do you think World War II as it turned out, and Hitler as he turned out, would be possible without

1:45:17.040 --> 1:45:23.760
 anti Semitism? Could we have avoided the Holocaust? Or was it an integral part of

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:32.000
 the ideology of fascism and the Nazis? Not an integral part of fascism, because Mussolini really,

1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:38.560
 I mean, Mussolini did it to please Hitler, but it wasn't an integral part. What's interesting to me

1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:43.360
 is that that's the big anomaly in the whole question, because anti Semitism didn't need

1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:51.280
 to be a part of this at all, right? Hitler had a conspiratorial view of the world. He was a believer

1:45:51.280 --> 1:45:57.440
 that the Jews controlled things, right? The Jews were responsible for both Bolshevism on one side

1:45:57.440 --> 1:46:01.520
 and capitalism on the other. They ruled the banks. I mean, the United States was a

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:09.600
 Jewified country, right? Bolshevism was a Jewified sort of a political, in other words,

1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:15.760
 he saw Jews everywhere. And he had that line about if the Jews of Europe force another war to Germany,

1:46:15.760 --> 1:46:20.240
 they'll pay the price or whatever. But then you have to believe that they're capable of that.

1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:25.200
 The Holocaust is a weird, weird sidebar to the whole thing. And here's what I've always found

1:46:25.200 --> 1:46:30.320
 interesting. It's a sidebar that weakened Germany, because look at the First World War, Jews fought

1:46:30.320 --> 1:46:36.320
 for Germany, right? Who was the most important? And this is a very arguable point, but it's just

1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:42.480
 the first one that pops into my head. Who was the most important Jewish figure that would have

1:46:42.480 --> 1:46:49.440
 maybe been on the German side, had the Germans had a non anti Semitic? Well, listen, that whole

1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:55.200
 part, yeah, it's not inside. But the whole, I should point out that to say Germany or Europe

1:46:55.200 --> 1:46:59.920
 or Russia or any of those things were not anti Semitic is to do injustice to history, right?

1:46:59.920 --> 1:47:05.600
 Pogroms everywhere. I mean, that is the standard operating procedure. What you see in the

1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:10.960
 Hitlerian era is an absolute huge spike, right? Because the government has a conspiracy theory

1:47:10.960 --> 1:47:16.240
 that the Jews have. It's funny because Hitler both thought of them as weak and super powerful at the

1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:21.600
 same time, right? And as an outsider people that weakened Germany, the whole idea of the blood

1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:28.080
 and how that connects to Darwinism and all that sort of stuff is just weird, right? A real outlier.

1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:33.840
 But Einstein, let's just play with Einstein. If there's no anti Semitism in Germany,

1:47:33.840 --> 1:47:41.840
 or none above the normal level, right? The baseline level. Does Einstein leave along

1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:49.120
 with all the other Jewish scientists? And what does Germany have as increased technological

1:47:49.120 --> 1:47:55.280
 and intellectual capacity if they stay, right? It's something that actually weakened that state.

1:47:55.280 --> 1:48:02.800
 It's a tragic flaw in the Hitlerian worldview. But it was so, and let me, you had mentioned

1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:09.120
 earlier, like maybe it was not integral to his character. Maybe it was a wonderful tool for power.

1:48:09.120 --> 1:48:15.280
 I don't think so. Somewhere along the line, and really not at the beginning, this guy became

1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:21.280
 absolutely obsessed with this. With the conspiracy theory. And Jews. And he surrounded himself

1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:27.360
 with people and theorists. I'm going to use that word really, really sort of loosely.

1:48:27.360 --> 1:48:33.680
 Who believe this too. And so you have a cabal of people who are reinforcing this idea that the Jews

1:48:33.680 --> 1:48:39.600
 control the world. He called it international Jewry was a huge part of the problem. And because of

1:48:39.600 --> 1:48:43.520
 that, they deserve to be punished. They were an enemy within all these kinds of things.

1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:47.920
 It's a nutty conspiracy theory that the government of one of the most,

1:48:48.880 --> 1:48:54.400
 I mean, the big thing with Germany was culture, right? They were a leading figure in

1:48:54.400 --> 1:49:00.080
 culture and philosophy and all these kinds of things. And that they could be overtaken with this

1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:04.960
 wildly, wickedly weird conspiracy theory and that it would actually determine things.

1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:10.560
 I mean, Hitler was taking vast amounts of German resources and using it to wipe out this race

1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:15.120
 when he needed them for all kinds of other things to fight a war of annihilation. So

1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:19.760
 that is the weirdest part of the whole Nazi phenomenon.

1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:28.000
 It's the darkest possible silver lining to think about is that the Holocaust may have been and the

1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:33.280
 hatred of the Jewish people may have been the thing that avoided Germany getting the nuclear

1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:42.880
 weapons first. Isn't that a wonderful historical ironic twist that if it weren't so overlaid with

1:49:42.880 --> 1:49:46.560
 tragedy a thousand years from now, we'll be seeing something really kind of funny?

1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:50.480
 Well, that's true. It's fascinating to think as you've talked.

1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:53.120
 So the seeds of his own destruction, right? The tragic flaw.

1:49:55.280 --> 1:50:01.120
 And my hope is, this is a discussion I have with my dad as a physicist,

1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:10.960
 is that evil inherently contains with it that kind of incompetence.

1:50:10.960 --> 1:50:20.240
 So my dad's discussion sees a physicist and engineer, his belief is that at this time in our

1:50:20.240 --> 1:50:28.880
 history, the reason we haven't had nuclear, like terrorist blow up a nuclear weapon somewhere in

1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:35.680
 the world is that the kind of people that would be terrorists are simply not competent enough

1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:43.760
 competent enough at their job of being destructive. So like there's a kind of, if you plot it,

1:50:43.760 --> 1:50:51.920
 the more evil you are, the less able you are. And by evil, I mean purely just like we said,

1:50:53.040 --> 1:50:57.520
 if we were to consider the hatred of the Jewish people as evil, because it's sort of detached

1:50:57.520 --> 1:51:06.640
 from reality, it's like just this pure hatred of something that's grounded on things, conspiracy

1:51:06.640 --> 1:51:12.880
 theories. If that's evil, then the more you sell yourself, the more you give into these conspiracy

1:51:12.880 --> 1:51:18.240
 theories, the less capable you are at actually engineering, which is very difficult engineering

1:51:18.240 --> 1:51:23.920
 nuclear weapons and effectively deploying them. So that's a hopeful message that the

1:51:23.920 --> 1:51:32.080
 destructive people in this world are by their worldview incompetent in creating the ultimate

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:38.000
 destruction. I don't agree with that. Oh boy. I straight up don't agree with that. So why are

1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:44.240
 we still here? Why haven't we destroyed ourselves? Why haven't the terrorists blow? It's been many

1:51:44.240 --> 1:51:51.200
 decades. Why haven't we destroyed ourselves to this point? Well, when you say it's been many

1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:57.440
 decades, many decades, that's like saying in the life of 150 year old person, we've been doing well

1:51:57.440 --> 1:52:02.560
 for a year. The problem with all these kinds of equations, and it was Bertrand Russell,

1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:08.960
 right? The philosopher who said so, he said it's unreasonable to expect a man to walk

1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:16.320
 on a tightrope for 50 years. I mean, the problem is that this is a long game. And let's remember

1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:22.480
 that up until relatively recently, what would you say 30 years ago, the nuclear weapons in the world

1:52:22.480 --> 1:52:26.640
 were really tightly controlled. That was one of the real dangers in the fall of the Soviet Union.

1:52:26.640 --> 1:52:32.560
 Remember the worry that all of a sudden you were going to have bankrupt former Soviet republics

1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:37.200
 selling nuclear weapons to terrorists and whatnot? I would suggest, and here's another problem, is

1:52:37.200 --> 1:52:42.880
 that when we call these terrorists evil, it's easy for an American, for example, to say that Osama

1:52:42.880 --> 1:52:48.720
 bin Laden is evil. Easy for me to say that. But one man's terrorist is another man's freedom

1:52:48.720 --> 1:52:53.600
 fighter, as the saying goes. And to other people, he's not. What Osama bin Laden did,

1:52:54.640 --> 1:53:00.800
 and the people that worked with him, we would call evil genius, the idea of hijacking planes and

1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:06.320
 flying them into the buildings like that, and that he could pull that off. And that still

1:53:06.320 --> 1:53:13.040
 boggles my mind. I'm still, it's funny, I'm still stunned by that. And yet, you know, the idea,

1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:17.440
 here's the funny part, and I don't, I hesitate to talk about this because I don't want to give

1:53:17.440 --> 1:53:25.680
 anyone ideas. Right. But you don't need nuclear weapons to do incredibly grave amounts of danger.

1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:32.000
 Really? I mean, what one can of gasoline and a big lighter can do in the right place and the right

1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:40.240
 time and over and over and over again can bring down societies. This is the argument behind

1:53:40.240 --> 1:53:46.480
 the importance of the stability that a nation state provides. So when we went in and took out

1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:52.000
 Saddam Hussein, one of the great counter arguments from some of the people who said this is a really

1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:58.000
 stupid thing to do, is that Saddam Hussein was the greatest anti terror weapon in that region

1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:03.440
 that you could have because they were a threat to him. So he took that and he did it in a way

1:54:03.440 --> 1:54:08.720
 that was much more repressive than we would ever be. Right. And this is the old line about why we

1:54:08.720 --> 1:54:15.280
 supported right wing death squad countries because they were taking out people that would

1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:20.240
 inevitably be a problem for us if they didn't. And they were able to do it in a way we would

1:54:20.240 --> 1:54:24.240
 never be able to do supposedly. We're pretty good at that stuff, you know, just like the Soviet

1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:29.840
 Union was behind the scenes and underneath the radar. But the idea that the stability created

1:54:29.840 --> 1:54:35.760
 by powerful and strong centralized leadership allowed them, it's almost like outsourcing

1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:40.960
 anti terror activities allowed them to for their own reasons. I mean, you see the same thing in

1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:46.640
 the Syria situation with the Assad's. I mean, you can't have an ISIS in that area because that's a

1:54:46.640 --> 1:54:50.720
 threat to the Assad government who will take care of that for you. And then that helps us by not

1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:57.440
 having an ISIS. So I would suggest one that the game is still on on whether or not these people

1:54:57.440 --> 1:55:02.960
 get nuclear weapons in their hands. I would suggest they don't need them to achieve their goals,

1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:10.000
 really. The crazy thing is if you start thinking like the Joker in Batman, the terrorist ideas,

1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:13.760
 it's funny, I guess I would be a great terrorist because I'm just full of those ideas. Oh,

1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:18.240
 you could do this. It's scary to think of how vulnerable we are. But the whole point

1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:27.360
 is that you as the Joker wouldn't do the terrorist actions. That's the that's the theory that's so

1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:33.840
 hopeful to me with my dad is that all the ideas, your ability to generate good ideas, what forget

1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:40.560
 nuclear weapons, how you can disrupt the power grid, how you can disrupt the attack our psychology

1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:47.600
 attack, like with a can of gasoline, like you said, somehow disrupt the American system of ideas,

1:55:48.880 --> 1:55:55.920
 like that coming up with good ideas there. Are we saying evil people can't come up with

1:55:55.920 --> 1:56:00.960
 evil genius ideas? That's what I'm saying. We have this Hollywood story. I don't think history

1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:04.720
 backs that up. I mean, I think you can say with the nuclear weapons it does, but only because

1:56:04.720 --> 1:56:10.400
 they're so recent. Yes. But I mean, evil genius. I mean, that's almost proverbial. But that's

1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:15.200
 okay. So to push back for the fun of it. I don't need to. I don't want you to leave this

1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:20.800
 with a terrible mood because I push back on every hopeful idea you had. But I tend to be a little

1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:28.080
 cynical about that stuff. But that goes to the definition of evil, I think, because I'm not

1:56:28.080 --> 1:56:35.680
 so sure human history has a lot of evil people being competent. I do believe that they mostly,

1:56:35.680 --> 1:56:42.240
 like in order to be good at doing what may be perceived as evil, you have to be able to construct

1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:49.200
 an ideology around which you truly believe when you look in the mirror by yourself that you're

1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:58.080
 doing good for the world. And it's difficult to construct an ideology where destroying the lives

1:56:58.080 --> 1:57:03.120
 of millions or disrupting the American system. I'm already contradicting myself as I'm saying.

1:57:03.120 --> 1:57:09.840
 I was going to say people have done this already. Yes. But then it's the question of like about

1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:19.280
 aliens with the idea that if the aliens are all out there, why haven't they visited us?

1:57:20.320 --> 1:57:27.040
 The same question. If it's so easy to be evil, not easy. If it's possible to be evil,

1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:33.520
 why haven't we destroyed ourselves? And your statement is from the context of history, the game

1:57:33.520 --> 1:57:39.520
 is still on. And it's just been a few years since we've found the tools to destroy ourselves.

1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:46.160
 And one of the challenges of our modern time that we don't often think about this pandemic

1:57:46.160 --> 1:57:53.600
 kind of revealed is how soft we've gotten in terms of our deep dependence on the system.

1:57:53.600 --> 1:58:00.800
 So somebody mentioned to me what happens if power goes out for a day? What happens if power goes out

1:58:00.800 --> 1:58:10.080
 for a month? Oh, the person that mentioned this was a Berkeley faculty that I was talking with.

1:58:10.080 --> 1:58:16.880
 He's an astronomer who's observing solar flares. And it's very possible that a solar flare,

1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:20.560
 they happen all the time to different degrees. To knock out your cell phones.

1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:29.040
 Yeah, to knock out the power grid for months. So just as a thought experiment,

1:58:29.040 --> 1:58:33.360
 what happens if just power goes out for a week in this country?

1:58:33.360 --> 1:58:38.720
 This is like the electromagnetic pulses in the nuclear weapons and all those kinds of things.

1:58:38.720 --> 1:58:44.400
 But maybe that's an act of nature. And even just the act of nature will reveal

1:58:44.400 --> 1:58:51.360
 the fragility of it all. And then the evil can emerge. The kind of things that might happen

1:58:51.360 --> 1:58:57.280
 when power goes out, especially during a divisive time. Well, you won't have food.

1:58:57.280 --> 1:59:04.560
 At baseline level, that would mean that the entire supply chain begins to break down.

1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:08.000
 And then you have desperation. And desperation opens the door to everything.

1:59:09.120 --> 1:59:12.640
 Can I ask a dark question? As opposed to the other things we've been talking about?

1:59:12.640 --> 1:59:18.080
 Well, there's always a thread, a hopeful message. I think there'll be a hopeful message on this one

1:59:18.080 --> 1:59:28.960
 too. You may have the wrong guess. If you were to bet money on the way that human civilization

1:59:28.960 --> 1:59:38.000
 destroys itself, or it collapses in some way that is where the result would be unrecognizable to us

1:59:38.000 --> 1:59:48.640
 as anything akin to progress, what would you say? Is it nuclear weapons? Is it some societal breakdown

1:59:48.640 --> 1:59:54.400
 through just more traditional kinds of war? Is it engineered pandemics, nanotechnology?

1:59:54.400 --> 1:59:59.520
 Is it artificial intelligence? Is it something we can't even expect yet? Do you have a sense

1:59:59.520 --> 2:00:03.920
 of how we humans will destroy ourselves? Or might we live forever?

2:00:03.920 --> 2:00:12.080
 Sure. I think what governs my view of this thing is the ability for us to focus ourselves

2:00:12.080 --> 2:00:17.360
 collectively. And that gives me the choice of looking at this and saying, what are the odds

2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:26.160
 we will do X versus Y? So go look at the 62 Cuban Missile Crisis, where we looked at the

2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:32.320
 potential of nuclear war and we stared right in the face of that. To me, I consider that to be,

2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:37.520
 you want to talk about a hopeful moment. That's one of the rare times in our history where I think

2:00:37.520 --> 2:00:45.600
 the odds were overwhelmingly that there would be a nuclear war. And I'm not the super Kennedy

2:00:45.600 --> 2:00:50.240
 worshipper. I grew up in an era where he was, especially amongst people in the Democratic

2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:53.920
 Party, he was almost worshipped. And I was never that guy, but I will say something.

2:00:53.920 --> 2:01:01.920
 John F. Kennedy, by himself, probably made decisions that saved a hundred million or more

2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:07.600
 lives because everyone around him thought he should be taking the road that would have led

2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:12.720
 to those deaths. And to push back against that is when you look at it now, I mean, again,

2:01:12.720 --> 2:01:16.240
 if you were a betting person, you would have bet against that. And that's rare, right?

2:01:16.240 --> 2:01:25.520
 So when we talk about how the world will end, the fact that one person actually had that

2:01:25.520 --> 2:01:30.800
 in their hands meant that it wasn't a collective decision. It gave, remember I said I trust people

2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:34.960
 on an individual level, but when we get together, we're more like a herd and we devolve down to

2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:41.280
 the lowest common denominator. That was something where the higher ethical ideas of a single human

2:01:41.280 --> 2:01:47.200
 being could come into play and make the decisions that influence the events. But when we have to

2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:53.920
 act collectively, I get a lot more pessimistic. So take what we're doing to the planet. And we

2:01:53.920 --> 2:01:58.240
 talk about it always now in terms of climate change, which I think is far too narrow.

2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:04.480
 And I always get very frustrated when we talk about these arguments about is it happening,

2:02:04.480 --> 2:02:11.040
 is it human? Just look at the trash. Forget climate for a second. We're destroying the

2:02:11.040 --> 2:02:14.960
 planet because we're not taking care of it. And because what it would do to take care of it would

2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:22.880
 require collective sacrifices that would require enough of us to say, okay, and we can't get enough

2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:28.720
 of us to say, okay, because too many people have to be on board. It's not John F. Kennedy making one

2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:35.040
 decision from one man. We have to have 85% of us or something around the world. Not just,

2:02:35.040 --> 2:02:40.240
 you can't say we're going to stop doing damage to the world here in the United States. If China

2:02:40.240 --> 2:02:47.680
 does it, right? So the amount of people that have to get on board that train is hard. You get pessimistic

2:02:47.680 --> 2:02:53.760
 hoping for those kinds of shifts unless it's right. And you know, Krypton's about to explode.

2:02:54.720 --> 2:03:01.600
 And so I think if you're talking about a gambling man's view of this, that that's got to be the odds

2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:08.480
 on favorite because it requires such a UNM. I mean, and the systems maybe aren't even in place,

2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:13.840
 right? The fact that we would need intergovernmental bodies that are completely discredited now on

2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:19.600
 board and you would have to subvert the national interests of nation states. I mean, the amount

2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:26.000
 of things that have to go right in a short period of time where we don't have 600 years to figure

2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:31.280
 this out, right? So to me, that looks like the most likely just because the things we would have

2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:36.640
 to do to avoid it seem the most unlikely. Does that make sense? Yes, absolutely. I believe

2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:43.840
 call me naive. And just like you said with the individual, I believe that charismatic leaders,

2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:48.960
 individual leaders will save us. What if you don't get them all at the same time? What if you get a

2:03:48.960 --> 2:03:52.800
 charismatic leader in one country but under or what if you get a charismatic leader in a country

2:03:52.800 --> 2:03:57.760
 that doesn't really matter that much? Well, it's a ripple effect. So it starts with one leader and

2:03:57.760 --> 2:04:05.280
 their charisma inspires other leaders. Like so it's a it's like one aunt queen steps up and then

2:04:05.280 --> 2:04:09.920
 the rest of the aunt starts behaving. And then there's like little other spikes of leaders that

2:04:09.920 --> 2:04:15.600
 emerge. And then that's where collaboration emerges. I tend to believe that like, when you heat up the

2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:24.480
 system and shit starts getting really chaotic, then the leader, whatever this collective intelligence

2:04:24.480 --> 2:04:29.680
 that we've developed, the leader will emerge. Like there, do you think there's just as much of a

2:04:29.680 --> 2:04:33.440
 chance though that the leader would emerge and say the Jews are the people who did all this?

2:04:33.440 --> 2:04:36.720
 That's right. You know what I'm saying is that the idea that they would come up,

2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:40.320
 you have a charismatic leader and he's going to come up with the rights or she is going to come

2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:45.680
 up with the right solution as opposed to totally coming up with the wrong solution. I mean, I guess

2:04:45.680 --> 2:04:50.720
 what I'm saying is you could be right, but a lot of things have to go the right way. But my

2:04:50.720 --> 2:04:55.520
 intuition about the evolutionary process that led to the creation of human intelligence and

2:04:55.520 --> 2:05:03.600
 consciousness on earth results in the power of like, if we think of it just the love in the system

2:05:03.600 --> 2:05:13.600
 versus the hate in the system, that the love is greater, the human kindness potential in the system

2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:21.120
 is greater than the human hatred potential. And so the leader that is in the time when it's needed,

2:05:21.120 --> 2:05:29.760
 the leader that inspires love and kindness is more likely to emerge and will have more power.

2:05:29.760 --> 2:05:36.640
 So you have the hitlers of the world that emerge, but they're actually in a grand scheme of history

2:05:36.640 --> 2:05:45.040
 are not that impactful. So it's weird to say, but not that many people died in World War II.

2:05:45.040 --> 2:05:54.800
 If you look at the full range of human history, it's up to 100 million, whatever that is,

2:05:54.800 --> 2:05:59.280
 with natural pandemics too, you can have those kinds of numbers, but it's still a percentage.

2:05:59.280 --> 2:06:03.920
 I forget what the percentage is, maybe three, five percent of the human population on earth,

2:06:03.920 --> 2:06:09.040
 maybe it's a little bit focused on a different region, but it's not destructive to the entirety

2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:19.360
 of human civilization. So I believe that the charismatic leaders, when time is needed that

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:26.400
 do good for the world in the broader sense of good, are more likely to emerge than the ones

2:06:26.400 --> 2:06:32.720
 that say kill all the Jews. It's possible though, and this is just, I've thought about this all

2:06:32.720 --> 2:06:40.160
 of 30 seconds. We're betting money here on the 21st century. Who's going to win? I think maybe

2:06:41.120 --> 2:06:47.440
 you've divided this into too much of a black and white dichotomy, this love and good on one side

2:06:47.440 --> 2:06:52.640
 and this evil on another. Let me throw something that might be more in the center of that linear,

2:06:53.360 --> 2:07:00.880
 a balancing act, self interest, which may or may not be good, the good version of it we call

2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:07.680
 enlightened self interest, the bad version of it we call selfishness. But self interest to me

2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:13.840
 seems like something more likely to impact the outcome than either love on one side or evil on

2:07:13.840 --> 2:07:19.760
 the other. Simply a question of what's good for me or what's good for my country or what's good

2:07:19.760 --> 2:07:27.520
 for my point of view or what's good for my business. If you tell me, and maybe I'm a coal

2:07:27.520 --> 2:07:33.120
 miner or maybe I own a coal mine, if you say to me, we have to stop using coal because it's hurting

2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:41.840
 the earth, I have a hard time disentangling that greater good question from my right now good feeding

2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:49.680
 my family question. I think maybe it's going to be a much more banal thing than good and evil,

2:07:49.680 --> 2:07:55.440
 much more a question of we're not all going to decide at the same time that the interests that

2:07:55.440 --> 2:08:00.720
 we have are aligned. Does that make sense? Yeah, totally. But I mean, I've looked at Ayn Rand and

2:08:00.720 --> 2:08:05.280
 Objectivism and kind of really thought like, how bad or good can things go when everybody's acting

2:08:05.280 --> 2:08:10.320
 selfishly? But I think we're just talking to ants here with microphones talking about

2:08:13.200 --> 2:08:21.920
 but like the question is when they when this spreads. So what is what do I mean by love and

2:08:21.920 --> 2:08:30.800
 kindness? I think it's human flourishing on earth and throughout the cosmos. It feels like whatever

2:08:30.800 --> 2:08:38.240
 the engine that drives human beings is more likely to result in human flourishing. And people like

2:08:38.240 --> 2:08:45.120
 Hitler are not good for human flourishing. So that's what I mean by good is they is is there's a,

2:08:45.120 --> 2:08:52.480
 I mean, maybe it's an intuition that kindness is an evolutionary advantage. I hate those terms,

2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:58.400
 I hate to reduce stuff to evolutionary biology always, but it just seems like for us to multiply

2:08:58.400 --> 2:09:05.280
 throughout the universe, it's good to be kind to each other. And those leaders will always emerge

2:09:05.280 --> 2:09:10.240
 to save us from the hitlers of the world that want to kind of burn the thing down with a

2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:15.280
 flame thrower. That's the intuition. But let's talk about you brought up evolution several times.

2:09:15.280 --> 2:09:21.680
 Let me play with that for a minute. I think going back to animal times, we are conditioned

2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:26.560
 to deal with overwhelming threats right in front of us. So I have quite a bit of faith

2:09:27.120 --> 2:09:35.760
 in humanity when it comes to impending doom right outside our door. If cryptons about to explode,

2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:42.160
 I think humanity can rouse themselves to great and would give power to the people who needed it

2:09:42.160 --> 2:09:47.360
 and be willing to make the sacrifices. But that's what makes I think the pollution slash climate

2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:53.920
 change slash, you know, screwing up your environment threat so particularly insidious is it happens

2:09:53.920 --> 2:10:00.960
 slowly, right? It defies fight and flight mechanisms. It defies the natural ability we have to deal

2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:07.040
 with the threat that's right on top of us. And it requires an amount of foresight that while some

2:10:07.040 --> 2:10:12.240
 people would would be fine with that, most people are too worried and understandably, I think,

2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:18.400
 too worried about today's threat rather than next generation's threat or whatever it might be.

2:10:18.400 --> 2:10:22.000
 So I mean, when we talk about when you had said, what do you think the greatest threat is?

2:10:22.960 --> 2:10:27.840
 I think with nuclear weapons, I think, could we have a nuclear war we darn right could, but I

2:10:27.840 --> 2:10:34.640
 think that there's enough of inertia. We're against that because people understand instinctively,

2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:40.160
 if I decide to launch this attack against China and I'm India, we're going to have 50 million

2:10:40.160 --> 2:10:44.800
 dead people tomorrow. Whereas if you say, we're going to have a whole planet of dead people in

2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:53.760
 three generations, if we don't start now, I think the evolutionary way that we have have evolved

2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:58.480
 mitigates maybe against that. In other words, I think I would be pleasantly surprised if we

2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:02.880
 could pull that off. Does that make sense? Totally. I don't mean to be like the I'm the

2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:08.560
 I'm the most predicting doom. Well, it's fun that way. I think we're both maybe I'm over the top on

2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:14.400
 the low. Maybe I'm over the top on the doom. So it makes it makes for a fun chat, I think.

2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:20.720
 So one one guy that I've talked to several times is solely becoming a friend is a guy named Elon

2:11:20.720 --> 2:11:29.440
 Musk. He's a big fan of hardcore history, especially Genghis Khan series of episodes,

2:11:29.440 --> 2:11:36.160
 but really all of it, him and his girlfriend Grimes listen to it. I know Elon. Yeah, you know

2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:42.000
 Elon? Okay, awesome. So that's like relationship goals, like listen to hardcore history on the

2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:49.360
 weekend with your loved one. Okay, so let me if I were to look at the guy from a perspective of

2:11:49.360 --> 2:11:57.200
 human history, it feels like he will be a little spec that's remembered. Oh, absolutely. You think

2:11:57.200 --> 2:12:03.600
 about like the people, what will we remember from our time? Who are the people will remember,

2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:10.480
 whether it's the the Hitlers or the Einstein's? Who's going to be it's hard to predict when

2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:15.840
 you're in it. But it seems like Elon will be one of those people remembered. And if I were to guess

2:12:15.840 --> 2:12:23.040
 what he's remembered for, it's the work he's doing with SpaceX and potentially being the person

2:12:23.600 --> 2:12:30.960
 that we don't know, but the being the person who launched a new era of space exploration.

2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:36.880
 If we look, you know, centuries from now, if we are successful as human beings surviving long enough

2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:44.800
 to venture out into the, you know, toward the stars, it's weird to ask you this. I don't know

2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:52.160
 what your opinions are. But do you think humans will be a multi planetary species in the arc

2:12:52.160 --> 2:12:57.440
 long arc of history? Do you think Elon will be successful in his dream? And he doesn't he doesn't

2:12:57.440 --> 2:13:05.920
 shy away from saying it this way, right? He really wants us to colonize Mars first, and then colonize

2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:12.160
 other Earth like planets in other solar systems throughout the galaxy. Do you have a hope that

2:13:12.160 --> 2:13:17.280
 we humans will venture out towards the stars? So here's the thing. And this actually, again,

2:13:17.280 --> 2:13:24.240
 dovetails do what we were talking about earlier. I actually, first of all, I toured SpaceX. And it

2:13:24.240 --> 2:13:29.280
 is when you it's hard to get your mind around because he's doing what it took governments to

2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:34.400
 do before. Yes. Okay, so it's incredible that we're watching individual companies and stuff doing

2:13:34.400 --> 2:13:39.200
 this during a faster and cheaper. Yeah. Well, and pushing the envelope, right faster than the

2:13:39.200 --> 2:13:43.760
 governments at the time we're moving is it's great. It really is. I mean, there's a lot of people who

2:13:43.760 --> 2:13:50.720
 I think who think Elon is is overrated and you have no idea, right? When you go see it, you have

2:13:50.720 --> 2:13:57.200
 no idea. But that's actually not what I'm most impressed with. It's Tesla, I'm most impressed

2:13:57.200 --> 2:14:02.400
 with. And the reason why is because in my mind, we just talked about what I think is the greatest

2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:08.160
 threat, the environmental stuff. And I talked about our inability, maybe all at the same time

2:14:08.160 --> 2:14:14.960
 to be willing to sacrifice our self interests in order for the for the goal. And I don't want to

2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:19.440
 put words in Elon's mouth. So you can you can talk to him if you want to. But in my mind,

2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:25.280
 what he's done is recognize that problem. And instead of building a car that's a piece of crap,

2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:29.600
 but you know, it's good for the environment. So you should drive it. He's trying to create a car

2:14:30.160 --> 2:14:36.160
 that if you're only motivated by your self interest, you'll buy it anyway. And it will help the

2:14:36.160 --> 2:14:41.040
 environment and help us transition away from one of the main causes of damage. I mean, one of the

2:14:41.040 --> 2:14:47.920
 things this pandemic and the shutdown around the world has done is show us how amazingly quickly

2:14:47.920 --> 2:14:52.800
 the earth can actually rejuvenate. We're seeing clear skies in places, species come and you would

2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:58.240
 have thought it would have taken decades for some of this stuff. So what if to name just one major

2:14:58.240 --> 2:15:04.880
 pollution source, we didn't have the pollution caused by automobiles, right? And and if if you

2:15:04.880 --> 2:15:09.120
 had said to me, Dan, what do you think the odds of us transitioning away from that were 10 years

2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:11.840
 ago, I would have said, well, people aren't going to do it because it's inefficient. It's this,

2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:16.080
 it's that nobody wants to buy. But what if you created the vehicle that was superior in every

2:15:16.080 --> 2:15:21.600
 way so that if you were just a self oriented consumer, you'd buy it because you wanted that car.

2:15:21.600 --> 2:15:27.920
 That's the best way to get around that problem of people not wanting to. I think he's identified

2:15:27.920 --> 2:15:33.280
 that. And as he's told me before, you know, when the last time a car company was created that

2:15:33.280 --> 2:15:38.800
 actually, you know, blah, blah, blah, he's right. And so I happen to feel that even though he's

2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:42.880
 pushing the envelope on the space thing, I think somebody else would have done that someday.

2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:48.080
 I'm not sure because of the various things he's mentioned, how difficult it is to start there.

2:15:48.080 --> 2:15:53.760
 I'm not sure that the industries that create vehicles for us would have gone where he's going

2:15:53.760 --> 2:15:59.040
 to lead them. If he didn't force them there through consumer demand by making a better car

2:15:59.040 --> 2:16:04.320
 that people wanted anyway, they'll follow, they'll copy, they'll do all those things. And yet who

2:16:04.320 --> 2:16:10.160
 was going to do that? So I hope he doesn't hate me for saying this, but I happen to think the Tesla

2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:16.560
 idea may alleviate some of the need to get off this planet because the planet's being destroyed,

2:16:16.560 --> 2:16:21.040
 right? And we're going to colonize Mars probably anyway, if we live long enough. And I think the

2:16:21.040 --> 2:16:26.720
 Tesla idea, not just Elon's version, but ones that follow from other people, is the best chance of

2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:30.960
 making sure we're around long enough to see Mars colonized. Does that make sense? Yeah, totally.

2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:36.560
 And one other thing from my perspective, because I'm now starting a company, I think the interesting

2:16:36.560 --> 2:16:44.640
 thing about Elon is he serves as a beacon of hope, like pragmatically speaking, for people that

2:16:44.640 --> 2:16:52.480
 sort of to push back on our doom conversation from earlier, that a single individual could build

2:16:52.480 --> 2:17:00.000
 something that allows us as self interested individuals to gather together in a collective way

2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:08.400
 to actually alleviate some of the dangers that face our world. So it gives me hope as an individual

2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:18.800
 that I can build something that can actually have impact that counteracts the Stalin's and the

2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:26.160
 Hitler's and all the threats that face that human civilization faces, that an individual has that

2:17:26.160 --> 2:17:33.520
 power. I didn't believe that the individual has that power in the halls of government. Like,

2:17:33.520 --> 2:17:38.720
 I don't feel like anyone presidential candidate can rise up and help the world, unite the world.

2:17:39.360 --> 2:17:46.160
 It feels like from everything I've seen, and you're right with Tesla, it can bring the world

2:17:46.160 --> 2:17:52.960
 together to do good. That's a really powerful mechanism of whatever you say about capitalism,

2:17:52.960 --> 2:18:00.240
 that you can build companies that start with a single individual. Of course, there's a collective

2:18:00.240 --> 2:18:06.640
 that grows around that, but the leadership of a single individual, their ideas, their dreams,

2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:14.400
 their vision can catalyze something that takes over the world and does good for the entire world.

2:18:14.400 --> 2:18:21.360
 But again, I think the genius of the idea is that it doesn't require us to go head to head

2:18:21.360 --> 2:18:28.480
 with human nature. He's actually built human nature into the idea by basically saying,

2:18:28.480 --> 2:18:33.600
 I'm not asking you to be an environmental activist. I'm not asking you to sacrifice to make

2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:37.760
 it. I'm going to sell you a car you're going to like better, and by buying it, you'll help the

2:18:37.760 --> 2:18:45.360
 environment. That takes into account our foibles as a species and actually leverages that to work

2:18:45.360 --> 2:18:51.120
 for the greater good. That's the sort of thing that does turn off my little doom caster cynicism

2:18:51.120 --> 2:18:57.520
 thing a little bit because you're actually hitting us where we live. You can take somebody who doesn't

2:18:57.520 --> 2:19:02.240
 even believe the environment's a problem, but they want a Tesla. They're inadvertently helping

2:19:02.240 --> 2:19:09.440
 anyway. I think that's the genius of the idea. Yeah. I'm telling you, that's one way to make love

2:19:09.440 --> 2:19:15.200
 much more efficient mechanism of change than hate. Making it in your self interest to make

2:19:15.200 --> 2:19:21.680
 use of creating a product that leads to more love than hate. You're going to want to love

2:19:21.680 --> 2:19:28.640
 your neighbor because you're going to make a fortune. I'm on board. That's why Elon said

2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:35.280
 loves the answer. That's I think exactly what he meant. Okay. Let's try something difficult.

2:19:36.560 --> 2:19:43.440
 You've recorded an episode of steering into the iceberg on your common sense program

2:19:44.560 --> 2:19:51.280
 that has started a lot of conversations. It's quite moving. It was quite haunting. Got me a

2:19:51.280 --> 2:19:57.680
 lot of angry emails. Really? Of course. I did something I haven't done in 30 years. I endorsed

2:19:57.680 --> 2:20:01.200
 a political candidate from one of the two main parties and there were a lot of disillusioned

2:20:01.200 --> 2:20:07.440
 people because of that. I guess I didn't hear it as an endorsement. I just heard it as a

2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:15.200
 the similar flavor of conversation as you have in hardcore history. It's almost a

2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:22.880
 speaking about modern times in the same voice as you speak about when you talk about history.

2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:28.080
 So it was just a little bit of a haunting view of the world today.

2:20:30.400 --> 2:20:35.200
 I know we were just wearing our doomcaster. He put that right back on, are you?

2:20:38.400 --> 2:20:48.480
 I like the term doomcaster. How do we get love to win? What's the way out of this?

2:20:48.480 --> 2:21:01.360
 Is there some hopeful line that we can walk to avoid something, and I hate to use the terminology,

2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:10.560
 but something that looks like a civil war. Not necessarily a war of force, but a division

2:21:10.560 --> 2:21:18.400
 to a level where it doesn't any longer feel like a united States of America with an emphasis on

2:21:18.400 --> 2:21:26.560
 united. Is there a way out? I read a book a while back. I want to say George Friedman,

2:21:26.560 --> 2:21:30.720
 the Stratford guy, wrote it. It was something called the next 100 years, I think it was called.

2:21:31.440 --> 2:21:36.480
 And I remember thinking, I didn't agree with any of it. And one of the things I think he

2:21:36.480 --> 2:21:40.000
 said in the book was that the United States was going to break up. I'm going from memory here.

2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:42.880
 He might not have said that at all, but something was stuck in my memory about that. And I remember

2:21:42.880 --> 2:21:53.200
 thinking, but I think some of the arguments were connected to the differences that we had and the

2:21:53.200 --> 2:21:57.840
 fact that those differences are being exploited. So we talked about media earlier and the lack of

2:21:57.840 --> 2:22:05.360
 truth and everything. We have a media climate that is incentivized to take the wedges in our

2:22:05.360 --> 2:22:12.640
 society and make them wider. And there's no countervailing force to do the opposite or to help

2:22:12.640 --> 2:22:20.880
 us. So there was a famous memo from a group called Project for a New American Century,

2:22:20.880 --> 2:22:25.120
 and they took it down, but the Wayback Machine online still has it. And it happened before 9

2:22:25.120 --> 2:22:30.160
 11, spawned all kinds of conspiracy theories because it was saying something to the effect of,

2:22:30.800 --> 2:22:35.440
 and I'm really paraphrasing here, but that the United States needs another Pearl Harbor type

2:22:35.440 --> 2:22:41.680
 event because those galvanize a country that without those kinds of events periodically

2:22:41.680 --> 2:22:47.760
 is naturally geared towards pulling itself apart. And it's those periodic events that act as the

2:22:47.760 --> 2:22:55.760
 countervailing force that otherwise is not there. If that's true, then we are naturally inclined

2:22:55.760 --> 2:23:04.640
 towards pulling ourselves apart. So to have a media environment that makes money off widening

2:23:04.640 --> 2:23:11.520
 those divisions, which we do, I mean, I was in talk radio and it has those people, the people that

2:23:11.520 --> 2:23:15.520
 used to scream at me because I wouldn't do it. But I mean, we would have these terrible conversations

2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:19.360
 after every broadcast where I'd be in there with the program director and they're yelling at me

2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:25.280
 about heat, heat was the word they create more heat. Well, what is heat, right? Heat is division,

2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:31.360
 right? And they want the heat not because they're political, they're not Republicans or Democrats

2:23:31.360 --> 2:23:37.920
 either. We want listeners and we want engagement and involvement. And because of the constructs of

2:23:37.920 --> 2:23:42.960
 the format, you don't have a lot of time to get it. So you can't have me giving you like on a podcast

2:23:42.960 --> 2:23:48.560
 an hour and a half or two hours where we build a logical argument and you're with me the whole way,

2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:53.680
 your audience is changing every 15 minutes. So whatever points you make to create interest and

2:23:53.680 --> 2:24:00.960
 intrigue and engagement have to be knee jerk right now. They told me once that the audience

2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:07.600
 has to know where you stand on every single issue within five minutes of turning on your show. In

2:24:07.600 --> 2:24:13.840
 other words, you have to be part of a linear set of political beliefs so that if you feel

2:24:13.840 --> 2:24:18.880
 A about subject A, then you must feel D about subject D. And I don't even need to hear your

2:24:18.880 --> 2:24:22.560
 opinion on it because if you feel that way about A, you're going to feel that way about D. This is

2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:28.720
 a system that is designed to pull us apart for profit, but not because they want to pull us apart,

2:24:28.720 --> 2:24:37.600
 right? It's a byproduct of the profit. That's one little example of 50 examples in our society

2:24:37.600 --> 2:24:42.400
 that work in that same fashion. So what that project for a new American Century document

2:24:42.400 --> 2:24:49.120
 was saying is that we're naturally inclined towards disunity and without things to occasionally

2:24:49.120 --> 2:24:53.520
 ratchet the unity back up again so that we can start from the baseline again and then pull

2:24:53.520 --> 2:24:59.200
 ourselves apart till the next Pearl Harbor that you'll pull yourself apart, which I think that's

2:24:59.200 --> 2:25:04.800
 what the George Friedman book was saying that I disagreed with so much at the time. So in answer

2:25:04.800 --> 2:25:10.320
 to your question about civil wars, we can't have the same kind of civil war because we don't have

2:25:10.320 --> 2:25:14.640
 a geographical division that's as clear cut as the one we had before, right? You had a basically

2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:20.240
 North South line and some border states. It was set up for that kind of a split. Now we're divided

2:25:20.240 --> 2:25:25.360
 within communities, within families, within gerrymandered voting districts and precincts,

2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:31.360
 right? So you can't disengage. We're stuck with each other. So there's a civil war now

2:25:32.880 --> 2:25:40.400
 for lack of a better word. What it might seem like is the late 1960s, early 1970s, where you had

2:25:40.400 --> 2:25:45.680
 the bombings and, you know, let's call it domestic terrorism and things like that,

2:25:45.680 --> 2:25:50.720
 because that would seem to be something that once again, you don't even need a large chunk

2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:56.880
 of the country pulling apart. 10% of people who think it's the end times can do the damage,

2:25:56.880 --> 2:26:02.000
 just like we talked about terrorism before, and a can of gas and a big lighter. I've lived in a

2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:06.720
 bunch of places and I won't give anybody ideas where a can of gas and a big lighter would

2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:14.080
 take a thousand houses down before you could blink, right? That terrorist doesn't have to be

2:26:14.080 --> 2:26:18.640
 from the Middle East, doesn't have to have some sort of a fundamentalist religious agenda.

2:26:18.640 --> 2:26:22.960
 It could just be somebody really pissed off about the election results. So once again,

2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:28.960
 if we're playing an odds game here, everybody has to behave for this to work right. Only a few

2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:33.760
 people have to misbehave for this thing to go sideways. And remember, for every action, there

2:26:33.760 --> 2:26:38.720
 is an equal and opposite reaction. So you don't even have to have those people doing all these

2:26:38.720 --> 2:26:43.040
 things. All they have to do is start a tit for tat retribution cycle.

2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:47.920
 And there's an escalation. Yes. And it creates a momentum of its own,

2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:52.560
 which leads fundamentally, if you follow the chain of events down there, to some form of

2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:58.400
 dictatorial government as the only way to create stability, right? You want to destroy the Republic

2:26:58.400 --> 2:27:02.240
 and have a dictator? That's how you do it. And there are parallels to Nazi Germany,

2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:07.760
 the burning of the Reichstag, blah, blah, blah. I'm the doomcaster again, aren't I?

2:27:07.760 --> 2:27:13.040
 And some of it could be manufactured by those seeking authoritarian power. Absolutely. Like

2:27:13.040 --> 2:27:20.480
 the Reichstag fire was, or the Polish soldiers that fired over the border before the invasion in 1939.

2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:26.320
 To fight the devil's advocate with an angel's advocate, I would say just as our conversation

2:27:26.320 --> 2:27:32.800
 about Elon, it feels like individuals have power to unite us, to be that force of unity.

2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:41.600
 So you mentioned the media. I think you're one of the great podcasters in history. Joe Rogan is

2:27:42.560 --> 2:27:48.800
 like a long form, whatever. It's not podcasting. It's actually whatever the very infrequent is

2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:54.720
 what it is. No matter what it is. But the basic process of it is you go deep and you stay deep

2:27:54.720 --> 2:28:00.240
 and the listener stays with you for a long time. So I'm just looking at the numbers.

2:28:00.240 --> 2:28:10.880
 We're almost three hours in. And from previous episodes, I can tell you that about 300,000

2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:17.120
 people are still listening to the sound of our voice three hours in. So usually it's 300,000 to

2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:20.880
 500,000 people listen. And they two know. Congratulations, by the way. That's wonderful.

2:28:20.880 --> 2:28:31.520
 Joe Rogan is like 10 times that. And so he has power to unite. You have power to unite.

2:28:31.520 --> 2:28:36.080
 There's a few people with voices that it feels like they have power to unite.

2:28:37.280 --> 2:28:43.520
 Even if you quote unquote endorse a candidate and so on, there's still it feels to me that

2:28:43.520 --> 2:28:51.600
 speaking of. I don't want to keep saying love, but it's love and maybe unity more

2:28:51.600 --> 2:29:01.280
 practically speaking that like sanity that like respect for those you don't agree with or don't

2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:12.160
 understand. So empathy will just a few voices of those can help us avoid the really importantly,

2:29:12.160 --> 2:29:18.240
 not avoid the singular events, like you said, of somebody starting a fire and so on, but avoid

2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:28.480
 the escalation of it, the preparedness of the populace to escalate those events to turn a

2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:35.040
 singular event and a single riot or a shooting or like even something much more dramatic than

2:29:35.040 --> 2:29:41.760
 that to turn that into something that creates like ripples that grow as opposed to ripples

2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:47.200
 that fade away. And so like, I would like to put responsibility on somebody like you

2:29:48.400 --> 2:29:58.080
 and me in some small way and Joe being cognizant of the fact that a lot of very destructive

2:29:58.080 --> 2:30:04.720
 things might happen in November. And a few voices can save us is the feeling I have,

2:30:05.360 --> 2:30:10.560
 not by saying who you should vote for or any of that kind of stuff, but really by being the

2:30:10.560 --> 2:30:21.280
 the the voice of calm that like calms the the seas from or whatever the analogy is from boiling

2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:28.320
 up. Because I truly am worried about this is the first time this year when I

2:30:30.240 --> 2:30:36.560
 I sometimes I somehow have felt that the American project will go on forever. When I came to this

2:30:36.560 --> 2:30:43.680
 country, I just believed and I think I'm young, but like, you know, I have a dream of creating

2:30:43.680 --> 2:30:50.640
 a company that will do a lot of good for the world. And I thought that America is the beacon

2:30:50.640 --> 2:30:56.720
 of hope for the world. And the idea is a freedom, but also the idea of empowering companies that

2:30:56.720 --> 2:31:02.720
 can do some good for the world. And I'm just worried about this America that filled me,

2:31:02.720 --> 2:31:10.080
 me, a kid that came from our family came from nothing. And from, you know, Russia as it was

2:31:10.080 --> 2:31:16.480
 Soviet Union as it was, to be able to do anything in this new country. I'm just worried about it.

2:31:16.480 --> 2:31:24.960
 And it feels like a few people can still keep this project going. Like people like Elon, people

2:31:24.960 --> 2:31:37.440
 like Joe. Is there do you have a bit of that hope? I'm watching this experiment with social media

2:31:37.440 --> 2:31:41.840
 right now. And I don't even mean social media, really expand that out to me. I feel like we're

2:31:41.840 --> 2:31:46.240
 all guinea pigs right now watching, you know, I have two kids and in just watching and there's a

2:31:46.240 --> 2:31:52.080
 three year space between the two of them, one's 18, the other's 15. And just, you know, in when I

2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:57.360
 was a kid, a person who was 18 and 15 would not be that different, just three years difference,

2:31:57.360 --> 2:32:02.640
 more maturity, but their life experiences, you would easily classify those two people as being in

2:32:02.640 --> 2:32:09.840
 the same generation. Now, because of the speed of technological change, there is a vast difference

2:32:09.840 --> 2:32:14.880
 between my 18 year old and my 15 year old and not in the maturity question, just in what apps they

2:32:14.880 --> 2:32:20.320
 use, how they relate to each other, how they deal with their peers, their social skills, all those

2:32:20.320 --> 2:32:25.040
 kinds of things where you turn around and go, this is uncharted territory, we've never been here,

2:32:25.040 --> 2:32:28.480
 so it's going to be interesting to see what effect that has on society. Now, as that relates to your

2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:35.920
 question, the most upsetting part about all that is reading how people treat each other online.

2:32:35.920 --> 2:32:39.600
 And you know, there's lots of theories about this, the fact that some of it is just for trolling

2:32:39.600 --> 2:32:43.920
 laughs, that some of it is just people are not interacting face to face or they feel free to

2:32:43.920 --> 2:32:52.800
 treat each other that way. And I, of course, I'm trying to figure out how, if this is how we have

2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:57.600
 always been as people, right, we've always been this way, but we've never had the means to post

2:32:57.600 --> 2:33:03.840
 our feelings publicly about it, or if the environment and the social media and everything else

2:33:03.840 --> 2:33:11.360
 has provided a change and changed us into something else. Either way, when one reads

2:33:11.360 --> 2:33:17.520
 how we treat one another and the horrible things we say about one another online,

2:33:17.520 --> 2:33:22.560
 which seems like it shouldn't be that big of a deal, they're just words, but they have a cumulative

2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:28.880
 effect. I mean, when you, I was reading Megan Markle, who I don't know a lot about because it's

2:33:28.880 --> 2:33:32.560
 too much of the pop side of culture for me to pale. But I read a story the other day where she

2:33:32.560 --> 2:33:38.560
 was talking about the abuse she took online and how incredibly overwhelming it was and how many

2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:44.160
 people were doing it. And you think to yourself, okay, this is something that people who are in

2:33:44.160 --> 2:33:49.280
 positions of what you were discussing earlier never had to deal with. Let me ask you something,

2:33:49.280 --> 2:33:55.280
 and boy, this is the ultimate doom caster thing of all time to say. When you think of historical

2:33:55.280 --> 2:34:06.320
 figures that push things like love and peace and creating bridges between enemies, when you think

2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:12.000
 of what happened to those people, first of all, they're very dangerous. Every society in the world

2:34:12.000 --> 2:34:16.000
 has a better time, easier time dealing with violence and things like that than they do

2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:20.160
 nonviolence. Nonviolence is really difficult for governments to deal with, for example.

2:34:20.800 --> 2:34:26.720
 What happens to Gandhi and Jesus and Martin Luther King? And you think about all those people,

2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:32.560
 right? When they're that day, it's ironic, isn't it, that these people who push for peaceful solutions

2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:39.280
 are so often killed, but it's because they're effective. And when they're killed, the effectiveness

2:34:39.280 --> 2:34:44.320
 is diminished. Why are they killed because they're effective? And the only way to stop them is to

2:34:44.320 --> 2:34:49.760
 eliminate them because they're charismatic leaders who don't come around every day. And if you

2:34:49.760 --> 2:34:54.800
 eliminate them from the scene, the odds are you're not going to get another one for a while. I guess

2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:58.320
 what I'm saying is the very things you're talking about, which would have the effect you think it

2:34:58.320 --> 2:35:03.680
 would, right? They would destabilize systems in a way that most of us would consider positive,

2:35:03.680 --> 2:35:09.040
 but those systems have a way of protecting themselves, right? And so I feel like

2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:15.200
 history shows... See, history is pretty pessimistic, I think, by and large, if only because we can find

2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:20.400
 so many examples that just sound pessimistic. But I feel like people who are dangerous to the way

2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:27.920
 things are tend to be removed. Yes. But there's two things to say. I feel like you're right

2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:36.880
 that history... I feel like the ripples that love leaves in history are less obvious to detect,

2:35:36.880 --> 2:35:41.680
 but are actually more transformational. Like, in this... Well, one could make a case about, I mean,

2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:46.320
 if you want to talk about the long term value of a Jesus, a Gandhi... Yes. But yes, those people's

2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:51.040
 ripples are still affecting people today. I agree. And that's... You feel those ripples through the

2:35:51.040 --> 2:35:57.040
 general improvement of the quality of life that we see throughout the generations. Like,

2:35:57.040 --> 2:36:00.800
 you feel the ripples through the growth. I'll go along with you on that. Okay. But I would...

2:36:00.800 --> 2:36:10.320
 Even if that's not true, I tend to believe that... And by the way, the company that I'm working on

2:36:10.320 --> 2:36:16.320
 as a competitor is exactly attacking this, which is a competitor to Twitter. I think I can build

2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:20.720
 a better Twitter as a first step. There's a long story in there. I think a three year old child could

2:36:20.720 --> 2:36:24.240
 build a better... This is not to denigrate you. I'm sure yours would be better than a three year

2:36:24.240 --> 2:36:29.920
 old. But Twitter is so... And listen, Facebook too, they're really awful platforms for intellectual

2:36:29.920 --> 2:36:34.400
 discussion and meaningful discussion. And I'm on it. So let me just say I'm part of the problem.

2:36:34.400 --> 2:36:42.160
 We're new to this. So it wasn't obvious at the time how to do it. I agree. I tend to believe

2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:48.640
 that we live in a time where the tools that people that are interested in providing love,

2:36:48.640 --> 2:36:58.720
 like the weapons of love are much more powerful. So the one nice thing about technology is it

2:36:58.720 --> 2:37:05.120
 allows anyone to build a company that's more powerful than any government. So that could be

2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:11.680
 very destructive, but it could be also very positive. And I tend to believe that somebody

2:37:11.680 --> 2:37:17.200
 like Elon that wants to do good for the world, somebody like me and many like me could have

2:37:17.200 --> 2:37:23.440
 more power than any one government to... And by power, I mean the power to affect change,

2:37:24.320 --> 2:37:26.640
 which is different from... What do you mean with government? And I don't mean to interrupt you,

2:37:26.640 --> 2:37:30.800
 but I'll forget my friend. I'm getting old. I mean, how do you deal with the fact that

2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:36.720
 already governments who are afraid of this are walling off their own internet systems as a way

2:37:36.720 --> 2:37:42.560
 to create firewalls simply to prevent you from doing what you're talking about? In other words,

2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:46.080
 if there's an old line that if voting really changed anything, they'd never allow it.

2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:53.680
 If love through a modern day successor to Twitter would really do what you want it to do,

2:37:53.680 --> 2:37:59.920
 and this would destabilize governments, do you think that governments would take countermeasures

2:38:00.480 --> 2:38:03.440
 to squash that love before it got too dangerous?

2:38:03.440 --> 2:38:07.680
 There's several answers. One, first of all, I don't actually to push back on something you

2:38:07.680 --> 2:38:14.800
 said earlier, I don't think love is as much of an enemy of the state as one would think.

2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:16.480
 Different states have different views.

2:38:20.000 --> 2:38:27.040
 I think the states want power, and I don't always think that love is in tension with power.

2:38:33.040 --> 2:38:36.560
 I think it's not just about love, it's about rationality, it's reason,

2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:42.000
 it's empathy, all of those things. I don't necessarily think there always have to be

2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:49.920
 by definition in conflict with each other. That's one sense, I feel like, basically,

2:38:49.920 --> 2:38:56.720
 you can trojan horse love behind, but you have to be good at it. This is the thing,

2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:04.080
 is you have to be conscious of the way these states think. The fact that China bans certain

2:39:04.080 --> 2:39:10.240
 services and so on, that means the companies weren't eloquent, whoever the companies are,

2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:19.280
 weren't actually good at infiltrating. I think, isn't that a song? Love is a battlefield?

2:39:22.400 --> 2:39:29.200
 It's all a game, and you have to be good at the game. Just like Elon, we said with Tesla and

2:39:29.200 --> 2:39:36.080
 saving the environment, that's not just by getting on a stage and saying it's important

2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:42.880
 to save the environment. It's by building a product that people can't help but love,

2:39:43.440 --> 2:39:48.000
 and then convincing Hollywood stars to love it. There's a game to be played.

2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:53.040
 Okay, so let me build on that, because I think there's a way to see this. I think you're right,

2:39:53.040 --> 2:39:58.960
 and so it has to do with the story about the 1960s. In the vast scheme of things, the 1960s

2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:06.640
 looks like a revival of neo romantic ideas. I had a buddy of mine several years, well, two decades

2:40:06.640 --> 2:40:10.640
 older than I was, who was in the 60s, went to the protest, did all those kind of things.

2:40:11.360 --> 2:40:15.280
 We were talking about it, and I was romanticizing it. He said, don't romanticize it. He goes,

2:40:15.280 --> 2:40:19.440
 let me tell you, most of the people that went to those protests and did all those things,

2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:23.920
 all they were there was to meet girls and have a good time. It wasn't so, but

2:40:23.920 --> 2:40:31.120
 it became in vogue to have all in other words, let's talk about your empathy and love. You're

2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:35.360
 never going to, in my opinion, grab that great mass of people that are only in it for them,

2:40:35.360 --> 2:40:42.560
 they're interested in whatever. But if meeting girls for a young teenage guy requires you to

2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:50.240
 feign empathy, requires you to read deeper subjects because that's what people are into,

2:40:50.240 --> 2:40:56.880
 that's what people are into. You can almost as a silly way to be trendy, you could make maybe

2:40:56.880 --> 2:41:04.080
 empathy trendy, love trendy, solutions that are the opposite of that, the kind of things that

2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:10.480
 people inherently will not put up with you. In other words, the possibility exists to change

2:41:10.480 --> 2:41:17.040
 the zeitgeist and reoriented in a way that even if most of the people aren't serious about it,

2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:22.240
 the results are the same. Does that make sense? Absolutely. Okay. So we've found a meeting of

2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:30.880
 them on this. Yeah, exactly. Creating incentives that encourage the best and the most beautiful

2:41:30.880 --> 2:41:36.000
 aspects of human nature. They can't start a will. It all boils down to meeting girls and boys.

2:41:37.520 --> 2:41:41.840
 Once again, you're getting to the bottom of the evolutionary motivations and you're always on safe

2:41:41.840 --> 2:41:46.960
 ground when you do that. Yeah. That's a little difficult for me. And I'm sure it's actually

2:41:46.960 --> 2:41:56.240
 difficult for you to listen to me say complimenting you, but it's difficult for both of us.

2:41:58.240 --> 2:42:03.920
 But you and I, as I mentioned to you, I think I've been friends for a long time, it's just been one

2:42:03.920 --> 2:42:10.720
 way. It's two way now. It's two way now. So that's the beauty of podcasting. I mean,

2:42:10.720 --> 2:42:16.560
 now just been fortunate enough with this particular podcast that I see it in people's eyes when they

2:42:16.560 --> 2:42:23.360
 meet me, that they've been friends with me for a few years now. And we become fast friends

2:42:23.360 --> 2:42:28.240
 actually after we start talking. But it's one way in the vet in that first moment.

2:42:30.800 --> 2:42:36.400
 There's something about, especially hardcore history that I do some crazy challenges and

2:42:36.400 --> 2:42:41.360
 running and stuff. I remember in particular, probably don't have time, one of my favorite

2:42:41.360 --> 2:42:47.200
 episodes, the painful tainment one. Some people hate that episode. Because it's too real. Yeah,

2:42:47.200 --> 2:42:52.240
 they can't listen to it. It's by darkest one. We wanted to set a baseline. That's the baseline.

2:42:52.960 --> 2:42:58.160
 But I remember listening to that when I ran 22 miles for me, that was the long distance.

2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:08.880
 And it just pulls you in. And there's something so powerful about this particular creation

2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:13.280
 that's bigger than you actually that you've created. It's kind of interesting. I think

2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:17.520
 anything that is successful like that, like Elon stuff to it becomes bigger than you. And that's

2:43:17.520 --> 2:43:20.880
 what you're hoping for, right? Yeah, absolutely. Didn't mean to interrupt you. I apologize.

2:43:20.880 --> 2:43:29.760
 I guess one question I have, if you like look in the mirror, but you also look at me. What advice

2:43:29.760 --> 2:43:38.320
 would you give to yourself and to me and to other podcasters, maybe to Joe Rogan about this journey

2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:44.160
 that we're on? I feel like it's something special. I'm not sure exactly what's happening. But it

2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:53.440
 feels like podcasting is special. What advice and I'm relatively new to it. What advice do you have

2:43:54.080 --> 2:43:58.240
 for people that are carrying this flame and traveling this journey?

2:43:59.520 --> 2:44:06.480
 Well, I'm often asked for advice by new podcasters, people just starting out. And so I have sort of a

2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:18.000
 tried and true list of do's and don'ts. But I don't have advice or suggestions for you or for Joe.

2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:22.640
 Joe doesn't need anything from me. Joe's figured it out, right? I mean, he hasn't yet. He's still

2:44:22.640 --> 2:44:27.840
 a confused kid curious about the world. But that's the genius of it. That's what makes it work,

2:44:27.840 --> 2:44:33.840
 right? That's what Joe's brand is, right? I guess what I'm saying is, by the time you reach the

2:44:33.840 --> 2:44:39.840
 stage that you're at or Joe's at, they don't need it. They have figured this out. The people that

2:44:39.840 --> 2:44:43.680
 sometimes need help are brand new people trying to figure out what do I do with my first show and

2:44:43.680 --> 2:44:48.960
 how do I talk to them? And I have standard answers for that. But you found your niche. I mean, you

2:44:48.960 --> 2:44:53.440
 don't need me to tell you what to do. As a matter of fact, I might ask you questions about how you

2:44:53.440 --> 2:45:00.480
 do what you do, right? Well, I guess there's specific things that we were talking offline about

2:45:00.480 --> 2:45:05.920
 monetization. That's a fascinating one. Very difficult as an independent, yeah.

2:45:05.920 --> 2:45:12.080
 And one of the things that Joe is facing with, I don't know if you're paying attention, but he

2:45:12.080 --> 2:45:18.560
 joined Spotify with a $100 million deal before going exclusive on their platform. The idea of

2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:25.200
 exclusivity, that one, I don't give a damn about money personally, but I'm single. And I like living

2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:31.920
 in a shitty place. So I enjoy, so I guess it makes it easy. You get the freedom, right? To not

2:45:31.920 --> 2:45:37.440
 care, yeah. The freedom. Materials. Not saving for anybody's college. Exactly. Yeah. Okay, so

2:45:38.400 --> 2:45:44.160
 on that point, but I also, okay, maybe it's romanticization, but I feel like podcasting is

2:45:44.160 --> 2:45:51.120
 pirate radio. And when I first heard about Spotify, partnering up with Joe, I was like,

2:45:51.120 --> 2:45:59.120
 you know, fuck the man. I drafted a few tweets and so on, just like attacking Spotify, then I

2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:06.080
 calmed myself down, that you can't lock up this special thing we have. But then I realized that

2:46:06.080 --> 2:46:13.520
 maybe that these are vehicles for just reaching more people and actually respecting podcasts,

2:46:13.520 --> 2:46:20.160
 there's more and so on. So that's what I mean by it's unclear what the journey is, because you're

2:46:20.160 --> 2:46:30.560
 also serve as beacon for now there's like millions, one million plus podcasters. I wonder what the

2:46:30.560 --> 2:46:38.560
 journey is. Do you have a sense? Are you romantic in the same kind of way in feeling that because

2:46:38.560 --> 2:46:45.760
 you have roots in radio too? Do you feel that podcasting is pirate radio? Or is the Spotify

2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:54.080
 thing one possible avenue? Are you nervous about Joe as a fan as a friend of Joe? Or is this a

2:46:54.080 --> 2:47:01.440
 good thing for us? So my history of how I got involved in podcasting is interesting. I was in

2:47:01.440 --> 2:47:08.080
 radio and then I started a company back in the era where the dot com boom was happening and

2:47:08.080 --> 2:47:13.840
 everybody was being bought up and it just seemed like a great idea, right? I did it with six other

2:47:13.840 --> 2:47:20.000
 people and the whole goal of the company was we had to invent the term. I'm sure everybody,

2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:24.960
 there's other places that invented it at the same time, but what we were pitching to investors

2:47:24.960 --> 2:47:29.680
 was something called amateur content. So this is before YouTube, before podcasting, before all

2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:37.920
 this stuff. And my job was to be the evangelist and I would go to these people and sing the praises

2:47:37.920 --> 2:47:45.680
 of all the ways that amateur content was going to be great. And I never got a bite. And they all

2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:49.520
 told me the same thing. This isn't going to take off because anybody who's good is already going

2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:55.200
 to be making money at this. And I kept saying, forget that. We're talking about scale here.

2:47:55.200 --> 2:48:00.240
 If you have millions of pieces of content being made every week, a small percentage is going to

2:48:00.240 --> 2:48:04.400
 be good no matter what, right? 16 year olds will know what other 16 year olds like. I kept pushing

2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:10.960
 this nobody bit. But the podcast grew out of that because if you're talking about amateur content in

2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:19.040
 1999, well, then you're already, you're ahead of the game in terms of not seeing where it's

2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:23.840
 going to go financially, but seeing where it's going to go technologically. And so when we started

2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:28.800
 the podcast in 2005, and it was the political one, not hardcore history, which was an outgrowth of

2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:36.560
 the old radio show, we didn't have any financial ideas. We were simply trying to get our handle

2:48:36.560 --> 2:48:40.720
 on the technology and how you distribute it to people and all that. And it was years later

2:48:40.720 --> 2:48:44.320
 that we tried to figure out, okay, how can we get enough money to just support us while we're

2:48:44.320 --> 2:48:49.200
 doing this? And the cheap and the easy way was just to ask listeners to donate like a PBS kind

2:48:49.200 --> 2:48:55.680
 of model. And that was the original model. So then once we started down that, we figured out

2:48:55.680 --> 2:48:59.760
 other models and the advertising thing and that we sell the old shows. And so all these became

2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:09.760
 ways for us to support ourselves. But as podcasting matured and as more operating systems developed

2:49:09.760 --> 2:49:15.200
 and phones were developed and all these kinds of things, every one of those developments,

2:49:15.200 --> 2:49:20.320
 which actually made it easier for people to get the podcast actually made it more complex to

2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:25.440
 make money off of them. So while our audience was building the amount of time and effort we

2:49:25.440 --> 2:49:31.680
 had to put into the monetization side began to skyrocket. So to get back to your Spotify question,

2:49:31.680 --> 2:49:37.760
 to use just one example, there's a lot of people who are doing similar things. In this day and age,

2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:42.640
 we used to just sell MP3 files and all you had to have was an MP3 player. It's cheap and dirty.

2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:48.320
 Now every time there's an OS upgrade, something breaks for us. So we're having, I mean, my choices

2:49:48.320 --> 2:49:53.600
 are at this point to start hiring staff, more staff, people and then be a human resources

2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:57.440
 manager. I mean, the pirate radio side of this was the pirate radio side of this because you

2:49:57.440 --> 2:50:02.160
 didn't need anybody but you or you and another, I mean, you could just do this lean and mean and

2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:07.440
 it's becoming hard to do it lean and mean now. So if somebody like a Spotify comes in and says,

2:50:07.440 --> 2:50:13.840
 hey, we'll handle that stuff for you. In the past, I would just say, f off, we don't need you.

2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:19.120
 I don't mind. And I definitely am not making what we could make on this. But what we would have to

2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:26.800
 do to make that is honoris to me. But it's becoming honoris to me day to day anyway. And so if somebody

2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:32.160
 were to come in and say, hey, we'll pick that up for you, we will not interfere with your content at

2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:36.080
 all. We won't. And in my case, you can't say we need to show a month because that ain't happening,

2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:41.360
 right? So I mean, everybody's, everybody's design is different, right? So it doesn't, you know,

2:50:41.360 --> 2:50:48.560
 there's not one size fits all. But I guess as a longtime pirate podcaster, there are, you know,

2:50:48.560 --> 2:50:52.160
 we've been looking to partner with people, but nobody's right for us to partner with. I mean,

2:50:52.160 --> 2:50:58.960
 so, so I'm always looking for ways to take that side of it off my plate, because I'm not interested

2:50:58.960 --> 2:51:03.680
 in that side. All I want to do is the shows. And the, you know, it's really at this point,

2:51:04.480 --> 2:51:08.160
 you shouldn't call yourself an artist because some, you know, that's something to be decided by

2:51:08.160 --> 2:51:14.880
 other. But I mean, we're trying to do art. And there's something very satisfying in that.

2:51:14.880 --> 2:51:20.160
 But the part that I can't stand is the, the increasing amount of time, the monetization

2:51:20.160 --> 2:51:25.440
 question takes upon us. And so there's a case to be made, I guess is what I'm saying,

2:51:26.320 --> 2:51:33.120
 that if a partnership with some outside firm enhances your ability to do the art without

2:51:33.120 --> 2:51:38.480
 disenhancing your ability to do the art, it's, the word I'm looking for here is it's,

2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:48.720
 it's, it's enticing. I don't like big companies. So I'm afraid of whatever strings might come with

2:51:48.720 --> 2:51:53.440
 that. And if I'm Joe Rogan, and I'm talking about subjects that can make company public

2:51:53.440 --> 2:51:58.160
 companies, you know, a little nervous, I would certainly be careful. But at the same time,

2:51:58.800 --> 2:52:05.280
 people who are not in this game don't understand the problems that literally, I mean, just all

2:52:05.280 --> 2:52:09.280
 the operating systems, all the pod catchers, every time some new pod catcher comes out,

2:52:09.280 --> 2:52:13.440
 makes it easier to get the podcast, that's something we have to account for on the back end.

2:52:14.080 --> 2:52:20.800
 And I'm not exactly the technological wizard of all time. So I think it is maybe, maybe the

2:52:20.800 --> 2:52:26.720
 short answer is, is that as the medium develops, it's becoming something that you have to consider,

2:52:26.720 --> 2:52:31.520
 not because you want to sell out, but because you want to keep going. And it's becoming harder

2:52:31.520 --> 2:52:37.680
 and harder to be pirate like in this environment. The thing that convinced me, especially inside

2:52:37.680 --> 2:52:45.840
 Spotify, is that they understand. So if you walk into this whole thing with some skepticism,

2:52:45.840 --> 2:52:52.480
 as you're saying, of big companies, then then it works because Spotify understands the magic that

2:52:52.480 --> 2:53:00.160
 makes podcasting, or they appear to in part, at least they understand enough to respect Joe Rogan.

2:53:00.160 --> 2:53:05.120
 And despite what, I don't know if you, so there's the internet and there's people with opinions on

2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:13.200
 the internet. Really? Yes. And they have opinions about Joe and Spotify. But the reality is,

2:53:13.920 --> 2:53:19.440
 there's two things in private conversation with Joe. And in general, there's two important things.

2:53:19.440 --> 2:53:25.760
 One, Spotify literally doesn't tell Joe anything. Like all the people that think that Spotify is

2:53:25.760 --> 2:53:30.400
 somehow pushing Joe in this direction or that. It's a contractual. Did he insist upon that?

2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:35.920
 It's in the contract. But also, companies have a way of even with the contract. They sure do.

2:53:35.920 --> 2:53:41.280
 To be marketing people. Hey, I know we're not forcing you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I hate that. Yeah.

2:53:41.280 --> 2:53:47.360
 But Joe, what you and Joe are the same, and Spotify is smart enough not to send a single email

2:53:47.360 --> 2:53:53.280
 of that kind. That's really smart. And they leave them be. There is meetings inside Spotify that

2:53:53.280 --> 2:53:58.560
 like people read about those people complain. But those meetings never reach Joe. That never,

2:53:58.560 --> 2:54:05.360
 that's like company stuff. And the idea that Spotify is different than Pirate Radio. The

2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:11.600
 difficult thing about podcasting is nobody gives a damn about your podcast. You're alone in this.

2:54:11.600 --> 2:54:16.400
 I mean, there's fans and stuff, but nobody nobody's looking out for you. Yeah. And the nice thing

2:54:16.400 --> 2:54:23.840
 about Spotify is they want Joe's podcast to succeed even more. That's what Joe talked about

2:54:23.840 --> 2:54:28.960
 is that's the difference between YouTube and Spotify. Spotify wants to be the Netflix of

2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:37.040
 podcasting. And what Netflix does is they don't want to control you in any way,

2:54:37.040 --> 2:54:40.960
 but they want to create a platform where you can flourish even more.

2:54:40.960 --> 2:54:42.240
 But your interests are aligned.

2:54:42.240 --> 2:54:46.880
 Interests are aligned. So let me bring up something that let's make a distinction because

2:54:46.880 --> 2:54:52.640
 not all companies who do this are the same. And you brought up YouTube and Spotify. But to me,

2:54:52.640 --> 2:54:58.160
 YouTube is at least more like Spotify than some of these smaller. The term is walled garden,

2:54:58.160 --> 2:55:04.080
 right? You've heard the term walled garden. Okay. So I've been around podcasting so long now that

2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:09.360
 I've seen rounds of consolidation over the years and they come in waves. And all of a sudden,

2:55:09.360 --> 2:55:14.640
 so you'll get, and I'm not going to mention any names, but up until recently, the consolidation

2:55:14.640 --> 2:55:20.160
 was happening with relatively small firms compared to people like Spotify. And the problem was is

2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:26.640
 that by deciding to consolidate your materials in a walled garden, you are walling yourself off from

2:55:26.640 --> 2:55:31.200
 audience, right? So your choice is I'm going to accept this amount of money from this company,

2:55:31.200 --> 2:55:35.520
 but the loss is going to be a large chunk of my audience. And that's a catch 22 because

2:55:35.520 --> 2:55:40.000
 you're negotiating power with that company is based on your audience size. So signing up with

2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:45.920
 them diminishes your audience size, you lose negotiating power. But when you get to the level

2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:51.360
 of the Spotify to just pick them out, there's other players, but you brought up Spotify specifically,

2:55:51.360 --> 2:55:59.280
 these are people who can potentially, potentially enhance your audience over time. And so the risk

2:55:59.280 --> 2:56:05.680
 to you is lower because if you decide in a year or two, whatever the licensing agreements term is,

2:56:05.680 --> 2:56:09.920
 that you're done with them and you want to leave, instead of how you would have been with some of

2:56:09.920 --> 2:56:14.640
 these smaller walled gardens where you're walking away with a fraction of the audience you walked

2:56:14.640 --> 2:56:20.080
 in with, you have the potential to walk out with whatever you got in the original deal plus a

2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:25.760
 larger audience because their algorithms and everything are designed to push people to your

2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:33.040
 content if they think you'd like. So it takes away some of the downside risk which which alleviates

2:56:33.040 --> 2:56:36.960
 and if you can write an agreement like Joe Rogan, I mean where you've protected your

2:56:36.960 --> 2:56:41.600
 freedom to put the content out the way you want. So and if some of the downside risk is mitigated

2:56:42.160 --> 2:56:47.520
 and if you eliminate the problem of trying to monetize and stay up with the latest tech,

2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:51.840
 then it might be worth it. I'm scared of things like that, but at the same time,

2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:57.760
 I'm trying to not be an idiot about it and I can be an idiot about it. And when you've been doing

2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:04.000
 it as independently for as long as I have, the inertia of that has a force all its own.

2:57:04.560 --> 2:57:12.240
 But I'm inhibited enough in what I'm trying to do on this other end that it's opened me at least

2:57:12.240 --> 2:57:19.680
 to listening to people. But listen, at the same time, I love my audience and it sounds like a

2:57:19.680 --> 2:57:26.320
 cliche, but they're literally the reason I'm here. So I want to make sure that whatever I do, if I

2:57:26.320 --> 2:57:32.480
 can, is in keeping with a relationship that I've developed with these people over 15 years.

2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:38.000
 But like you said, no matter what you do, you are good because see, here's the thing,

2:57:38.000 --> 2:57:41.600
 if you don't sign up with one of those companies to make it easier for them to get your stuff on

2:57:41.600 --> 2:57:47.920
 this hand, they might yell at you for how difficult it is because the new operating system just updated

2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:52.080
 and you just, I can't get your stuff. So either way, you're opening yourself up to ridicule at

2:57:52.080 --> 2:57:57.040
 this point, all of that makes it easier to go, well, if the right deal came along and weren't

2:57:57.040 --> 2:58:00.800
 screwing me and they weren't screwing my audience and blah, blah, blah. You know, I mean, again,

2:58:00.800 --> 2:58:04.800
 in this business, when you're talking about cutting edge technology that is ever changing,

2:58:04.800 --> 2:58:10.560
 and as you said, a million podcasts and growing, I think you have to try to maintain flexibility.

2:58:10.560 --> 2:58:16.560
 And especially if they can mitigate the downside risk, I think you have to, I think you'd be an

2:58:16.560 --> 2:58:21.920
 idiot to not at least try to stay up on the current trends. And look, I'm watching Joe,

2:58:21.920 --> 2:58:26.560
 I'm going, okay, let's see how it goes for Joe. I mean, if he's like, ah, this is terrible,

2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:31.120
 I'm getting out of this, you go, okay, those people are off. So Joe's put himself out as a

2:58:31.120 --> 2:58:35.840
 guinea pig and the rest of us, guinea pigs appreciate it. As a huge, as a fan of your

2:58:35.840 --> 2:58:43.040
 show and as a fan of Netflix, the people there, I think I can speak for like millions of people

2:58:43.040 --> 2:58:48.720
 in hope that the hardcore history comes to Netflix or if Spotify becomes the Netflix,

2:58:48.720 --> 2:58:53.920
 the podcast and then just Spotify, there's something at its best that they bring out the,

2:58:54.800 --> 2:59:00.080
 you said artists. So I can say it is they bring out the best out of the artists. They,

2:59:00.080 --> 2:59:09.760
 they remove some of the headache and somehow like they put at their best, Netflix, for example,

2:59:09.760 --> 2:59:16.000
 is able to enforce and find the, the beauty and the power in the creations that you make,

2:59:16.000 --> 2:59:21.840
 even better than you. Like they don't interfere with the creations, but they somehow,

2:59:22.640 --> 2:59:26.480
 it's a branding thing, probably to interfering would be, that would be a no go from that.

2:59:26.480 --> 2:59:30.880
 That's right. Absolutely. That can't have, but that's why Netflix is masterful. They,

2:59:30.880 --> 2:59:36.080
 they seem to not interfere with the talent as opposed to I could throw other people under the

2:59:36.080 --> 2:59:40.560
 bus. There's a lot of places under the bus that could be thrown. Absolutely. So I would love,

2:59:40.560 --> 2:59:45.520
 I know there's probably people screaming yes right now in terms of hardcore history on Netflix would

2:59:45.520 --> 2:59:54.480
 be awesome. And I don't love asking this question, but it's asked probably the most popular question

2:59:55.440 --> 3:00:00.400
 that's unanswerable. So let me try to ask it in a way that you would actually answer it,

3:00:00.400 --> 3:00:06.560
 which is, of course, you said you don't release shows very often. And the question is,

3:00:07.120 --> 3:00:11.520
 the requests and the questions is, well, can you tell Dan to do one on the civil war?

3:00:11.520 --> 3:00:15.840
 Can you tell Dan to do one on the pulling bottom part? Can you, can you tell them to do one,

3:00:15.840 --> 3:00:19.920
 you know, every, every topic and you've spoken to this, actually your answer about the civil war

3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:23.520
 is quite interesting. I didn't know you knew what my answer about the civil war was.

3:00:23.520 --> 3:00:29.280
 That, that you don't, as a military historian, you enjoy in particular when there is differences

3:00:29.280 --> 3:00:35.600
 in the armies as opposed to contrasts with the civil war, which like blew my mind when I heard

3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:41.280
 you say is, you know, it's, there's not an interesting, a deep intricate contrast between

3:00:41.280 --> 3:00:45.200
 the two opposing sides. It's like the Roman civil wars where it's legionary against legionary. Yeah.

3:00:45.200 --> 3:00:50.720
 Is, and you've also said that you kind of, the shows you work on are ones where you have some

3:00:50.720 --> 3:00:57.280
 roots of fundamental understanding about that period. And, and so like when you work on a show,

3:00:57.280 --> 3:01:02.800
 it's basically like pulling at those strings further and like refreshing your mind and learning

3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:06.400
 what is really done. Definitely done the research. Wow. These are like words out of my mouth. Yeah,

3:01:06.400 --> 3:01:14.000
 you're right. And so, but is there something like, like shower thoughts on Reddit? Is there

3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:20.560
 some ideas that are like lingering in your head about possible future episodes? Is there things

3:01:20.560 --> 3:01:28.000
 that, whether you not committing to anything, but whether you're going to do it or not? Is there

3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:33.920
 something that's like makes you think, hmm, that would be interesting to, to pull at that thread

3:01:33.920 --> 3:01:40.480
 a little bit? Oh, yeah. We have things we keep in our back pocket for later. So blueprint for

3:01:40.480 --> 3:01:45.040
 Armageddon, the First World War series we did, that was in my back pocket the whole time. And

3:01:45.040 --> 3:01:50.240
 when the centennial of the war happened, it just seemed to be the likely time to bring out what was

3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:54.720
 that was a hell of a series. That's probably one of my favorite series. My rear end, man. I have

3:01:54.720 --> 3:01:59.200
 to tell you. Psychologically, you mean? Well, just, you know, when you get to these, I think,

3:01:59.200 --> 3:02:04.480
 I'm guessing here, I think it's 26 hours, all pieces together. Think about, and, and we don't

3:02:04.480 --> 3:02:10.880
 do scripts. It's improvised. Yeah. So think about what I had somebody write on Twitter just yesterday

3:02:10.880 --> 3:02:16.320
 saying, he said something like, I'm not seeing the dedication here. You're only getting 2.5 shows

3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:22.400
 out a year. And I wanted to say, man, you have no idea what the only people who understand really

3:02:22.400 --> 3:02:28.320
 are other history podcasters. And even they don't generally do 26 hours. You know, that was a two

3:02:28.320 --> 3:02:32.800
 year endeavor. As I said, the first show we ever did was like 15 minutes, I could crank out one of

3:02:32.800 --> 3:02:37.440
 those a month. But when you're doing, I mean, the last show we did on the fall of the Roman Republic

3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:43.360
 was five and a half hours. That's a book, right? And it was part six or something. So I mean,

3:02:43.360 --> 3:02:48.560
 you just do the math. And it felt like you were sorry to interrupt. And on World War One,

3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:55.520
 it felt like you were emotionally pulled in to it. Like it felt taxing. I was gonna say,

3:02:55.520 --> 3:02:58.800
 if that's a good thing, though, because that, you know, and I think we said during the show,

3:02:58.800 --> 3:03:03.280
 that was the feeling that the people at the time have. And I think at one point we said,

3:03:03.280 --> 3:03:10.000
 if this is starting to seem gruesomely repetitive, now you know how the people at the time felt.

3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:14.560
 So in other words, that had any sort of inadvertently, because when you improvise a show,

3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:19.520
 some of these things are inadvertent, but it had inadvertently created the right climate

3:03:20.240 --> 3:03:26.400
 for having a sense of empathy with the storyline. And to me, that those are the serendipitous

3:03:26.400 --> 3:03:32.160
 moments that make this art and not some sort of paint by the numbers kind of endeavor, you know?

3:03:32.160 --> 3:03:36.240
 And that's to me, that wouldn't have happened had we scripted it out.

3:03:36.240 --> 3:03:41.440
 So it's mostly you just bring the tools of knowledge to the table and then

3:03:42.720 --> 3:03:45.280
 in large part improvise like the actual wording.

3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:49.520
 I always say we make it like they made things like spinal tap and some of those other things where

3:03:50.320 --> 3:03:55.440
 the material, so I do have notes about things like on page 427 of this book, you have this quote,

3:03:55.440 --> 3:04:00.240
 so that I know, aha, I'm at the point where I can drop that in. And sometimes I'll write notes

3:04:00.240 --> 3:04:05.520
 saying, here's where you left off yesterday. So I remember. But in the improvisation,

3:04:05.520 --> 3:04:10.720
 you end up throwing a lot out. And so like, but it allows us to go off on tangents, like we'll

3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:14.960
 try things like I'll sit there and go, I wonder what this would sound like. And I'll spend two

3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:19.280
 days going down that road and then I'll listen to him and go, doesn't work. But that's, you know,

3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:23.200
 like writers do this all the time, it's called killing your babies, right? You got can't, you

3:04:23.200 --> 3:04:27.600
 know, but people go so this guy goes, I'm not seeing the dedication. He has no idea how many

3:04:27.600 --> 3:04:32.480
 things were thrown out. I did an hour and a half. I had an hour and a half into the current show

3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:37.200
 about two months ago. And I listened to it and I just went, you know what, it's not right. Boom,

3:04:37.200 --> 3:04:42.800
 out the window, there goes six weeks of work. Yeah. Right. But here's the problem. You trust

3:04:42.800 --> 3:04:49.600
 your science intro. Do you trust your judgment on that? No. No. But but here's here's the here's

3:04:49.600 --> 3:04:55.760
 the thing. Our show is a little different than other people's Joe Rogan called it evergreen

3:04:55.760 --> 3:05:00.880
 content. In other words, my political show is like a car you buy. And the minute you drive it off the

3:05:00.880 --> 3:05:06.480
 lot, it loses half its value, right? Because it's not current anymore. These shows are just as good

3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:10.960
 or just as bad five years from now as they are when we do, although the standards on the internet

3:05:10.960 --> 3:05:14.560
 change. So when I listen to my old shows, I cringe sometimes because the standards are so much higher

3:05:14.560 --> 3:05:20.480
 now. But when you're creating evergreen content, you have two audiences to worry about. You have

3:05:20.480 --> 3:05:23.840
 the audience that's waiting for the next show and they've already heard the other ones and they're

3:05:23.840 --> 3:05:27.760
 impatient and they're telling you on Twitter, where is it? But you have show the shows also for

3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:32.320
 people five years from now who haven't discovered it yet and who don't care a wint for how long it

3:05:32.320 --> 3:05:36.800
 took because they're going to be able to download the whole and all they care about is quality.

3:05:36.800 --> 3:05:41.600
 And so what I always tell new podcasters is they always say, I read all these things, they say,

3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:45.680
 it's very important you have a schedule, a release schedule. Well, it's not more important than putting

3:05:45.680 --> 3:05:52.560
 out a good piece of work. And the audience will forgive me if it takes too long, but it's really

3:05:52.560 --> 3:05:57.200
 good when you get it. They will not forgive me if I rush it to get it out on time and it's a piece

3:05:57.200 --> 3:06:02.320
 of crap. So for us, and this is why when you brought up a Spotify dealer or anything else,

3:06:02.320 --> 3:06:08.000
 they can't interfere with this at all. Because my job here as far as I'm concerned is quality

3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:12.320
 and everything else goes by the wayside. Because the only thing people care about long term,

3:06:12.320 --> 3:06:16.800
 the only thing that gives you longevity is how good is it, right? How good is that book? If you

3:06:16.800 --> 3:06:21.280
 read J.R.R. Tolkien's work tomorrow, you don't care how long it took him to write it, all you

3:06:21.280 --> 3:06:25.360
 care is how good is it today. And that's what we try to think too. And I feel like if it's good,

3:06:25.360 --> 3:06:29.360
 if it's really good, everything else falls into place and takes care of itself.

3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:32.880
 Although sometimes to push back, sorry to interrupt.

3:06:32.880 --> 3:06:36.080
 No, no, I've done it to you a thousand times so you can get me back, please.

3:06:36.080 --> 3:06:42.160
 Sometimes the deadline, you know, some of the greatest like movies and books have been,

3:06:42.160 --> 3:06:45.840
 you think about like Dusty Yeske, I forget which one, knows from Underground or something,

3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:51.040
 he needed the money, so he had to write it real quick. Sometimes the deadline creates

3:06:51.040 --> 3:06:59.360
 is powerful at taking a creative mind of an artist and just like slapping it around

3:06:59.360 --> 3:07:03.040
 to force some of the good stuff out. Now, the problem with history, of course, is there's

3:07:03.840 --> 3:07:08.960
 different definitions of good that like, it's not just about what you talk about,

3:07:08.960 --> 3:07:13.280
 which is the storytelling, the richness of the storytelling. And I'm sure you're, you know,

3:07:13.840 --> 3:07:17.600
 again, not to compliment you too much, but you're one of the great storytellers of our time.

3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:24.160
 That, I'm sure if you put in a jail cell and forced at a, like somebody pointed a gun at you,

3:07:24.160 --> 3:07:30.560
 you could tell one hell of a good story, but you still need the facts of history or not necessarily

3:07:30.560 --> 3:07:36.880
 the facts, but you know, like making sure you painting the right full picture, not perfectly

3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:39.760
 right. That's what I meant about the audience doesn't understand what a history podcast is,

3:07:39.760 --> 3:07:46.400
 you can't just riff and be wrong. So let me both oppose what you just said and back up what you

3:07:46.400 --> 3:07:52.080
 just said. So I have a book that I wrote, right? And in a book, you have a hard deadline, right?

3:07:52.080 --> 3:07:57.680
 So Harper Collins had a hard deadline on that book. So when I released it, I was mad because

3:07:57.680 --> 3:08:03.120
 I would have worked on it a lot longer, which is my style, right? Get it right. But we had a

3:08:03.120 --> 3:08:09.120
 chapter in that book entitled pandemic prologue, question mark, and it was the book about the

3:08:09.120 --> 3:08:15.120
 part about the black death and the 1918 flu and all that kind of stuff. And I was just doing an

3:08:15.120 --> 3:08:19.520
 interview with a Spanish journalist this morning who said, did you ever think how lucky you got

3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:25.760
 on that on that, you know, and first of all, lucky on a pandemic, it strikes you. But had I had my

3:08:25.760 --> 3:08:33.360
 druthers, I would have kept that book working in my study for months more. And the pandemic would

3:08:33.360 --> 3:08:37.680
 have happened. And that episode that would have looked like a chapter I wrote after the fact,

3:08:37.680 --> 3:08:42.560
 I would have had to rewrite the whole thing, it would have been so that argues for what you said

3:08:42.560 --> 3:08:47.440
 at the same time, I would have spent months more working on it because to me, it didn't look the

3:08:47.440 --> 3:08:52.800
 way I wanted it to look yet, you know? Can you drop a hint of the things that you're keeping on the

3:08:52.800 --> 3:08:58.000
 shelves? Oh, the Alexander the Great. I've talked around it. I talked to somebody the other day,

3:08:58.000 --> 3:09:03.040
 said, do you know that the very first word in your very first podcast, in the title, the very

3:09:03.040 --> 3:09:07.920
 first thing that anybody ever saw with hardcore history is the word Alexander. And because the

3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:13.040
 show is entitled Alexander versus Hitler, I have talked around the career I've done show after I

3:09:13.040 --> 3:09:18.400
 talked about his mother in one episode, I talked about the funeral games after his death, I've

3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:23.440
 talked around this, I've specifically left this giant Alexandrian size hole in the middle,

3:09:23.440 --> 3:09:27.920
 because we're going to do that show one day and I'm going to lovingly enjoy talking about this

3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:32.560
 crazily interesting figure of Alexander the Great. So that's one of the ones that's on the back pocket

3:09:32.560 --> 3:09:40.240
 list. And what we try to do is whenever we're doing a Second World War in Asia and the Pacific

3:09:40.240 --> 3:09:45.600
 now, I'm on part five, whenever the heck we finish this, the tendency is to then pick a very different

3:09:45.600 --> 3:09:52.320
 period because we've had it and the audience has had it. So I will eventually get to the Alexander

3:09:52.320 --> 3:09:59.040
 saga. What about just one last kind of little part of this is what about the other half of that

3:09:59.040 --> 3:10:04.880
 first 10 minute 15 minute episode, which is so you've done quite a bit about the World War,

3:10:04.880 --> 3:10:11.440
 you've done quite a bit about Germany. Will you ever think about doing Hitler and the man?

3:10:12.240 --> 3:10:16.480
 It's funny because I talked earlier about how I don't like to go back to the old shows because

3:10:16.480 --> 3:10:22.000
 our standards have changed so much. Well, a long time ago, one of my standards for not getting

3:10:22.000 --> 3:10:29.600
 five hour podcasts done or not getting too deeply into them was to flip around the interesting

3:10:29.600 --> 3:10:34.560
 points. We didn't realize we were going to get an audience that wanted the actual history. We

3:10:34.560 --> 3:10:39.040
 thought we could just go with assume the audience knew the details and just talk about the weird

3:10:39.040 --> 3:10:44.960
 stuff that only makes up one part of the show now. So we did a show called Nazi tidbits. And it was

3:10:44.960 --> 3:10:48.880
 just little things about, you know, it's totally out of date now. Like, you know, you can still buy

3:10:48.880 --> 3:10:54.800
 them, but they're out of date. Where we dealt a little with it, you know, it would be interesting.

3:10:54.800 --> 3:11:00.000
 But I'll give you another example. I mean, history is not stagnant, as you know. And we had talked

3:11:00.000 --> 3:11:05.600
 about Stalin earlier. And Ghost of the Osfront was done years ago. And people will write me from

3:11:05.600 --> 3:11:12.480
 Russia now and say, well, your portrayal of Stalin is totally out of, it's outdated, because there's

3:11:12.480 --> 3:11:16.560
 all this new stuff from the former Soviet Union. And you do, you turn around and you go, okay,

3:11:16.560 --> 3:11:23.520
 they're right. And so when you talk about Hitler, it's very interesting to think about how I would

3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:28.480
 do a Hitler show today versus how I did one 10 years ago. And you would think, well, what's new?

3:11:28.480 --> 3:11:31.680
 I mean, it happened so long, but there's lots of new stuff. And there's lots of new scholarship.

3:11:31.680 --> 3:11:37.200
 And so, yeah, I would think that would be an interesting one to do someday. I haven't thought

3:11:37.200 --> 3:11:40.640
 about that. That's done in the back pocket. But yeah, that'd be interesting.

3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:46.640
 I have a disproportionate amount of power because I'd trapped you somehow in a room and thereby

3:11:46.640 --> 3:11:53.120
 during a pandemic. So you'd like my hope will be stuck in your head. But after Alexander the Great,

3:11:53.120 --> 3:12:00.880
 which would be an amazing podcast, I hope you do give a return to Hitler, the rise and fall of

3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:08.960
 the Third Reich, which to me, I really contemporary book, basically. Yeah. And I exactly as by a

3:12:08.960 --> 3:12:18.240
 person who was there, I really loved that study of the man of Hitler. And I would love to hear

3:12:18.240 --> 3:12:23.840
 your study of certain aspects of it. And perhaps even an episode that's like more focused on a

3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:31.440
 very particular period. I just feel like you can tell a story that it's funny. Hitler is one of the

3:12:31.440 --> 3:12:37.840
 most studied people. And I still feel like all the stories or most of the stories haven't been told.

3:12:37.840 --> 3:12:41.920
 Oh, and there's, listen, I've got three books at home. I'm on all the publishers lists now. And

3:12:41.920 --> 3:12:45.760
 they just, young Hitler, there's this Hitler, there's that. I mean, I've been reading these

3:12:45.760 --> 3:12:49.280
 books and I've read about Hitler. I read the rise and fall of the Third Reich. My mother thought

3:12:49.280 --> 3:12:54.480
 I needed to go to a psychologist because I read it when I was six. And she said, there's something

3:12:54.480 --> 3:13:01.280
 wrong with the boy. And but she was right. She was absolutely right. But you would think that

3:13:01.280 --> 3:13:05.920
 something like that is pretty established fact. And yet there's new stuff coming out all the

3:13:05.920 --> 3:13:10.880
 time. And needless to say, Germany's been investigating this guy forever. And sometimes

3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:16.000
 it takes years to get the translations. I took five years of German in school. I can't read

3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:23.680
 any of it. And he is, when you talk about fascinating figures, he's so, the whole thing is

3:13:23.680 --> 3:13:29.600
 so twistedly weird. There was a, it came out a couple of years ago, somebody found a tape of

3:13:29.600 --> 3:13:35.760
 him talking to General, I want to say it was General, the Finnish General, Mannerheim, right?

3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:41.520
 And he's just in a very normal conversation of the sort we're having now. And, you know, the

3:13:41.520 --> 3:13:45.840
 Hitler tapes, when you hear him normally, he's ranting and waving. But this was a very sedate.

3:13:45.840 --> 3:13:49.520
 And I wish I'd understood the German well enough to really get a feel because I was reading

3:13:50.160 --> 3:13:55.440
 what Germans said. And they say, wow, you can really hear the Southern accent, you know,

3:13:55.440 --> 3:14:00.160
 little things that only a native speaker would hear. And I remember thinking, this is such a

3:14:00.160 --> 3:14:04.960
 different side of this twisted character. And you would think you would always, you would think

3:14:04.960 --> 3:14:09.600
 that this was information that was out in the rise and fall of the Third Reich, but it wasn't.

3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:15.440
 And so this goes along with that stuff about new stuff coming out all the time. Alexander,

3:14:15.440 --> 3:14:20.080
 new stuff coming out all the time. Really? Well, at least interpretations rather than factual data.

3:14:20.080 --> 3:14:23.280
 And those color, those give depth to your understanding.

3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:28.960
 Yes. And you want that because the historiography, people love that. And that was a byproduct of

3:14:28.960 --> 3:14:34.720
 my lack of credentials, where we thought we're going to bring in the historians and we call them

3:14:34.720 --> 3:14:39.600
 audio footnotes right away for me to say, listen, I'm not a historian, but I'll quote this guy who

3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:44.640
 is so you can trust him. But then we would quote other people who had different views and people

3:14:44.640 --> 3:14:49.200
 didn't realize that, you know, if they're not history majors, that historians don't always agree

3:14:49.200 --> 3:14:54.640
 on this stuff and that they have disagreements and they love that. So I love the fact that

3:14:54.640 --> 3:14:59.120
 there's more stuff out there because it allows us to then bring in other points of view and sort of

3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:04.960
 maybe three dimensionalize or flesh out the story a little bit more. Two last questions,

3:15:04.960 --> 3:15:12.400
 one really simple, one absurdly ridiculous and perhaps also simple. First, who has been in this

3:15:12.400 --> 3:15:19.120
 year real? I don't even know what you're talking about. Very well. How's that for an answer?

3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:24.400
 It's like asking me, is Harvey the white rabbit real? I don't know. There's carrots all around

3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:29.280
 the production room, but I don't know what that means. Well, a lot of people demanded that I prove,

3:15:30.000 --> 3:15:35.120
 I somehow figure out a way to prove the existence. If I said he was real, people would say no, he's

3:15:35.120 --> 3:15:40.080
 not. And if I said he was, if he wasn't real, they would say yes, he is. So it's a Santa Claus

3:15:40.080 --> 3:15:46.240
 Easter Bunny kind of vibe there. Yeah. I mean, what is real anyway? That's exactly what I told him

3:15:46.240 --> 3:15:53.040
 it exists. Okay. The most absurd question. I'm very sorry. Very sorry, but then again, I'm not.

3:15:54.160 --> 3:16:00.240
 What's the meaning of it all? You study history of human history.

3:16:02.960 --> 3:16:08.560
 Have you been able to make sense of why the hell we're here on this spinning rock? Does

3:16:08.560 --> 3:16:15.840
 any of it even make sense? What's the meaning of life? What I look at sometimes that I find

3:16:15.840 --> 3:16:22.000
 interesting is certain consistencies that we have over time. History doesn't repeat,

3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:30.240
 but it has a constant. And the constant is us. Now, we change. I mentioned earlier the wickedly

3:16:30.240 --> 3:16:34.560
 weird time we live in with what social media is doing to us is guinea pigs. And that's a new element.

3:16:34.560 --> 3:16:42.480
 But we're still people who are motivated by love, hate, greed, envy, sex. I mean, all these things

3:16:42.480 --> 3:16:47.440
 that would have connected us with the ancients, right? That's the part that always makes history

3:16:47.440 --> 3:16:55.760
 sound like it rhymes. And when you put the constant, the human element, and you mix it with

3:16:55.760 --> 3:16:59.840
 systems that are similar. So one of the reasons that the ancient Roman Republic is something

3:16:59.840 --> 3:17:05.360
 that people point to all the time as something that seems like we're repeating history is because

3:17:05.360 --> 3:17:12.160
 you have humans, just like you had then, and you have a system that resembles the one we have here.

3:17:12.160 --> 3:17:17.200
 So you throw the constant in with a system that is somewhat similar, and you begin to see things

3:17:17.200 --> 3:17:23.440
 that look like they rhyme a little. So for me, I'm always trying to figure out more about us.

3:17:23.440 --> 3:17:31.360
 And when you show us in 500 years ago in Asia, and 800 years ago in Africa, and you look at all

3:17:31.360 --> 3:17:37.040
 these different places that you put the guinea pig in, and you watch how the guinea pig responds

3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:44.880
 to the different stimuli and challenges, I feel like it helps me flesh out a little bit more

3:17:44.880 --> 3:17:50.880
 who we are in the long timeline, not who we are today specifically, but who we've always been.

3:17:50.880 --> 3:17:57.280
 It's a personal quest. It's not meant to educate anybody else. It's something that fascinates me.

3:17:57.280 --> 3:18:02.400
 Do you think there's, in that common humanity throughout history of the guinea pig,

3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:09.040
 is there a why underneath it all? Or is it somehow like it feels like it's an experiment of some

3:18:09.040 --> 3:18:14.480
 sort? Oh, now you're into, Elon Musk and I talked about this, the simulation thing, right? Nick

3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:19.920
 Bostrom's, yeah, the idea that there's some kid and we're the equivalent of an alien's ant farm,

3:18:19.920 --> 3:18:24.000
 you know? And we hope he doesn't throw a tarantula in just to see what happens.

3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:33.280
 I think the whys elude us. And I think that what makes philosophy and religion and those

3:18:33.280 --> 3:18:41.520
 sorts of things so interesting is that they grapple with the whys. But I'm not wise enough to

3:18:41.520 --> 3:18:48.640
 to propose a theory myself, but I'm interested enough to read all the other ones out there. So

3:18:50.720 --> 3:18:54.480
 let's put it this way. I don't think there's any definitive why that's been agreed upon,

3:18:54.480 --> 3:18:59.840
 but the various theories are fascinating. Yeah, whatever it is, whoever the kid is that created

3:18:59.840 --> 3:19:08.960
 this thing, the ant farm is kind of interesting. So far, a little bit twisted and perverted and

3:19:08.960 --> 3:19:13.840
 sadistic maybe. That's what makes it fun, I think. But then again, that's the Russian perspective.

3:19:13.840 --> 3:19:18.480
 I was just going to say, it is the Russian perspective.

3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:23.680
 A little bit. That's what makes the Russian, so Russian history, one day I'll do some Russian

3:19:23.680 --> 3:19:29.920
 history, I took it to college. Oh, that's the ant farm, baby. That's an ant farm with a very,

3:19:29.920 --> 3:19:38.880
 very frustrated young teenage alien kid. Dan, I can't say I've already complimented you way too

3:19:38.880 --> 3:19:45.920
 much. I'm a huge fan. This has been an incredible conversation. It's a huge gift. Your gift of

3:19:45.920 --> 3:19:50.960
 humanity, I hope you... Oh, let me cut you off and just say you've done a wonderful job. This

3:19:50.960 --> 3:19:55.920
 has been fun for me. The questions and more importantly, the questions can come from anybody.

3:19:55.920 --> 3:19:59.440
 The counter statements, your responses have been wonderful. You made this a very

3:19:59.440 --> 3:20:04.000
 fun intellectual discussion for me. Thank you. Well, let me have the last word and say I agree

3:20:04.000 --> 3:20:10.960
 with Elon and despite the doom caster say that I think we've concluded definitively and you don't

3:20:10.960 --> 3:20:18.160
 get a chance to respond that love is in fact the answer and the way forward. So thanks so much, Dan.

3:20:18.160 --> 3:20:23.680
