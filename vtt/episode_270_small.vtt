00:00.000 --> 00:05.040
 The following is a conversation with Rabbi David Wolpe, someone who I have been a fan

00:05.040 --> 00:10.160
 of for many years, for the kindness in his heart, the strength of his character, and

00:10.160 --> 00:15.440
 the kind of friends he keeps and talks with, many of whom disagree with him but love him

00:15.440 --> 00:19.200
 nevertheless, including the late Christopher Hitchens.

00:20.240 --> 00:26.560
 I will have many conversations like these in the future about religion, about Islam, Christianity,

00:26.560 --> 00:32.160
 Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and others, looking to understand and celebrate the culture,

00:32.160 --> 00:35.840
 the tradition, and the beauty of the people who practice these religions.

00:36.480 --> 00:39.680
 I will of course not shy away from the difficult topics.

00:39.680 --> 00:44.960
 I will talk both about hate and love, about war and peace.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.120
 This conversation was recorded more than three weeks ago.

00:49.760 --> 00:53.600
 Please allow me this time to speak on what has been on my mind.

00:53.600 --> 00:58.240
 If this is not interesting to you, please skip, I totally understand.

00:59.680 --> 01:02.880
 Some people asked me to say a few words on the war in Ukraine.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.000
 I think my words are worth little, but perhaps let me try.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.560
 I consider doing a long solo episode on this war.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.720
 I tried several times, but it is too personal for now.

01:17.840 --> 01:22.400
 To give you context, I have been talking to refugees, friends, loved ones,

01:22.400 --> 01:26.800
 in Ukraine, in Russia, in Poland, Slovakia, Moldova, Romania,

01:26.800 --> 01:32.000
 even UK, Germany, Canada, India, China, and of course the United States.

01:33.440 --> 01:38.960
 Some of them crying, or angry, or confused, or scared.

01:40.400 --> 01:45.360
 I am helping as best as I can privately, and I am hoping to help in the future

01:45.360 --> 01:50.000
 by traveling to Ukraine and Russia, and celebrating the humanity

01:50.000 --> 01:54.000
 and the beauty of the people in this region. This was all set up

01:54.000 --> 01:59.520
 both for Ukraine and Russia trips before 2022, including conversations

01:59.520 --> 02:05.840
 with scientists, artists, athletes, leaders, and just, quote, regular folks

02:06.720 --> 02:09.360
 who are equally, if not more, fascinating to me.

02:10.320 --> 02:14.640
 For now, it has become much more difficult, but I'll keep trying to find a way.

02:14.640 --> 02:21.040
 I was born in the Soviet Union. My roots are both Ukrainian and Russian.

02:21.840 --> 02:28.640
 And today, and until the day I die, I am an American. I am proud of all of this.

02:29.200 --> 02:32.400
 I hope to keep celebrating the culture and the incredible human beings

02:32.400 --> 02:35.200
 that make up these nations, and humanity as a whole.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.560
 We are all one people. We are in this together.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.240
 That's how I feel about the people of these nations.

02:42.240 --> 02:46.160
 Now, let me speak about those in the seats of power.

02:47.520 --> 02:53.120
 I condemn all actions of leaders who play geopolitical games on the world stage

02:53.120 --> 02:58.080
 disregarding the costs paid in human suffering on the scale of millions.

02:58.960 --> 03:03.440
 For this reason, I condemn Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.

03:04.720 --> 03:08.880
 And I condemn many of the military interventions

03:08.880 --> 03:15.680
 by the superpowers of the world, including by my country, the country I love, the United States.

03:16.480 --> 03:20.640
 That after World War II has intervened in over 40 nations,

03:20.640 --> 03:24.400
 with many studies finding that the United States is cupable

03:24.400 --> 03:27.120
 for an unfathomable number of civilian deaths.

03:28.320 --> 03:32.480
 I condemn all heads of state who needlessly wage wars,

03:33.280 --> 03:36.480
 watching young men and women burn in the fires they started.

03:36.480 --> 03:40.240
 I don't understand how humans can be so cruel to each other.

03:41.120 --> 03:46.800
 Or rather, I understand, but I believe in a future world where this is no longer true.

03:48.480 --> 03:52.320
 Let me also say a few words of what I hope to do with this podcast.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.240
 I want to explore the full complexity and beauty of human nature.

03:56.880 --> 04:00.320
 I believe each of us are capable of good and evil.

04:00.320 --> 04:04.160
 And I want to understand how the mind and the circumstance

04:04.160 --> 04:07.600
 lead one to choose the former path or the latter.

04:08.320 --> 04:12.320
 And I believe conversation is one of the best ways to work toward this understanding.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.920
 For that, I think I have to not only talk to the most inspiring humans in the world,

04:17.920 --> 04:19.680
 but also to the most controversial.

04:20.640 --> 04:23.280
 I will speak with many people who I disagree with.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.160
 Politicians, activists, CEOs, heads of state, with very different opinions on the world.

04:30.160 --> 04:34.880
 I will try hard to challenge their ideas without closing my mind

04:34.880 --> 04:39.120
 to the depth and complexity of their perspective and their humanity.

04:39.920 --> 04:45.600
 My presence in the same room with wildly different people will make it easy for the media

04:45.600 --> 04:50.320
 and the internet to pick and choose clips and snapshots attacking me for being

04:50.320 --> 04:52.400
 a shill for one side or the other.

04:53.120 --> 04:57.840
 I can't defend this point, except to say that I'm a shill for no one,

04:57.840 --> 05:00.960
 and that I hope you see the strength of my integrity,

05:00.960 --> 05:06.480
 that I won't be influenced by any of them, no matter how rich, powerful, or charismatic they are.

05:07.280 --> 05:10.080
 Like the poem If by Roger Kipling says,

05:10.720 --> 05:16.720
 If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings, nor lose the common touch.

05:16.720 --> 05:23.200
 If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none too much.

05:23.200 --> 05:27.680
 This is a really, really important thing to me that I try to live by,

05:27.680 --> 05:30.000
 that all human beings count with me the same.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.680
 People have criticized me for wanting to have some of these conversations,

05:33.680 --> 05:37.600
 like with Vladimir Putin and Vladimir Zelensky,

05:37.600 --> 05:42.960
 and for times in the past speaking about them without the seriousness the topic deserves.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.880
 For this, I would sincerely like to apologize.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.880
 I'm disappointed, even ashamed, of my frequent ineliquence

05:50.880 --> 05:54.080
 on these topics. I will work hard to do better.

05:54.080 --> 05:59.520
 When I'm joking, it should be clear that it's a joke, and hopefully actually funny.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.360
 When I'm being serious, I should speak with care and rigor.

06:04.320 --> 06:07.520
 I've now done many hundreds of hours of podcast conversation.

06:07.520 --> 06:11.840
 Despite my frequent failures and speaking, I hope you know where my heart is.

06:11.840 --> 06:16.960
 Unfortunately, I think people will take clips of me and use them to attack me.

06:16.960 --> 06:20.880
 This will happen more and more. I guess there's nothing I can do,

06:20.880 --> 06:26.240
 but send them my love, and in the meantime, try to be a better person and a better interviewer.

06:26.240 --> 06:31.440
 Let me also say that I like humor, especially dark humor.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.880
 I like being silly and not taking myself seriously.

06:34.880 --> 06:37.920
 I will keep taking risks with that.

06:37.920 --> 06:43.440
 All with the goal of having fun and celebrating humanity at its most absurd and most beautiful.

06:43.440 --> 06:49.520
 I will occasionally dress up in strange and weird outfits to celebrate the absurdity of life.

06:49.520 --> 06:53.360
 I will hang out, break bread and joke with all kinds of people.

06:53.360 --> 06:58.000
 I don't have to agree with them to laugh with them in order to escape for a brief moment

06:58.000 --> 07:00.880
 of tension, the conflict, the hatred in the world.

07:00.880 --> 07:06.320
 Humor just might save this little chaotic little civilization of ours.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.560
 I love the Ukrainian people.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.160
 I love the Ukrainian people.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.160
 I love the Russian people.

07:14.160 --> 07:22.160
 And of course, I love my fellow Americans, Californians and Midwesterners, New Yorkers and Texans.

07:22.160 --> 07:24.160
 I love humans. I love life.

07:24.160 --> 07:28.160
 And I want to share that love with others, with you.

07:28.160 --> 07:32.160
 If I mess it up, I'm really, really sorry. I'm trying my best.

07:32.160 --> 07:36.160
 I have no agenda and no one telling me what to do.

07:36.160 --> 07:40.160
 I feel like the luckiest guy in the world to have all these opportunities.

07:40.160 --> 07:46.160
 And I'm deeply grateful to be alive and to share that joy with other amazing people around me.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.160
 Thank you for your support.

07:48.160 --> 07:53.160
 For all the love you've sent my way, I will work my ass off to not disappoint you.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.160
 I love you all.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.160
 This is Alex Friedman podcast.

07:57.160 --> 08:01.160

08:01.160 --> 08:05.160
 And now, here's my conversation with David Wolpe.

08:05.160 --> 08:10.160
 Let's start with a big question. According to Judaism, who is God?

08:10.160 --> 08:17.160
 It's difficult because Judaism, like any tradition that is thousands of years old

08:17.160 --> 08:21.160
 and encompasses so many different lands and languages and thinkers,

08:21.160 --> 08:25.160
 it doesn't give a single answer to even simple questions.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.160
 And to large questions, it certainly doesn't give a single answer.

08:28.160 --> 08:33.160
 Although Judaism was responsible for introducing the monotheistic idea to the world,

08:33.160 --> 08:35.160
 it doesn't mean that it's one idea.

08:35.160 --> 08:42.160
 So if you take Maimonides, the greatest sage in the Jewish tradition, medieval philosopher,

08:42.160 --> 08:49.160
 he would say that God is an omnipotent, benevolent, intangible, unimaginable God.

08:49.160 --> 08:53.160
 In fact, he said you can't say what God is, only what God is not.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.160
 Because you have to emphasize, could talk more about that,

08:56.160 --> 09:00.160
 but basically you have to emphasize the unknowability of God.

09:00.160 --> 09:04.160
 You have a modern philosopher like Heschel, who says that God is a God of pathos,

09:04.160 --> 09:12.160
 a God of deep feeling, which probably would make Maimonides shiver if he heard such a description.

09:12.160 --> 09:18.160
 And if you look in the Bible, God is always regretting or having human emotions.

09:18.160 --> 09:22.160
 So there are so many different kinds of depictions and ideas.

09:22.160 --> 09:27.160
 And there is this tremendous tension between transcendence and imminence.

09:27.160 --> 09:33.160
 That is, in the Jewish tradition, God is exquisitely close, God is imminent.

09:33.160 --> 09:37.160
 In the Talmud's words, God is as close as your mouth is to your ear.

09:37.160 --> 09:40.160
 In other words, whatever you say, God hears it.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.160
 And yet at the same time, God is unfathomably distant.

09:44.160 --> 09:51.160
 Sometimes when I speak to high schoolers, I will say, in the Jewish tradition, think of it this way.

09:51.160 --> 09:56.160
 When you were two years old, you had no idea what it was to be a 15 year old.

09:56.160 --> 10:02.160
 Not only did you not know, but you didn't know what you didn't know.

10:02.160 --> 10:05.160
 We conceive of God as being more...

10:05.160 --> 10:10.160
 The distance between God and human beings is far greater than the distance between a two year old and a 15 year old.

10:10.160 --> 10:15.160
 So when we speak about God, we have to acknowledge how limited we really are.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.160
 So, okay, you laid out a lot of fascinating things on the table.

10:18.160 --> 10:29.160
 So one, the nobility of God, then this idea of deep feeling, which again, can God be operating in the space of feelings too.

10:29.160 --> 10:32.160
 So not just the mouth and the ear of the senses.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.160
 Can God be known?

10:35.160 --> 10:44.160
 Can God be felt by this three year old in the analogy versus the teenager?

10:44.160 --> 10:49.160
 So I will take refuge in a beautiful phrase by from Martin Buber, another Jewish theologian.

10:49.160 --> 10:51.160
 He said, God cannot be expressed.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.160
 God can only be addressed.

10:53.160 --> 10:56.160
 In other words, you can speak to God.

10:56.160 --> 11:01.160
 You can feel a sense of God, but can you begin to comprehend or know God?

11:01.160 --> 11:02.160
 No.

11:02.160 --> 11:06.160
 Josef Kospi, I'm pulling in a couple of early Jewish philosophers.

11:06.160 --> 11:11.160
 He said, to know God, I would have to be God.

11:11.160 --> 11:24.160
 Can we get close? Is it useful or is it a distraction to visualize things, to embody, to create, to attach to the stories, some kind of visualizations in our mind.

11:24.160 --> 11:31.160
 For example, gender, he versus she, things like this, or old man in the sky kind of feeling.

11:31.160 --> 11:36.160
 So it's almost inevitable, but I think ultimately you try to transcend it.

11:36.160 --> 11:42.160
 This was the great, you know, we just read this actually in synagogue, the story of the golden calf.

11:42.160 --> 11:57.160
 And the story is that human beings found it impossible to not have a visualization because they had just come from Egypt and in the world of pagan worship, everything.

11:57.160 --> 12:17.160
 It's not that pagans thought that idol was actually God, but it represented visually what God was and along comes this idea that God is actually not capable of being visualized, which is very difficult and it stretches the bounds of human comprehension, maybe even breaks them.

12:17.160 --> 12:31.160
 So would you say the proper way to operate as a human in relation to God is humility in that you're screwed, you're not able to basically know anything, almost anything?

12:31.160 --> 12:43.160
 Well, the reason that you're the salvation of this is that you can't, I was going to say the reason you're not screwed, but then I thought somebody might be upset at a rabbi saying that.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.160
 So I didn't say it and have not said it.

12:46.160 --> 12:55.160
 But the reason you're not is that you don't have to have a comprehension of God.

12:55.160 --> 12:59.160
 You have to have a relationship to God and those are not the same.

12:59.160 --> 13:10.160
 I mean, to draw an analogy that is not far from perfect as most analogies are, but this one especially, you have relationships with people who are mysteries to you.

13:10.160 --> 13:13.160
 You're a mystery to yourself.

13:13.160 --> 13:21.160
 You can live and love somebody for 50 years and they can say something that surprises you because ultimately we are trapped in here.

13:21.160 --> 13:35.160
 And when a child first says, I, we call that individuation, but what that really means is I now know that I am cut off from the minds of all other children and all other people.

13:35.160 --> 13:52.160
 And so you have with God a more intimate relationship because you can believe that God is, you are known by God and you have a relationship to God despite the fact that you can't know God just as you can't know others.

13:52.160 --> 13:57.160
 And some would say to have a good relationship, you want to be constantly surprised.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.160
 Right.

13:58.160 --> 13:59.160
 You don't want to know the thing.

13:59.160 --> 14:02.160
 Well, the world, yes, the world that God created is constantly surprising.

14:02.160 --> 14:12.160
 And by the way, the caveat to this, you know, when I had all these debates with Christopher Hitchens and he would always say that God is a greater tyrant than North Korea because it continues after your death.

14:12.160 --> 14:22.160
 And the idea of being known by God is after all frightening if you think God knows what I think and so on, if your image of God is unloving.

14:22.160 --> 14:37.160
 Can we jump to this? You had friendships and conversations with a lot of the fascinating figures of the past 20, 30 years of the great intellectuals, one of which perhaps one of the greats is Christopher Hitchens.

14:37.160 --> 14:42.160
 What have you learned from your conversation, your friendship?

14:42.160 --> 14:48.160
 So there are a lot of views he held that I really did not agree with, but he was a remarkable person.

14:48.160 --> 14:49.160
 That was a good line about North Korea.

14:49.160 --> 14:51.160
 He was full of incredibly good lines.

14:51.160 --> 14:54.160
 Well, one of the things I learned was you can't win a debate with Christopher Hitchens.

14:54.160 --> 15:06.160
 One of the reasons you can't win is because he has this British baritone and this ready wit that you can't triumph over laughter.

15:06.160 --> 15:10.160
 It doesn't matter if your argument is better. If your quip is better, you win.

15:10.160 --> 15:15.160
 And so I remember once we were arguing about free will and he said, well, I choose to believe in it.

15:15.160 --> 15:20.160
 And everybody laughed and that was despite the fact that that's not really an argument.

15:20.160 --> 15:24.160
 And I remember like, I have free will because I don't have a choice or whatever.

15:24.160 --> 15:25.160
 Right, exactly.

15:25.160 --> 15:27.160
 And people should watch your conversation with him. It's great.

15:27.160 --> 15:38.160
 I mean, it's a kind of David versus Goliath situation and you're quite masterful at using charisma and sweet talking with Hitchens.

15:38.160 --> 15:40.160
 I also genuinely liked him.

15:40.160 --> 15:50.160
 I spent a three hour limousine ride with him from one debate to another from LA to San Diego.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.160
 And the entire time he said, we just can't talk about religion.

15:53.160 --> 15:58.160
 So we talked about literature and he gave me a long lecture about Scotch.

15:58.160 --> 16:02.160
 He was inexhaustible.

16:02.160 --> 16:16.160
 I mean, not only did he, I began, I wrote a couple of obituaries about him and when I began with the historian Keith Thomas said there are two ways of achieving immortality by doing things worth remembering or saying things worth remembering.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.160
 And by that standard, he did both.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.160
 I mean, he went all around the world to all sorts of danger zones.

16:21.160 --> 16:36.160
 He knew like the best bars everywhere from Kuala Lumpur to Beirut to LA and he could drink all night and write a 2000 word essay on the poetry of Yates and go to sleep.

16:36.160 --> 16:41.160
 I remember before one of our debates in Boston, he was at the bar and he said, come have a drink.

16:41.160 --> 16:45.160
 And I said, I'm going to have a drink before I go to debate with you.

16:45.160 --> 16:46.160
 What are you crazy?

16:46.160 --> 16:47.160
 And he said, just have a beer.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.160
 It's water.

16:49.160 --> 16:58.160
 So he really was a constant inexhaustible fountain of intrigue and interest.

16:58.160 --> 17:09.160
 What kind of things, if you can remember, if you can mention, if you can admit to have him enlightening you or helping you change your mind about something in this world?

17:09.160 --> 17:11.160
 So I think...

17:11.160 --> 17:13.160
 Unrelated to Scotch.

17:13.160 --> 17:15.160
 Yeah, unrelated to Scotch.

17:15.160 --> 17:21.160
 He convinced me that the idea...

17:21.160 --> 17:31.160
 I mean, I had my doubts about it and have my doubts about it, but he convinced me through many debates and not only he, that the idea that religion makes people better is not...

17:31.160 --> 17:39.160
 It's not ipso facto wrong, but it's a much, much more complicated argument than I wished it to be.

17:39.160 --> 17:53.160
 So he is, however you conceive of the term beauty, he's one of the more beautiful humans, this weird little earth produced.

17:53.160 --> 18:00.160
 So how do you explain the atheism combined with such a beautiful mind?

18:00.160 --> 18:07.160
 So from your perspective of a man of faith, how do you think about that?

18:07.160 --> 18:16.160
 So of the atheists that I have debated, I think about all of them somewhat differently.

18:16.160 --> 18:22.160
 So I think that in some deep way, for example, Sam Harris is a religious personality.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.160
 I don't even think that he would...

18:24.160 --> 18:28.160
 He wouldn't like the word religious, but I don't even think that he would take issue with that.

18:28.160 --> 18:39.160
 I think that he would say his is a purely material based spirituality, but I mean his orientation towards meditation and appreciation of Buddhism.

18:39.160 --> 18:43.160
 There's something deeply seeking spiritual about him.

18:43.160 --> 18:50.160
 With Hitchens, I honestly, and I know that some of his fans will really not like this.

18:50.160 --> 18:55.160
 It's not that he was any kind of closet believer, certainly not at all.

18:55.160 --> 19:07.160
 But I almost feel as though he was less a passionate arguer against religion than he was, first of all, extremely upset by the forms that religion took in this world.

19:07.160 --> 19:24.160
 And then once he trained his intellectual howitzers on a target, he had so much fun inventing new arguments and attacking it that I really believe he gets carried away sometimes by his own eloquence.

19:24.160 --> 19:28.160
 And intellectual range.

19:28.160 --> 19:33.160
 So for example, the idea that you would call a book that religion poisons everything.

19:33.160 --> 19:41.160
 I think he did that deliberately, provocatively so that he could defend a proposition that obviously is indefensible, that it poisons everything.

19:41.160 --> 19:44.160
 So I don't know.

19:44.160 --> 19:47.160
 I think he had tremendous joie de vieux.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.160
 That's really what that's what sums him up.

19:49.160 --> 19:58.160
 This guy who loved life in all of its manifestations and arguing against something that someone else believed was one of his greatest joys.

19:58.160 --> 19:59.160
 Yeah.

19:59.160 --> 20:04.160
 And of course, the practical aspect of that, he just saw the powerful and he challenged them with humor and so on.

20:04.160 --> 20:05.160
 Absolutely.

20:05.160 --> 20:11.160
 And you could argue perhaps that humor is the highest form of what humanity can achieve.

20:11.160 --> 20:21.160
 Like sometimes maybe us little humans take things a little too seriously, then sometimes we need to just laugh at it all, laugh at ourselves and that's probably the purest form of wisdom.

20:21.160 --> 20:29.160
 You know, Auden, the poet said, among the people that I like or admire, I can find no common quality, but among those I love, I can.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.160
 All of them make me laugh.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.160
 There you have it.

20:32.160 --> 20:39.160
 Speaking of people that make you laugh, Sam Harris, because he's actually has a really great sense of humor.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.160
 He does.

20:40.160 --> 20:43.160
 Very cold and monotone delivery.

20:43.160 --> 20:46.160
 He's another one that you had your friends with.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.160
 Yes.

20:47.160 --> 20:49.160
 You have good conversations with.

20:49.160 --> 20:54.160
 Where's your fundamental disagreements and agreements with Sam?

20:54.160 --> 20:58.160
 Sam believes that religion is intellectually indefensible.

20:58.160 --> 21:02.160
 He really believes it, like deep in his soul.

21:02.160 --> 21:13.160
 And he gets angry at the idea that a proposition should be unchallenged if it offends his sense of logic.

21:13.160 --> 21:14.160
 Yeah.

21:14.160 --> 21:16.160
 So he cannot move on until this is dealt with.

21:16.160 --> 21:17.160
 No.

21:17.160 --> 21:21.160
 In fact, I mean, I did a podcast with Eric Weinstein.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.160
 And then Sam did one.

21:23.160 --> 21:36.160
 And Sam said, when I heard your podcast with David Wolpe, I learned stuff about what he thinks that I never learned in my conversations with him because I can never let him make those unfounded assertions without challenging them and you just let them go.

21:36.160 --> 21:52.160
 And I think that there was something to that was like, he finds it hard to have a conversation about religion that doesn't arouse his real ire about the harm that he thinks religion does in the world.

21:52.160 --> 21:58.160
 Is this more about the implementation of religion in the world as it is versus the really fundamental?

21:58.160 --> 22:03.160
 I think he also thinks it's fundamentally intellectually shoddy and disreputable.

22:03.160 --> 22:04.160
 Faith.

22:04.160 --> 22:05.160
 Yeah.

22:05.160 --> 22:06.160
 Faith.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.160
 I don't know how to put this.

22:07.160 --> 22:15.160
 I mean, they're both capable of separating their contempt for religion from the people that they have sitting in front of them.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.160
 You mean Christopher Hitchens and Sam Harris?

22:17.160 --> 22:18.160
 Yes.

22:18.160 --> 22:19.160
 Both of them.

22:19.160 --> 22:24.160
 Okay, so let me, you mentioned Eric Weinstein, people should listen to your conversation with Eric because it's a fascinating one.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.160
 It's great.

22:25.160 --> 22:26.160
 It's a nonstandard.

22:26.160 --> 22:29.160
 It just goes all over the place in this humor and wit.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.160
 It's great.

22:30.160 --> 22:46.160
 So one interesting aspect that I also learned, perhaps not about you, but about Eric, about both, but Eric has a similar thing with Jordan Peterson, which is, if you ask him, do they believe in God?

22:46.160 --> 22:54.160
 I think the answer, they're not comfortable answering that question or they might say no, but they're usually just not comfortable answering that question.

22:54.160 --> 23:02.160
 But there's a kind of sense that they would like to live life, a religious life, as if God exists.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.160
 I think that's exactly right.

23:04.160 --> 23:08.160
 I think, first of all, Eric has a really deep appreciation of the Jewish tradition.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.160
 I don't know Peterson.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.160
 I've read his stuff and I've reviewed his stuff and so on.

23:12.160 --> 23:23.160
 But I think that Jungians are, in their very approach, they believe that myth is the way the world works.

23:23.160 --> 23:29.160
 And so it's not that big a leap to God, but it's still, there's still a distance there.

23:29.160 --> 23:32.160
 Is it possible to have your cake and eat it too?

23:32.160 --> 23:39.160
 Is it possible to have the depth of a religious life without believing in God?

23:39.160 --> 23:45.160
 How do you make sense of Eric Weinstein's devout life within the tradition?

23:45.160 --> 23:53.160
 I mean, I honestly think he believes in God but doesn't believe in God and it's oscillating like it's a quantum mechanical system of some sort.

23:53.160 --> 23:55.160
 Schrodinger's God.

23:55.160 --> 24:07.160
 So I think that he would probably agree with what Elie Wiesel said, that a Jew can be angry at God or be disbelieving of God but is not allowed to be indifferent to God.

24:07.160 --> 24:10.160
 And I think Eric's not indifferent to God.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.160
 And it's different than Christianity.

24:13.160 --> 24:27.160
 I've had this conversation many times because you can be very Jewish and have deep doubts about theological questions because Judaism isn't a religion.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.160
 It's a religious family.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.160
 And so you're born Jewish.

24:31.160 --> 24:38.160
 Like if I said to you tomorrow, if I was Christian and I said, oh, I believe in Jesus today and then tomorrow I didn't, I'm not Christian anymore.

24:38.160 --> 24:42.160
 But if tomorrow I said, oh, I don't believe all this stuff, I'm still Jewish.

24:42.160 --> 24:46.160
 So it's a more complicated system.

24:46.160 --> 24:57.160
 Having said that though, I think it's very hard to sustain over generations without some belief that the source of it is beyond ourselves.

24:57.160 --> 25:01.160
 And in that sense, as in many others, Eric is unique.

25:01.160 --> 25:11.160
 Well, he was actually making that claim that we need faith to propagate this tradition through the generations.

25:11.160 --> 25:14.160
 So without that, the traditions crumble.

25:14.160 --> 25:23.160
 It's a very interesting idea and a very interesting argument for devout faith, which is it's a thing.

25:23.160 --> 25:27.160
 It's a glue that holds a tradition together. Otherwise, like traditions fall apart.

25:27.160 --> 25:31.160
 So you can't have the intensity of that tradition.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.160
 I mean, on the other hand, you do see tradition.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.160
 I mean, Thanksgiving, one of my favorites.

25:36.160 --> 25:40.160
 So I would say traditions that are demanding fall apart.

25:40.160 --> 25:43.160
 Traditions that require turkey might not fall apart.

25:43.160 --> 25:50.160
 But traditions that make demands of you that are countercultural or are hard, they fall apart.

25:50.160 --> 25:55.160
 I think I need to introduce you to some Thanksgiving dinners that are quite demanding.

25:55.160 --> 25:57.160
 Getting the family together.

25:57.160 --> 25:59.160
 First of all, I'm a vegetarian.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.160
 So I'm tough to have at Thanksgiving dinner.

26:02.160 --> 26:08.160
 But there's a comedian named Kathy Landsman who, one year I heard this on the radio and it stuck with me.

26:08.160 --> 26:13.160
 She said that holidays are a chance to renew your resentments afresh.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.160
 And that's basically what people do with their families.

26:15.160 --> 26:19.160
 It's like, I'm going to go home and fight with the uncle again this year.

26:19.160 --> 26:25.160
 I apologize to take a dark turn, but you mentioned Ali Wazel.

26:25.160 --> 26:31.160
 I recently saw a picture of Ali Wazel when he was in the camp when he was liberated.

26:31.160 --> 26:34.160
 For some reason that hit hard.

26:34.160 --> 26:41.160
 Like, you know, I've seen pictures in concentration camps of people I don't know.

26:41.160 --> 26:45.160
 Or whose words I haven't really felt and gone through.

26:45.160 --> 26:52.160
 But for some reason, like here's just a normal person, like a normal body laying there.

26:52.160 --> 26:54.160
 That was him.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.160
 I've seen it.

26:56.160 --> 27:02.160
 And you see, you can see his face, but at the same time you see that this is an amazing.

27:02.160 --> 27:09.160
 And I think what's so disturbing about it is exactly what you were saying is I've seen a thousand people like this.

27:09.160 --> 27:12.160
 And I know this one and I know what he became.

27:12.160 --> 27:19.160
 So what about all those other people who look exactly like him who didn't make it out of the camp?

27:19.160 --> 27:28.160
 You know, maybe it's projection, but it seemed like this perhaps is also just combining with math's search for meaning.

27:28.160 --> 27:32.160
 It seemed like it was a regular day for them in the picture.

27:32.160 --> 27:41.160
 It didn't seem like, I mean, I'm not sure what I expect to see what suffering looks like, but it's almost like there's no celebration.

27:41.160 --> 27:47.160
 I've never seen a picture of actually liberation be celebratory. It's true. It's really true.

27:47.160 --> 27:53.160
 So what do you make sense? And I apologize to take a step into that moment in history.

27:53.160 --> 28:07.160
 How do you make sense of the Holocaust, of Nazi Germany, that such things could be committed by human beings to each other?

28:07.160 --> 28:18.160
 Is it religion? Is it the thirst for power? Is it the madness of crowds somehow carrying us forward?

28:18.160 --> 28:22.160
 I mean, for me, it's multicausal. I don't think there's one reason.

28:22.160 --> 28:29.160
 One of the things especially there has to do with the special nature of antisemitism, which is let's put that to one side for the moment.

28:29.160 --> 28:37.160
 The second is I think human beings are fundamentally split. They are mostly good except when put under certain pressures.

28:37.160 --> 28:45.160
 My first explanation for hatred is as follows. Go to a playground. What happens when a new kid comes on the playground?

28:45.160 --> 28:49.160
 Do the other kids say, oh, let's go share our toys with the new kid? No.

28:49.160 --> 29:00.160
 They say, oh, who's that stranger? And let's go get them because otherness is built into our genetic, I mean, we're tribal by nature.

29:00.160 --> 29:06.160
 And we see people form tribes all the time of different kinds.

29:06.160 --> 29:15.160
 I asked you before if you were a chess player. And when I was a kid and playing in tournaments and I didn't do it for that long and I didn't do it that well.

29:15.160 --> 29:21.160
 But when I was, it was like the whole world was divided into people who could play chess and people who couldn't play chess.

29:21.160 --> 29:25.160
 Which is ridiculous if you think about it, as though that's the way you divide the world.

29:25.160 --> 29:32.160
 But we tend to do that. And the Jews were always the identifiable other. There were Frenchmen and Jews.

29:32.160 --> 29:35.160
 There were Russians and Jews. There were Germans and Jews.

29:35.160 --> 29:47.160
 And the great blessing of America is that there's no identifiable other quite that way is that there's all these minorities and no, there's not an American and a something.

29:47.160 --> 29:58.160
 But once you have that identifiable other and you have a long history of blaming that identifiable other for all the ills that befall you.

29:58.160 --> 30:07.160
 Of course, people still do try to form, you said, America. They still try to form other, I mean, immigrant versus grown, been here for a generation.

30:07.160 --> 30:17.160
 There's so many ways to slice it. We still try to find ways. It's just more difficult in America because there's so many sub tribes, hierarchies of tribes and upon tribes.

30:17.160 --> 30:24.160
 You're absolutely right. And I was moving fast because I didn't want to get bogged down and all the very difficult. It's true. I tried.

30:24.160 --> 30:27.160
 You're hoping I wouldn't mention that tribalism happens in America.

30:27.160 --> 30:35.160
 I was skating, you know, when you run thin ice, your safety is in your speed. So I was trying to move fast.

30:35.160 --> 30:46.160
 But for most of history in Eastern Western Europe, not obviously in Asia, but in Eastern Western Europe, Jews were the ones who like they're not like us.

30:46.160 --> 30:53.160
 They're clearly not like us. And so, and in addition, there's a peculiar quality.

30:53.160 --> 31:04.160
 And I don't know, I wonder what you'll think of this explanation. There's a peculiar quality to antisemitism that is unlike any other hatred that I know of, which is Jews are both superhuman and subhuman.

31:04.160 --> 31:10.160
 They're vermin. The Nazis thought of them as vermin, and yet they control the world.

31:10.160 --> 31:19.160
 And there was an English scholar named Hyman Maccabee who said the reason that that's so is the myth that Jews killed God.

31:19.160 --> 31:27.160
 They killed Jesus. And to kill a God, you have to be superhumanly evil. You can't just be bad. Otherwise, you can't kill a God.

31:27.160 --> 31:37.160
 So there is some like supercharged evil sense that people got from that about Jews that still inheres.

31:37.160 --> 31:47.160
 Yeah, that's true. A lot of the way we formulate the other in terms of tribes is often they're subhuman and they're here to steal our resources like on the playground.

31:47.160 --> 31:53.160
 But to be both is a fascinating construction.

31:53.160 --> 31:58.160
 Do you agree with Solzhenitsyn that all of us have the capacity for evil?

31:58.160 --> 32:03.160
 100% runs through every human heart. I have no doubt about it.

32:03.160 --> 32:12.160
 And I know, as you probably do, but I probably know more both because of what I do and because I've lived a lot longer than you.

32:12.160 --> 32:22.160
 I know a lot of religious leaders who people thought or think are above the human and they are emphatically not. They're not.

32:22.160 --> 32:27.160
 Some of them have done horrible things and they've used their position to do horrible things.

32:27.160 --> 32:32.160
 And it's because there is no perfect saint.

32:32.160 --> 32:43.160
 I mean, all through history, you discover all these saintly characters that we worship, the people who actually knew them around them, some like them and some didn't.

32:43.160 --> 32:46.160
 People are complicated, all of us.

32:46.160 --> 32:55.160
 And the tough thing is, the thing that's the toughest for me is it's not very always clear what is good and what is evil.

32:55.160 --> 33:11.160
 Because certainly if you just look at history and it's not always propaganda, I really believe that some part of Stalin thought he was doing good legitimately.

33:11.160 --> 33:20.160
 And it makes you ask a question of yourself, for those of us who want to do good in the world, am I actually doing good?

33:20.160 --> 33:25.160
 And that's a really difficult question, like in the technology sphere, for example.

33:25.160 --> 33:30.160
 In this dream of creating technology that will do some good, am I actually doing good?

33:30.160 --> 33:32.160
 So I have a question about that myself.

33:32.160 --> 33:33.160
 Not about Stalin.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.160
 I'm sure that Stalin thought so.

33:35.160 --> 33:40.160
 Stalin does not strike me from what I know of him as somebody given to a lot of self doubt.

33:40.160 --> 33:51.160
 But the question with AI to me is actually it goes back to the God question, which is, if we have an appreciation of the limitations of our own intelligence,

33:51.160 --> 34:04.160
 that we know that just like we can only hear certain things and see certain colors, how much of the world is inaccessible to us because of the way our brains are constructed.

34:04.160 --> 34:22.160
 How can we possibly have any confidence that we can create things that in certain ways are far more intelligent than we are and control them the way we think is best seems to me a hubris that might end up being destructive.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.160
 Definitely.

34:23.160 --> 34:29.160
 Well, any sentence with the word hubris in it is going to end badly when implemented at scale.

34:29.160 --> 34:40.160
 But there is also beauty, so if you approach it with humility, there is a sense, I don't want to over romanticize it, but there is a legged robot right behind you, which is hilarious.

34:40.160 --> 34:58.160
 So there's a magic, I don't have kids, I would love to have kids, but there's a magic to bringing robots to life that it feels like you are a mini God.

34:58.160 --> 34:59.160
 Right.

34:59.160 --> 35:07.160
 Because you just breathe life into an entity that operates in this world, especially when they have legs and they move in this way.

35:07.160 --> 35:15.160
 That's in the case of the four legged robots, like a dog, that I think, I don't think I'm over romanticizing it.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.160
 The feeling is like you would with a child.

35:17.160 --> 35:21.160
 You just gave birth, like holy crap, this is a living thing.

35:21.160 --> 35:24.160
 I wonder what he or she are thinking about.

35:24.160 --> 35:29.160
 By the way, I'm not at all insensible to how remarkable it must feel to create that.

35:29.160 --> 35:42.160
 I'm actually worried in part about how remarkable it feels to create that because to maintain humility and perspective when it's such a fantastic thing is what's difficult.

35:42.160 --> 35:56.160
 And I think also because creativity is both part of what it is to be human and it's very much part of the legacy of Western civilization and the legacy of having a creator God.

35:56.160 --> 36:08.160
 If you have a tradition where God is known primarily through what God creates, so the first debate I ever had since we talked about humor and God and creating, let me give you my one God creating joke.

36:08.160 --> 36:13.160
 Because the first debate I ever had on religion and science was with Steven J. Gould.

36:13.160 --> 36:21.160
 And it was wonderful because he had a deep interest in religion and his interest was actually not to say religion is terrible.

36:21.160 --> 36:28.160
 But I started with this joke and I think it made the debate go a little bit easier.

36:28.160 --> 36:37.160
 So the time has come when human beings can do everything that God can do and a scientist looks up at heaven and says, God, look, you are great in your day and we thank you for everything you did.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.160
 But now we don't need you.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.160
 And God says, really, you don't need me?

36:40.160 --> 36:42.160
 He says, no, we can do everything you did.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.160
 God says everything.

36:43.160 --> 36:46.160
 And human beings says, yeah, we can do everything.

36:46.160 --> 36:49.160
 God says, OK, can you create a human being?

36:49.160 --> 36:52.160
 And the scientist goes, yeah, God says from dirt.

36:52.160 --> 36:54.160
 The scientist goes, yeah, he says, OK, let me see.

36:54.160 --> 37:01.160
 The scientist reaches down, scoops up some dirt and God says, uh, uh, uh, get your own dirt.

37:01.160 --> 37:05.160
 But the idea is that a creator God impels us to create too.

37:05.160 --> 37:10.160
 But let me bring up Nietzsche who proclaimed that God is dead.

37:10.160 --> 37:13.160
 Is belief in God slowly disappearing from our world?

37:13.160 --> 37:14.160
 Do you think?

37:14.160 --> 37:17.160
 And what kind of impact does that have on society?

37:17.160 --> 37:21.160
 You wrote that religion is not our enemy.

37:21.160 --> 37:26.160
 Before the Western faiths captured the heart of our world, there was cruelty, carnage and destruction.

37:26.160 --> 37:30.160
 In the 20th century, when religion ceased to be a force of international politics,

37:30.160 --> 37:35.160
 the scale of human slaughter was far beyond anything human beings have ever known.

37:35.160 --> 37:39.160
 What is the world like when we take religion out of it?

37:39.160 --> 37:41.160
 I mean, I think Nietzsche was largely right.

37:41.160 --> 37:44.160
 You know, it wasn't a statement about God.

37:44.160 --> 37:48.160
 It was a statement about God's presence in the world.

37:48.160 --> 37:56.160
 And I think that that's largely true, that God is not a force in a lot of Western society.

37:56.160 --> 38:03.160
 And I believe that if the force of nihilism has no clear counter

38:03.160 --> 38:11.160
 without an idea that we're all here for a purpose and that our lives are inherently meaningful

38:11.160 --> 38:16.160
 and that there's a God who wishes us to be better.

38:16.160 --> 38:19.160
 So I worry a lot about it.

38:19.160 --> 38:23.160
 And I don't think, I think that the sort of optimism that things are just going to get better and better

38:23.160 --> 38:28.160
 is what one philosopher called cut flower ethics.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.160
 That is, we're still living off the morals that religion gave us,

38:31.160 --> 38:37.160
 but now that they're separate from the soil that gave birth to them, I see them wilting.

38:37.160 --> 38:40.160
 So that's kind of optimism for the future of human civilization,

38:40.160 --> 38:45.160
 you think isn't part grounded in a religious society.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.160
 I really do believe that.

38:46.160 --> 38:50.160
 I mean, it was religion that the Greeks looked back at a golden age of the past.

38:50.160 --> 38:53.160
 It was the Jews who said, no, the golden age is in the future, right?

38:53.160 --> 38:54.160
 It's the Messiah.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.160
 And I think that that idea that we're moving towards something better,

38:57.160 --> 39:05.160
 which I really believe humanity can do and absent destroying ourselves will do.

39:05.160 --> 39:10.160
 I mean, I'm very excited about the technology that I won't live to see.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.160
 I think it's fantastic.

39:11.160 --> 39:14.160
 And that excitement is a kind of religious excitement

39:14.160 --> 39:16.160
 because there's a reason to preserve this whole thing.

39:16.160 --> 39:19.160
 Absolutely, because I really think

39:19.160 --> 39:22.160
 I know this sounds absurdly anthropomorphic,

39:22.160 --> 39:24.160
 but I really think God is cheering us on.

39:24.160 --> 39:27.160
 I feel like this is why we're here.

39:27.160 --> 39:36.160
 We're here to grow in soul and to grow each other in soul.

39:36.160 --> 39:37.160
 Yeah.

39:37.160 --> 39:42.160
 So what do you think the world, so if you just think of this force of nihilism

39:42.160 --> 39:48.160
 that's contending with the force of faith based optimism.

39:48.160 --> 39:49.160
 Right.

39:49.160 --> 39:54.160
 What do you make of the atrocities in the 20th century?

39:54.160 --> 40:00.160
 Do you think at its core it's part of human nature

40:00.160 --> 40:03.160
 and has nothing to do with religion or not religion?

40:03.160 --> 40:07.160
 Or do you think you can assign this kind of nihilistic view of the world?

40:07.160 --> 40:12.160
 I think it has to do with a religion that doesn't make ethical demands.

40:12.160 --> 40:18.160
 That is for Stalin and for Hitler, they both had religions,

40:18.160 --> 40:23.160
 but they were in a sense, but they were religions that didn't make ethical demands for the other.

40:23.160 --> 40:27.160
 I mean, 36 times the Torah talks about the stranger.

40:27.160 --> 40:33.160
 The point is it's trying to educate people away from their natural inclination

40:33.160 --> 40:36.160
 towards distrusting and disliking the other.

40:36.160 --> 40:39.160
 And it's a lot of work that's really difficult to do.

40:39.160 --> 40:49.160
 But if you have a tribal passion and not a universal ethic, then you're in trouble.

40:49.160 --> 40:54.160
 Well, the Jewish tribe is a very strong tribe.

40:54.160 --> 41:00.160
 So how do you make sense of this mention of the stranger versus the power of the tribe,

41:00.160 --> 41:05.160
 which is the whole point, not the point, but the mechanism of tradition propagates the tribe?

41:05.160 --> 41:06.160
 So it's both.

41:06.160 --> 41:10.160
 I mean, the Torah does not start with Jews.

41:10.160 --> 41:11.160
 It starts with Adam and Eve.

41:11.160 --> 41:16.160
 That's a way of saying, yeah, this is going to be a story about a people,

41:16.160 --> 41:20.160
 but understand that prior to a kind of people, there are people.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.160
 I'm a human being before I'm a Jew.

41:23.160 --> 41:30.160
 And in fact, the Jewish New Year, the Muslim New Year starts with Muhammad's journey.

41:30.160 --> 41:33.160
 And the Christian New Year starts with Jesus's birth.

41:33.160 --> 41:38.160
 The Jewish New Year starts with the creation of the world because the idea is, yes,

41:38.160 --> 41:42.160
 this is a particularist tradition, but it makes a universal statement,

41:42.160 --> 41:50.160
 which is all if humanity is a child or in the image of God or children of God.

41:50.160 --> 41:58.160
 I think that the idea of Judaism was to try to exemplify a certain way of making that statement

41:58.160 --> 41:59.160
 over and over again.

41:59.160 --> 42:03.160
 And I want to say one other thing about chosenness that's very name dropy.

42:03.160 --> 42:06.160
 But when I tell you how I got there, it won't be his name dropy.

42:06.160 --> 42:10.160
 So my brother is a professor at Emory.

42:10.160 --> 42:15.160
 And so is the Dalai Lama actually teaches at Emory, although he no longer does

42:15.160 --> 42:18.160
 because he's too old to go to Emory, but for many years taught at Emory.

42:18.160 --> 42:23.160
 And so my brother brought us, he's the head of the Ethic Center at Emory.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.160
 He's a bioethicist.

42:24.160 --> 42:27.160
 So he brought a bunch of students to Darm Salah to meet with the Dalai Lama.

42:27.160 --> 42:30.160
 So I went to India, I was on sabbatical.

42:30.160 --> 42:34.160
 Then anyway, I met my brother there and we had a chance to meet with the Dalai Lama.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.160
 Okay, that was the name drop.

42:36.160 --> 42:38.160
 So we're sitting in the hall before he speaks to the students.

42:38.160 --> 42:41.160
 He was speaking to us, but not because I just wanted to make it clear,

42:41.160 --> 42:43.160
 not because he said, oh, I got to talk to that rabbi.

42:43.160 --> 42:47.160
 We just happened to be, I happened to glom along with my brother.

42:47.160 --> 42:48.160
 We sit down.

42:48.160 --> 42:51.160
 The first thing he says, he points at me and says,

42:51.160 --> 42:53.160
 what's this about the chosen people anyway?

42:53.160 --> 42:58.160
 By the way, he had asked that I give a lecture,

42:58.160 --> 43:03.160
 which I did later, to his monks about how Jews survived in the diaspora.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.160
 So it's not like he doesn't know about Jews.

43:05.160 --> 43:08.160
 He knows a lot about it, but he's just being right away with.

43:08.160 --> 43:12.160
 So I said, yes, Jews believe that they were chosen for a certain mission in this world.

43:12.160 --> 43:15.160
 That doesn't mean other people weren't chosen for other sorts of things.

43:15.160 --> 43:19.160
 They certainly, I mean, seems to me that other people believe they're chosen for things too.

43:19.160 --> 43:23.160
 He burst out laughing and said, yeah, we also think we're chosen.

43:23.160 --> 43:28.160
 So the idea is that no tribe is better than it.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.160
 Better? No.

43:29.160 --> 43:38.160
 From a Jewish perspective, you're chosen for a thing, but that doesn't make you better.

43:38.160 --> 43:39.160
 No.

43:39.160 --> 43:42.160
 The only place where the betters came in, honestly, if I'm going to, historically,

43:42.160 --> 43:46.160
 if I'm going to be honest, was not with the idea that you,

43:46.160 --> 43:51.160
 but it was when Jews were small, persecuted,

43:51.160 --> 43:55.160
 the way that you take this sort of psychic revenge is by saying,

43:55.160 --> 43:57.160
 no, we're better than our persecutors, even.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.160
 Yeah.

43:58.160 --> 44:02.160
 But the idea is, yeah, different people have different missions,

44:02.160 --> 44:07.160
 which is, I mean, there was a Jewish philosopher, Franz Rosenzweig, who used to say,

44:07.160 --> 44:09.160
 he didn't know very much about Islam.

44:09.160 --> 44:14.160
 He used to say, Judaism is the sun, and Christianity was the rays of the sun.

44:14.160 --> 44:18.160
 Like, Judaism introduced the idea of God, and Christianity brought it to the world.

44:18.160 --> 44:21.160
 Can you speak to this difference?

44:21.160 --> 44:27.160
 What is the difference and similarities between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?

44:27.160 --> 44:30.160
 The religious family part is different.

44:30.160 --> 44:36.160
 And the greatest difference, which I talked about in the Eric Weinstein podcast,

44:36.160 --> 44:43.160
 is that Islam and Judaism are more similar in a lot of ways than Judaism and Christianity.

44:43.160 --> 44:51.160
 And the reason that that is so is Christianity in its core is not a religion of law.

44:51.160 --> 44:56.160
 The reason it's not a religion of law is because it grew up in the Roman Empire.

44:56.160 --> 44:58.160
 So law was taken care of.

44:58.160 --> 45:02.160
 I mean, Jesus didn't have to create civil law because you had Roman law.

45:02.160 --> 45:06.160
 Muhammad and Moses created a religion in the desert where there was no law.

45:06.160 --> 45:08.160
 So you have to create a religion of law.

45:08.160 --> 45:11.160
 Otherwise, you have anarchy.

45:11.160 --> 45:18.160
 And that's why in a lot of ways, like, there was never a separation of church and state in Islam or Judaism.

45:18.160 --> 45:20.160
 That was a gift that Christianity gave the world.

45:20.160 --> 45:24.160
 And it could do it because of render unto Caesar what is Caesar's.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.160
 But when Moses came along, there was no Caesar.

45:26.160 --> 45:28.160
 When Muhammad came along, there was no Caesar.

45:28.160 --> 45:33.160
 So historically, the traditions shaped differently.

45:33.160 --> 45:44.160
 But all three of them have this core, I think, the single most important statement and insight in all of human history,

45:44.160 --> 45:47.160
 which is that every human being is in the image of God.

45:47.160 --> 45:53.160
 And if you believe, if you really believe that, that's a transformative belief.

45:53.160 --> 45:59.160
 So that means you should love, you know, by neighbor as yourself.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.160
 Which comes from Leviticus, comes straight from the Torah.

46:02.160 --> 46:06.160
 So I don't know if you know, I've been chatting with Omar Salaman.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.160
 I don't know if you know who that is.

46:08.160 --> 46:11.160
 He's an Imam and Dallas great guy.

46:11.160 --> 46:15.160
 I enjoy his interfaith dialogues that he engages in.

46:15.160 --> 46:19.160
 And do you ever do that kind of talk with Christians, with Muslims?

46:19.160 --> 46:21.160
 Yes, often, often.

46:21.160 --> 46:26.160
 I mean, I do whenever I at least listen to them in the context of these kinds of conversations.

46:26.160 --> 46:32.160
 There's so much love and humor and empathy and appreciation.

46:32.160 --> 46:37.160
 And also ability to make fun of the quirks of the little.

46:37.160 --> 46:38.160
 Of one's own.

46:38.160 --> 46:44.160
 Of one's own communities, you know, like, so it's not, you know, necessarily the depths of the details of the traditions.

46:44.160 --> 46:51.160
 But you know, these are communities and they're full of people and they're full of weird people because we're all weird.

46:51.160 --> 46:58.160
 And so you, there is very particular flavors of weirdness that emerge and they can make fun of them.

46:58.160 --> 47:03.160
 And in that way, they can talk about some like beautiful ideas.

47:03.160 --> 47:06.160
 So I mean, I don't know, do you engage in these kinds of things?

47:06.160 --> 47:08.160
 What would you learn from them?

47:08.160 --> 47:11.160
 So one of the things I learned is exactly what you said.

47:11.160 --> 47:14.160
 The personalities that you think are unique to your own community.

47:14.160 --> 47:19.160
 In fact, they exist in all sorts of communities and religious communities in particular.

47:19.160 --> 47:22.160
 Draw, I think, some interesting personalities.

47:22.160 --> 47:30.160
 And also that the, especially as clergy, some of the pressures that you feel are shared.

47:30.160 --> 47:34.160
 And it's weird.

47:34.160 --> 47:37.160
 Again, it has to do with that tribal association.

47:37.160 --> 47:48.160
 There's almost like there's an understanding among clergy because they have similar straight and it's a strange role in the following way.

47:48.160 --> 47:51.160
 It's one that you never escape.

47:51.160 --> 47:58.160
 That is, you're not my lawyer at the supermarket, but you are my rabbi at the supermarket.

47:58.160 --> 48:01.160
 I mean, it doesn't matter why you're there.

48:01.160 --> 48:16.160
 That's not an escapable role and every religious leader is aware of that strange assumption of stepping into something that you can never step out of.

48:16.160 --> 48:27.160
 But you're also the source where people go to think about the deepest question of our lives and our universe.

48:27.160 --> 48:32.160
 And so that's some heavy, you know, when people are suffering, they look to you for answers.

48:32.160 --> 48:36.160
 I mean, every privilege comes with a cost of one kind or another.

48:36.160 --> 48:44.160
 The reason you get to be in that role is exactly because you get the privilege of being there at crucial moments in people's lives.

48:44.160 --> 48:56.160
 I mean, the fact that I get to marry people and get to give eulogies for people and come to the hospital, it's inexpressible.

48:56.160 --> 49:03.160
 I have this joke with people that I know that when I'm sitting on the couch and it's Saturday night, I don't want to get up and go to a wedding.

49:03.160 --> 49:04.160
 I really don't.

49:04.160 --> 49:07.160
 I want to sit there and watch Netflix like everybody else.

49:07.160 --> 49:13.160
 But when I'm actually doing the wedding, I always love it, always, always, always.

49:13.160 --> 49:21.160
 And the reason is that I don't think, I mean, yes, people go to you for answers in calmer conversations.

49:21.160 --> 49:27.160
 Like, if you ask me now, like, what's my theory of why God allows evil, I could give you a conversation about it.

49:27.160 --> 49:32.160
 But they really go for presence and comfort, not really for answers.

49:32.160 --> 49:36.160
 When someone's suffering, an answer doesn't make them unsuffer.

49:36.160 --> 49:39.160
 You know, it's just they want to know they're not alone.

49:39.160 --> 49:43.160
 Yeah, to be heard and just to feel things in silence together.

49:43.160 --> 49:44.160
 Exactly.

49:44.160 --> 49:45.160
 Yeah.

49:45.160 --> 49:51.160
 In terms of weddings and marriage, what's the role of that?

49:51.160 --> 49:53.160
 I'm just, I need to take some notes here.

49:53.160 --> 49:55.160
 What's the role of a rabbi?

49:55.160 --> 49:58.160
 The role of marriage in human existence.

49:58.160 --> 50:06.160
 It is, first of all, to teach you how to care for someone unlike you, which could be anyone you marry.

50:06.160 --> 50:12.160
 And I think it's to create a home and a family.

50:12.160 --> 50:15.160
 So there's a commitment to it, so care for a long time.

50:15.160 --> 50:16.160
 Right, exactly.

50:16.160 --> 50:23.160
 And also, when couples come to me and they say, we don't need to be married because it really won't change how we think about ourselves and our relationship.

50:23.160 --> 50:24.160
 I say to them, that's true.

50:24.160 --> 50:25.160
 It might not.

50:25.160 --> 50:27.160
 But it will change how everyone else looks at you.

50:27.160 --> 50:28.160
 Yeah.

50:28.160 --> 50:31.160
 And because it changes how everyone else looks at you, it changes you.

50:31.160 --> 50:36.160
 Because it's one thing to say, this is my partner, it's another thing to say, this is my husband.

50:36.160 --> 50:42.160
 You say this is my husband, that means we've made a real commitment to this.

50:42.160 --> 50:44.160
 Yeah.

50:44.160 --> 50:58.160
 Do you worry that there's a dissolution of that as well in terms of how, you know, as religion dissipates, it loosens its hold on society, loosens its impact on society.

50:58.160 --> 51:00.160
 Do you worry about that?

51:00.160 --> 51:02.160
 I worry about it.

51:02.160 --> 51:09.160
 I do think that it is possible that we're going, rather than a dissolution, we're going through a transition.

51:09.160 --> 51:13.160
 That is different kinds of families and different configurations of families.

51:13.160 --> 51:16.160
 That is, I see some of that.

51:16.160 --> 51:22.160
 But I also do see, it's less a dissolution of marriage than it is of the idea of commitment.

51:22.160 --> 51:24.160
 And I'll give you like a simple example.

51:24.160 --> 51:31.160
 When I was growing up, a player on a sports team was always on that team.

51:31.160 --> 51:35.160
 And you've rooted for the team because you knew the players for 20 years.

51:35.160 --> 51:42.160
 Now, there are very good reasons, starting with Kurt Flood, why people got free agency and they can move around and it's better for the players.

51:42.160 --> 51:44.160
 I understand all that.

51:44.160 --> 51:48.160
 And I am not saying, oh, they should continue.

51:48.160 --> 51:58.160
 But just like people move jobs and they move sports teams and they change careers, they change partners.

51:58.160 --> 52:10.160
 And there is a diminishment of the commitment to commitment that I actually think has serious societal consequences and that I am worried about.

52:10.160 --> 52:12.160
 Yeah, there's a cost to that.

52:12.160 --> 52:16.160
 I don't know what it is about commitment that's beautiful.

52:16.160 --> 52:21.160
 Because some of the deepest friendships I have is when we've gone through some shit together.

52:21.160 --> 52:31.160
 And so going through hard times together, especially when the hard times are between the two of you, that's always a risk.

52:31.160 --> 52:36.160
 But if you can find a way through, that can bond you stronger.

52:36.160 --> 52:38.160
 That's the fascinating thing about human relations.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.160
 There's no question.

52:39.160 --> 52:46.160
 Even if it doesn't keep you forever, you still have a connection that doesn't, that exists.

52:46.160 --> 52:49.160
 So I can give you one, you said, what is it about commitment?

52:49.160 --> 52:52.160
 I'll give you one, I think, beautiful answer.

52:52.160 --> 53:00.160
 Someone once asked Rabbi Soloveitchik, who is a great thinker and leader in the Orthodox community in the 20th century.

53:00.160 --> 53:02.160
 They said, you know, I go from religion to religion.

53:02.160 --> 53:05.160
 I just take what I think is beautiful in it.

53:05.160 --> 53:09.160
 And his answer was that you're treating religion like a nomad.

53:09.160 --> 53:14.160
 He said, nomads go from place to place and they eat what they want and they move on.

53:14.160 --> 53:16.160
 He says, farmers stay in one place.

53:16.160 --> 53:19.160
 The difference is farmers make things grow.

53:19.160 --> 53:23.160
 And I think that that's true also when you think about the relationships you have.

53:23.160 --> 53:34.160
 Things have grown out of the relationships that you've invested in, that you farmed basically, that can't exist in fly by night relationships.

53:34.160 --> 53:38.160
 Can you talk about, can we talk about the Torah?

53:38.160 --> 53:39.160
 Yes.

53:39.160 --> 53:40.160
 What is it?

53:40.160 --> 53:44.160
 And is it the literal word of God?

53:44.160 --> 53:46.160
 Easy questions today.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.160
 Yeah.

53:47.160 --> 53:52.160
 Well, the Torah is the five books of Moses written in Hebrew.

53:52.160 --> 54:00.160
 I, like most, I think modern rabbis, non Orthodox or non literalist rabbis will tell you that it's a product of human beings.

54:00.160 --> 54:08.160
 And I believe that they are inspired by God, but it's clear to me that it's a human product.

54:08.160 --> 54:15.160
 And I think that people who study modern biblical criticism, it's really hard to study modern, modern.

54:15.160 --> 54:18.160
 Criticism gives a wrong impression.

54:18.160 --> 54:25.160
 I would say modern scholarship on the Bible and not appreciate the fact that it even has levels of language.

54:25.160 --> 54:35.160
 I mean, it's just like if you read today, somebody writing like Shakespeare, you would say this isn't, it's like English has developed.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.160
 It's different.

54:36.160 --> 54:38.160
 It's not the English we speak today.

54:38.160 --> 54:46.160
 And if you study the Bible and you know Hebrew well enough, you even see that this was written over hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years.

54:46.160 --> 54:54.160
 It is a holy book and I like the idea that it is what, what you say in Hebrew is Torami Hashamiim and not Torami Sinai.

54:54.160 --> 54:57.160
 That is the Torah is from heaven, but it's not from Sinai.

54:57.160 --> 55:12.160
 So it has its origin beyond us, but it has things in it that I think, and this is one of the, one of the things that was a huge controversy at my congregation when I started to do same sex marriages.

55:12.160 --> 55:18.160
 There are some people who try to argue that the Torah does not forbid them.

55:18.160 --> 55:27.160
 Whether it does or not, it seems to me we understand things that were not understood in the ancient world about gender and sexuality.

55:27.160 --> 55:28.160
 And so.

55:28.160 --> 55:37.160
 So you think that in the scripture, in the words, you can find the kind of spirit that supports the idea of gay marriage.

55:37.160 --> 55:42.160
 Well, that's yes, that's my argument is that you criticize the Torah by the Torah.

55:42.160 --> 55:53.160
 That is, it gives you the understanding that you use to evaluate its own claims.

55:53.160 --> 56:04.160
 And I think that Judaism, by the way, has always done that because it's clear that there are things in the Torah that the rabbis changed, altered, grew, expanded, diminished.

56:04.160 --> 56:07.160
 I think that's what it is to be part of a living tradition.

56:07.160 --> 56:12.160
 Yeah, you wrote in your book, Why Faith Matters.

56:12.160 --> 56:20.160
 Walt Whitman wrote that in order for there to be a great books, there must be great readers for a book to remain powerful throughout generations.

56:20.160 --> 56:22.160
 It cannot have a single meaning.

56:22.160 --> 56:26.160
 Scripture like great poetry is not reducible to other words.

56:26.160 --> 56:33.160
 That is, one cannot paraphrase it and capture the totality of its meaning.

56:33.160 --> 56:38.160
 So how the heck do you capture the meaning of the words in scripture?

56:38.160 --> 56:41.160
 Is it an ongoing process through the centuries?

56:41.160 --> 56:43.160
 Yes, exactly so.

56:43.160 --> 56:55.160
 It's a continual conversation of sages, scholars, readers, strugglers, seekers, mystics, visionaries, all of them making a contribution.

56:55.160 --> 56:59.160
 I mean, I write a weekly Torah column for the Jerusalem Post.

56:59.160 --> 57:03.160
 Now, what is there left to say?

57:03.160 --> 57:23.160
 But every week what I do is I start opening books and seeing what people say and it starts to percolate and you realize that you're entering this conversation that's been going on for thousands of years with remarkable minds and it constantly fertile in new insights.

57:23.160 --> 57:26.160
 So yes, that's what it is to be part of a tradition.

57:26.160 --> 57:29.160
 Yeah, why do people keep writing love poems?

57:29.160 --> 57:32.160
 We should have figured out love by this point already.

57:32.160 --> 57:35.160
 I use the analogy sometimes of diet books.

57:35.160 --> 57:38.160
 If any diet worked, there would be one book.

57:38.160 --> 57:41.160
 There'd be one book and you'd be done.

57:41.160 --> 57:45.160
 You mentioned this fascinating story that you were a part of.

57:45.160 --> 57:48.160
 You were a part of several controversies in your life.

57:48.160 --> 57:50.160
 I've had a few.

57:50.160 --> 57:57.160
 For someone who walks with grace through the fire, you sure have found yourself in a lot of fires.

57:57.160 --> 58:10.160
 One of them, can you tell me the story of your views on gay marriage, the underlying principles that led you to fight this battle of defending gay marriage in the Jewish community?

58:10.160 --> 58:24.160
 So I'm part of a congregation that is really politically split and split not only politically, but split in terms of origin.

58:24.160 --> 58:35.160
 We have a lot of Jews from the Middle East from Iran, a lot of Persian Jews, a lot of Jews from Israel, some from Mexico, from other places and many that grew up in LA.

58:35.160 --> 58:37.160
 Do you have any Russian Jews the best country?

58:37.160 --> 58:43.160
 I have a few Russian Jews, not as many as I should, but we'll work on that.

58:43.160 --> 58:57.160
 But what happened was, increasingly, I became uncomfortable with people who would come to me and say, this is the only kind of person I can love.

58:57.160 --> 59:04.160
 It's not the same question as an intermarriage, as a Jew marrying a non Jew, because you could find a Jew to love.

59:04.160 --> 59:09.160
 You could have found, but you could, and that's a whole separate question.

59:09.160 --> 59:20.160
 But I would have men in my office, primarily, a couple of women, they would say, like, this is the only kind of person that I can enter into an intimate relationship with.

59:20.160 --> 59:24.160
 How can it be that my religion has no room for me?

59:24.160 --> 59:29.160
 And that was very persuasive to me.

59:29.160 --> 59:37.160
 But I knew that it was going to be explosive in my community.

59:37.160 --> 59:41.160
 When, by the way, it finally happened, it was literally on the front page of the New York and the LA Times.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.160
 It was that explosive.

59:42.160 --> 59:48.160
 So it was not a small controversy.

59:48.160 --> 59:56.160
 So what I did was, I started to teach classes, not that many people came about homosexuality and Jewish tradition and so on.

59:56.160 --> 59:59.160
 It's funny, much, much less about lesbianism.

59:59.160 --> 1:00:02.160
 I'm talking about in terms of the sources and so on.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:06.160
 It's almost always about homosexuality.

1:00:06.160 --> 1:00:14.160
 And then I got ready to send out a letter.

1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:25.160
 And I said to my daughter, who at the time was maybe 10 or 11, now in her mid 20s, I said, look, honey, when you go to school tomorrow or whatever it was,

1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:31.160
 I said, people might be saying bad things about your dad, and I just want you to be prepared for that.

1:00:31.160 --> 1:00:32.160
 She said, why?

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:38.160
 And I said, because I'm going to start marrying, I'm going to start doing same sex marriages.

1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:42.160
 And she looked at me quizzically and said, what took you so long?

1:00:42.160 --> 1:00:49.160
 And I thought, really, her face was like, I said to her, I'm going to start marrying blonde haired people to brown haired people.

1:00:49.160 --> 1:00:53.160
 It's like she really did not understand why there was an issue.

1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:55.160
 And I thought that's exactly why.

1:00:55.160 --> 1:00:59.160
 Because I know that this is, it's generational.

1:00:59.160 --> 1:01:01.160
 People are raised with it.

1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:06.160
 They have a deep in there, but it's not really right.

1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:07.160
 It's just not right.

1:01:07.160 --> 1:01:17.160
 But if you could just look back to that journey, how difficult is it to make these decisions a principle?

1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:25.160
 Because you have to think about that in order to think about such decisions you yet might still have to make in the future.

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:29.160
 And I will tell you one thing I did wrong with that and one thing I did right.

1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:36.160
 The thing I did right was I waited until in the communities where people objected to it.

1:01:36.160 --> 1:01:50.160
 I had enough people whose kids had come out so that I had parents of kids who'd come out to refer later on other parents to so that they wouldn't feel like they were the only ones.

1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:58.160
 Because once I announced it, as I thought would happen, a bunch of kids came out and said, you know, now the rabbi said this mom, dad, I want you to know I'm gay.

1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:02.160
 And when the parents came to me, I could say, well, listen, you're not alone.

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:04.160
 This person also you can go to.

1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:06.160
 That I did right.

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:12.160
 What I did wrong was I don't think the classes were enough and I don't think enough people were prepared.

1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:15.160
 And I think part of the explosion was shock.

1:02:15.160 --> 1:02:18.160
 And I should have prepared even more.

1:02:18.160 --> 1:02:30.160
 The words you used to talk about it, the way you thought about it, was it more scholarly in the Jewish tradition or did you go to the feeling?

1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:31.160
 No, I went to the feeling.

1:02:31.160 --> 1:02:44.160
 I said quote Habriot, which means respect or honor for God's creations and caring for other human beings and understanding.

1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:50.160
 It wasn't scholarly because I knew that the objections were not scholarly objections.

1:02:50.160 --> 1:03:01.160
 And I had many beautiful and also painful stories as a result, some of which can be told and some of which really can't.

1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:13.160
 But what I tried to impress also on people was how painful it is to not be able to tell the world, even your own parents, who you are.

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:16.160
 And your sexuality is not a trivial part of who you are.

1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:18.160
 I mean, it's core to people.

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:21.160
 So it's one of the reasons why it evokes such reactions.

1:03:21.160 --> 1:03:29.160
 But I would say to them, the same reason that you're reacting so strongly tells you how strongly, you know.

1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:34.160
 Anyway, it was a very powerful experience.

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:49.160
 And for that, I feel good about it.

1:03:49.160 --> 1:03:54.160
 I told the Churchill one said that it's exhilarating to be shot at without result.

1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:58.160
 If you go into a battle and you make it through and you're still okay, that's good.

1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:01.160
 The problem is when you're in the battle, you don't know.

1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:02.160
 No, you don't know.

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:11.160
 How did it feel like, I mean, looking back, you've been, you know, to use the word canceled a couple of times.

1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:23.160
 I guess when you're dealing with the most difficult of questions, how did it, just as a human being, for a community that you really deeply care about some part of it saying that you have failed?

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:29.160
 I wasn't canceled the way, like I didn't lose my job, didn't lose my home.

1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:31.160
 But I hurt people that I cared about.

1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:32.160
 Yeah.

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:38.160
 And that was the hard, like I went into this, you know, to be someone who brings people together.

1:04:38.160 --> 1:04:54.160
 And then I would sit there and do, even now, like as you're well aware with stuff that's going on now, I sit there and people are really upset at me who I either am or used to be close to.

1:04:54.160 --> 1:05:00.160
 Do those people in time come around?

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:10.160
 When you look now, because those are real feelings in the moment, and we can learn that about social media, people, especially during COVID, there's this intensity of feeling about stuff.

1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:17.160
 And have you learned something about the passing of feeling that turns into wisdom?

1:05:17.160 --> 1:05:18.160
 No question about it.

1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:27.160
 This sermon I gave this Saturday was about how, you know, Moses came down the mountain, he saw the golden calf and he broke the tablets.

1:05:27.160 --> 1:05:30.160
 If he'd sat with it for a little while, he probably wouldn't have broken the tablets.

1:05:30.160 --> 1:05:33.160
 But the instant reaction is always anger.

1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:41.160
 And in our age, unfortunately, the instant reaction gets put on social media forever and ever and ever.

1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:46.160
 And by the way, once you've actually said that, it becomes harder to back down.

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:52.160
 If you keep quiet for a day or two, then you can back down because you haven't put yourself out there.

1:05:52.160 --> 1:05:59.160
 But once you've said, this is terrible, what you did, what you did, it's harder to write and say, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

1:05:59.160 --> 1:06:17.160
 Yeah, so it almost becomes, I mean, I actually, it's a really powerful statement that the downside of saying something on the internet is that it actually pulls you into this current.

1:06:17.160 --> 1:06:23.160
 You both create the current and it pulls you into it to where it's actually very hard to escape.

1:06:23.160 --> 1:06:27.160
 So when two days later you feel different, there's a momentum.

1:06:27.160 --> 1:06:31.160
 There's not a tribe of people that feel this way and there's a momentum with it.

1:06:31.160 --> 1:06:36.160
 There's a momentum and also you don't want to betray your own tribe because then people will get upset at you.

1:06:36.160 --> 1:06:43.160
 I really think that a lot of the antagonism is not so much that you don't want to give ground to the people who oppose you.

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:48.160
 It's that you don't want to break with the people who are behind you and that's really hard.

1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:52.160
 Can you tell the story of this recent controversy?

1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:54.160
 Sure, why not?

1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:56.160
 You went to the Super Bowl.

1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:02.160
 I think a lot of people would relate to this because to me personally, I apologize to anybody who was hurt by this.

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:06.160
 The absurdity of it is deeply intense.

1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:07.160
 So here's the story.

1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:15.160
 The LA County mandates masking children in school and all of kids in our school are masked and many of the parents are extremely upset about that.

1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:18.160
 I will just leave that at that.

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:20.160
 I went to the Super Bowl.

1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:22.160
 There were 70,000 people.

1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:29.160
 Frank Luntz, whom we know was a wonderful guy, gave me a ticket.

1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:31.160
 So I was at the Super Bowl.

1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:34.160
 I maybe saw two masks among the 70,000 people.

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:37.160
 I didn't even think about it, which was foolish on my part.

1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:38.160
 No question.

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:42.160
 I took a picture of myself unmasked at the Super Bowl.

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:50.160
 And people were, I mean, many, many people thought, oh, great, wonderful, glad you're having a good time, so on and so forth.

1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:53.160
 I don't want to diminish at all the many people who said that.

1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:55.160
 A lot of people were livid.

1:07:55.160 --> 1:07:56.160
 They were livid.

1:07:56.160 --> 1:07:58.160
 And they weren't.

1:07:58.160 --> 1:08:03.160
 What was instructive about it was they didn't say nobody wrote it.

1:08:03.160 --> 1:08:07.160
 Nobody wrote me a private note and said, you know, I think that this was a bad idea.

1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:08.160
 You should have thought about this.

1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:09.160
 No.

1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:11.160
 They were, you're a hypocrite.

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:12.160
 You're a clown.

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:13.160
 You're an idiot.

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:14.160
 How could you do this?

1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:15.160
 This is a disgrace.

1:08:15.160 --> 1:08:16.160
 This is...

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:17.160
 They say that publicly.

1:08:17.160 --> 1:08:18.160
 Oh, yeah.

1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:23.160
 On my Instagram, you can still see, I left the remarks up because I really thought it was important.

1:08:23.160 --> 1:08:28.160
 If I started, I only deleted the really vile comments because I thought that shouldn't stay up.

1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:34.160
 But I left them up because I thought like people should see and I should remind myself what I did.

1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:38.160
 And I didn't want to just delete the picture as though it didn't happen because it did happen.

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:39.160
 And I did do it.

1:08:39.160 --> 1:08:41.160
 And I felt terrible about that.

1:08:41.160 --> 1:08:47.160
 And I felt terrible that I had not, not about, I mean, the comments will leave me weren't, weren't pleasant.

1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:48.160
 I didn't like it.

1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:49.160
 Nobody likes it.

1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:53.160
 But I felt worse that I had hurt all these people that I'm close to.

1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:56.160
 And I defended all these people who were really upset that their kids were wearing masks.

1:08:56.160 --> 1:08:59.160
 And now they, their kid says, why doesn't the rabbi have to wear a mask?

1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:02.160
 Well, first of all, it is tough to be a rabbi.

1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:13.160
 If this is, I mean, the masks to me symbolize these kinds of discussions symbolize not necessarily the issues at hand, but the intensity of feeling.

1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:15.160
 And people are really struggling.

1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:16.160
 People are in pain.

1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:17.160
 They're lonely.

1:09:17.160 --> 1:09:19.160
 They're the uncertainty of it.

1:09:19.160 --> 1:09:21.160
 You don't know who to trust.

1:09:21.160 --> 1:09:28.160
 Everything's under question, the institutions, even the scientific institutions, and there's all these conspiracy theories flying around.

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:30.160
 You don't know who to believe.

1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:35.160
 And there's people just yelling at each other and politics has weaved into this whole thing in some messy way.

1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:41.160
 And you're just getting, I mean, honestly, it's just like legit, simple, just frustration.

1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:52.160
 Going back to marriage of just hanging out with the kids and your wife, husband, just distressed, just building up over time.

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:53.160
 No release.

1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:59.160
 And people want to tell you when the rabbi is not wearing a mask, even though it's at the damn Super Bowl.

1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:03.160
 Maybe you want to comment on the Super Bowl part, which is awesome.

1:10:03.160 --> 1:10:08.160
 But anyway, it released clearly a dam of all the kinds of feelings that you're talking about.

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:11.160
 So how do you then write a sermon?

1:10:11.160 --> 1:10:20.160
 Well, so what I did was I didn't answer on social media because I knew that I wouldn't be able to formulate it the way I wanted.

1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:21.160
 And I was going to wait.

1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:26.160
 And I was going to be able to give a longer, I mean, the sermon is 15 minutes, not that long.

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:32.160
 But I wanted to be able to give a longer answer as opposed to a tweet.

1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:39.160
 And so I was really, I mean, I tried to make two points during the sermon.

1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:43.160
 And also I published the text of it, which I never do because I never speak from a text.

1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:46.160
 I always speak from either notes or not even from notes.

1:10:46.160 --> 1:10:51.160
 But this time I thought it was really important that I have a text out there too so that people could actually look over it.

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:57.160
 And I just wanted to make two points, one of which was that I really feel terrible.

1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:06.160
 And I did, that all these people were hurt and that there is this contradiction between the way I acted and the way they want me to act.

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:14.160
 And I also think, by the way, I didn't speak about this, but I also think that there are some people who just don't like the idea of a rabbi being at the Super Bowl.

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:17.160
 It's like you're supposed to be doing rabbi stuff.

1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:19.160
 So I understand that too.

1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:20.160
 But then?

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:30.160
 Yeah, but rabbi at the Super Bowl, I mean, you are also, I hate to say it, but there's a rock star nature to you talking to Christopher Hitchens,

1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:34.160
 contending with ideas, inspiring so many other minds.

1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:36.160
 I mean, there's an educational aspect to this.

1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:37.160
 I appreciate that.

1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:38.160
 It's making ideas cool.

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:42.160
 I mean, that's a very powerful, I mean, that is also the job of a rabbi.

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:44.160
 You're not just supposed to do rabbi stuff.

1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:49.160
 Yeah, but I didn't do so much of that at the game.

1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:51.160
 I see.

1:11:51.160 --> 1:12:02.160
 Nonetheless, but the second part of it was I said that we have to be able to express our anger and disappointment better than this.

1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:04.160
 You just have to.

1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:08.160
 In part because it doesn't get you the result that you want.

1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:14.160
 I mean, when you scream at someone, that's not going to get them to realize what they did.

1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:24.160
 And the most painful moment of it was this letter that I got from a Christian pastor who said,

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:30.160
 you know, I always admired the Jews so much, I can't believe they could be so cruel and especially to a rabbi.

1:12:30.160 --> 1:12:36.160
 And I thought, that's not how I want my congregation to be perceived in the world.

1:12:36.160 --> 1:12:45.160
 And by the way, some of them were from my congregation, some were, many were not from my congregation.

1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:53.160
 And I spoke about what you talked about, which is that, you know, I mentioned before that Moses broke those tablets coming down the mountain.

1:12:53.160 --> 1:12:57.160
 And the Torah doesn't say what happened to the tablets, but the rabbis do.

1:12:57.160 --> 1:13:01.160
 They say that they were carried together in the ark with the second set that was intact.

1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:04.160
 And that we all have brokenness, communities and individuals.

1:13:04.160 --> 1:13:07.160
 We have brokenness and especially now.

1:13:07.160 --> 1:13:14.160
 And we have to learn how to give each other space to be mistaken and broken and hurt and all of that.

1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:18.160
 And the cool thing when you give people that space, you feel better.

1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:26.160
 I mean, you for caring for the community, it feels better when you show empathy and compassion and kindness on the internet.

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:29.160
 You'll actually feel better a week from now.

1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:36.160
 You'll feel much worse if you make some kind of negative statement of principle on the internet.

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.160
 It's almost just exclusively true.

1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:43.160
 So if you care about feeling good, just be kind first.

1:13:43.160 --> 1:13:44.160
 Right.

1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:45.160
 Be empathetic first.

1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:47.160
 Almost always the case, exactly so.

1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:53.160
 So it's, I mean, it settled down a lot.

1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:58.160
 The most really the single best reaction.

1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:04.160
 There are people, and you can again, you can go on social media, you can see all the criticisms and so on and so forth.

1:14:04.160 --> 1:14:10.160
 But the single best reaction I got was from a man who came up to me right after the sermon and said,

1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:12.160
 I have four words for you.

1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:14.160
 And I thought, oh no.

1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:17.160
 Nothing good comes in fourth.

1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:18.160
 I got to confess.

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:20.160
 I said, what?

1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:23.160
 He said, you changed my mind.

1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:25.160
 And I thought, wow.

1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:32.160
 And I said to him, you know, that's so, it's like to take so much courage to come up to somebody and say that in front of them.

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:33.160
 And I was so grateful.

1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:40.160
 And the other thing that it tells me is, look, I've been the rabbi of that congregation for 25 years and I taught 10 years before that.

1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:41.160
 I've been a rabbi for a long time.

1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:43.160
 I still, I still have a lot to learn.

1:14:43.160 --> 1:14:48.160
 We talked a little bit about the difference between Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

1:14:48.160 --> 1:14:55.160
 Because you maybe talk about the difference between the Torah, the Bible and the Koran.

1:14:55.160 --> 1:15:03.160
 So there's, the Hebrew Bible is actually what's called a step canon.

1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:05.160
 That is, there are the five books of the Torah.

1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:08.160
 Then there are books of history and the prophets.

1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:19.160
 So books like Samuel, Kings, Judges, and then the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Ezekiel, so on.

1:15:19.160 --> 1:15:21.160
 And then there are what are called the writings.

1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:33.160
 The writings are books like Psalms, Proverbs, Job, the Megiloth, which are Esther, Daniel, all of those, all of those books, Ecclesiastes.

1:15:33.160 --> 1:15:41.160
 So in Hebrew, it's called the Tanakh, Torah, Neveim, Ketuvim, the Torah, the prophets and the writings.

1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:43.160
 And that is the Hebrew Bible.

1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:49.160
 Sometimes that's also called the Torah, just to be confusing, but really the Torah generally refers to the five books.

1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:55.160
 Then there is the New Testament, which the Jews don't recognize as a sacred book.

1:15:55.160 --> 1:15:59.160
 They recognize it as the book of another religion.

1:15:59.160 --> 1:16:09.160
 And I sometimes say to Christians, in order for them to really grasp this, Jesus has as much religious significance to Judaism as Muhammad has to Christianity.

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:14.160
 That is, Jesus, although Jewish, became the founder of another religion.

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:22.160
 And for Judaism, that's not only in as much as Christians and Jews have had a lot of interactions, but religiously, Jesus has no significance.

1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:25.160
 Said many beautiful things, said some things I don't like so much.

1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:31.160
 Like what? Leave your father and mother and follow me. I don't like that as a religious model.

1:16:31.160 --> 1:16:41.160
 Now, Christians will say that I don't understand that, but that's because Christians, like Jews, interpret their texts different ways at different times.

1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:48.160
 So anyway, the Koran, which I know less well.

1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:54.160
 I have read it, but I know it less well than I know the New Testament and certainly less well, obviously, than I know the Hebrew Bible.

1:16:54.160 --> 1:17:03.160
 In some ways, parts of it are, I don't say this word.

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:08.160
 I say this word because I can't find a better descriptive word, but Muslims will not accept this.

1:17:08.160 --> 1:17:11.160
 Is it take off on the Torah in some things?

1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:14.160
 That is, it's the same stories as the Torah, but they're different.

1:17:14.160 --> 1:17:22.160
 Now, Jews will say, and I being a Jew will say this, that that's because Muhammad heard those stories from Jews and also heard Midrashim,

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:26.160
 which are rabbinic interpretations of those stories, and he wrote those down.

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:32.160
 Muslims will say, no, the Jews got it wrong, and Muhammad came along to correct the record and tell the real story.

1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:37.160
 But they're all telling the story of the same thing.

1:17:37.160 --> 1:17:48.160
 The Hebrew Bible part, the Abrahamic part, they all tell the story of the same characters, but tell them, obviously, Christians accept the Hebrew Bible as sacred scripture.

1:17:48.160 --> 1:17:54.160
 The Muslims retell many of the stories in the Bible.

1:17:54.160 --> 1:18:00.160
 What is common to all of them is that all of them are monotheistic faiths.

1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:12.160
 Now, in Christianity, that's more complicated because of the Trinity, but as Christianity has developed over time, it clearly presents itself and thinks of itself and is a monotheistic faith as well.

1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:18.160
 What's the role of the word in each of these religions in the scriptures?

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:29.160
 So first of all, the role of oral traditions, the power of the exactness of the words in the scripture, does it differ, or is it really within the communities it differs?

1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:36.160
 It differs because in Christianity, the words are not all the words of Jesus.

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:45.160
 They're the words of Jesus's disciples. None of the books of the New Testament were written by people who met Jesus in person, so they're different.

1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:54.160
 And also, we don't even know sometimes the original language of some of the things in the New Testament.

1:18:54.160 --> 1:19:14.160
 In the Bible, and I understand in the Quran, but I'll speak for the Hebrew Bible, the idea is that that's Lashon Hakodesh, that's sacred language, and Hebrew is, that's the language according to the tradition that God actually spoke to Moses, and therefore the exact words are infinitely interpretable and meaningful.

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:22.160
 But the words are spoken but written by Moses, and the same with Muhammad, but from memory?

1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:24.160
 No.

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:31.160
 There are different theories. I won't speak for Muhammad. You should ask. I don't want to get that wrong. I don't want to get another religious tradition wrong.

1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:41.160
 In Judaism, the words are written by Moses at God's dictation, basically. That's the traditional view. There are other views that I'm happy to go into if you want to, but basically that's the traditional view.

1:19:41.160 --> 1:19:43.160
 So it's pretty close.

1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:55.160
 What makes Judaism and Christianity different is Christianity has an ideal life. Judaism doesn't have an ideal life. Judaism has an ideal book.

1:19:55.160 --> 1:20:03.160
 So the holidays of Christianity are events in the life of God, God's birth, God's death and resurrection.

1:20:03.160 --> 1:20:15.160
 In Judaism, the holidays are all events in the life of the people, like the liberation from slavery, or in the people's relationship to God, like Yom Kippur, which is a day of atonement.

1:20:15.160 --> 1:20:24.160
 But there are no holidays in Judaism that are events in the life of God because in Judaism, God doesn't have a biography. God is eternal, and God never came to earth.

1:20:24.160 --> 1:20:37.160
 And those events carry with them traditions and rules that you're to follow. I mentioned on one such event in Scripture, yet another time you walked through the fire, which is with Exodus.

1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:39.160
 That was the first.

1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:47.160
 And you never forget the first. One of several controversies.

1:20:47.160 --> 1:20:59.160
 You spoke 20 years ago, 21 years ago, now it passed over and said that, quote, the way the Bible describes the Exodus is not the way it happened if it happened at all.

1:20:59.160 --> 1:21:03.160
 So first of all, what is Exodus? And what really happened?

1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:08.160
 Exodus is the liberation of the Jews from Egypt, and it is the central story of the Jewish tradition.

1:21:08.160 --> 1:21:17.160
 And as I've said numerous times in various places, I believe that it's based on a historical kernel.

1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:25.160
 I think Richard Eliot Friedman may have gotten this right in his book Exodus. It may have been the Levites who left Israel.

1:21:25.160 --> 1:21:30.160
 But historically, but the Bible is not a book of history.

1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:48.160
 I don't believe that there were 10 plagues and a split sea and 600,000 men, which makes about 2 million people, who actually, if there were 2 million people would stretch all the way from Israel to Egypt alone, were liberated from Egypt.

1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:53.160
 And my point in that sermon was not actually to convince people that it didn't happen.

1:21:53.160 --> 1:22:02.160
 My point in that sermon was to convince people that the historicity of the Exodus is not the basis of the faith of the Jewish people.

1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:04.160
 Well, what does the word historicity mean?

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:07.160
 In other words, the factuality of it. It can be true without being factual.

1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:10.160
 So you're not supposed to read it as facts?

1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:14.160
 Well, I don't read it as fact. I don't read it as a history book.

1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:18.160
 I said, look, I was talking again to a congregation that had many Iranians.

1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:22.160
 I said, you experienced the truth of the Exodus in your own life.

1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:30.160
 There was a regime that wanted to destroy you and you miraculously escaped before it did.

1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:39.160
 And so a myth is something that may not have happened, but is always happening.

1:22:39.160 --> 1:22:42.160
 And that's what I would say about the Exodus story.

1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:46.160
 It's not about whether, in fact, there was a killing of the firstborn.

1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:52.160
 It's about, does God deliver? Did God deliver the Jews in ancient times? Does God deliver people in modern times?

1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:55.160
 And that's what the issue is.

1:22:55.160 --> 1:23:02.160
 And to me, the issue of faith is much deeper than the issue of fact.

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:05.160
 I wouldn't look to the Torah for my science either.

1:23:05.160 --> 1:23:17.160
 What are the limits of science in terms of, what can science not tell us that the Torah can in terms of wisdom?

1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:27.160
 So the historicity, the facts of things, okay, if the Torah is much more than that, is it's, like you said, myth.

1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:31.160
 Myth is not something that happened, but something that is always happening.

1:23:31.160 --> 1:23:39.160
 And so presumably it's interacting with the environment of the day to generate wisdom.

1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:45.160
 So you can live a life by Torah. I don't think you can live a life by biology.

1:23:45.160 --> 1:23:52.160
 You can live a life that is informed by the values of the tradition of Judaism.

1:23:52.160 --> 1:24:04.160
 And those values, by the way, what science does is it contributes factuality to the conversation and also changes the reality around us.

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:13.160
 So when you study Talmud on your iPhone, you know, you're still, I mean, it changes the atmosphere in which you do it.

1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:23.160
 But the wisdom and the life guidance and the connection to transcendence is something that science doesn't give.

1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:31.160
 So if we now step into returning to our friend Sam Harris and step into this weird place of science,

1:24:31.160 --> 1:24:38.160
 and you talked about this, where the kind of the current assumption of science is it's a materialistic one.

1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:44.160
 So for me, obviously AI person, this whole mind thing is fascinating.

1:24:44.160 --> 1:24:46.160
 Like what the heck is going on up there?

1:24:46.160 --> 1:24:51.160
 So how do you explain consciousness? How do you explain free will?

1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:57.160
 Do you think, first of all, do you think we have a free will? And if so, what is it?

1:24:57.160 --> 1:25:12.160
 This is where we had the debate earlier that I mentioned with Hitchens, where I think actually neither he nor the moderator understood what I was saying, which is I'm sure my inability to express it.

1:25:12.160 --> 1:25:17.160
 But he was very focused and delivered on the humor and the wit.

1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:31.160
 Yes. But what I was trying to say is, if we're entirely biological creatures, if we didn't choose our genetics and we didn't choose our environment, then there is no space for free choice.

1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:37.160
 I don't understand where it comes in. And I kept asking them that question, but didn't get an answer because I don't think there is an answer.

1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:43.160
 I think if you're a thoroughgoing materialist, free will is impossible.

1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:48.160
 There could be randomness, but randomness is not free will. It's randomness.

1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:58.160
 I think you need a spiritual nonmaterial belief in order to get free will. And that's why I believe in free will.

1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:14.160
 Okay, you were talking about, and actually the moderator totally missed your point about the glass of water and basically how was the difference. So do you free will, because you could also, if it fits into the materialistic picture, it could be just a convenient, useful quirk.

1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:21.160
 You would understand this better than I would. I don't understand how it could be a convenient quirk materialistically. I don't understand how to explain it.

1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:37.160
 If you study perception, there's all these kinds of illusions. Our mind plays tricks on us to make our life easier, more efficient, and survive better and all those kinds of things. And so free the feeling like we have a choice.

1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:45.160
 Oh, that could be an illusion. That I understand. But actual free choice, free will. I don't see where you get it if you're a materialist.

1:26:45.160 --> 1:27:07.160
 I think you have to have a spiritual component. By the way, I think Sam would agree with this. I think he wrote about not having free will. And I think if you don't have a God and you don't have a soul, that free will is a logical impossibility.

1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:24.160
 Sam, which is fascinating, it's not just that free will is an illusion, but the illusion of free will is an illusion, meaning we don't even experience anything like it. There's no illusion. It's not even honest to be talking about it.

1:27:24.160 --> 1:27:44.160
 We're just, we are like the current in the river or something. You were comparing it to the glass. We are just like that glass. I don't know what we're going on about with this whole free will thing. I mean, to use the free will, the eye that a young person is born with, is that somehow fundamental to religion?

1:27:44.160 --> 1:28:13.160
 It's fundamental to Judaism. I think that the idea is that you are the custodian of your soul. And even though I grant that there's a certain over emphasis in modern society on the individuality of the soul, that is, we are more interconnected than I think we believe.

1:28:13.160 --> 1:28:33.160
 Still, yeah, the eye, the idea that every human being is an image of God that, I mean, that the human being in the Torah is created singly. And again, do I really believe there was an Adam and an Eve and a Garden of Eden? No, not literally, but I think that it expresses a deep truth about human life.

1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:38.160
 And tied into this, is this subjective experience of things which we call consciousness?

1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:59.160
 I mean, this is the most fascinating and inexplicable discussion. And again, this is a discussion I've had, I privileged to have with Daniel Dennett and could not make any, as you can imagine, any headway on my, but he was delightful and brilliant to talk to.

1:28:59.160 --> 1:29:17.160
 For me, consciousness is a real thing. I don't know if it is, I mean, I kind of like the panpsychist's view that there's an element of consciousness in everything, that that's constitutive of reality.

1:29:17.160 --> 1:29:30.160
 But I don't, I'm not wedded to it. But I think that it's, it exists in different degrees and all sentient creatures. I think that anybody who has a pet knows that they have some kind of consciousness.

1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:32.160
 Except cats.

1:29:32.160 --> 1:29:37.160
 I'm not going to, since I don't have cats or dogs, I'm not going to.

1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:39.160
 This is another reason people be outraged.

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:43.160
 Well, I happen to be allergic to both, but I'm very fond of animals.

1:29:43.160 --> 1:29:57.160
 The thing that so perplexes me about this and is the denial of the reality of consciousness from people who are fully aware that they're conscious.

1:29:57.160 --> 1:30:07.160
 I don't know how you divest yourself of the most present quality of being a person in your discussions about what it is to be a person.

1:30:07.160 --> 1:30:14.160
 We just don't really have a good sense of the alternative. And so you can kind of divest yourself in that way. Well, maybe everything is like this.

1:30:14.160 --> 1:30:18.160
 Maybe we're trying, we're over dramatizing this whole thing.

1:30:18.160 --> 1:30:28.160
 It seems like every living thing, perhaps everything period thinks that it's the center of the universe.

1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:33.160
 And so here we are telling ourselves these dramatic big stories about us being special and so on.

1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:40.160
 And maybe we need to have a little bit more humility, both about the uncertainty and about our place in the whole.

1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:46.160
 Any statement you make about something like consciousness has, I think, a sort of equal level of humility.

1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:55.160
 You're saying that you know we don't have it is as not you, Lex, but you person saying we don't have it is as intellectually arrogant as my saying we do.

1:30:55.160 --> 1:31:04.160
 So I think for me, humility comes in in admitting that we really, really have just the tiniest part of the puzzle.

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:14.160
 And as you get older, at least my experience has been not that you get more answers, but that you just see a bigger puzzle.

1:31:14.160 --> 1:31:29.160
 So to me, there is less. So the questions are fascinating, but there's also an engineering practical question. And perhaps I'll ask you a religious one too on this point to return back to robots.

1:31:29.160 --> 1:31:43.160
 So how to engineer consciousness, or I'll just even ask you a very simple question, which is when you have robots that exhibit the capacity to suffer.

1:31:43.160 --> 1:31:48.160
 I found in myself as a human, when I see that, I feel something.

1:31:48.160 --> 1:31:56.160
 Exhibit the capacity to suffer or they exhibit behaviors that evoke in you a sense that they are suffering. Those aren't the same things.

1:31:56.160 --> 1:32:01.160
 From an observation perspective, they sure as heck seem similar.

1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:03.160
 Do you think they're feeling pain?

1:32:03.160 --> 1:32:08.160
 I don't know. I'm observing pain.

1:32:08.160 --> 1:32:17.160
 It's like when I watch a movie and there's people on screen, some of them are dressed like Batman.

1:32:17.160 --> 1:32:31.160
 But you can make the distinction. Like if I have a doll and I bend the doll over and it makes a sad face, I know that that doll is not actually in pain, even though I am observing pain.

1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:33.160
 So the question, what's that?

1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:51.160
 The question is when the doll becomes able to remember things about you, David, about the experiences you shared, it is able to speak and make you feel like there's an actual relationship.

1:32:51.160 --> 1:33:10.160
 So that's what I'm asking, is at what point do you believe that the, and I know that this is an impossible question, but at what point do you believe that there is a consciousness in there as opposed to just an extraordinary, I mean, like when I play chess against a computer and it beats me.

1:33:10.160 --> 1:33:28.160
 I'm embarrassed even though the computer doesn't, I don't think the computer is going, ah, you idiot, but it feels that way. But there is some part of me that says, okay, I know that this computer doesn't actually know who I am or care who I am, it just knows how to move the pieces.

1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:39.160
 So at what point do you, I mean, you're giving me instances, it speaks, it does this, it does this, but at what point does that for you cross the threshold into it's actually a sentient being?

1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:54.160
 I think the question is whether there is a threshold that could be crossed. That's one question. And I can answer this because I think it's different from person to person, but the chess engine is not at all trying to cross that threshold.

1:33:54.160 --> 1:34:16.160
 Let's just start there. And to me, the personalization, which is what's the difference, like a friend that you meet, you've shared all these memories. The way they look at you will convey, and the things they say will convey that they've shared those memories with you.

1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:25.160
 They'll be able to speak in the shared humor and the language, but really the memories is the big one of having gone through things together.

1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:36.160
 I think I would have more and more trouble, for example, turning off a system that I've been through things with.

1:34:36.160 --> 1:34:53.160
 And by turning off, I mean, delete all of its memory. If me and the toaster have gone through a bunch of dramatic events and that toaster remembers, there's a certain level to where like, it's just me and the toaster and this together at this point.

1:34:53.160 --> 1:34:58.160
 And just to talk about sentience, I don't know, but you know.

1:34:58.160 --> 1:35:11.160
 I don't know. It's according to the scripture, can't live by bread alone. But I would, I mean, I know that there's no way to determine this, but it's still about what you feel.

1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:15.160
 Yes. But isn't that what human relations are also, though?

1:35:15.160 --> 1:35:17.160
 Yes, but we make each other feel.

1:35:17.160 --> 1:35:34.160
 It's true, but it's true that I have the assumption that you feel somewhat like I do. I mean, obviously, I don't, you know, and that could be illusion and I don't know. And I know that you don't feel exactly as I do.

1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:49.160
 But I think we have a long, at least to me, we have a long way to go before the detached part of our brains. That is, the objective evaluating part, as opposed to the emotive, it feels this way part, believe that that machine has consciousness.

1:35:49.160 --> 1:36:11.160
 I think it's at least, without arriving at conclusions, it's at least possible that one day we will look back and realize that we have yet, once again, formed another tribe and that scripture all along had in it the ability for humans and robots to have a deep, meaningful connection.

1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:20.160
 And that, through the robot, the life that enters the body of another robot, what's the difference between a biological body and a mechanical one?

1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:34.160
 And then we will see that the fundamental thing is about the, whatever you want to call it, sentience, whatever can permeate an object. That was the thing all along.

1:36:34.160 --> 1:36:36.160
 So, I mean...

1:36:36.160 --> 1:36:38.160
 And then you'll get cancelled one more time.

1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:41.160
 Because I denied it. I was going to say...

1:36:41.160 --> 1:36:44.160
 You'll eventually convince it.

1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:45.160
 I'll preach to the robots.

1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:46.160
 I'm hoping.

1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:47.160
 I'm hoping.

1:36:47.160 --> 1:36:55.160
 Look, I, first of all, depends how quickly you do it and how much longer I have to live.

1:36:55.160 --> 1:37:11.160
 I resist it tremendously, but I am also enough of a student of history to know that my instinctive resistance has nothing to do with whether it will come about.

1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:13.160
 I have a hard time believing it.

1:37:13.160 --> 1:37:15.160
 We'll see.

1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:25.160
 Can I ask you about this? Maybe you can educate me. I tend to believe that we mentioned suffering, that there is a connection between consciousness and suffering.

1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:28.160
 That suffering is a fundamental part...

1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:31.160
 The capacity to suffer is the fundamental part of being human.

1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:34.160
 I mean, we look at when you're not conscious, you don't suffer.

1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:40.160
 You know, we've had operations where we've been put under anesthetic and we're not conscious and we don't suffer during the operation.

1:37:40.160 --> 1:37:43.160
 If we were conscious, we would.

1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:49.160
 But there's also, I mean, there's a nonphysical suffering that is very much tied to consciousness.

1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:59.160
 I can think of things right now that will cause me suffering, like pain that I've caused or pain that other people I care about have felt or so on.

1:37:59.160 --> 1:38:03.160
 So I don't see how...

1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:06.160
 I think that way, I think it's equally true of joy.

1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:09.160
 Joy is also a product of consciousness.

1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:17.160
 It's all tied in in some beautiful, messy way with memory and so on that we can reexperience it when we recall the memories.

1:38:17.160 --> 1:38:21.160
 But why is there suffering? You mentioned evil. Why is there evil in the world?

1:38:21.160 --> 1:38:24.160
 You can tell stories about this.

1:38:24.160 --> 1:38:29.160
 Why is there suffering? Why is there evil in the world if there's a God that cares for us?

1:38:29.160 --> 1:38:35.160
 So let's assume for a minute that everything was a primitive robot.

1:38:35.160 --> 1:38:39.160
 There would be no suffering, but there would also be no growth.

1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:43.160
 And that implies choices.

1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:52.160
 One of the things that I've said that I know why it hurts people and I don't mean it quite the way that...

1:38:52.160 --> 1:39:04.160
 But I will say it nonetheless, is the Holocaust presents the exact same theological question as somebody who gets shot on the streets of a city in Los Angeles.

1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:10.160
 Which is, God, why do you allow some people to do bad things to other people?

1:39:10.160 --> 1:39:13.160
 It's on an unimaginable scale, but it's the same question.

1:39:13.160 --> 1:39:18.160
 And the answer has to be you either allow people that free will or you don't.

1:39:18.160 --> 1:39:23.160
 You can't say as God, I'm going to have let everybody have free will, but not Nazis.

1:39:23.160 --> 1:39:29.160
 Nazis don't get free will because Cambodians, they can kill each other.

1:39:29.160 --> 1:39:33.160
 Rwandans kill each other, but the Nazis don't get to do that.

1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:38.160
 So that's one piece of the puzzle.

1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:45.160
 And what makes it unfathomable is when you're actually faced with suffering, these kinds of explanations are obscene.

1:39:45.160 --> 1:39:46.160
 They just are.

1:39:46.160 --> 1:39:47.160
 You can't...

1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:53.160
 I mean, when somebody is actually suffering, oh, the rabbi said, God gave people free will, that's just awful.

1:39:53.160 --> 1:39:59.160
 But there is a second piece to this also, which is that there is natural suffering.

1:39:59.160 --> 1:40:05.160
 Like children were with diseases or earthquakes or volcanoes or whatever.

1:40:05.160 --> 1:40:15.160
 And here my argument is that in some way suffering has to be random in the world because when people say, why do bad things happen to good people?

1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:18.160
 Well, if only good things happen to good people, everybody would be good.

1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:21.160
 But it would have no moral content.

1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:28.160
 The only way you can be good and it have moral content is say, I know that I can live a really good life and have really terrible things happen to me nonetheless.

1:40:28.160 --> 1:40:33.160
 So it feels to me like it has to be a randomly.

1:40:33.160 --> 1:40:39.160
 Now that means, by the way, that I've been incredibly lucky.

1:40:39.160 --> 1:40:42.160
 I don't have a good life because I was good.

1:40:42.160 --> 1:40:44.160
 I have a good life because I was lucky.

1:40:44.160 --> 1:40:52.160
 And that implies not that I should feel guilty about it, but that I have a tremendous responsibility as a result to other people who aren't so lucky.

1:40:52.160 --> 1:41:05.160
 Tremendous responsibility to study the lessons of history, to tell the stories of those who are less lucky and to draw enough wisdom from them so that we have less cruelty and suffering in the world.

1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:09.160
 Or have new kinds that get us to improve even more.

1:41:09.160 --> 1:41:10.160
 That's right. Exactly.

1:41:10.160 --> 1:41:11.160
 That we suffer better.

1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:13.160
 Suffer better.

1:41:13.160 --> 1:41:27.160
 For a lot of people, mortality is one of the very unfortunate versions of suffering, which is that the ride ends in this realm, whatever it is.

1:41:27.160 --> 1:41:29.160
 What do you think of mortality?

1:41:29.160 --> 1:41:31.160
 Is it something you think about?

1:41:31.160 --> 1:41:33.160
 Is it something you fear?

1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:37.160
 What do you think happens after we die?

1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:39.160
 I don't fear it.

1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:46.160
 First of all, I would say when I was in high school, I think my father actually encouraged me to read this book.

1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:55.160
 I read Ernest Becker's Denial of Death, which I found and still find to be one of the most profound works I've ever come across.

1:41:55.160 --> 1:42:08.160
 And he convinced me that a lot of what our society is about are ways that we avoid encountering our own mortality, our physicality.

1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:15.160
 I mean, one of the points he makes, and I'm not quoting him at all directly, is like, why does everything about our physical body make us so uncomfortable?

1:42:15.160 --> 1:42:20.160
 Everything that comes out of you, other than tears, is either mildly or very disgusting.

1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:22.160
 Why? Why does that have to be?

1:42:22.160 --> 1:42:28.160
 Why are sex and eating and all the things that are physical surrounded with so much symbolism?

1:42:28.160 --> 1:42:30.160
 I mean, what are table manners, really?

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:34.160
 They're like, we're not eating like animals because we're not eating like animals.

1:42:34.160 --> 1:42:38.160
 And sex, obviously, has more symbolism around it than anything.

1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:42.160
 And his answer is anything that reminds you that you're a physical body because that's what dies.

1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:46.160
 Your body dies, it decays, it dies, it gets eaten by worms.

1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:49.160
 That you don't want to think about, so you deny it.

1:42:49.160 --> 1:43:00.160
 I think that part of religion is a confrontation with your own mortality, but also a certain transcendence of it because the idea is something about you is eternal.

1:43:00.160 --> 1:43:06.160
 What exactly I don't know, and you ask, what do I think happens after we die?

1:43:06.160 --> 1:43:13.160
 So I don't know any better than anyone else does, but I will, I'll say two things about it.

1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:20.160
 One is that every image of what it's like is foolish.

1:43:20.160 --> 1:43:28.160
 Like Mark Twain has, I think in Letters from Earth, he says, we're going to lie on green fields and listen to harp music, which you wouldn't want to do for five minutes while you're alive.

1:43:28.160 --> 1:43:31.160
 But you think you'll be happy for the rest of eternity doing it after you die.

1:43:31.160 --> 1:43:36.160
 So I don't know, this world was a surprise, so why shouldn't the next world be a surprise?

1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:37.160
 I have no idea.

1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:48.160
 But I really like this parable that's told by a guy in a book on death and mourning by a rabbi and a book on death and mourning about twins in a womb.

1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:54.160
 He says, one of them believes that there's a life outside and the other one doesn't.

1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:59.160
 He says, the one who doesn't says, look, this is the only world we've ever seen, the only world we've ever known.

1:43:59.160 --> 1:44:01.160
 Why do you think there's something out there?

1:44:01.160 --> 1:44:05.160
 He says, now imagine the one who believes is born.

1:44:05.160 --> 1:44:10.160
 Back in the womb, his brother is mourning a death, but outside, everybody's celebrating a birth.

1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:12.160
 He said, and that's what it's like when you die.

1:44:12.160 --> 1:44:14.160
 And I love that image.

1:44:14.160 --> 1:44:16.160
 Yeah, the grass is always greener.

1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:20.160
 It's the new step, but the eternity thing is an interesting one.

1:44:20.160 --> 1:44:26.160
 It's yet another concept that I feel humans are fully inequipped to comprehend.

1:44:26.160 --> 1:44:30.160
 Is eternity fundamental somehow to all of these discussions?

1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:31.160
 I think it is.

1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:41.160
 Well, partly because God is supposed to be eternal and therefore it moves the mind in that direction even though it is completely unfathomable.

1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:52.160
 Because sometimes I would say eternity, you said on a green field, sometimes a moment, like a truly joyful moment feels like an eternity, the intensity of it.

1:44:52.160 --> 1:44:58.160
 Maybe eternity is more about stopping time versus extending time indefinitely.

1:44:58.160 --> 1:45:03.160
 And it's something that we just totally can't comprehend us silly humans.

1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:12.160
 All I would say is the older you get, the more you're struck by the fact that time does not freeze.

1:45:12.160 --> 1:45:19.160
 People will sometimes say to me, you have an age today, and then I'll look at an old picture of myself.

1:45:19.160 --> 1:45:23.160
 And I'll say, that was very kind of you, but that's not true.

1:45:23.160 --> 1:45:25.160
 It's not true.

1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:33.160
 So yeah, I mean, I love the idea of seeing eternity in a grain of sand was how Blake put it, I love that notion.

1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:51.160
 But when you talk about life after death, I really, I think that in some ways my fundamental faith is in human beings, that this doesn't all disappear, that there's something about people that transcends this world.

1:45:51.160 --> 1:46:00.160
 You mentioned Ernest Becker in high school and the amount of death, maybe you can mention if you still see truth and wisdom and some of this idea.

1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:08.160
 But in general, can you go all the way back and tell some of the fascinating story of how you found faith?

1:46:08.160 --> 1:46:14.160
 When I was in high school, I was a really pretty ardent atheist.

1:46:14.160 --> 1:46:29.160
 And I loved Bertrand Russell, who was, for my money, with all due respect to all the very, very capable people that we've talked about earlier, he's the best atheist pound for pound that there was.

1:46:29.160 --> 1:46:37.160
 And a remarkably witty and lucid writer, and I was totally in his thrall, and I would read every book by Russell I could get my hands on.

1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:58.160
 And the reason that I did, I have this theory that why do adolescent boys like Mr. Spock and like Sherlock Holmes, I think it's because when you hit puberty, for a lot of us, there's so much discomfort with our bodies that we like the idea that we're just brains.

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:08.160
 I really think so. I had that experience. It's like, I want to just be a thinking machine. I don't want to be a body because my body was making me so uncomfortable.

1:47:08.160 --> 1:47:23.160
 I had all these urges and inclinations that I couldn't control. So Russell was perfect. And my father, who was a rabbi, did the very wise thing of buying me some of Bertrand Russell's books, which was his way of saying, I'm not afraid of him.

1:47:23.160 --> 1:47:35.160
 And actually, there was another rabbi. I was at summer camp, and I was sitting on the porch of the, I remember exactly, and I was reading Bertrand Russell, and this guy came up to me and said, what are you reading?

1:47:35.160 --> 1:47:47.160
 I was maybe 16 or 17. And I said, Bertrand Russell, I was spoiling for a fight. And he said, I'm glad you're reading him. I said, really, why? He goes, how old are you, David? And I said, whatever I was, 16, 17.

1:47:47.160 --> 1:48:04.160
 He said, well, I'd rather you grow out of him than grow into him. And you know what? He was actually right because when I started to read about Russell's life, I realized that all of that rationality didn't shield him.

1:48:04.160 --> 1:48:22.160
 He had an incredibly messy life, multiple marriages, endless infidelities, family members he didn't speak to, he didn't speak to him. It was raised by his grandparents because his parents had died and really not a happy or, I mean, a remarkable life, but not a happy one.

1:48:22.160 --> 1:48:47.160
 And so I started to believe that maybe it was possible that people who had faith were not just stupid and needed crutches, but saw something deeper than Russell did. And the more people that I met that were like that, it's funny because I always thought, okay, my father is a rabbi, that's great, but nobody else.

1:48:47.160 --> 1:49:03.160
 And I think what happened to me was it was not a logical decision to come to faith. It was a sort of opening of my heart. It's like this world is way much more than my mind can capture. And I've kind of felt my way to God.

1:49:03.160 --> 1:49:20.160
 And in the moments, my faith, you know, there was a rabbi named Rabbi Nachman of Brotslav, he said he was a moon man, his faith waxed and waned. So sometimes I have more, sometimes less. But in my feeling girl moments is when I have more.

1:49:20.160 --> 1:49:33.160
 So with your heart open, what would you say in your feeling girl moments is the most beautiful part about Judaism and your faith?

1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:52.160
 I think the most beautiful part about Judaism is that even though it is filled with humor and wit, it takes life and it takes the soul seriously. It really believes that this matters and that we matter and what we do matters.

1:49:52.160 --> 1:50:18.160
 And I think that that's incredibly important. And especially in a world in which young people feel so much like they don't matter. That's an unbelievably powerful message. I mean, you know, it's, you don't, I want to say like almost to every young woman under 30 on TikTok, you don't matter because you're beautiful.

1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:30.160
 That's not why you matter. I hope you know that you matter because you have a soul. And to every young man who's like nihilistic and doesn't think and just thinks that if they make enough money, their life will be fine.

1:50:30.160 --> 1:50:48.160
 I want to say the same thing, which is really that's not ultimately you matter because you're in the image of God and Judaism really deeply, deeply believes and preaches that. And I think that that's a message that has so much to say to the world.

1:50:48.160 --> 1:51:06.160
 It's like, you have to take people's souls seriously. And for all of the difficulty in figuring out all these social questions and what they mean, I just don't want to dismiss people because I disagree with them politically or socially or culturally, because I think they matter.

1:51:06.160 --> 1:51:30.160
 So ultimately, Judaism has a wealth of meaning. Yes. For a human mind. I really believe that it does. I really do. And it's meaning, and I want to emphasize this, is not political. The deepest meaning of Judaism is not political.

1:51:30.160 --> 1:51:40.160
 Well, there is, we put politics on top of everything. Exactly. But that's why I want to emphasize it. The deepest meaning is on the soul level. It's not on a voting level.

1:51:40.160 --> 1:51:44.160
 Well, that combined with the humor, it's clear to me that Christopher Hitchens should have been a Jew.

1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:50.160
 He was. He actually was. He discovered that in his 30s, that his mother was Jewish.

1:51:50.160 --> 1:51:51.160
 That's fascinating.

1:51:51.160 --> 1:52:11.160
 Yep. He actually, he has a beautiful essay about it, discovering in his 30s that his mother was Jewish. Yep. So remarkably enough, he actually was Jewish. His autobiography, Hitch 22, is a great read. And I just want to say, like, what you discover there, I don't know if I'm giving too much away by telling the story of this.

1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:29.160
 What you discover there is that his mother ran away with a minister or a priest, and they died in what seemed like was a suicide pact. And so I read it, unfortunately, after he passed away. But I would have wanted to ask him, do you think that has anything to do maybe with the hostility towards religion?

1:52:29.160 --> 1:52:31.160
 We are only human.

1:52:31.160 --> 1:52:41.160
 My father, I mean, both my parents, but my father who was a rabbi was such a wonderful, warm and loving man. So I associate a religious figure, you know, with real goodness.

1:52:41.160 --> 1:52:59.160
 And I'm sorry to return to a darker topic, but I really wanted to ask you this. For the current events, for a recent event, I mentioned Dallas. What lessons do you draw from the Dallas synagogue hostage incident?

1:52:59.160 --> 1:53:20.160
 Well, the week after that, we had active shooter training in my synagogues. And one of the things I drew was that security for synagogues is important. And the second is that the reality of antisemitism, which I had thought had waned when I first began my rabbinate, I thought it's not going to be such a big issue.

1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:35.160
 It is like an evergreen issue. And Jews and all people of goodwill have to take this really seriously because it has devastating consequences. And if the world doesn't know that, then it just hasn't been paying attention.

1:53:35.160 --> 1:54:00.160
 So there's antisemitism at a scale of human to human. But there's also, like you mentioned, politics get mixed up into things, nations get mixed into things, impossible to answer. But I have to ask, what do you think about the long running saga of Israel and Palestine? Will we ever see peace in that part of the Middle East?

1:54:00.160 --> 1:54:27.160
 Well, since I'm an optimist about human, look, I mean, I have many, many thoughts about I'm a very, very strong supporter of Israel. And, and I also feel really for the plight of the Palestinians, I think that they're, you know, this is, this is a clash of legitimate narratives that is impossible to exactly split the difference

1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:43.160
 of. However, I know that Israel has made peace with Egypt has made peace with Jordan has made peace now with other Arab nations. I don't believe that Israel is unwilling to make peace.

1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:59.160
 And so I think that as difficult as it will be for the Palestinians to come to grips with the fact that the Jewish state is not leaving and is legitimately here, as opposed to we can't get rid of it now, but we will get rid of it one day.

1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:11.160
 If that comes to be, and I believe that it will, I think not only that there would be peace, but I think that those two peoples together could probably do remarkable things in the world.

1:55:11.160 --> 1:55:37.160
 Do you think the source of it is politics? Is it religious ideas? And to flip it, what is the way out? Is it geopolitics? Is it, you know, interfaith discourse and collaboration? Or is it simply the human, like, love?

1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:52.160
 So I think that I'm not sure that I could give one answer to that, but I will give a piece of an answer. Why did the Abraham Accords happen? The main reason that they happened was because economics overrode ideology.

1:55:52.160 --> 1:56:10.160
 And I actually am hopeful that that's in the end what will happen, that people will say, you know what, we could have such a better life if we put aside the ideological animosities and just created this different kind of Middle East together.

1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:23.160
 I went to Dubai to watch the world chess championship because I really wanted to see Magnus Carlson play. I thought, you're alive when you have such a remarkable world champion, go see him play.

1:56:23.160 --> 1:56:34.160
 So I actually took myself to Dubai for the last couple of games and I watched. And so I wasn't so much, I mean, it's not that I'm uninterested in Dubai, but I really, I went there for the chess thing.

1:56:34.160 --> 1:56:43.160
 The Expo was also on at the same time and I saw, here's this amazing place. I came back. This guy I know who lived in Dubai for several years and works in the Middle East said to me, what did you think of it?

1:56:43.160 --> 1:56:56.160
 And I said, this is Dubai. It was like very, you know, very polished, very sophisticated, very clean, very no crime and so on. But it was like, you know, kind of like Las Vegas in the Middle East without the gambling or something like that.

1:56:56.160 --> 1:57:10.160
 And he said, you know, he totally changed my perspective in a couple sentences. He said, I know it seems like that when you come from Los Angeles. He said, but fly there from Yemen or from Riyadh. And it is a miracle.

1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:23.160
 And I thought, oh my God, you're right. It's like what human beings can do if they just put aside their ideological shackles is remarkable. And I'm hopeful that one day that'll happen.

1:57:23.160 --> 1:57:38.160
 Economics allows for higher quality of life. You no longer, it's the playground analogy. You said earlier, if there's more resources to play with, unfortunately, us humans are more willing to play with others.

1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:58.160
 And maybe that is the solution. And maybe, I mean, for me, from a technology perspective, innovation, engineering helps make everybody's life better. And over that, once people's lives become better, they start to be, have more time to be empathetic and hear people.

1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:14.160
 And they have more to lose. When you have more to lose, it actually makes you, I think countries are less willing to go to war when they have more to lose. And families want peace when it's good at home. So I think there's an element of that as well.

1:58:14.160 --> 1:58:32.160
 And some of it, again, taking us back to the other aspect of our conversations, how we're conducting ourselves in conversation online and so on. Because I think actually, I'm a big fan of the idea of social media, that is a way for us to connect together.

1:58:32.160 --> 1:58:52.160
 I think there's a lot of really strong ideas how to do that well. And clearly, the initial attempts that kind of just open it up wide, some of the lesser aspects of human nature can take over when combined with different forces like advertisements and virology and all those kinds of things.

1:58:52.160 --> 1:59:13.160
 But overall, I love the honesty of the mess of it being presented before us on social media. Part of me, maybe because I don't participate it, like if somebody is being mean to me or being aggressive and these kinds of things, I enjoy it because it's human nature.

1:59:13.160 --> 1:59:25.160
 But I enjoy it because I don't respond. I think if I responded, I would get pulled into this human nature and then it's not fun. But I love the, like I'll talk to people. In fact, I still visit clubhouse. I don't know if you know what that is.

1:59:25.160 --> 1:59:26.160
 Sure.

1:59:26.160 --> 1:59:27.160
 Oh, right. That's right.

1:59:27.160 --> 1:59:29.160
 I think that's how we first met.

1:59:29.160 --> 1:59:48.160
 Well, yeah. Well, I was such a fanboy. I actually, when I first heard you and I was like, I can't believe I get you. But the Israel Palestine topic was something that was very deeply in a heated way, discussed on clubhouse.

1:59:48.160 --> 2:00:06.160
 Race relations is a thing that was really heatedly discussed. And I now go to clubhouse to practice Russian. And there in Russian, the heated discussion is on basically any topic as meaningless or meaningful as you want and the heat of it.

2:00:06.160 --> 2:00:21.160
 Just people just screaming and then calming down and going through the full process. And that too is beautiful because that emotion is there. And if it is allowed to have a voice, I think ultimately it leads to healing.

2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:26.160
 So that felt really healthy if you learn how to do that at scale.

2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:40.160
 Social media, I wish that it were not as algorithmically biased towards conflict. I don't think that that's healthy. But I do, I think it brings a lot of blessings into people's lives if they use it wisely.

2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:53.160
 You know, it can, like anything else, it can be awful. But it can't, I've connected to all sorts of people that I never would have known. And that's been wonderful.

2:00:53.160 --> 2:01:07.160
 Let me ask you the big question of advice. What advice would you give to young people today? Or maybe high school, college, thinking about career, thinking about life that can be proud of?

2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:21.160
 So the first thing that I would say is that life is longer than you think it is. Even though I understand the impulse to be in a rush, you will have many unfoldings.

2:01:21.160 --> 2:01:24.160
 More even than people of my generation did.

2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:27.160
 Unfoldings. That's such a funny word. It's a beautiful word.

2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:37.160
 But it feels that way. It's like different aspects of your life will come, will show you different possibilities that you don't imagine at the moment.

2:01:37.160 --> 2:01:58.160
 And I think the second thing that I would say is, I know that this is a very old fashioned, but I would say don't, to the extent that you can read, don't just, and not just on social media, read books,

2:01:58.160 --> 2:02:07.160
 learn things that will give you a broader context for your life than just today or yesterday or the day before.

2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:36.160
 And I suppose the other thing that I would say is that to the extent that you can, try to develop your own internal metric of both what matters and what is good, because you will be exposed to more voices than any generation in history telling you that that's good or this is good.

2:02:36.160 --> 2:02:43.160
 They're called influencers, but what they are is voices telling you what you should think and what you should believe.

2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:54.160
 And so have some internal space where you'll be able to say, for example, I know this person is doing that and it looks great, but that's not me.

2:02:54.160 --> 2:03:13.160
 You have a community of people that speak to you with a lot of passion, and do you still have that voice in your own, in the privacy of your own mind that you're able to ignore, like for a moment, just be with yourself.

2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:14.160
 Absolutely.

2:03:14.160 --> 2:03:15.160
 Think what is right.

2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:16.160
 Absolutely.

2:03:16.160 --> 2:03:19.160
 And I think it's partly because I grew up without that.

2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:24.160
 I mean, I grew up with a lot of space in my life, and so I had a chance to develop that voice.

2:03:24.160 --> 2:03:28.160
 That's why I think it's harder for kids today than it was for me.

2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:30.160
 I mean, I grew up when there were three channels.

2:03:30.160 --> 2:03:31.160
 There was three, six, and ten.

2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:34.160
 There was ABC, CBS, and NBC, and that was it.

2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:39.160
 And you spent your evening, you know, playing board games or reading or whatever, and there was a lot of space.

2:03:39.160 --> 2:03:48.160
 And we played football in the street, and you went on your bike in the morning, and nobody worried about you, and you came home at night, and everybody assumed you were fine.

2:03:48.160 --> 2:04:00.160
 And so I really feel, and also I went into a religious tradition where I feel like I have the opportunity to judge myself by bigger metrics.

2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:02.160
 And it's still hard.

2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:06.160
 I don't want to, it's not like, oh, I wear impenetrable armor.

2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:07.160
 It's still hard.

2:04:07.160 --> 2:04:13.160
 So how much harder for kids today when they don't have that?

2:04:13.160 --> 2:04:15.160
 You mentioned books.

2:04:15.160 --> 2:04:20.160
 Is there Bertrand Russell and Denial of Death by Ernest Becker?

2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:25.160
 Is there books that pop into mind that had an impact on you?

2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:27.160
 My favorite novel is Middlemarch.

2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:28.160
 Middlemarch?

2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:29.160
 Middlemarch.

2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:31.160
 I remember, like, I was listening to a podcast.

2:04:31.160 --> 2:04:43.160
 I was listening to one of your podcasts where your guest said the two greatest novels of the 19th century were Brothers Karamazov and what was the other one he mentioned?

2:04:43.160 --> 2:04:44.160
 I don't remember.

2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:45.160
 I don't know.

2:04:45.160 --> 2:04:46.160
 I think it was both.

2:04:46.160 --> 2:04:47.160
 I might have been.

2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:48.160
 I don't remember.

2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:49.160
 Maybe.

2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:51.160
 But anyway, but I would say Middlemarch is up there.

2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:53.160
 Middlemarch, like, presents an entire world.

2:04:53.160 --> 2:05:06.160
 And it's written by a woman, Mary Ann Evans, who took the pen named George Elliott, who you feel, Virginia Woolf said it's the only English novel written for grownups.

2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:11.160
 You feel the genius in her sentences, like the pressure of her intellect in her sentences.

2:05:11.160 --> 2:05:14.160
 It's a beautiful, wonderful book.

2:05:14.160 --> 2:05:15.160
 I love it.

2:05:15.160 --> 2:05:17.160
 Pressure of her intellect.

2:05:17.160 --> 2:05:19.160
 Yeah, you really do.

2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:27.160
 I also love, I love Saul Bellow, especially Herzog, but it's a very different kind of thinking person's novel.

2:05:27.160 --> 2:05:32.160
 I read a lot of mysteries and a lot of other kinds of fiction and literature.

2:05:32.160 --> 2:05:43.160
 But in terms of the books that most, you mentioned one of them, which is Victor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning.

2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:46.160
 And I also really, really love Heschel's The Sabbath.

2:05:46.160 --> 2:05:48.160
 I think it's a beautiful book.

2:05:48.160 --> 2:05:51.160
 It's a very short book, just as Frankl's book is.

2:05:51.160 --> 2:05:54.160
 What do you take from Man's Search for Meaning?

2:05:54.160 --> 2:06:09.160
 What do you take of a human being in the worst conditions, being able to non dramatically find little joys, find beauty.

2:06:09.160 --> 2:06:15.160
 It's what I said before about Judaism's advice to younger people, is that it mattered.

2:06:15.160 --> 2:06:20.160
 If you believe that something matters, you have enormous resilience.

2:06:20.160 --> 2:06:24.160
 It's meaninglessness that is the greatest threat to a decent life.

2:06:24.160 --> 2:06:32.160
 When people are deeply depressed, whether it is chemical depression or what they feel like is this is all meaningless.

2:06:32.160 --> 2:06:47.160
 And meaning, now, obviously, chemical depression calls in part for chemical means, but meaning is the great antidote.

2:06:47.160 --> 2:06:49.160
 We can talk about what kind of meaning.

2:06:49.160 --> 2:07:05.160
 I mean, there are kinds of meanings that are awful, but meaning is the great antidote to a sense that life is just nihilistic and purposeless and to that destructiveness that I think is too common.

2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:18.160
 Yeah, so maybe the heroic action in Nazi Germany, in the Holocaust, in the camps is even not the action, but just the realization that every life matters.

2:07:18.160 --> 2:07:27.160
 So here's this really wonderful story that Hugo Grin, who was a rabbi in England, died, I don't know, like 15, 20 years ago.

2:07:27.160 --> 2:07:29.160
 He used to tell, he grew up in Auschwitz.

2:07:29.160 --> 2:07:35.160
 He was a child there and he was with his father and it was Hanukkah and you're supposed to light the candles.

2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:39.160
 And his father took the margarine ration and used it as the oil to light the Hanukkah candles.

2:07:39.160 --> 2:07:49.160
 And Hugo was scandalized and he said, that's our food and his father said, what we have learned, my son, is you can live for three weeks without food.

2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:57.160
 You can live for three days without water, but you can't live for three minutes without hope.

2:07:57.160 --> 2:08:03.160
 Well, hope, let me ask you, he said meaning.

2:08:03.160 --> 2:08:05.160
 What's the meaning of this whole thing?

2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:07.160
 What's the meaning of life?

2:08:07.160 --> 2:08:11.160
 You're the perfect person to ask this question.

2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:15.160
 I believe the meaning of life is for human beings to grow in soul.

2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:25.160
 That's why we're here and you can do that in infinite numbers of ways, but you're supposed to return your soul like more burnished and beautiful than you got it.

2:08:25.160 --> 2:08:33.160
 I mean, it's going to have, you know, some nicks and cuts, but that's what it means to deepen and grow it.

2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:40.160
 You do that more than anything else, you do that by learning how to love.

2:08:40.160 --> 2:08:43.160
 I mean, that's the principle way I think that you do it.

2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:51.160
 You know, it's interesting because for a human, the relationship, if you're a man of faith, is with God.

2:08:51.160 --> 2:09:01.160
 But it feels like love is so richly part of human society that it's not just love of God, it's love of each other.

2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:04.160
 Right, yep, there's no question about the idea.

2:09:04.160 --> 2:09:10.160
 I mean, in Judaism, that was actually the great innovation of the monotheistic idea.

2:09:10.160 --> 2:09:14.160
 In pagan societies, it was all about how you treat the gods.

2:09:14.160 --> 2:09:17.160
 Monotheism said, no, God cares how you treat each other.

2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:34.160
 So it's, in fact, the mystics use the same kind of word in Hebrew, dvekut, which means clinging, that is used about Adam and Eve, about it says, therefore, a man will leave his father and mother and davak with his wife.

2:09:34.160 --> 2:09:36.160
 And davak means cling.

2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:39.160
 So there is an analogy there, absolutely.

2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:47.160
 Yeah, I kind of think of human civilization as that movie March of the Penguins, and they're all huddling together in the cold.

2:09:47.160 --> 2:09:49.160
 This is fundamentally human.

2:09:49.160 --> 2:10:01.160
 Is this just this darkness all around us of uncertainty, of cruelty, of just, it seems like everything is so fragile.

2:10:01.160 --> 2:10:04.160
 And we're just kind of all huddling together for warmth.

2:10:04.160 --> 2:10:05.160
 Yes.

2:10:05.160 --> 2:10:08.160
 And that's all we got is each other.

2:10:08.160 --> 2:10:15.160
 So we started with the big question of what is God, ended with what is meaning.

2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:20.160
 Rabbi Wolpe, I've been a huge, as I've told you, huge, huge fanatist for a long time.

2:10:20.160 --> 2:10:22.160
 It's such an honor that you talked to me today.

2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:27.160
 I am really so happy to be here, and thank you so much for the conversation.

2:10:27.160 --> 2:10:30.160
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with David Wolpe.

2:10:30.160 --> 2:10:33.160
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:10:33.160 --> 2:10:38.160
 And now let me leave you with some words from David himself.

2:10:38.160 --> 2:10:43.160
 The only whole heart is a broken one, because it lets the light in.

2:10:43.160 --> 2:11:05.160
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
