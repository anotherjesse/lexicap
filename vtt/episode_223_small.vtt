00:00.000 --> 00:06.320
 The following is a conversation with Travis Stevens, 2016 Olympic silver medalist in Judo,

00:06.320 --> 00:12.080
 and one of the greatest American judoka ever. But his story is inspiring not because of that

00:12.080 --> 00:17.840
 Olympic medal, but because of the decades of injury, hardship, incredible battles against the best

00:17.840 --> 00:24.720
 in the world, wrapping up in close heartbreaking losses at the 2008 and 2012 games, all of which

00:24.720 --> 00:32.080
 eventually led to that very silver medal in 2016. As we talk about in the podcast, Travis is also

00:32.080 --> 00:37.840
 someone who is largely responsible for me getting into judo, for which I will forever be grateful.

00:38.400 --> 00:44.320
 He also happens to be now my judo coach and mentor. I'll release a video of Travis and I

00:44.320 --> 00:49.520
 doing some judo in a few days. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the

00:49.520 --> 00:57.120
 description. As a side note, let me say a few words that I've written down about the Olympic Games

00:57.120 --> 01:03.600
 and the International Olympics Committee. I'm visiting family has the t shirt, but I had to

01:03.600 --> 01:11.040
 pull away to write and to say these words because this very video was taken down by YouTube as per

01:11.040 --> 01:17.280
 the request of the IOC. You know it's serious when a Russian takes time away from family,

01:17.280 --> 01:23.520
 food and drink. I'm heartbroken to see continued incompetence, greed and corruption on the part

01:23.520 --> 01:31.040
 of the IOC in failing to do as the Olympic Charter states to quote, ensure the fullest coverage

01:31.040 --> 01:37.840
 and the widest possible audience in the world for the Olympic Games, end quote. I want to give you

01:37.840 --> 01:44.160
 two facts. First, they do not make most of the videos of the games available for replay anywhere

01:44.160 --> 01:49.920
 that is accessible, searchable and discoverable, whether funded by ads or by subscriptions.

01:49.920 --> 01:57.680
 For example, on YouTube or their own service, it is not available anywhere. Second, in the most

01:57.680 --> 02:05.120
 absurd violation of the Olympic Charter, they've uploaded all of the videos of the 2012 2016 and

02:05.120 --> 02:14.800
 the 2020 slash 21 Olympics to YouTube and they set all of these videos to private. This results

02:14.800 --> 02:19.520
 in a situation like my four hour conversation that you're watching now with Travis Stevens being

02:19.520 --> 02:26.160
 taken down due to us including a few seconds of a small video overlay of Travis's epic match

02:26.160 --> 02:31.520
 against Ole Bischoff in 2012. This is done automatically as per the request of the IOC.

02:31.520 --> 02:37.920
 I have the video due to having screen recorded it from 2012. Here you have Travis Stevens,

02:38.560 --> 02:45.200
 an Olympic silver medalist, someone who spent his entire life overcoming injuries, losses, hard

02:45.200 --> 02:51.040
 weight cuts, periods of no financial or psychological support, culminating in the biggest heartbreak of

02:51.040 --> 02:58.400
 his career in this one match and this match is available nowhere online, not for free,

02:58.400 --> 03:05.040
 not for one million dollars. Our showing short clips of it results in the IOC taking it down,

03:05.040 --> 03:12.080
 not demonetizing it, taking it down, blocking it. The IOC silences this amazing story of Travis

03:12.080 --> 03:18.880
 Stevens of heartbreak that eventually led to triumph and there are thousands of stories like it,

03:18.880 --> 03:25.120
 stories that are supposed to inspire the world. To me and to billions of others, the Olympic Games

03:25.120 --> 03:30.640
 give a chance to celebrate and to be inspired by the greatest stories of human flourishing

03:30.640 --> 03:36.240
 in the face of hardship and incredibly long odds or dominance in the pursuit of perfection

03:36.240 --> 03:43.520
 at levels previously thought to be impossible. The Olympic Games inspired kids like me to dream

03:43.520 --> 03:50.320
 and to work hard to achieve in our own lives the same moments of magic and greatness small or big

03:50.320 --> 03:56.240
 that the Olympic Games reveal. I believe the members of the IOC are good people,

03:56.960 --> 04:03.440
 but people who forgot the dream, the fire that was sparked and burned in their hearts when they

04:03.440 --> 04:10.320
 first saw the Olympics as kids. They've allowed the gradual corruption of their own human spirit

04:10.320 --> 04:15.360
 and thereby have robbed the world of this very fire, the fire of the Olympic torch,

04:15.360 --> 04:20.560
 the fire that ought to burn in the eyes and hearts of kids watching the Olympics today,

04:21.120 --> 04:28.720
 daring to dream, daring to be great. Please, please do better. The world needs you,

04:28.720 --> 04:37.120
 the world needs the Olympic Games. This is the Lex Friedman podcast and here's my conversation

04:37.120 --> 04:44.880
 with Travis Stevens. Judo is a martial arts, a sport, a set of techniques, ideas and philosophies.

04:44.880 --> 04:51.520
 Can we start by maybe you giving a big picture overview of what is Judo to somebody who's like

04:51.520 --> 04:58.640
 outside the whole spectrum of grappling sports? Yeah, Judo was originated in Japan that was used

04:58.640 --> 05:06.720
 as a police tactic for self defense and subduing people. It's the art of being able to throw

05:06.720 --> 05:13.200
 somebody to the ground and hold and control the situation. I think it's pretty much evolved since

05:13.200 --> 05:21.200
 then though. As you include the sport aspect of it, it's grown to be something more and more

05:21.200 --> 05:28.000
 dynamic and it's gotten away from that. The basics is people wear something called a gi,

05:28.800 --> 05:36.640
 which I think nicely mimics outdoor clothing, like a jacket. They start on the feet

05:36.640 --> 05:44.800
 and they get to grip each other and the scoring works by the more badass the throw is,

05:44.800 --> 05:52.000
 the more points you get and if you throw the person big and hard on their back,

05:52.640 --> 05:58.080
 you win the match and it's over and that's called an epon. Yeah, which is equivalent to a knockout.

05:58.080 --> 06:03.760
 So I guess there's no knock downs, Judo. We don't count those. Yeah. They got to hit their back

06:03.760 --> 06:08.400
 and they got to hit it with force. And so there's a huge incentive for the big throws

06:09.440 --> 06:17.200
 and there's also the drama of somebody catching you off guard with a surprise big throw and it's

06:17.200 --> 06:28.640
 over. There's two ways of losing really. I saw this coming. You see it but you can't stop it

06:28.640 --> 06:34.960
 and those ones tend to be the ones you can live with. The ones that are really hard to live with

06:34.960 --> 06:40.480
 are the ones you never saw coming because that just shows that that person has really out glassed

06:40.480 --> 06:47.600
 you. So there's a small set of throws, maybe you can go through them that are like you saw

06:47.600 --> 06:52.640
 coming but you couldn't do anything about it and then there's the set of throws that are more like

06:52.640 --> 06:57.600
 surprises. So first of all, the counters or if you fake one thing and go the other way,

06:57.600 --> 07:03.760
 then that's a surprise and it's like oh shit, you off balance the person because they think you go

07:03.760 --> 07:06.960
 one way and then you go the other way and then there's this oh shit moment. All of a sudden

07:07.680 --> 07:12.960
 your back is just slammed on the ground. One of the ones, I mean you're good at many throws but

07:12.960 --> 07:20.080
 one of them is that I think reveals the beauty of Judo is the foot sweep. There's something

07:20.080 --> 07:24.880
 about the off balance and the timing. If you catch him right, all of a sudden it's like I had the

07:24.880 --> 07:29.600
 same feeling when I went skydiving. Like all of a sudden the ground is not under you anymore.

07:29.600 --> 07:34.480
 Yeah and you just you go weightlessness for like a split second and you realize you've lost like

07:34.480 --> 07:39.680
 all control of your limbs. It's like zero gravity, right? Like you just you can't turn,

07:39.680 --> 07:43.920
 you can't rotate, you can't do much of anything and then before you know it you've hit the floor.

07:43.920 --> 07:51.040
 Yeah. It's a cool feeling when you get thrown because you hope to do that this thing to another

07:51.040 --> 07:56.720
 person is like you just hit the ground hard because it's not you didn't see it coming. It wasn't a

07:56.720 --> 08:03.840
 big throw that got loaded up. It's like all of a sudden the surprise and then like this like

08:03.840 --> 08:09.520
 feeling your back just slams and there's like the air's up. Yeah and the worst is when you get hit

08:09.520 --> 08:14.720
 twice with one throw, right? Because sometimes like the guy throwing you didn't expect you to

08:14.720 --> 08:20.000
 leave either so you hit and then that guy comes down like a second and a half later and it's like

08:20.000 --> 08:25.600
 boom boom and then the wind is just gone from you. Yeah those are the worst. And then there's the

08:25.600 --> 08:30.960
 disappointment like then the intellectual the cognitive part comes in where you're like oh

08:30.960 --> 08:37.760
 shit I just lost. Yep and you don't have like a connection to why, right? It's almost like you've

08:37.760 --> 08:42.880
 just like you didn't literally get a concussion like you understand and remember everything

08:42.880 --> 08:48.160
 but you can't figure out how this just happened, right? Those are the those are the tough ones

08:48.160 --> 08:53.040
 to deal with. Actually have you had moments like that where you don't understand how it happened?

08:53.040 --> 08:56.640
 You have to watch footage to understand what happened. Even when you watch it you're just like

08:57.920 --> 09:04.560
 I don't get it like why wasn't I in a position to stop this? It makes zero sense.

09:05.840 --> 09:11.440
 Conceptually when you watch it you're like I understand how to play defense. I understand

09:11.440 --> 09:18.320
 and it looks like I'm in a defensive position but at the end of the day I still got thrown.

09:18.320 --> 09:25.840
 Yeah you were talking about what is it a 2008 match. You have a non traditional gripping style

09:25.840 --> 09:30.080
 yeah accurate to say but and then you were going against another right handed player

09:30.640 --> 09:36.640
 and then there's some kind of fake that he did and then he caught you. Yep. Can you

09:36.640 --> 09:44.640
 describe the throw he caught you with? He caught me with a drop sale but he kind of like we were

09:44.640 --> 09:50.720
 engaged we were looking at each other and we were kind of at like a stalemate right? He couldn't

09:50.720 --> 09:56.640
 really advance. I couldn't really advance and he kind of just let his gaze like wander off to the

09:56.640 --> 10:01.280
 right like he was looking at something and then I kind of like what's over there and then I got

10:01.280 --> 10:10.320
 thrown and it's like. So first of all for people don't know sales say a nagi drop means when you

10:10.320 --> 10:16.080
 drop to your knees and say a nagi is one of the fundamentals of judo there's just just a handful

10:16.080 --> 10:23.280
 but does that actually ever work? I was wondering that about like boxing or judo does the head

10:23.280 --> 10:28.400
 movement of the person work because we're still like kind of dogs at heart if you look somewhere

10:28.400 --> 10:33.440
 with a dog the dog is going to look that direction as well does that actually work ever? It does

10:34.960 --> 10:41.520
 but on a greater sense what you try to do is not necessarily get like a physical reaction

10:41.520 --> 10:48.880
 of a look but a lull of security where like they've almost like relaxed for that split second because

10:48.880 --> 10:55.760
 you've lured them into like a sense of comfort and then that's when you can strike. So you have

10:55.760 --> 11:05.040
 this speaking of say nagi you have this gigantic standing say nagi and you have a specific grip

11:05.040 --> 11:09.520
 one of our challenges is there's a large number of people that listen to the audio version of this

11:10.080 --> 11:14.560
 so we're gonna have to try to describe some of this stuff I'll do my best to try to describe

11:14.560 --> 11:22.720
 with words but you grip with your left hand on the lapel of the jacket or like that area

11:22.720 --> 11:29.120
 and there's kind of a lean into the person and I suppose is there a feeling of a lull there

11:29.120 --> 11:33.840
 that you're trying to get to where you're just it feels like you're both calmly dancing before

11:33.840 --> 11:43.360
 you turn your hips and go in for the throw? I'm actually trying to create a sense of weightlessness

11:43.360 --> 11:53.440
 for my lead leg which would be my right leg and a sense of resistance from my partner. So aren't

11:53.440 --> 11:57.280
 you both kind of leaning into each other? Into each other and it creates like an A frame

11:58.080 --> 12:02.160
 yeah but when the A frame is held together at the top half which would be my left hand and

12:02.160 --> 12:07.040
 their right hand posted on each other's chest it means our legs are free to move and our hips are

12:07.040 --> 12:12.080
 free to move right and they're not going to feel your leg move because of the weightlessness and

12:12.080 --> 12:17.040
 is there a feeling like for them is there feeling like nothing bad can happen here we're all relaxed

12:17.040 --> 12:21.840
 everything's fine yeah and and then they're standing off at a funny angle and before they

12:21.840 --> 12:27.600
 know it I've spun and my back is on their chest and they can't go anywhere yeah yeah uh how did

12:27.600 --> 12:33.520
 you first develop that throw so for people um it's called iponse nagi which means your right

12:33.520 --> 12:41.360
 hand goes under their like armpit area and that that's like a vice that connects you to them

12:41.360 --> 12:46.000
 yeah and then they get go on for the ride yeah the interesting thing with the standing one is

12:46.800 --> 12:54.560
 as opposed to drop san agi version the drop san agi you kind of drop under them and because

12:54.560 --> 13:02.720
 there's a vice they're like pulled pulled under and like over yeah with the standing one I suppose

13:02.720 --> 13:08.160
 there's some similar physics but you're kind of loading them onto your hip and so they're in the

13:08.160 --> 13:15.680
 air while you're standing still there's there's a there's a sense in which they're like you're

13:15.680 --> 13:23.680
 lifting them above where they started yes that's how you get the really big air yeah if obviously if

13:25.760 --> 13:30.560
 if everything is right so how did you first develop that how did you first I first learned

13:30.560 --> 13:36.800
 just learning like the very basics of the throw you know foot placement all that kind of stuff and

13:36.800 --> 13:43.680
 then you know like anything the basics are nice um but once you get good at the basics it's it's

13:43.680 --> 13:49.600
 very easy to stop but it gives you a good like fundamental platform to learn off of and to

13:49.600 --> 13:56.240
 expand off of and then I expanded when I first started watching koga the new wind right because

13:56.240 --> 14:03.840
 he's the one that first like introduced that split hip style san agi that I do um once I

14:03.840 --> 14:12.560
 learned that one I built about eight different variations of sale off that one start position

14:13.120 --> 14:19.600
 that way I could regardless of your defense I had an answer for a throw so why that one though why

14:19.600 --> 14:24.240
 can you uh can you describe love to me Travis Stevens why did you fall in love with that throw

14:24.240 --> 14:31.920
 in particular um it it was really a sense of you know one of my shortcomings as a kid like

14:31.920 --> 14:39.680
 like I hate leg day in the gym I hate it with a passion I if you asked me to do a squat I'll

14:39.680 --> 14:44.960
 I'll get it done but I will bitch and moan every step of the way I hate it I remember

14:44.960 --> 14:48.720
 one time I was at the gym with my trainer and he goes okay we're gonna do front squats and I

14:48.720 --> 14:54.080
 want you to put 225 on the bar and I was like I can't do that and he was like what do you mean

14:54.080 --> 15:00.960
 you can't do that and I go I physically I can't do that and he was like are you serious and I go yeah

15:00.960 --> 15:05.920
 so he's he didn't believe me we put 225 on the bar and I bottomed out and then he was like okay let's

15:05.920 --> 15:11.040
 go down to 185 and I was like I can't do that I just it's not happening you probably couldn't

15:11.040 --> 15:16.720
 strength wise you just refuse I just mentally I cannot wrap my head around like this ain't happening

15:16.720 --> 15:21.600
 I'm not doing it so I ended up with like your main principle 90 do like 95 pounds on the bar

15:21.600 --> 15:26.880
 I got you at a front squat no problem by the way body weight squats are rough too psychologically

15:26.880 --> 15:34.240
 so yeah I just when it comes to my legs like I want no part of like leg pressing single leg

15:34.240 --> 15:38.960
 squats split squat any of that want no part of it so you think like the more traditional variants

15:38.960 --> 15:44.320
 of saying I'll give require you to have that leg strength yeah that mass like when you watch Japanese

15:44.320 --> 15:49.920
 judo players like their thighs and their hips they're thick they got a lot of power there

15:49.920 --> 15:55.840
 so you're almost like always dropping a little bit into a squat position for mine never no no

15:55.840 --> 16:01.920
 not you sorry for that the traditional ones yeah and so the split hip the split hip actually allows

16:01.920 --> 16:07.200
 me to keep my leg straight yeah and the farther I split my legs the lower my center of gravity goes

16:07.200 --> 16:12.640
 now I don't need my legs yeah perfect love it let's do it so that's the way you were thinking

16:12.640 --> 16:19.360
 okay yeah but it's you know the interesting thing about it is because you know as I mentioned to you

16:19.360 --> 16:26.480
 I've gotten to judo after first watching you in the Olympics and then watching koga as well

16:26.480 --> 16:31.600
 and so you start imitating the people you first see and then you take it to judo coaches and

16:31.600 --> 16:37.760
 they're like no no no that's the wrong way to do it and happens all the time it drives me nuts

16:37.760 --> 16:43.200
 drives me nuts I was in Poland one time yeah teaching a camp and I had two coaches

16:43.200 --> 16:50.160
 is anti coaching telling their kids not to do say oh the way I do it because it never works

16:50.160 --> 16:56.960
 yeah it's crazy how do you have the fortitude and the guts to just go on with a throw that's

16:56.960 --> 17:06.560
 not traditional the variant that's not traditional if you think about it you know from a very basic

17:06.560 --> 17:13.200
 like root of it there's a philosophy and a mentality of judo of how the throws work right

17:13.200 --> 17:20.160
 there's a mechanical structure there like this makes sense if I follow that principle I can do

17:20.160 --> 17:26.400
 anything I want nothing else matters as long as we follow those core principles so in the early

17:26.400 --> 17:33.120
 days even even then you were able to think on your own yeah and I was able to develop a pattern for

17:33.120 --> 17:39.280
 my foot placement based on my opponent's height because the number one thing any judo coach

17:39.280 --> 17:44.480
 will tell you is you need your center of gravity below yours well now I now I know exactly where

17:44.480 --> 17:49.600
 to put my feet because the shorter you are the bigger the split because the lower I need to get

17:49.600 --> 17:56.000
 the taller you are the less of a split I need is there something you could say about fundamental

17:56.000 --> 18:03.280
 principles of judo is there over all that time not 20 over 20 years that you've been doing judo

18:03.280 --> 18:10.560
 uh it's not approaching 30 is it yeah it's yeah it's going there okay it's getting over a couple

18:10.560 --> 18:17.760
 years away let's get in there is there some like principles that have emerged like you said you

18:17.760 --> 18:23.360
 have to have your center of gravity below theirs yep is there other kind of both on the gripping

18:23.360 --> 18:31.200
 side the footwork side leverage anything you can speak to there's some that have with stood like

18:31.200 --> 18:37.120
 time like you have to be able to get below their center of gravity because you have to be able

18:37.120 --> 18:43.680
 to rotate them around their center of gravity and then the other one is that was always a

18:43.680 --> 18:48.560
 principle when I was growing up and I didn't change until later on in my career was you have to be

18:48.560 --> 18:55.280
 able to pull you need to be able to pull to get them off balance but when you think about that

18:55.280 --> 19:00.880
 statement as a whole it ended with they have to be off balance I don't need the pull to get you

19:00.880 --> 19:06.640
 off balance I just need you off balance and when you think about it that way it allows you to open

19:06.640 --> 19:13.440
 up the doors to what do I need to do to get you off balance I could push pull I could flinch I could

19:13.440 --> 19:20.160
 fake and you could put yourself in your own off balance state right when you think about people

19:20.160 --> 19:26.480
 who wrestle right if I fake shoot it causes you to over lean forward which means you're off balance

19:27.120 --> 19:31.680
 there's no pull there's no push there's no nothing I just get a reaction that leaves the

19:31.680 --> 19:36.960
 opportunity in the door open for an attack and that off balance could be very subtle could be

19:36.960 --> 19:45.200
 very subtle and the better you get and the more skills you get the less subtle it is so we should

19:45.200 --> 19:52.240
 also mention that there is something called forward throws where you throw the person you know

19:52.240 --> 19:58.320
 they they're gonna fly facing forward they're gonna fly forward and then a backward throw is

19:58.320 --> 20:03.920
 they're gonna fly back yeah and then there's lateral you know they actually go sideways over

20:03.920 --> 20:10.000
 like a cartwheel almost okay so the forward throws there's the one we've been talking about which is

20:10.000 --> 20:14.960
 say nagi and there's a bunch of different variants ipan maroto say nagi there's drop and

20:14.960 --> 20:19.920
 there's standing versions of them and that all I don't know if there's a way to summarize it

20:20.480 --> 20:26.880
 but that's like as clean as a getting your center of gravity under theirs as it gets

20:27.680 --> 20:32.400
 and then the rest is just gripping variations yep I guess it's all gripping variations on all of

20:32.400 --> 20:42.320
 these throws but and then there is in terms of forward throws there's the other big one in

20:42.320 --> 20:51.200
 competition is uchimata which is I don't know we can try to explain that one but it ends up being

20:51.200 --> 20:57.360
 where one you're standing on just one of your feet and the other one is up in the air and I

20:57.360 --> 21:03.040
 don't know if you'll put in that same category haraigoshi like those kinds of throws where you're

21:03.040 --> 21:08.480
 kind of a little bit single footed yeah so there's two footed techniques and then they're single

21:08.480 --> 21:16.640
 footed yeah oh goshi where it's like you're doing a mix between the uchimata and the say nagi yeah

21:16.640 --> 21:22.960
 it's a hug you you hug a person and then you turn your hips around such that you're now hugging

21:22.960 --> 21:29.440
 facing the same direction when it comes to forward throw there's regardless of the name of the throw

21:29.440 --> 21:35.520
 or the gripping variation that you're using the whole principle is how do I get this person to

21:35.520 --> 21:42.560
 do a forward roll in midair and land on their back the more of a forward roll I can get the

21:42.560 --> 21:47.360
 bigger the score if I get like a quarter of a turn where like you land on your side and you

21:47.360 --> 21:53.600
 don't go over your back it's a half score yeah but they all require me to get you to do that

21:53.600 --> 21:59.360
 forward rolling action so just if we think of one person if they do this nice leap forward

21:59.360 --> 22:03.920
 and they do a roll and their back nicely rolls over the ground you're trying to do the exact

22:03.920 --> 22:09.440
 same thing with you connected to them well and if it's nice and it's smooth it's probably not a

22:09.440 --> 22:16.240
 full score it needs to have like somewhat of a violent impact right so if you think of a drop

22:16.240 --> 22:22.000
 say nagi if I if I'm moving too slow and you still roll over your shoulders and there's no

22:22.000 --> 22:29.280
 direct impact it's only a half score right they want the force the force the violence yeah it's good

22:29.920 --> 22:39.520
 okay so then in terms of backward throws the traditional ones there's stuff where you trip them

22:39.520 --> 22:48.160
 from outside their body like Osoto gari it's a trip where you hook your leg onto their leg and you

22:48.160 --> 22:54.720
 trip them but your hook it goes outside of their legs and then there's the trips from inside their

22:54.720 --> 23:01.840
 body there's a one foot is called kuchigari and then the others kuchigari doesn't matter the most

23:01.840 --> 23:08.320
 important thing is outside and inside and then there is like I don't even know how you throw them

23:08.320 --> 23:14.000
 sideways except foot sweeps and then there's the foot sweeps where you can sweep one of their legs

23:14.000 --> 23:19.120
 from out of them or both their legs at the same time and like we were talking about this kind of

23:20.080 --> 23:28.000
 is when timed perfectly it's effortless for everybody involved and the ending like you said

23:28.000 --> 23:34.960
 is big dramatic and violent yeah is there other kind of oh yeah there's a sacrifice techniques

23:34.960 --> 23:42.240
 yeah there's a bunch of them and that ultimately the variations have to do with gripping but you're

23:42.240 --> 23:49.440
 basically you the attacker fall onto your back sticking your legs somewhere onto onto their

23:49.440 --> 23:54.480
 body which is like this fulcrum over which they fly and do that same kind of roll that you mentioned

23:54.480 --> 24:00.000
 you basically sacrifice your back to the mat in order to throw them into that circular pattern

24:00.000 --> 24:05.440
 so they hit their back sometimes we use a foot sometimes we don't and so we should probably say

24:06.400 --> 24:12.400
 it's okay for you to go on to your back as long as you're clearly demonstrating control over the

24:12.400 --> 24:19.280
 other person's body correct you can't go to your back in the same direction that your opponent is

24:19.280 --> 24:24.800
 trying to put you to your back right you have to go the other way or you have to initiate

24:24.800 --> 24:34.000
 you going to your own back right like clearly and then and then there's all the counters which

24:34.000 --> 24:40.240
 almost kind of have a whole group of their own even though they have echoes of the same types

24:40.240 --> 24:45.200
 of techniques it seems like they're their own whole thing yeah but they follow the same principles

24:45.200 --> 24:52.560
 it's just most counters like if you wanted to counter Enuchimada for example you're trying

24:52.560 --> 24:58.480
 to throw me in a somersault over my right shoulder therefore I would counter you by

24:58.480 --> 25:04.560
 throwing you over your left shoulder it goes in the opposite shoulder direction but in the same

25:04.560 --> 25:10.560
 somersault idea and there used to be I already forget at this point forget the years but it

25:10.560 --> 25:17.280
 might be 20 before the 2012 Olympics where they banned you used to be allowed to grab legs in the

25:17.280 --> 25:22.320
 same way you do in wrestling so you have basically all the techniques you would have in wrestling

25:23.760 --> 25:28.800
 available to you if you would like yeah it's just that some of the techniques in wrestling

25:28.800 --> 25:33.680
 are not that effective for getting your opponent to their back yeah wrestlers want to take the

25:33.680 --> 25:38.560
 other person down in any way possible and have control judo wants to take you down like we said

25:38.560 --> 25:42.880
 in a big fashion where your back slams on the ground yeah it has to be to the back a lot of

25:42.880 --> 25:49.840
 wrestling takedowns happen because they get behind them yeah and then they they partare out yeah so

25:50.720 --> 25:56.960
 but the judo banned all touching of the legs which is very dramatic change of the sport

25:56.960 --> 26:04.560
 but after 2012 after it was after 2012 so 2008 I fought the games and everything was free

26:04.560 --> 26:13.680
 and 2012 we could only touch the legs as a defensive action or in response to an attack

26:13.680 --> 26:19.360
 so I could try to throw you with a normal throw and then when you try to counter I could grab

26:19.360 --> 26:27.040
 your leg right so there had to be a secondary technique and didn't like didn't they disqualify

26:27.040 --> 26:33.760
 on a first offense first offense was a direct disqualification which happened at the 2012 games

26:33.760 --> 26:40.800
 to the 57 brazilian who won in 16 yeah she was dq'd and I think the quarters yeah and it was like

26:42.240 --> 26:48.560
 I wouldn't say it was blatant as much as I don't think the act changed the outcome of the match

26:48.560 --> 26:53.120
 had they not disqualified sure so that's not that dramatic and by the way you say 57

26:53.120 --> 26:58.640
 that refers to weight divisions and that's in kilograms and kilograms is the measure of weight

26:58.640 --> 27:04.960
 that the rest of the world uses and the United States does not so and there's uh we should say

27:04.960 --> 27:14.000
 the divisions for for guys um I don't know what the 70 I don't know the lower level 60 66 73

27:14.000 --> 27:23.280
 and 81 90 100 and heavyweight which has no ceiling no ceiling as we'll talk about yeah it is an

27:23.280 --> 27:32.240
 important distinction um so and you competed most of your career at 81 kilograms all of it all you

27:32.240 --> 27:38.240
 never did I never did 73 but you had to cut big for 81 anyway especially towards the end of my career

27:38.240 --> 27:46.800
 yeah okay uh I overly grew into the division what's uh I'm trying to remember is that I bought 180

27:46.800 --> 27:54.160
 pounds 178.6 I think and you have to weigh in with the the the geek no nothing you're not allowed to

27:54.160 --> 27:58.000
 wear anything except for your underwear let's weigh in sorry confusing digits so that's right that's

27:58.000 --> 28:05.200
 right that's right that's which is very nice um okay so we we just say we covered most of the

28:05.200 --> 28:11.680
 throws and no so there's the forward and the backward there's the sacrifice throws and the

28:11.680 --> 28:16.880
 counters yeah and the and then there's the leg grabs and we should say for the leg grabs that were

28:16.880 --> 28:23.120
 effective it's like um the big pickups where you just kind of pick them up and try to figure out

28:23.120 --> 28:27.200
 once they're in the air what the heck to do with their body to get them to the ground you just

28:27.200 --> 28:33.360
 kind of figure it out as you go I think the really nice one that was to me heartbreaking as a fantasy

28:33.360 --> 28:41.760
 go is I guess what's called a fireman's carry which is uh you know it does lead to judo like beautiful

28:41.760 --> 28:48.560
 throws and the fact that that was gone is is that one I missed a little bit but then a bunch of people

28:48.560 --> 28:55.120
 I guess came up with the variance where you don't need to grab the leg it's definitely not as effective

28:55.120 --> 29:01.360
 as being able to grab it but I'm also on the side of the fence having competed in all three

29:01.360 --> 29:08.400
 it was definitely better for the sport to remove it as a whole it's probably good to cover sort of

29:08.400 --> 29:14.480
 the whole spectrum of rules of judo is there's ground work so there's uh you do all the stuff

29:14.480 --> 29:19.280
 on the feet where you're trying to murder each other with a giant throw but then you know if the

29:19.280 --> 29:24.080
 throw doesn't succeed you go to the ground and you stay in the ground for some amount of time

29:24.080 --> 29:29.520
 like short amount of time you have to move quickly you have to be attacking and two of the ways you

29:29.520 --> 29:36.880
 can win is similar to people who do jiu jitsu is you can submit them uh chokes arm breaks all that

29:36.880 --> 29:44.720
 kind of stuff no foot locks and uh and you can also pin them yeah which is get around their legs and

29:44.720 --> 29:51.520
 this is very no this is not like wrestling you have to actually get around their legs and uh pin

29:51.520 --> 29:56.400
 them in what in jiu jitsu is called side control mount all kinds of ways that doesn't involve their

29:56.400 --> 30:02.160
 legs yeah and then you pin them for like whatever 20 seconds 25 seconds yeah 20 seconds now I think

30:02.160 --> 30:08.400
 the distinction is their back has to be facing the mat you have to be past their legs and your

30:08.400 --> 30:14.240
 chest has to be on the same plane as theirs yeah so it doesn't have to necessarily be on top but it

30:14.240 --> 30:20.720
 has to be on the same plane yeah and all of this is I think different sports of different versions

30:20.720 --> 30:27.440
 of this but it's like an approximation of what dominance looks like yeah so pin and wrestling

30:27.440 --> 30:32.560
 is dominating your opponent presumably if you were in a street fight that position allows you to

30:32.560 --> 30:37.200
 then do a lot of damage obviously submissions is dominance because you're breaking their arm or

30:37.200 --> 30:44.800
 choking them to uh uh unconscious and then obviously the throw which is not often talked about but

30:44.800 --> 30:51.360
 like if you talk about a street fight situation a throw is like the best way to murder somebody

30:52.400 --> 30:58.000
 like this could end anyone's life yes it's terrifying actually so okay so these are whole

30:58.000 --> 31:05.040
 elements of dominance so going back to set of principles you were mentioning getting your

31:05.040 --> 31:11.600
 center of mass under theirs which I think applies for type of um like the forward senagi throws is

31:11.600 --> 31:17.680
 there is there other stuff um obviously you mentioned off balance yeah there's the off balance one

31:17.680 --> 31:24.560
 where you can either pull to get an off balance or you can give way to the force which can also

31:24.560 --> 31:35.200
 lead to an off balance um you can amplify somebody's force to so for example if you push me you expect

31:35.200 --> 31:43.040
 a certain reaction that you're ready for but if you push me and I pull you now you didn't expect

31:43.040 --> 31:48.800
 that much force coming out of you therefore you're off balance the thing that's distinctly

31:48.800 --> 31:57.600
 recognizable about judo is like when done at the highest level like it's it seems effortless

31:57.600 --> 32:03.520
 when the big throw happens yeah like that's just it doesn't there is no other sport like it in the

32:03.520 --> 32:10.000
 combat sports where it's like when the timing is right everything just is perfect I think you get

32:10.000 --> 32:16.160
 that out of my mate and um boxing sometimes when this is a knockout yeah perfect strike just like

32:16.160 --> 32:22.320
 yeah what they but it's not just like a hard hit it's like it's almost like the with Conor

32:22.320 --> 32:27.360
 McGregor and Aldo for example when you just catch him just right and that you didn't look like you

32:27.360 --> 32:32.320
 hit him that hard yeah but he hit him just right yeah and then you get to see this all the time in

32:32.320 --> 32:38.800
 judo it's fascinating and so the beginning part of that is because there's a jacket there's also

32:38.800 --> 32:44.240
 this whole thing that your master of which is like which is gripping yeah so is there something you

32:44.240 --> 32:50.400
 can say about are there some fundamental principles of gripping that you can speak to and like what

32:50.400 --> 32:56.960
 the hell is gripping gripping is having the ability to hold your opponent in such a way where you

32:56.960 --> 33:03.440
 have the ability to be offensive and also the ability to be defensive at the same given time

33:05.200 --> 33:12.480
 and it's a distinction because I can hold you in such a way where I might be able to feel offensive

33:13.120 --> 33:19.120
 but if you can take a purely defensive grip and then I can't be offensive we are no longer gripping

33:19.120 --> 33:26.320
 we are holding each other right right so like that would be the act of being able to grip

33:26.320 --> 33:33.040
 is to be in a situation where you have me and I have you and I can play both offense and defense

33:33.040 --> 33:40.080
 at the same time where you can only play defense so Donahar talks about like jiu jitsu that way

33:40.080 --> 33:45.360
 and not that way but maybe you can see if there's a distinction so you have a set of weapons the

33:45.360 --> 33:51.200
 other person has a set of weapons you want to sort of maximize the use of your weapons and shut down

33:51.200 --> 33:56.800
 the set of weapons that they have that they have you see gripping the same way on the on the feet

33:57.520 --> 34:01.440
 I do if we want to include body positioning with our gripping

34:02.400 --> 34:06.240
 all right okay because I can give you any grip you want and you still can't throw me

34:06.240 --> 34:11.360
 because I can put myself in a position that nullifies your ability to use those grips in a

34:11.360 --> 34:17.600
 successful way and those would you say the hips are critical to that or is it everything hips

34:17.600 --> 34:23.440
 shoulders chin position head position you know the angle of your foot yeah yeah where you mean

34:24.480 --> 34:29.600
 wow okay and so uh and there's a bunch of places you can grip obviously if people

34:29.600 --> 34:34.880
 like kind of think of a jacket like there's a bunch of places you can grip that are interesting

34:34.880 --> 34:41.040
 so you can grip on the collar you can grip on the sleeves you can grip like the elbow joint

34:41.040 --> 34:48.480
 yep and then you could do uh those badass like Eastern European Georgian over the back over

34:48.480 --> 34:53.200
 the opposite sides of the heads yeah the Koreans that grab on one side around the head with their

34:53.200 --> 34:58.880
 hands together yeah there's something really nice about just those like I mean especially

34:58.880 --> 35:04.080
 Georgia's just throwing that hand yes just over the person and just if you're not actually gripping

35:04.080 --> 35:09.360
 a belt or anything you're gripping just the entirety of like as opposed to being all nice

35:09.360 --> 35:13.440
 so I'm going to grab this part of the jacket this part of the jacket you're just like taking

35:13.440 --> 35:19.600
 the whole fucking jacket it and just launching somebody for those people that can't picture

35:20.560 --> 35:26.400
 judo think about it in like if you understood like what a boxing match looks like and you

35:26.400 --> 35:31.760
 thought about that as like traditional gripping when you throw like a Russian grip over the back

35:31.760 --> 35:36.560
 that's more like a hockey fight like I'm just grabbing you and we're just gonna we're gonna

35:36.560 --> 35:41.760
 be throwing punches left and right because when we have that grip somebody has to get thrown yeah

35:41.760 --> 35:47.200
 there's no there's no we don't walk around with this grip it's it's go time once somebody throws it

35:47.840 --> 35:55.920
 to me as a as a fan and sort of amateur practitioner there's two styles of Olympic level judo

35:55.920 --> 36:01.680
 one is where you're trying not to get thrown and the other is where you're trying to throw

36:01.680 --> 36:08.560
 more specifically when you're trying not to get thrown there's like the strategy that you're using

36:08.560 --> 36:14.160
 gripping to nullify their offense and all those kinds of stuff you're you're being very clever

36:14.160 --> 36:19.200
 and strategic and all that you know maybe using conditioning and then there is people who just

36:19.200 --> 36:24.000
 like step in the pocket and they don't almost don't care if they're getting thrown because

36:24.000 --> 36:28.400
 they have the confidence that they're going to throw first yeah and those like there's a clear

36:28.400 --> 36:34.160
 distinction between the people that do one or the other and I think both can be done extremely

36:34.160 --> 36:39.200
 successfully at the highest level it's just like obviously you admire the people that step in the

36:39.200 --> 36:46.800
 pocket and and I think when you look at the people who do judo the best like if we want to talk about

36:46.800 --> 36:55.440
 like the top 10% of the people who would compete at the games they do both and they do both really

36:55.440 --> 37:04.080
 well but they favor one because if you look at a player like uh luteppatiliani of georgia for

37:04.080 --> 37:10.720
 example there's a guy that stands in the pocket but we can find numerous occasions where he's

37:10.720 --> 37:16.720
 hustled some people for like a short period of time to get out of scenarios to elongate the

37:16.720 --> 37:23.040
 match to make somebody tired so you want both sides of the coin but you better pick the one that

37:23.040 --> 37:28.640
 you know 80 percent of your strategy is going to be built around sorry for the romantic question but

37:28.640 --> 37:36.560
 I talked to dan gable and uh he always looked to the russians as um as the artists in wrestling

37:37.280 --> 37:42.960
 and uh he always wanted to be an artist but I think he's known for being that sort of

37:43.680 --> 37:48.960
 guts aggression mental toughness guy but he always was drawn to the artistry of wrestling

37:48.960 --> 37:54.400
 it's hard to know when you just watch you because it looks like you're aggressive and you got the

37:54.400 --> 37:59.120
 guts and the mental toughness but there's also obviously a mastery of technique which would

37:59.120 --> 38:05.120
 you lean towards in terms of what accounts for your success and just the way you approach judo

38:05.120 --> 38:12.080
 is it the the guts the aggression the mental toughness and or is it the mastery of technique

38:12.080 --> 38:20.960
 the artistry mine would be my my aggressiveness if i'm gonna pick those two areas um

38:22.880 --> 38:27.760
 but i think there's a third area in there that i would put myself in where i'm more of a strategist

38:28.960 --> 38:36.560
 i look at all of my opponents and all i ever see is their faults and the way i do judo is built

38:36.560 --> 38:44.400
 around their faults and it's just i put myself in scenarios where i don't even know how i'm

38:44.400 --> 38:51.120
 gonna win but what i've done in those scenarios is i've made it very difficult for you to win

38:53.040 --> 39:00.080
 and then i figure out the rest as i go like how do you study an opponent are there bins you can

39:00.080 --> 39:05.200
 put them in like there's a lefty and a righty or yep that's kind of stuff how many bins are

39:05.200 --> 39:11.520
 there in judo you might that you put your opponents in yeah there's probably about 20

39:12.640 --> 39:19.200
 there's like certain players who you could put in a category of like they're only good for the first

39:19.200 --> 39:24.880
 you know two thirds of the match after that they turn into a different player where they're either

39:24.880 --> 39:32.240
 falling into a sense of panic or uncertainty and you can if you were to take a video clip of

39:32.240 --> 39:38.320
 let's say churches villi right they got george and i beat in the olympic semi he's somebody that would

39:38.320 --> 39:44.160
 beat you in the first three minutes and if you clipped out all of his matches and you only watched

39:44.160 --> 39:51.040
 the first three minutes of every match you would see one style if you found all the matches where

39:51.040 --> 39:58.080
 he got taken into the last minute and he wasn't winning by a a major score you would see a completely

39:58.080 --> 40:04.640
 different fighter and so going into like my olympic semi i put him into that category of like

40:04.640 --> 40:10.720
 i want to get to this guy because this guy is beautiful the trick is how do you get there how

40:10.720 --> 40:15.360
 do you get there and by the way we're talking about the 2016 olympics where you won the silver

40:15.360 --> 40:25.040
 medal you're part of uh three different olympics but the cardio aspect of it have you faced exhaustion

40:25.040 --> 40:32.240
 often in your matches where you have to go deep and go like past yeah but that's not from the judo

40:32.240 --> 40:37.280
 side of it that's from like i did a very bad job of making weight it's always the way cut yeah it's

40:37.280 --> 40:45.280
 always the way cut and i think people really struggle with that they blame cardio and training

40:45.280 --> 40:49.920
 and everything else but when it really comes down to it like we train for an hour and a half two

40:49.920 --> 40:55.920
 hours twice a day how are you tired after five minutes right right it becomes into a mental

40:55.920 --> 41:03.280
 struggle your anxiety your stress your lack of belief in yourself or in my case sometimes it's

41:03.280 --> 41:09.760
 poor nutrition sometimes i had one too many mcdonalds meals it just it happens okay so let's

41:09.760 --> 41:17.600
 talk about weight cutting real quick so i've i've seen weight cutting break some of the toughest

41:17.600 --> 41:23.120
 fighters wrestlers grapplers ever like burnout break like where they makes you want to quit

41:23.120 --> 41:28.320
 the sport yeah um so you know this is what people don't often talk about but mentally

41:28.320 --> 41:33.840
 is one of the hardest things especially when you're doing it kind of wrong because it becomes a

41:33.840 --> 41:41.200
 mental war so you competed like you said your whole career at 81 kilograms you walked around at

41:41.200 --> 41:52.720
 88 89 it's about 15 pounds sometimes 20 pounds over that give or give or take and so what uh

41:53.440 --> 41:58.400
 what was your process like mentally and physically first of all maybe you can comment on when the

41:58.400 --> 42:04.080
 weigh ins are relative to the matches and then what was your process like leading like a week ahead

42:04.080 --> 42:13.680
 a day ahead an hour ahead minutes ahead of the weigh in man everyone varies tremendously because

42:13.680 --> 42:20.560
 we're not like most sports because you're dropped off in foreign countries with who knows what right

42:20.560 --> 42:27.840
 some places have sauna some places have treadmills i went to a place one time in china in the middle

42:27.840 --> 42:34.320
 of winter where the roads were frozen with ice and we had to use our hotel rooms because it was

42:34.320 --> 42:40.560
 you couldn't sweat outside because it was too cold right um and every one of my olympics the weight

42:40.560 --> 42:48.480
 cut was different just given my mass when i went to 2008 i was probably like 82 83 kilos walking

42:48.480 --> 42:55.920
 around so weight cutting wasn't a thing for me in london we actually weighed in the morning of

42:55.920 --> 43:02.160
 so weigh ins were at like 6 a.m and the olympics were always beneficial to me because they actually

43:02.160 --> 43:08.240
 don't start until like 10 or 11 so you actually were able to recover where on the circuit you would

43:08.240 --> 43:14.080
 weigh in at 6 a.m and the competition started at 8 a.m it's like well i was cutting weight at 5 a.m

43:14.960 --> 43:19.920
 and most of it for people who are not familiar but maybe you can also correct me most of it you're

43:19.920 --> 43:26.000
 really just getting the water out of your system it was water at that point yeah it's like 24 hours

43:26.000 --> 43:34.000
 before even like so are you like an hour before but yeah but like leading up to it um and do

43:34.000 --> 43:38.640
 have you eaten the day before do you try to minimize the amount of food in your system

43:38.640 --> 43:42.960
 my weight cutting process was a little bit different than the most people because

43:42.960 --> 43:52.560
 i like to eat um i'm not i'm not the type of person that believes your athletic career is

43:52.560 --> 43:59.040
 determined by your nutrition right i don't i don't believe that i think some sports are built that

43:59.040 --> 44:06.560
 way but when it comes to combat sports like you know your ability to knock somebody out has nothing

44:06.560 --> 44:11.680
 to do with whether you had a cheeseburger or a salad my ability to throw you is not determined

44:11.680 --> 44:17.840
 by that i may be able to perform better because i've eaten a certain way but not enough to justify

44:17.840 --> 44:24.000
 an entire diet change your body is built and my body is built to operate with certain things that

44:24.000 --> 44:30.880
 i've had in my system for years yeah i think uh i'm with you but i also believe that there's a

44:30.880 --> 44:36.720
 mental aspect so if you're surrounded by people that tell you diet matters then if your diet is

44:36.720 --> 44:40.320
 off you're going to believe you're going to be off because the people around you tell you your

44:40.320 --> 44:46.240
 diet should be good so yeah i think it's like it's the same i i've had an argument with

44:46.240 --> 44:53.040
 matthew walker who's uh who's a sleep scientist about sleep and it's like if you believe sleep is

44:53.040 --> 44:57.840
 essential it's essential to get eight hours of sleep every single night perfectly then you're

44:57.840 --> 45:02.320
 going to be very stressed when you don't get it and then i think you will negatively affect

45:02.320 --> 45:06.720
 the stress will negatively affect your longevity and all kinds of aspects of your life if you

45:06.720 --> 45:11.200
 actually just learn to truly listen to your body become a scientist if you're on body with sleep

45:11.200 --> 45:16.640
 and food it might end up that it will be the eight hours a night or whatever but it might be something

45:16.640 --> 45:22.080
 else and probably diet or i remember when i was meeting with the usoc nutritionist after

45:23.120 --> 45:31.600
 london it was probably around 2014 i think and when we had our team meeting at the beginning

45:31.600 --> 45:36.480
 of the year and i was talking to him he was talking about the nutrition plans that he could put us

45:36.480 --> 45:41.680
 on and i was like time out i've done the usoc thing like i've done the couscous i've done the

45:41.680 --> 45:49.520
 lemon in my water i go i'm full shit the couscous yeah oh boy like there was just because there's

45:49.520 --> 45:54.720
 like a cookie cutter plan right right and i was like look here's what i want you to do i go i'll

45:54.720 --> 46:00.400
 listen to you but you're gonna walk into the 711 across the street from the usoc and if you can't

46:00.400 --> 46:07.680
 buy it in that 711 it's not on my plan right i go because i go to places where the only thing i can

46:07.680 --> 46:14.160
 eat is pringles and a snickers bar i've done that like i've flown to azerba jawn stayed in a hotel

46:14.160 --> 46:19.840
 where the restaurant is closed usajudo hasn't paid for the meal plan and the only thing that's

46:19.840 --> 46:25.360
 available is the thing across the street so you were eating pringles before fighting a grand slam

46:25.360 --> 46:31.680
 event while cutting 20 pounds and a snickers bar yeah i just the visual of that that's some like

46:31.680 --> 46:36.560
 that's some rocky shit okay build me a nutrition plan go for it because i'm not paying my own way

46:37.280 --> 46:45.280
 to travel with 14 days of food right i mean that's that's one of the magic of your whole career

46:45.280 --> 46:50.400
 and also judo i mean i'm sorry to say of course you want athletes to be super rich

46:50.400 --> 46:56.880
 and super well funded from an athlete perspective and the sport to be popular and managed in an

46:56.880 --> 47:02.640
 ultra competent way but as that's not reality but as a fan it's fun to watch somebody like you

47:02.640 --> 47:09.200
 who's exceptionally driven have to suffer in all these interesting ways but it's it's only

47:09.200 --> 47:16.400
 suffering if you expect the other side i don't expect it i accept it for what it is which is

47:16.400 --> 47:21.360
 why i write off nutrition for athletes right because it can be done without it as long as

47:21.360 --> 47:27.280
 you know to what you said before like you don't believe you need it some people believe they need

47:27.280 --> 47:32.320
 it the mind getting your mind right is the most important thing you know what i believe i need

47:32.320 --> 47:36.720
 what's that a snickers bar when i'm tired i want a little bit of sugar makes me feel better

47:36.720 --> 47:46.720
 you want me to see you uh what are you gonna do yes i just love the the the visual of you

47:46.720 --> 47:51.520
 eating a snickers bar before that's became but that became part of my nutrition plan when the

47:51.520 --> 47:59.360
 usoc guy wrote my nutrition plan i was eating a burrito bowl with brown rice white meat chicken

47:59.360 --> 48:07.200
 black beans guacamole cheese two chocolate chip cookies and a diet coke this is like chipotle uh

48:07.200 --> 48:12.000
 it was below code but same concept same concept would because it's two chocolate chip cookies

48:12.000 --> 48:21.200
 because i needed the sugar i was i was 88 kilos when i stepped on the scale at 6.3

48:21.200 --> 48:30.320
 percent body fat now i got to make 81 you know six what really yeah and the usoc was like hey

48:31.040 --> 48:37.920
 you know you can't you can't fight 81 anymore you have to fight 90s and i go i'm already into the quad

48:38.720 --> 48:44.480
 i'm not changing i go build me a plan where i can do this and now we have to have an acceptable

48:44.480 --> 48:50.080
 weight cut like it just what do you want me to do i'm not the ijf i can't just change the fact that

48:50.080 --> 48:55.680
 it takes two years to qualify i know where i'm at i know what i have to go through and i accept

48:55.680 --> 49:01.840
 the consequences it is what it is we want all right so what was the process i mean it can you

49:01.840 --> 49:07.440
 can you speak to so you you wake up early in the morning the the day of the weigh ins a few hours

49:07.440 --> 49:16.240
 before technically my weight cut never started until i got off a plane and to a hotel and how many

49:16.240 --> 49:23.040
 hours three days so it's a three day cut to three day mentally you're thinking of it that way

49:23.040 --> 49:28.800
 yeah and then you're still eating i eat every day and then like what do you load up on water maybe

49:28.800 --> 49:37.120
 as you start and then nope or the water stops it is what it is so you i mean it's a slow

49:37.120 --> 49:46.400
 slow you're not actually like sweating all three days yeah but then it's like torture to sleep

49:46.400 --> 49:55.600
 part of the process are you able to sleep sometimes it depends so you're dehydrated

49:55.600 --> 50:01.280
 further and further dehydrated with six seven percent body fat trying to lose 10 pound i even

50:01.280 --> 50:05.600
 developed a way to drink water out of a bottle where i don't drink anything but i feel like i have

50:05.600 --> 50:11.760
 uh swishing it was the no so like i take like a bottle of water and like if we were to like

50:11.760 --> 50:15.360
 to draw a line on it i would tip it and i would go like this i go

50:23.280 --> 50:27.440
 and you would draw that line but like i've drank now water for 20 seconds or whatever it is

50:27.440 --> 50:36.880
 and i feel i i get the fix yeah brain told me i got there no problem that's amazing man

50:36.880 --> 50:44.000
 you just your mind's a very powerful tool and the the problem a lot of people have is

50:45.920 --> 50:51.920
 they don't accept the reality of the situation they bitch about the reality of the situation i just

50:51.920 --> 50:59.680
 first of all you could always quit right yep so like you're not that's never missed weight

51:00.240 --> 51:05.680
 never never missed you can you can perform poorly you can't miss weight don't miss weight

51:05.680 --> 51:11.920
 don't miss weight because you you can always win regardless of how bad the weight cut is

51:12.560 --> 51:20.320
 you can never win if you miss weight but your your brain is also really good maybe not your brain

51:20.320 --> 51:27.120
 but i know my brain i think most people's brains are good at generating the more desperate things

51:27.120 --> 51:32.480
 become the better it's generating excuses so what were you doing with your mind

51:33.760 --> 51:42.320
 that resulted in you never missing weight the plan so like i said like my weight cut would

51:42.320 --> 51:48.880
 never start until i got to the hotel because i didn't check my weight the morning of i didn't

51:48.880 --> 51:55.040
 check my weight when i got there i just while i'm traveling i'm doing things at like a minimal level

51:55.680 --> 51:58.480
 but i'm never not giving myself something i'm craving

52:01.760 --> 52:07.600
 if i'm thirsty i'm drinking a diet coke if i'm hungry i'm buying a snickers bar

52:07.600 --> 52:14.480
 i'm buying a sandwich i am and i accept the consequences when i get there and then when

52:14.480 --> 52:21.200
 i get there if i step on the scale and it says 88 kilos i instantaneously know exactly what

52:21.200 --> 52:26.240
 it's going to take to be 81 and then you just follow like a robot follow a very specific process

52:26.240 --> 52:32.960
 yep and then i mean because there's a lot of seconds in three days seconds and minutes and

52:32.960 --> 52:39.600
 you just i just know exactly what it takes from my body i know exactly what a one hour gym workout

52:39.600 --> 52:45.600
 wearing a sauna suit is going to take i know exactly what i'm going to lose on day one and i

52:45.600 --> 52:50.480
 know exactly what i'm going to lose on day three because they're not the same so i can instantly

52:50.480 --> 52:58.560
 look at a hotel decide is there a bathroom sauna gym temperature of the gym access to the gym and

52:58.560 --> 53:05.200
 when it is access to the judo mats my training partners the roads versus streetlights the weather

53:05.200 --> 53:11.120
 outside i can take a look at that environment and say this is my weight this is weigh ins and

53:11.120 --> 53:16.800
 instantaneously in my head there's a plan to make weight and you have a sense of how much sweat adds

53:16.800 --> 53:25.120
 up to to 10 pounds how much sweat plus time yeah just and i make sure in my plan all of my meals

53:25.120 --> 53:30.000
 and how much water i need in between is allocated to still make weight because you have to eat or

53:30.000 --> 53:37.360
 drink during that time are you incorporating like mental exhaustion into this that doesn't exist

53:38.000 --> 53:43.360
 it doesn't it doesn't do you like meditators like what did the thoughts come especially three days

53:43.360 --> 53:47.840
 we're not talking about four hours of suffering i'll tell you this has broken some of the toughest

53:47.840 --> 53:55.360
 people in the world the hardest weight cut i ever had yeah hardest one um i fought pan am games in

53:55.360 --> 54:07.680
 2015 in edmonton canada on a wednesday and i won so i i've made weight on tuesday i fought on wednesday

54:07.680 --> 54:14.320
 where i had to weigh in five percent of my weight class so 84 kilos on wednesday i was 84 kilos i got

54:14.320 --> 54:25.760
 on a plane on that wednesday night and landed friday morning in sochi okay so i've traveled now

54:27.600 --> 54:35.360
 i got on the scale all my bags got lost everything so somehow i flew from there to hear

54:35.360 --> 54:44.800
 no bags and i threw all of my stuff in my bag i wore sandals one pair of pants and a t shirt on

54:44.800 --> 54:49.600
 the plane because i was like i'm just tired i just fought like i don't even want to carry it i don't

54:49.600 --> 54:56.800
 care what are the odds that i get there my bags are gone yeah very low very low sure enough it's

54:56.800 --> 55:04.320
 gone i get all the way to sochi i check into the hotel there's one sauna guess what you have to reserve

55:04.320 --> 55:10.480
 it and you're only allowed to reserve it for an x period of time guess get a small tangent when you

55:10.480 --> 55:16.160
 phone out your bags are gone this is something i'll often think about there's like people that are

55:16.160 --> 55:21.600
 helping you right like that there's a person in the airport who goes yep oops just like that

55:21.600 --> 55:26.320
 and then the person at the hotel who tells you that you have to reserve the sauna and looks at you

55:26.320 --> 55:32.720
 like you're yep they don't care that you've been suffering they don't you're they don't even understand

55:32.720 --> 55:39.120
 why you need it yeah like why oh you know oh this like uh like this little kid reserved it for five

55:39.120 --> 55:45.280
 hours or something to block it off or i'm sorry um is there a frustration that gets in there are you

55:45.280 --> 55:51.200
 just accept reality don't don't even hinder on like the things you can't change because the second

55:51.200 --> 55:57.600
 you get frustrated the second you think you can change it you'll harp on it and that breaks most

55:57.600 --> 56:04.000
 men yeah that like little thing in the back of their mind thinking all like what if there's no

56:04.000 --> 56:08.400
 what if like there's only right here right now yeah it doesn't work it doesn't work let's just quickly

56:08.400 --> 56:14.480
 come up with a solution to fix the problem by the way as another small tangent all the greatest

56:14.480 --> 56:21.280
 people i've interacted with at the highest level think like that they don't linger on the no it's

56:21.280 --> 56:27.280
 like the next thing yeah because like if you want to do something great hard stuff is going to keep

56:27.280 --> 56:31.680
 happening to you and if you're going to let that affect you you're not ever going to do the great

56:31.680 --> 56:37.200
 thing yeah it's fascinating actually like that's the one skill you have to learn um Elon Musk is

56:37.200 --> 56:42.240
 great at this constantly dealing with emergencies okay okay this happened what's the next step yep

56:43.040 --> 56:48.640
 accept it's not that big of a deal every problem has a solution yeah yeah and if i can't solve it

56:48.640 --> 56:54.160
 it's not my problem you know what i'm gonna do yeah exactly so what uh so how'd you figure it out

56:54.160 --> 57:00.560
 in sandals get this i get to the hotel yeah i check in i don't even know about the sauna yet

57:00.560 --> 57:06.640
 i go i need to find a clothing store i'm in the middle of russia i open up google maps and i'm like

57:07.200 --> 57:15.040
 sports store i find an adidas sports store in the middle of sochi russia right i spend like

57:15.040 --> 57:22.000
 five hundred dollars on like average sweats no plastics no nothing and no running shoes because

57:22.000 --> 57:27.680
 they don't have any what's the temperature outside it's cold it was kind of like springish so it wasn't

57:27.680 --> 57:33.360
 cold but it wasn't hot yeah so you still need a lot of layers preferably you would need a lot of

57:33.360 --> 57:38.240
 layers just to cut the amount of weight i'm about to tell you i have to cut because after i bought

57:38.240 --> 57:44.160
 that stuff that next morning and mind you it's a friday it's a friday morning i go to the venue where

57:44.160 --> 57:51.600
 we have the mats open to train and i step on the scale and then sagin bat tarb mongolia goes

57:52.320 --> 58:00.240
 oh pretty good you're almost there and i go oh no no i'm not i stepped on the scale at almost

58:00.240 --> 58:10.320
 94 kilos and i looked at him and i was like i'm 81 and he went good luck you're almost there

58:10.320 --> 58:20.160
 yeah for the next weight class above uh this is on a saturday or friday morning no no sorry

58:20.160 --> 58:28.880
 friday morning the the competition is one sunday sunday i weigh in sunday okay all right holy crap

58:28.880 --> 58:34.400
 i throw on all my layers and there's one other person with me there kalita who's my girlfriend

58:34.400 --> 58:40.640
 at the time now my wife we start doing judo because i'm like this will be the easiest way to knock off

58:40.640 --> 58:49.280
 like three or four kilos well it's cold i have no ghee and i'm working out with a female i can't get

58:49.280 --> 58:54.480
 like overly physical to like really get my muscles going to really break that sweat because

58:55.040 --> 59:00.080
 she has to compete in a day or two she's not a training partner you can't just use this person

59:00.080 --> 59:06.640
 then i stepped on the scale i was 91 kilos so i mean well i was a nice den but like workout

59:06.640 --> 59:13.520
 yeah i go that's that's not gonna fly so sure enough the clothes are now ruined they didn't

59:13.520 --> 59:18.640
 help me lose any extra weight so i go back to the hotel and i start reserving the sauna

59:19.520 --> 59:25.120
 do you know how hard it is to lose that much weight in a sauna by yourself so it's hard on many

59:25.120 --> 59:32.160
 levels but one of them is just mental yeah you're sitting in heat heat and you're not doing anything

59:32.160 --> 59:37.760
 like if there had been a bike or like the sauna was big enough to use a jump rope or you could do

59:37.760 --> 59:45.520
 some sort of activity but you just sit and you stew and you're there mentally at one point during

59:45.520 --> 59:50.480
 the weight cut i actually had my mouth on the bottom part of the door where there was a little

59:50.480 --> 59:56.960
 gap and my legs up on the benches and kalita holding the door so that it didn't open so i

59:56.960 --> 1:00:02.400
 couldn't open it so that i could lean against that thing and have fresh air because i was like

1:00:02.400 --> 1:00:08.880
 i was struggling and we're talking about i mean how many hours is that hours and then the thing is

1:00:08.880 --> 1:00:13.600
 is because you have to reserve the sauna i can't even take like a 30 minute break because the

1:00:13.600 --> 1:00:18.480
 sauna is not going to be mine in an hour which means you have to use the sauna and the heat

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:26.480
 for that a lot of time period and i hate saunas that is always my last resort i would use a bath

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:33.120
 i will train i will run i will jump rope saunas like oh let me do that for 10 minutes after

1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:38.320
 all of my gym workouts just to keep the sweat going while i stretch and cool down that's never

1:00:38.320 --> 1:00:44.000
 like the hey i'm gonna do five 10 minute sessions because i need to lose two kilos that is never

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:53.120
 the plan yeah but i mean so i've done plenty of sauna for weight cuts to know i can't even imagine

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:59.360
 what you went through yeah the seconds slow down that's one way to achieve immortality is like

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:05.040
 the time flows down to like a stop and you're left alone with your thoughts you can't do anything

1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:11.040
 just like you said you can't there's nothing worse than sitting in that kind of heat for 10 15 minutes

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:16.960
 yeah and then you walk out and you're not even sweating yeah there's nothing worse than that

1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:20.720
 and if you like and maybe if you weigh yourself which you probably shouldn't be doing because

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:26.880
 it'll break you yep you haven't lost anything yep and i was weighing myself every time because

1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:34.000
 i only get breaks when i was hitting weight allotments and so if i could lose 0.3 in 10 minutes

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:39.040
 i'd give myself a break but i had to hit certain numbers because i only have the sauna for a certain

1:01:39.040 --> 1:01:44.240
 amount of time and i remember one time i went downstairs to get my key to the sauna and the

1:01:44.240 --> 1:01:49.120
 japanese team had reserved it and took it from me because the guy didn't put my name on the list

1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:53.840
 when i called down to get the sauna so i lost an entire session that i had to get made up

1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:58.800
 towards the later part of the day because i still have no running shoes and then sure enough

1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:07.280
 my bags show up 30 minutes after weigh ins great that's like the universe is kind of giving you

1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:15.840
 a little wink there yeah i think like because so few people do this weight cut at this high of a

1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:21.360
 level people don't often realize because people get a sense of how hard it is to run 200 miles in a

1:02:21.360 --> 1:02:27.440
 desert like they because they go outside here in texas you can run five miles oh it's hard

1:02:27.440 --> 1:02:36.480
 but like the weight cut is really i can you so you just uh like how did you do it just fucking not

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:43.840
 refusing to you have to make weight you have to make weight and you just that's i am astounded

1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:54.720
 when i hear like ufc players like miss weight right like when jaden cox missed weight at the

1:02:54.720 --> 1:03:01.280
 olympic trials i was like at least his was understandable because he missed the actual

1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:08.960
 weigh ins he didn't he wasn't like not on weight but when ufc fighters like miss weight i'm like

1:03:10.400 --> 1:03:17.680
 how did that happen you clearly like gave up a long time ago there were times where i was like

1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:25.120
 but i can't do this there have been times where i've been in a in a sauna suit wrestling with a

1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:30.240
 training partner who's probably 60 kilos who fought earlier that day to lose point three

1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:36.960
 did lose point three like are you considering your mortality in this moment like aren't you

1:03:36.960 --> 1:03:42.560
 thinking you're gonna die because like it's severe dehydration you could damage your body

1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:53.520
 i do are you thinking about any of this or is it just uh man okay yes but yeah i'm i'm on the

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:59.120
 other level too where like i've been in belgium right belgium there used to be a b level tournament

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:04.800
 and the tournament used to go on and because i was always on the heavier side like 81s fights on

1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:11.040
 the second day which is the heavyweight day weigh ins were always at like let's say 2 p.m the day

1:04:11.040 --> 1:04:17.040
 before for that tournament well there was a sauna at the tournament i remember like being in the sauna

1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:25.520
 and like oh i'm 80.9 kilos weigh ins aren't for three hours fucking i'm gonna have lunch

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:35.760
 because i i mentally understand that what i eat right now is gonna fuel me for tomorrow

1:04:35.760 --> 1:04:41.760
 so i don't want to skip it i have the time to put it into my system and still lose it right it's

1:04:41.760 --> 1:04:46.880
 almost like a computer program you're running through the process you haven't i i get it but

1:04:46.880 --> 1:04:53.040
 like that all relies on your ability to be um to get it back off yeah i mean but also just like go

1:04:53.040 --> 1:04:56.880
 through this process which is painful it's like those monks who meditate while sitting in a fire

1:04:56.880 --> 1:05:02.800
 kind of thing or something right like it that uh yeah it's it's uh it's really interesting is there

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:08.320
 other people that are critical to this or is this all internal to you are there people that

1:05:09.600 --> 1:05:16.400
 you know everybody has their own way of doing it um some people don't cut that much some people

1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:24.880
 can't wait cut it all right they would rather have been like 83 kilos fighting 90 than you know be 83

1:05:24.880 --> 1:05:34.640
 kilos fighting 81 so why did you never move up to 90 uh what's your sense is it from your

1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:40.400
 deep understanding of your own judo and like the judo opponents you would face at 90 and 81

1:05:40.400 --> 1:05:45.680
 because 81 is probably the hardest if not the second hardest division in the history of judo

1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:53.680
 compared to 73 and 81 you know when i was a kid like i always wanted to be like the middleweight

1:05:53.680 --> 1:06:00.160
 olympic champion like the 81 kilo olympic champion when i was in high school i made a decision when

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:06.160
 i was trying to make weight for 73 i was like this is i was cutting weight for 73 like i was

1:06:06.160 --> 1:06:12.160
 cutting weight at the end of my career right and i was like i'm just gonna bag it i'm gonna accept

1:06:12.160 --> 1:06:17.360
 the fact that i may not make a junior world team i may not make this team but i'll grow into the

1:06:17.360 --> 1:06:22.960
 division so when i'm a senior player like i'm ready to go and i'll naturally be stronger there's an

1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:29.200
 understanding of like a growth process when you move up a weight class most people can't just

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:35.680
 oh i'm gonna fight nineties and i'm gonna win because i won an 81 the style of judo is different

1:06:35.680 --> 1:06:40.160
 how you move is different how they do things is different there's like a learning curve that goes

1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:47.840
 into it and because the weight cut didn't really happen until i was getting ready for real i wasn't

1:06:47.840 --> 1:06:52.240
 about to have my last olympic games be at a different weight class that i may or may not be able to

1:06:52.240 --> 1:06:59.680
 grow into i mean this is an awesome story of you kind of decided that this will be your life's work

1:06:59.680 --> 1:07:05.280
 in terms of judo competitor is like the 81 division i'm going to i mean i don't know if you saw it

1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:12.320
 that way but you're talking about three olympics and it's like this story of i would say tragedy and

1:07:12.320 --> 1:07:20.240
 triumph of just wars in 81 kilograms with with the usual cast of characters of the you know top

1:07:20.240 --> 1:07:26.080
 five in the world kind of thing so you just became a scholar of that let your body grow into it and

1:07:26.080 --> 1:07:30.800
 then let your body outgrow it and still suffer through it to keep it in the 81 kilograms

1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:38.480
 you never competed at like at the highest levels at 90 i entered one tournament at 90 kilos um and

1:07:38.480 --> 1:07:49.520
 that was because before rio from 20 from the end of 2014 all the way up until rios every time i fought

1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:55.920
 i got hurt every time there was no time where i made weight and got injured because my body weight

1:07:55.920 --> 1:08:02.800
 was so high my body fat was so low that by the time i dehydrated enough to get down there and you

1:08:02.800 --> 1:08:08.800
 take the physicality of judo and throw that into the mix something broke every time it was like

1:08:08.800 --> 1:08:19.920
 nature of the beast so the plan was before rio we made an agreement with us a judo that travish

1:08:19.920 --> 1:08:25.360
 you're going to fight 90 kilos but you're not going to weigh in at 90 kilos like hey there's no like

1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:31.040
 you get to be 94 kilos and cut to 90s there's like a you're going to step on the scale at 84

1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:36.400
 kilos like a little bit of a weight cut but not a full one just so that you feel like you get into

1:08:36.400 --> 1:08:44.560
 like the tournament because when i around 2012 when i was talking with the usoc nutritionist i

1:08:44.560 --> 1:08:49.200
 actually got my weight down so much that i didn't really need to cut weight the problem is i wasn't

1:08:49.200 --> 1:08:53.200
 cutting weight i didn't feel like i was competing got it right there's you have to go through like

1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:58.240
 that mental process and i never really reworked that it was easier to just cut the weight and be

1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:04.720
 ready to go but when i entered into the 90 kilo division i was rushed to the hospital the night

1:09:04.720 --> 1:09:11.120
 after because my body broke out in hives like full body what they had to they said it was stress

1:09:11.120 --> 1:09:20.080
 induced so a month before the games i was hospitalized and hungry and filled with steroids

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:26.080
 to get the hives to drop and every couple days my body when i got back home i would end up in

1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:30.400
 the hospital because my whole body would break out again i wonder if it's like deviating from

1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:36.640
 the process that you so like perfectly crafted already or it was stress from my mind thinking

1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:41.760
 like even though it's not top of mind there's probably a portion of me that like the olympics

1:09:41.760 --> 1:09:49.040
 is coming around and it could be my last that like my body just reacted to something chemically so

1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:56.560
 i was breaking out in hives i actually bought like a 600 euro hugo boss suit because when i was in

1:09:56.560 --> 1:10:02.000
 the netherlands training at the time i thought i had bedbugs because i was getting bit everywhere

1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:06.400
 then i thought there was something in the detergent at the local thing so i threw away all more

1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:11.600
 clothes like i was paying for showers because i was trying to get the detergent off my body

1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:17.600
 and buying new clothes at the airport trying to figure it out trying to figure it out just go

1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:22.160
 yeah accepting the situation i mean the but the level of stress is exceptionally high here

1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:30.480
 can we talk about the other side people are gonna love this but you're you have a long history

1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:38.960
 of persevering through injuries through insane amounts of injuries my ability to tolerate pain

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:47.440
 is probably more than most people but see injuries aren't just pain right it's like it's also mental

1:10:47.440 --> 1:10:54.640
 like psychological like again like the weight cut it can make a lot of people quit yep can you

1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:01.280
 tell your history of injuries what are the biggest injuries the toughest injuries in your career

1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:09.040
 um starting from what your early teens my early teens um i actually got out of sports

1:11:09.040 --> 1:11:18.080
 from 11 to i would say like 15 years old 16 years old because a kid shot a double leg through my knee

1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:22.800
 cap and i partially tore all the ligaments in my knee cartilage meniscus the whole nine yards

1:11:23.440 --> 1:11:29.680
 and i had to learn how to walk again i spent two years in a leg brace crutches you know

1:11:29.680 --> 1:11:37.680
 hobbling around the schoolyard that one was a challenge to come back from um i've broken most

1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:45.360
 of my ribs i won nationals with nine broken ribs i was actually getting novocaine shots into my chest

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:50.960
 to avoid feeling the pain and then wrapping them to try to make sure i didn't pop along

1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:59.760
 um i've broken my collar bone um i have five herniated disc in my neck i fractured my back twice

1:12:00.560 --> 1:12:07.200
 i've broken my tailbone i tore my si joints i've torn my right hamstring twice my left one

1:12:07.200 --> 1:12:16.240
 once um broken my ankles a few times i spun it once in a 360 that had depth surgery

1:12:18.080 --> 1:12:27.600
 fingers toes elbows shoulders so all of these are first of all you're uh you're a tough you're

1:12:27.600 --> 1:12:35.040
 tough dude man um so each of those have a story behind them so if you're talking about the collar

1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:43.920
 bone or the ankles uh or the back the neck is there interesting stories here that uh behind

1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:53.040
 these injuries heart training heart competing jiu jitsu judo so ground stuff like uh sparring in the

1:12:53.040 --> 1:12:59.280
 dojo or like drilling or all that kind of stuff is what if you were to sort of break it down your

1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:04.880
 understanding of the the last skip of injuries you went through i've never had one in jiu jitsu

1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:13.680
 ever i mean i might have like torn a fingernail or like you know gotten keyburn but i've never been

1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:24.160
 like seriously injured i know when panza straight ankle locked me at copepodio that hurt but i wasn't

1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:30.640
 injured like it felt sore but like if i had to run like i could run i can now understand probably

1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:37.200
 exactly what the injuries came from then you're very quickly excelled at jiu jitsu you have achieved

1:13:37.200 --> 1:13:43.200
 another level in judo and i think that means the intensity with which you approached judo

1:13:44.080 --> 1:13:52.400
 to achieve that world class level probably is the source of the injuries yeah because the mentality

1:13:52.400 --> 1:14:02.720
 of how i approached judo versus jiu jitsu jiu jitsu to me is like a game that like we would play

1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:08.160
 like if you wanted to like grab a basketball and like go play a game of one on one that's like jiu

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:14.960
 jitsu to me like i can't take the sport in its entirety seriously because i feel like the community

1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:20.400
 of jiu jitsu doesn't take it seriously so just for people who don't know just to set some context

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:28.000
 you're you're a black belt in jiu jitsu but more importantly you've beaten a lot of world

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:33.600
 class jiu jitsu people you've done very well at the highest levels of competition yeah i would

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:42.640
 necessarily say i've beaten them as much as i've trained with them and they understand whoever it

1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:50.560
 is that through training with me that like i'm not just a judo guy like i know how to do jiu jitsu

1:14:51.600 --> 1:15:00.160
 right and if any one of them were to come to me and like say hey you know i want to feel what it

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:09.840
 feels like to do judo with me they would quickly understand that like the way i approach one is

1:15:09.840 --> 1:15:14.080
 very different than the way i approach the other like we probably wouldn't be friends

1:15:14.080 --> 1:15:19.360
 if they did judo with me versus if they did jiu jitsu with me i'm curious asking for a friend

1:15:19.360 --> 1:15:24.400
 because mostly because i'll do a little judo with you today so you clearly because you're a great

1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:30.320
 instructor and teacher you have a mode where you can demonstrate a technique do you know how to like

1:15:30.320 --> 1:15:37.360
 spar where you're going like 50 percent it's hard to put like a percentage to it because

1:15:37.360 --> 1:15:43.680
 i've never in all of my jiu jitsu ever gone a hundred percent in jiu jitsu yeah like i had a

1:15:43.680 --> 1:15:50.480
 conversation with salo one time where we were talking about like jiu jitsu and training and i

1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:58.720
 was like well if i got his arm i would just break it and he was like but what if he tapped i go

1:15:58.720 --> 1:16:05.120
 that's not my responsibility if he taps and the ref doesn't say anything you just break it you just

1:16:05.120 --> 1:16:10.400
 keep going yeah he goes but the tap means it's over and i said no the ref tells me when it's over

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:15.760
 i go i never give you the opportunity to tap because if you have the opportunity to tap that

1:16:15.760 --> 1:16:21.040
 means you had the opportunity to think about how to get out make a decision that you can't

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:27.760
 then tap i clearly operated too slowly yeah so there's a it's either broken or i don't have it

1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:34.720
 or i don't have it you're a terrifying person go against in jido like the on the ground like

1:16:34.720 --> 1:16:40.400
 everything you did that's that's amazing um that's really amazing that's what made you a really fun

1:16:40.400 --> 1:16:46.000
 person to watch because you really went to war with these people yeah so you know what it's like

1:16:46.000 --> 1:16:52.400
 to go a hundred percent in jido i do because i know what it's like to train with somebody under

1:16:52.400 --> 1:16:58.960
 the mentality of i'm gonna do everything i want to do you're gonna do nothing you want to do

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:05.360
 and you're gonna accept that do you have a train in judo where where you let people get stuff of

1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:13.040
 course all the time now or like always even when you're sort of building up the four years building

1:17:13.040 --> 1:17:18.240
 up to the olympics like there's smaller guys that are throwing you in the gym and that kind of stuff

1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:26.080
 no i never said that okay that never came out of my mouth i said i let people do stuff i never

1:17:26.080 --> 1:17:30.240
 said smaller people throw me oh you mean you let them get a grip but then you'll position

1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:36.880
 yourself on such a way that it's it's it's hopeless like what the number one skill set that judo is

1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:45.520
 going to teach you is the ability to give people false hope right because i'm really looking forward

1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:51.760
 to the video we're gonna shoot like i can let you take a grip yeah i can let you think that

1:17:51.760 --> 1:17:57.440
 there's opportunity but what you don't understand is by the position and angle that i'm in it's

1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:04.080
 actually false hope yeah like as long as you don't know that it is then now i'm free to operate and

1:18:04.080 --> 1:18:11.920
 do what i want see i competed in judo against uh black belts where i would go in and it looks

1:18:11.920 --> 1:18:17.040
 like i could should be able to throw them and then you just hit a wall and then i also saw you

1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:22.720
 destroy those black belts yeah so there's levels to this yeah it's the the cliche thing of there's

1:18:22.720 --> 1:18:28.800
 black belts and there's black belts you're unique in this there may be a couple other uh judoka

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:35.760
 in america but you're really like unique i then get to see people that really i felt like were

1:18:36.400 --> 1:18:40.720
 10x better than me it just feels like that sometimes i've learned that madness and it said

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:47.760
 be truly might only be just a little better but i saw you destroy them and it was like holy

1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:57.920
 shit there's a thing in judo right where you know imagine like you as like just an adult right um

1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:04.080
 and i i hope people can like conceptualize this when they hear this but imagine like you're a full

1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:08.960
 grown adult even male female it doesn't matter but there's a little kid in front of you like call him

1:19:08.960 --> 1:19:15.760
 five or six years old and he's acting out like do you think you have the physical capability of

1:19:15.760 --> 1:19:22.400
 with one hand grabbing that person or that kid and making sure that they freeze like they feel

1:19:22.400 --> 1:19:28.240
 like they're nervous and like they can't do anything right when you fight a good judo player

1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:35.040
 when they grab you that's what it feels like as an adult yeah when people even i've felt that from

1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:40.160
 like certain players in japan like when they get a grip i'm like i've now lost the function of this

1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:46.160
 line yeah that's a really good way to put it i think i could potentially beat some of the people

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:54.720
 of uh went against but certain groups they took it made me feel powerless yep i was like i didn't

1:19:54.720 --> 1:19:59.600
 know this was possible that kind of power was possible and you don't even know where it originates

1:19:59.600 --> 1:20:04.720
 from yeah because you're like how does one person's hand do this where i can't use my whole arm yeah

1:20:04.720 --> 1:20:09.840
 or like i can't pick up my right foot because he's holding on to my right sleeve yeah it was kind of

1:20:10.960 --> 1:20:16.400
 on a basic animalistic sense kind of terrifying it's i mean you don't want to

1:20:18.320 --> 1:20:24.240
 part of this is like ego but you realize that there's a food chain and you're not at the top of it

1:20:26.320 --> 1:20:30.960
 that's part of the humbling process i think of martial arts it's like i think everybody

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:38.560
 like a lot of people think they're much higher in the food chain than they are they really are

1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:42.960
 and then when you realize this is why it's a really healthy process for people they're not

1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:48.240
 even competing in the olympics to practice martial arts because you realize okay that like

1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:51.440
 putting yourself more accurately in the food chain is really good

1:20:52.800 --> 1:20:57.920
 way to sort of place yourself in the rest of the world it humbles you to the reality the harshness

1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:02.480
 of the world yeah it's kind of like when people look at like survival in the wilderness it's

1:21:02.480 --> 1:21:08.640
 like oh it's not that hard no you'd probably be dying a couple days same thing with like

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:15.360
 judo and martial arts like yeah it's really not that hard but you don't know what to do yet and

1:21:15.360 --> 1:21:20.320
 so when you find out that first time that you don't know what to do it's devastating to a lot of

1:21:20.320 --> 1:21:26.000
 people but those that like stick through it and like start to learn it's a very powerful

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:32.960
 level like feeling that now like you can take care of yourself and i think i want to talk to you a

1:21:32.960 --> 1:21:38.480
 few times before you talked about that there's like love like the top three the top five in the

1:21:38.480 --> 1:21:44.880
 world i don't know where you put them but there there are another like level level here yeah

1:21:44.880 --> 1:21:51.840
 and the fact that you're i mean it's it's so exciting to me probably because i just felt

1:21:51.840 --> 1:22:01.120
 all the levels here and i i've seen you and others at that height destroy those i've i i've seen the

1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:09.280
 exponential levels to this game it's incredible that you're didn't quit didn't doubt yourself

1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:16.320
 and just persevered through three olympics to get to that highest always fighting at that like

1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:22.960
 very highest of levels but just like you know from the top 10 to the top five like really breaking

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:30.640
 in through that i don't know um what would you say it took to get to that highest of levels

1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:34.800
 like if you when you look back at all the weight cuts to just the insane amount of injuries

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:39.840
 believe it or not i didn't really think i was there until

1:22:39.840 --> 1:22:47.280
 2013 i thought i was recognized as one of the best because i was able to fight for

1:22:47.280 --> 1:22:51.360
 oppensburg which was the professional boondest league team for germany which is one of the top

1:22:51.360 --> 1:22:58.560
 clubs in all of europe um when they asked me to i felt like europe had like accepted me as like

1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:05.440
 oh i'm a top level judo player but i don't necessarily think that when i signed on to

1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:11.840
 compete for them that the division or the world of judo saw me as a top level judo player right

1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:22.000
 there's there's a a mental shift that happens along that point and for me my mental shift really

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:32.240
 came into play in december of 2015 before real that was like when i lost in japan that's when i

1:23:32.240 --> 1:23:39.760
 realized like the world respects my abilities and they compete against them they don't compete

1:23:39.760 --> 1:23:51.280
 against me as a person they compete against the idea or the the persona that i've been able to

1:23:51.280 --> 1:23:56.640
 establish over the years of competing in the division wow so you're the they probably have a

1:23:56.640 --> 1:24:03.360
 nickname for you you're the system of ideas and thought that they study but they're studying

1:24:03.360 --> 1:24:13.760
 me as a conceptual whole not me as the human is your style relatively unique in the 81 kilogram

1:24:13.760 --> 1:24:23.280
 division it was relatively unique for kayla i and jimmy up until 2016 now since 2016 you can see a

1:24:23.280 --> 1:24:28.720
 lot of what we used to do throughout most of europe and even asia like you're starting to see some

1:24:28.720 --> 1:24:35.680
 of those techniques that you didn't see before starting to get implemented because when i was

1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:42.960
 when i was gearing up for 2015 i had such a slew of injuries that entire calendar year that

1:24:43.920 --> 1:24:49.760
 i never should have made it to rio i should have called it quits at the end of 2015 because

1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:57.520
 i suffered that major concussion in february i stepped on a mat in may for the first time i lost

1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:05.760
 five straight tournaments i left the national team went to japan won pan am games got a bacterial

1:25:05.760 --> 1:25:11.760
 infection at the world almost had my leg cut off tore my si joint later on that year and then

1:25:11.760 --> 1:25:18.960
 took fifth in japan and when you look at like the calendar year as a whole like the world

1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:24.240
 should have treated me like i was washed up like this guy hasn't been training he hasn't been doing

1:25:24.240 --> 1:25:30.720
 anything but i took fifth in japan now how does a guy that hasn't trained all year take fifth at

1:25:30.720 --> 1:25:36.560
 one of the hardest tournaments in the world on two weeks of training because they were fighting

1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:44.160
 the guy i used to be not the guy i was at the tournament which means they were competing under

1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:50.240
 the idea of like what is he really capable of not what have i brought to the table today

1:25:52.960 --> 1:25:57.840
 and that just gave you the confidence and that told me that like well if i can take fifth and

1:25:57.840 --> 1:26:03.360
 i'm this bad at judo right now wait until i'm healthy and i'm back in shape then they're not

1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:07.600
 going to know what hit him one of the essential components of being the number one in the world

1:26:07.600 --> 1:26:14.960
 or up in that place is that confidence the self belief and the rest of the world believing it you

1:26:14.960 --> 1:26:19.280
 can have all the confidence in the world but if the rest of the room doesn't buy it it's nothing

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:26.240
 that's funny it's like there's certain people right with tyson uh my tyson they all understand

1:26:26.240 --> 1:26:31.440
 he could not train and they're still scared yeah right like he doesn't have to work out

1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:36.240
 that hard anymore there's several judo you know this way better but from a spectator perspective

1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:42.560
 like ilia ciliatus is like that he's one of them it's like he he's portrayed over the years

1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:48.800
 like everyone's so scared of that guy it's interesting yep i people were scared of you too

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:56.400
 people just gave a certain level of respect to my skill set and whether i had a bad way cut or

1:26:56.400 --> 1:27:01.120
 didn't have a bad way cut or not trained for the last three months which never happened i'm just

1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:07.840
 saying they were going to fight the persona and it's an important distinction when you're looking

1:27:07.840 --> 1:27:16.720
 at the top five because everybody coming up they're training against the persona not who you are

1:27:16.720 --> 1:27:23.200
 even i did that at a younger age that's why i would always go to people's hometowns because like

1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:28.240
 i don't i don't care about the persona i want to know what you do day in the day out when i couldn't

1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:33.360
 beat a russian i told jimmy send me to russia i need to i need to understand and see it with my own

1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:40.880
 eyes what they do outperform so that i can believe that i can beat them can i ask you on this a small

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:47.520
 tangent so uh dagestan has produced some incredible wrestlers yeah i don't know what the story with

1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:54.720
 judo is where the source of source of greatness in russia is for judo but what do you make of

1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:01.200
 dagestan why why what is it in the culture of there or russia broadly that produces greatness

1:28:02.720 --> 1:28:08.080
 specifically in the combat sports i don't know yeah specifically in the combat sports sorry

1:28:08.080 --> 1:28:11.680
 but i don't know if you want to draw a distinction between wrestling and judo i'm almost curious

1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:17.200
 do you understand the differences there in the culture still a combat sport to them they're

1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:27.040
 still in that same like realm of they're taking young kids and that that's what they do so kabib

1:28:27.040 --> 1:28:34.560
 speaks very highly of judo yep like it's funny kabib vladimir putin people don't get it but like

1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:40.160
 judo is like one of the premier sports in the world but we just don't understand it it's not

1:28:40.160 --> 1:28:48.240
 just popularity so definitely popularity but also like this respect and there's a certain thing which

1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:52.560
 is why i really value judo internationally you don't get this in the united states but internationally

1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:59.840
 there's an understanding like later in life when you're a scientist meeting a businessman

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:06.400
 when you both have done judo there's this like nod of respect yeah it's so interesting uh there's

1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:11.520
 very few sports like that you know basketball doesn't have any i don't know almost any sport like that

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:17.520
 and it's fascinating wrestling has that in the us it is the us only the rest of the world doesn't

1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:22.720
 do that there's a few like you could see that in like iran or something like that with the respect

1:29:22.720 --> 1:29:29.520
 wrestling in that kind of way yeah it's um but judo on like a global scale is probably that only one

1:29:29.520 --> 1:29:37.200
 man due to it's like physicality and the hardships that you have to go through to reach that upper

1:29:37.200 --> 1:29:42.720
 level so why do you think dagistan why do you think kabib is as good as he is is there is this just

1:29:42.720 --> 1:29:49.200
 the raw genetics of the human or is there something about the system the system it's all has to do

1:29:49.200 --> 1:29:58.320
 with the system so they um they grow up around fighting in all forms yep um they're also i mean

1:29:58.320 --> 1:30:04.160
 their technique is exceptionally good because they they grow up in it they grow up and they don't

1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:10.240
 they don't understand anything else so you don't have to it's almost like you with the way cutting

1:30:11.040 --> 1:30:16.000
 it's not like a big dramatic thing for them to fight it's like this is just part of life

1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:24.160
 yes and when you're i don't want to say bread into it but when you've done it for you know

1:30:24.160 --> 1:30:29.920
 i want to say like 90 of your life by the time like kabib probably has right from the time

1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:37.280
 he could crawl he's probably been grappling in some fashion thereof right um you know when you

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:43.760
 as grapplers like you can look at a wrestler and having never seen this person before and go

1:30:44.560 --> 1:30:52.240
 you wrestled yeah why is that it's because he's probably wrestled since he was like six so

1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:58.880
 the way he carries himself the way his body is built the way he grew into it was framed around

1:30:58.880 --> 1:31:06.240
 wrestling right so the people in that culture are framed around fighting and grappling you're

1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:11.440
 right it's like first of all philosophically psychologically but also just like the way you

1:31:11.440 --> 1:31:16.640
 move your body yes that means like when you're young the people you admire move their body in a

1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:22.400
 certain kind of way and then genetically it it just as they keep doing that they're just going

1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:28.160
 to get better and better every generation yeah it's just going to keep improving because they

1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:33.200
 just keep building into that system of turning them out and part of it there's like cultural stuff

1:31:33.200 --> 1:31:38.160
 where i mean it's such an interesting approach to wrestling i really want to travel to degestan

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:44.720
 and just talk to them because i happen to be able to speak russian because because there's um less

1:31:44.720 --> 1:31:52.000
 value for this kind of materialistic success that i think sometimes can get in the way of

1:31:52.560 --> 1:31:58.400
 greatness it seems like it makes coaching more difficult it makes like following orders as an

1:31:58.400 --> 1:32:03.680
 athlete more difficult i don't know struggle with that in us age you know yeah because you want more

1:32:03.680 --> 1:32:10.800
 money but then more money if not applied correctly can corrupt the system somehow can split people

1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:16.240
 up it just it's same thing with the prestige around certain medals over others because athletes start

1:32:16.880 --> 1:32:26.800
 chasing fame instead of development yeah yeah that's i mean uh the satio brothers are famous for

1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:33.120
 this like ignoring ignoring fame ignoring all of this like focus on the art itself not even not so

1:32:33.120 --> 1:32:38.240
 it's not even the medals exactly you're saying just the purity of like when you're in it yeah and let

1:32:38.240 --> 1:32:42.800
 everybody else figure out their stupid medals and money and all that because it comes it comes right

1:32:42.800 --> 1:32:48.160
 exactly it's a result yeah exactly like it's not that you don't appreciate it but you know that it

1:32:48.160 --> 1:32:55.840
 comes if you focus on the art there's a distinction when you're talking about your athletic career

1:32:55.840 --> 1:33:03.200
 or really any endeavor right the problem with goal setting is nobody teaches the athletes

1:33:03.200 --> 1:33:12.080
 or the people how to transition from the goal to reality right so when you look at my career as a

1:33:12.080 --> 1:33:18.400
 whole like when i was getting ready for 2008 i actually forgot to train for it i was so happy

1:33:18.400 --> 1:33:23.680
 at such a young age that i became an olympian that that in and of itself was a goal that i thought

1:33:24.320 --> 1:33:29.520
 had to be admired had to be celebrated that you know the games are right around the corner

1:33:29.520 --> 1:33:36.960
 that i didn't really come down off that high you're the local optima of just winning the trials

1:33:36.960 --> 1:33:42.160
 yeah that was a big thing it's a huge thing but then you're just focusing on the accomplishment

1:33:42.160 --> 1:33:49.680
 not the correct but at some point right when i when i went into london i actually went into

1:33:49.680 --> 1:33:54.560
 london going with i'm gonna prove i'm the best in the world because i believe i'm the best in the

1:33:54.560 --> 1:34:02.400
 world and i believe it from like the bottom of my soul that i'm winning this and then you're

1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:06.560
 almost like trying to tell the universe like i'm accomplishing this thing because it's a goal

1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:15.120
 but when i went into rio i just accepted the fact that i was winning it's not a goal like

1:34:15.120 --> 1:34:22.400
 this is happening you visualize it but i felt it you felt it right like this is no longer a goal

1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:30.320
 anymore like i anticipated like this is happening i i can see this coming down the path because

1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:35.920
 i'm anticipating that the games is happening and i'm gonna win it's not a goal it's an

1:34:35.920 --> 1:34:42.480
 anticipation and there's a distinct distinction there between the two okay so for people who are

1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:50.960
 just watching the video of this there should be an overlay of uh young travis this is uh

1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:56.800
 you still had to make 81 this is still a tough cut here no this one was relatively easy this

1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:04.880
 is going all the way back to 2008 so this is the summer before the games this probably happened in

1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:13.840
 june i would say so this is the uh olympic trials so in the united states you have to

1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:18.960
 i mean similar to like wrestling you have to win the trials to qualify for that particular

1:35:18.960 --> 1:35:24.720
 division to represent the united states so this is you said june before an august olympics yep

1:35:25.680 --> 1:35:31.600
 so here i just wanted to show this match because uh what was the there's another one i think you

1:35:31.600 --> 1:35:35.280
 do a pin you do some nice groundwork in the other one but in this one

1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:42.400
 fighting a teammate fighting a teammate former teammate oh there's an old school double leg i

1:35:42.400 --> 1:35:50.240
 forgot about that and it's weird to see so you so there um the travis's opponent and he's the

1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:59.760
 travis is setting up here that say nagi uh posting his left arm and getting it done that's a big

1:35:59.760 --> 1:36:06.800
 that's a big throw you don't have too many of those big throws on uh on video because like you

1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:10.960
 often on video you're going against the best people in the world it's tough to get like that

1:36:10.960 --> 1:36:16.800
 much air and a lot of times the the ones that we do see and you know the part that a lot of people

1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:24.480
 don't experience is a lot of those times where i threw people with that throw it was in training

1:36:24.480 --> 1:36:31.360
 camps so by the time i got to the competition with these guys they were playing a hundred percent

1:36:31.360 --> 1:36:38.320
 defense to never let me do that yeah so you do this um here are you kind of pulling him down

1:36:38.320 --> 1:36:43.200
 no he's i'm trying to get him to come up to come up but are you pulling him down to get to fake

1:36:43.200 --> 1:36:49.520
 him up i'm not doing anything with my left hand uh so here the the opponent's so what i'm doing

1:36:49.520 --> 1:36:56.720
 right now is his head is like in my chest i'm pressing him to get his head to lift with my chest

1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:04.000
 so i'm pressing his hand down so i can use my chest to like pinch my scaps and roll his head up

1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:09.760
 so that he wants to pick it up and and then he i mean doesn't even know what's coming here

1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:16.400
 oh no he might not oh no he knew he was a former teammate he knew exactly what i was trying to do

1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:24.560
 and that was a really big step with your right foot it covers uh about four feet so you step

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:34.000
 up and your left um catches up in like perfect position yeah you back it up a little bit

1:37:36.080 --> 1:37:43.200
 keep going keep going right there that this is like an important distinction between mine and

1:37:43.200 --> 1:37:52.080
 everybody else's is because i split his hip um i actually once i'm able to split i no longer need

1:37:52.080 --> 1:37:58.640
 his center gravity below mine right and when you say split you mean you put your foot in between

1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:04.560
 might do that split that four foot split yes and then when i get my feet back together

1:38:04.560 --> 1:38:10.480
 it doesn't matter that i'm under his center gravity or not yeah that's why my chest is right

1:38:10.480 --> 1:38:18.320
 around his like sternum height for me yes so there i mean how does he get for people just

1:38:18.320 --> 1:38:25.680
 listening to this travel steps is like does a big huge step gets like my hip is probably right around

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:32.080
 his nipple because he's he's brought back so much yeah that's right so like so you're how is the

1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:37.280
 physics of this work you're violating the principle of your center of mass being under oh i guess

1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:43.360
 somehow it is i don't know but he has nowhere to go he's screwed yes that's the kicker is

1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:51.920
 is the way mine mine works is in order for him to play an effective defense he needs to have his

1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:58.880
 feet firmly planted on the ground with friction yeah otherwise he can't press into me to stop it

1:38:58.880 --> 1:39:04.880
 so when i get him to sprawl back when i split his legs he effectively loses that contact

1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:09.040
 with the floor even though his feet are on the floor they're not in a position where he can

1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:15.440
 drive from them yeah therefore when i flip he flips so there's a so there's a natural

1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:22.800
 like flailing here so he's not falling forward you're falling forward yeah he's just attached to

1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:28.320
 you so like you can keep him up there and then like legs would be just flailing yep one of my

1:39:28.320 --> 1:39:33.920
 one of my golden rules when i'm training and i get really tired one of the like mantras i would

1:39:33.920 --> 1:39:38.640
 always tell myself is i'm gonna put my back on your chest and then i'm gonna put my back on the

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:44.480
 floor yeah because then you'll be underneath me it's a good principle the very simple and it

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:49.280
 regardless of like all the chaos and how quickly things are happening it's something i can just

1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:55.120
 dumb everything down to and focus on regardless of the gripping situation the footwork all of that

1:39:55.120 --> 1:40:00.320
 get my back to your chest and then put my back on the floor so this step of getting your back

1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:06.240
 to their chest like for for people who are sort of more like for example for people like me

1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:12.000
 who are just like amateur judo people like there's all kinds of ways to prevent this

1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:19.040
 turn from happening the gripping and just everything how difficult is it at the highest

1:40:19.040 --> 1:40:25.040
 level to get into this position i mean you make it look effortless often but like to get to a

1:40:25.040 --> 1:40:31.920
 position where you're from facing them to your back to them is that like strategy is that timing

1:40:31.920 --> 1:40:39.440
 is that timing it's timing it's like anything like if i wanted to punch you in the face like how

1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:44.640
 hard is it to really do that if you know you can just play defense and block it yeah the trick is

1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:51.920
 to get them to play defense to something that never happened and then you go through like another

1:40:51.920 --> 1:40:56.320
 way and then you just go through what would technically be your first plan if you planned

1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:04.960
 on them playing defense so i set the stage from the very beginning for this to work so then this

1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:12.560
 you're uh you're celebrating here it's a huge sort of once a big accomplishment big relief

1:41:12.560 --> 1:41:18.800
 to qualify for the olympics and then you go into the olympics and this is where i first saw judo

1:41:19.360 --> 1:41:25.680
 and i kind of thought of them as the same as judo and jujitsu and i was really impressed by

1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:33.120
 your performance in that olympics the footage nowhere to be found these days but at that time

1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:39.360
 i think you could still you could watch it live on nbc olympics or somewhere like that and i remember

1:41:39.360 --> 1:41:44.000
 watching several of your matches one of them was the match against olympisch off the german

1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:49.600
 and i remember being it'd be nice if you can talk to that match because i don't remember it all i

1:41:49.600 --> 1:42:01.840
 remember is being frustrated yep by him not letting you play judo yeah so obviously you faced him

1:42:01.840 --> 1:42:06.480
 again four years later and there's a lot of frustration there as well but i remember being

1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:11.840
 extra frustrated in 2008 what was that match like so he might have been number one in the

1:42:11.840 --> 1:42:18.720
 world at the time or up there he was up there for sure especially going into 2008 he was really

1:42:18.720 --> 1:42:27.280
 high up there yeah and did he win gold at that olympics yes yeah because he's silvered in london

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:34.640
 it was the same olympic final both in 2008 and london yeah okay so you're facing him there

1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:40.560
 were you intimidated what was the strategy can you talk to that match because it kind of sets

1:42:40.560 --> 1:42:47.920
 the stage for the rematch in 2012 yeah he was somebody that i had trained with in the past

1:42:47.920 --> 1:42:53.120
 and for some reason when it comes to him and i when we trained together

1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:01.840
 it's more of a physical altercation than a judo training session you know like it's just like

1:43:01.840 --> 1:43:06.880
 the coaches have had to break us up a few times like are you guys get almost like angry too a

1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:12.640
 little bit it always goes you know farther than it should for we're friends like we say hello to

1:43:12.640 --> 1:43:17.120
 each other but for some reason when we train together there's something about like him and

1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:22.080
 me that just oil and water i don't know what it is it could it be also the gripping because he's a

1:43:22.080 --> 1:43:26.720
 great gripping strategist yeah does he frustrate you with certain kinds of grips and then you get

1:43:26.720 --> 1:43:31.280
 pissed off and then you frustrate him and then he gets pissed off and then before you know it somebody

1:43:31.280 --> 1:43:36.640
 kicks somebody or punched somebody in the mouth or done something yeah so one of the only evidence

1:43:36.640 --> 1:43:45.040
 is we have online if you're fighting him is you your foot in his groin area is the only thing

1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:51.040
 we have from that olympics from 2008 from 2008 yeah and to answer everybody's question yes it was

1:43:51.040 --> 1:43:56.800
 deliberate now you can say this yeah but yeah i remember there being a lot of frustration

1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:01.840
 you go you're actually going for a lot of stuff like sacrifice those i mean maybe you're not going

1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:06.400
 for the highest scoring e ponds but you're just trying to shake things up if i remember correctly

1:44:06.400 --> 1:44:12.800
 yeah because when he i was so young then that and he was you know in his prime really at that time

1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:21.280
 right he was must have been 24 25 26 you know world medalist european champion at the time

1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:28.880
 and when he would grab me i would i had that sense of feeling stuck like i was strong enough

1:44:28.880 --> 1:44:33.600
 if i used all my strength to not let him do anything but then you can't be offensive when

1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:40.080
 you're using all your strength to hold on to the situation so i was getting really aggravated because

1:44:40.080 --> 1:44:45.520
 i couldn't i couldn't generate any offense with every time i felt like i gained an advantage

1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:51.120
 in the gripping scenario he would take some obscure grip somewhere that was like well now

1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:54.880
 i've got to go address this thing give up what i gained and i have to go back and

1:44:56.640 --> 1:45:01.600
 it if i were to think about watching the match now it probably looked like a lot of flailing

1:45:01.600 --> 1:45:07.440
 because we're just trying to generate enough to not get a penalty but also not enough to

1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:12.720
 where he could counter it did you think you were you could beat him like when you're walking into

1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:19.120
 the match until i gripped him for the first time like i because i had trained with him before

1:45:19.120 --> 1:45:25.760
 he felt stronger and more in shape than i've ever felt him that day at that olympics at that olympics

1:45:28.080 --> 1:45:30.480
 which begs a whole another question but

1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:38.960
 what was the question i remember when i when he grabbed me for that first time i went this is

1:45:38.960 --> 1:45:45.200
 different and i there was a sense of panic at the time because i was like holy crap where did

1:45:45.200 --> 1:45:51.520
 this come from this is not the guy that i've trained with that i expected because it was a

1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:58.560
 definite like level change in like his ability strength speed and stamina like looking back

1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:05.680
 at that can you explain that is it just you being more less confident because as the olympics it was

1:46:06.560 --> 1:46:11.120
 is there some kind of routine that he followed to like really level up in intensity for this

1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:19.840
 particular event i've been told that he only gets to like his prime for like really big events

1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:25.360
 yeah like he doesn't train like year around like i would train but when it comes to like the games

1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:32.720
 he doesn't do social media he doesn't work he lives breathes eats his training for the games

1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:40.160
 which could you know institute that level what about you as there uh like dan gable famously

1:46:40.160 --> 1:46:44.880
 said like the one loss he had in college he was doing a lot of media and stuff back back then there

1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:51.520
 was no social media i that was a huge mistake for him do you do social media do you do like at that

1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:55.680
 at this point well at that time was like a well i don't know what's two thousand i didn't even have

1:46:55.680 --> 1:47:03.600
 a facebook page uh my space nothing at this point i got my first facebook page from the usoc in 2012

1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:08.800
 yeah when i went through the media thing the lady was like you have to have it i go i don't want it

1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:13.920
 i don't like people i want to deal with the people what am i supposed to do you know like the social

1:47:13.920 --> 1:47:21.360
 part of the social media no okay um i have to bring this up because uh and then you went on to face

1:47:21.360 --> 1:47:26.480
 java camilo uh you lost that match but he went on to win bronze that's also an interesting one but

1:47:26.480 --> 1:47:31.680
 we can skip ahead i just remember being really impressed both by your ground work um that was

1:47:31.680 --> 1:47:38.720
 a match i should have won yeah i should have won that i was if you don't know judo you would

1:47:38.720 --> 1:47:43.520
 visually watch that and be like i'm winning but he was technically winning on the scoreboard so

1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:47.200
 it is what it is but the point that he got that solidified his win

1:47:49.760 --> 1:47:53.280
 yes it was a point back in those days so i can't say anything but like

1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:00.320
 my shoulder nicked the ground so it's like i don't know yeah a lot of the stories of your

1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:07.280
 olympic career is like from a fan perspective it seems like you should have won or you very

1:48:07.840 --> 1:48:12.080
 close to could have won yes and there was a lot of frustration in you and your game being like

1:48:12.080 --> 1:48:18.480
 shut down in certain ways and but like the thing that immediately grabbed me in 2008

1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:24.080
 was how much something about the way you approached judo how much you wanted to win

1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:32.240
 because i was young then i was when i was at this at this time in my career i was out to like

1:48:33.440 --> 1:48:39.120
 win like there was no like i'm gonna grab you i'm gonna throw you and if not you're gonna go

1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:45.840
 through a battle yeah you're gonna make sure you earned it it so happened that you competing in 2008

1:48:47.040 --> 1:48:54.960
 i was uh i became a fan of yours uh at that moment and since then i uh i kind of knew about judo

1:48:54.960 --> 1:49:01.040
 my university had a judo club and i kind of knew about jiu jitsu from mixed martial arts

1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:07.120
 and obviously i wrestled for many years before and i love wrestling but there's something about

1:49:07.120 --> 1:49:12.320
 you competing that made me well there's no other way to say but like changed the direction of my

1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:18.720
 life because it forced me to say you know what i'm gonna start judo and jiu jitsu and first of all

1:49:18.720 --> 1:49:24.240
 for that i'm really grateful but it's fascinating to think because this kid who's 22 years old i'm

1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:30.000
 sure i'm not the only one that you've influenced like you've changed the direction of my life

1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:36.400
 and there could be a huge number of others like that i mean that's the power of you as an individual

1:49:36.400 --> 1:49:41.280
 at the on the olympic stage you ever think about the pressure of that did you did you think as a

1:49:41.280 --> 1:49:47.200
 22 year old there's a bunch of people like i know i'm not the only one who changed i just happened to

1:49:47.200 --> 1:49:54.160
 have like a microphone recently you know what i mean like is that it's fascinating to think about

1:49:54.160 --> 1:50:00.000
 right like you perhaps you didn't think about this it's just a just a judo match but you're like you

1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:06.480
 influenced hundreds of thousands of people from that millions is that interesting it's it's not

1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:21.280
 something that really hit me until um 2012 when i lost because that's when like i would say like

1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:29.520
 the world felt bad for me at that point and that's when you knew that like people were

1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:36.480
 watching and people were inspired by the loss because of how much went into that match yeah

1:50:37.440 --> 1:50:43.280
 because you know the 99 percent of us who watched it thought i won except for the

1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:49.840
 one percent of the people who were considered judges at that day in the event so but i mean

1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:55.680
 that's the the winner lose that that was a really inspiring match and that's when it that's when it

1:50:55.680 --> 1:51:02.880
 dinged that like because i don't i don't watch something and really get inspired by like the

1:51:02.880 --> 1:51:12.080
 person and the act it's like a it's an accumulative thing but for a lot of people like when they watch

1:51:12.080 --> 1:51:17.200
 how much goes into it and then when i broke down on the match like the amount of suffering

1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:23.200
 that happens when you lose a match like that and then you know really coming back in

1:51:23.200 --> 1:51:30.960
 and winning in Rio there's a trend of people who were inspired that knew about London and

1:51:30.960 --> 1:51:37.280
 then when they found out i won in Rio that's when like people like in droves felt like they could

1:51:37.280 --> 1:51:42.320
 overcome their own personal obstacles to still achieve something because they've witnessed

1:51:42.320 --> 1:51:50.800
 somebody who's fallen and gotten back up yeah but it's not something that you think about like on

1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:57.600
 the day it's when you look back and you go all cause and effect i wonder if you can comment on that

1:51:57.600 --> 1:52:04.640
 i'm trying to realize and live up to the fact that there's like young people that come up to me

1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:11.360
 and i'm starting to realize like certain words i say will have a long lasting impact on them

1:52:11.360 --> 1:52:17.360
 yep because you say it is like you don't even doesn't just yeah the whim some of them might

1:52:17.360 --> 1:52:23.520
 come back 30 years later and a word i said was the reason they quit a thing and started the new

1:52:23.520 --> 1:52:29.120
 thing that led them to become their true self like to find success all that kind of stuff like

1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:34.960
 on the flip side though some people based on the actions that we do today even with this cast

1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:44.000
 will alter the course of their lives forever i had a guy one time was it after London

1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:51.440
 and it must have been after London he actually found me on instagram wrote me what seemed to be

1:52:51.440 --> 1:53:00.880
 like a dissertation on instagram about how much he i disrespected him 14 years earlier because

1:53:01.760 --> 1:53:06.000
 i didn't step on a podium to take a picture after winning a tournament where he bronzed

1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:14.320
 yeah and i'm thinking to myself like at the time like having dinner with my family because

1:53:14.320 --> 1:53:19.680
 i had to leave the next morning was more important to me as a person not thinking about

1:53:21.120 --> 1:53:31.120
 who you potentially will become and the actions of whatever you do today if you do become quote

1:53:31.120 --> 1:53:37.040
 unquote famous or somebody in a spotlight that that could come back to bite you to me i don't

1:53:37.040 --> 1:53:45.840
 know about you that that's that's super motivating like not to be a lesser version of myself ever

1:53:46.480 --> 1:53:50.720
 yeah just be on top of your game whatever that game is be on top of your game when you interact

1:53:50.720 --> 1:53:55.200
 with people and when you're just in your own private life i'm trying to make sure that i'm the

1:53:55.200 --> 1:54:00.720
 exactly same person privately as i am publicly and like making sure i'm on point i see like

1:54:00.720 --> 1:54:06.160
 just hanging out with uh joe rogan a lot i see how he's first of all the exact same person

1:54:06.720 --> 1:54:12.320
 and second he he like walks around and there's like a huge number of fans and you'll just take

1:54:12.320 --> 1:54:17.840
 pictures and like it's very cool and it's very cognizant of like certain words he says especially

1:54:17.840 --> 1:54:22.320
 young people like they're going to take that and that's going to be a memory for them for a couple

1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:27.280
 of years yeah that might be influential for the rest of their life so i don't know that's a cool

1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:35.920
 responsibility uh not to fuck it up but but anyway i bring all that up to just say thank you

1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:44.480
 so even if you like were frustrated that you didn't win a medal at least at least uh you influence one

1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:50.160
 silly russian kid to get into the martial arts and what happens when you get into martial arts

1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:58.800
 alters the direction you like yeah mine for for for the better okay so let's go to uh london 2012

1:54:58.800 --> 1:55:08.560
 olympics uh one of the most dramatic judo battles of all time rematch yeah so you've

1:55:08.560 --> 1:55:15.120
 reached the semifinals once again to face the german holy bishof do you mind if we step through

1:55:15.120 --> 1:55:23.360
 that match a little bit voted by all means i've only ever watched the entire thing one time just

1:55:23.360 --> 1:55:36.000
 because fucking so uh for context for the listener um travis first of all you don't like losing

1:55:37.040 --> 1:55:43.120
 i think that's fair to say you know the the hard part with this match is because i went into this

1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:48.160
 olympics thinking i'm gonna fucking win the olympics i'm the best in the world

1:55:50.160 --> 1:55:59.920
 i'd never in my right mind thought oh i'm gonna win a medal like that never that never crossed

1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:09.840
 my mind so it's like i would have rather him just fucking beat me yeah because then i lost

1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:17.760
 so here the referees as as many people thought robbed you of a victory but it was also a really

1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:23.840
 close battle again with many of the elements of frustration as 2008 in terms of strategically

1:56:23.840 --> 1:56:29.760
 and gripping wise and it was just a fascinating battle that went to overtime uh so can you set

1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:36.320
 the context so what what did the bracket look like who were the players here um who did you

1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:42.240
 beat leading up to this match like so as you walk on to the mat what happened the day before the

1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:47.680
 the hours before as you're standing there but how bad is this is when two people are standing like

1:56:47.680 --> 1:56:57.520
 this and yeah that fucking guy man um but this this bracket um was really interesting if you

1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:04.880
 look at like the backstory of 81 kilos like leading up to the olympics right because at this point in

1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:13.120
 time you know i was inside the top 10 at all times you know eight seven five four you know

1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:19.040
 sixes i fell out of there sometimes due to injuries but i always climbed back in um there was another

1:57:19.040 --> 1:57:30.960
 guy um from azerbaijan that was the olympic champion at 73 kilos in 2008 and the entire division

1:57:30.960 --> 1:57:39.920
 got rocked by match one because his first match was with antoine valis fortier of canada

1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:48.400
 and everybody who saw the draw come out was like the azerbaijan he's gonna win it he's the former

1:57:48.400 --> 1:57:54.080
 olympic champion he's pretty much one of most of the major events including at 90 kilos because he

1:57:54.080 --> 1:58:03.440
 just had smooth judo and you know match one rolls around match two rolls around antoine's

1:58:03.440 --> 1:58:09.680
 in the chute and he's looking around and he's like the azerbaijan he's not here but where is he

1:58:10.640 --> 1:58:19.360
 no joke he runs into the venue a match before throws his gi on and runs onto the olympic platform

1:58:19.360 --> 1:58:24.480
 loses the canadian in like a three minute golden score battle

1:58:26.320 --> 1:58:32.160
 so do you think he warmed up didn't he ran he literally ran into the venue through his

1:58:32.160 --> 1:58:38.800
 gi on and ran out did no judo and there you see antoine losing in the quarters

1:58:40.720 --> 1:58:47.280
 so how good was the antoine at this point in time this is i believe his first international

1:58:47.280 --> 1:58:55.600
 medal was the olympic games so i don't think he'd ever meddled in paris um he went into this bracket

1:58:55.600 --> 1:59:02.160
 unranked beating the ranked guy first round because he i don't know if he missed the boss

1:59:02.880 --> 1:59:08.320
 i don't know if he was off his cycle and planned on losing because he didn't want to test positive

1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:14.560
 i don't know there's a lot of like questionable things out there that could have potentially

1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:24.640
 caused him to you know run on to the olympic platform for match one but you know it it

1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:32.400
 catapulted antoine into like a belief that like i beat the seeded guy i'm i'm ready and that was

1:59:32.400 --> 1:59:39.280
 like a turning point in the canadian's career just as a whole right that's that everybody has a

1:59:39.280 --> 1:59:46.240
 defining moment like mine was when i beat bischoff uh in dusseldorf at the grand prix for germany

1:59:46.960 --> 1:59:55.360
 after 2008 right i beat the olympic champion in on his home soil to go win the entire tournament

1:59:55.360 --> 2:00:01.920
 so we all have like those moments it's just when it happens at the games it throws the bracket like

2:00:01.920 --> 2:00:06.480
 into a tailspin because typically you'd know like who's gonna beat who where it's gonna happen

2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:14.560
 and when you look at my quarterfinal against the brazilian what most people don't know is i was i was

2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:20.320
 so thankful i had that match most people would never in a million years be like i want to fight

2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:24.800
 the world number one at the olympic games that's what i want to do i want to be the eighth seed

2:00:24.800 --> 2:00:31.280
 fighting the world number one because i'm gonna win i was pissed off at him i was so angry because

2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:39.520
 we we were at the pan ams i think the year before and there was a team tournament i wanted to fight

2:00:39.520 --> 2:00:48.240
 him i had lost the quarters to a cuban i think and like the first gripping exchange he threw me

2:00:48.240 --> 2:00:53.360
 with a drop sale out of nowhere i was pissed so i wanted my hands on the brazilian and the team

2:00:53.360 --> 2:00:59.920
 match well the brazilian team's warming up so i walked up to him no joke i walked up to him and i

2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:07.280
 go you're fighting and he goes not today and i went are you fucking kidding me i warmed up i taped

2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:10.800
 up through the only fucking guy i want to fight and you're gonna fucking sit in the stands and read

2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:16.160
 a goddamn book i was so angry i carried that anger because i never fought him until this day

2:01:17.040 --> 2:01:22.560
 i was fucking pissed i was ready to beat him that's right i remember i forgot he was the world

2:01:22.560 --> 2:01:28.160
 number one yeah how did um because i remember like being really excited at that match how did you

2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:33.840
 beat him i threw him with two hands on the same side collar like drop sale i crossgripped i yanked

2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:41.840
 him behind me and i threw him epon was arie and then the match ended 30 seconds later yeah i was

2:01:41.840 --> 2:01:47.760
 pumped i was i thought like i think okay if i'm remembering correctly i thought okay this guy

2:01:47.760 --> 2:01:57.360
 might actually win gold that's what that's what made for me as a spectator remembering now the next

2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:04.240
 match that much more like painful and then the fans of judo that really followed the sport

2:02:05.440 --> 2:02:10.400
 the stats when you look at the games in my draws i had the worst possible draws you ever could have

2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:16.960
 imagined at both london and rio i fought the world number one to get to the final or into the semis

2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:24.480
 or past the semis and everybody i fought in the draw either beat me the last time we fought

2:02:24.480 --> 2:02:30.080
 or i had never fought before so i always held a loss going on to the mat at the olympic games

2:02:30.080 --> 2:02:34.080
 how'd you feel about that by the way like what were your feelings about facing the brazilian

2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:40.960
 first i was so excited this well that was match three in london i fought the slovenian guy first

2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:48.160
 round who beat me um where did he beat me was it the worlds might have been the worlds and then

2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:56.560
 churches villi i fought in the second round who threw me for wasari in japan and then leandro

2:02:56.560 --> 2:03:01.600
 who i don't think i ever fought who was world number one that avoided fighting me at the team

2:03:01.600 --> 2:03:06.800
 tournament but i mean every single olympics you've fought it you really stepped up the only tournament

2:03:06.800 --> 2:03:12.880
 i've ever prepped for mentally and physically and just the whole thing yeah we never trained

2:03:12.880 --> 2:03:18.640
 through this tournament like we did for the others or i would go into it injured all right well

2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:25.120
 let's talk about you're standing there next to that uh to the german he looks he looked always

2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:33.520
 smaller than you but you said like strong yeah um so what are you feeling now jimmy pager behind you

2:03:33.520 --> 2:03:39.440
 i was fucking ready to take his head off did you have an idea of what you're gonna do did you try

2:03:39.440 --> 2:03:44.160
 do you're thinking of winning by epon were you thinking like going for big throws take

2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:50.000
 or take him in deep waters i'll grip him or what were you thinking we were about to have a battle

2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:59.520
 and i wasn't gonna throw him until he broke mentally okay that was there was no like oh this

2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:07.760
 is going to be a clean throw that was never that was never the thought process so so here

2:04:07.760 --> 2:04:14.320
 you know there's going to be a lot of gripping so we're seeing a shit ton of gripping and right

2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:24.000
 here he throws it bang close fisted you got a lot of adrenaline you seem calm i'm pissed you're pissed

2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:28.240
 like you don't look as you just look like i'm looking at the ref like because he keeps telling me

2:04:28.240 --> 2:04:36.960
 to get up i'm like i have blood running down my face here see blood see and he's like oh yeah

2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:42.640
 go fix it and that's on your eyebrow somewhere yeah he split it just underneath it so you split

2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:47.920
 your eyebrow and so in judo they don't they're allergic to blood probably for a good reason but

2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:55.680
 they so now you have to try to figure out how to uh tape that up yeah which already sets up one of

2:04:55.680 --> 2:05:04.640
 the most badass looks in judo history first 15 seconds yeah busted my eye open was that getting

2:05:04.640 --> 2:05:11.280
 in the way of your eyesight at all or no no damn he looks good at gripping how difficult

2:05:11.280 --> 2:05:16.560
 does it to get a grip on that guy very like i'm struggling just to get my hand in the collar

2:05:16.560 --> 2:05:22.480
 and he wasn't even blocking it is he being cagey yeah remember like is he interested in offense

2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:30.400
 nope he's a very cagey you know methodical player like he he never opens himself up yeah

2:05:30.400 --> 2:05:37.760
 yeah there you go you grab the leg as part of a combination yep and people have told me that he's

2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:43.360
 actually very good at throwing people he just doesn't so but he just doesn't show it at these

2:05:43.360 --> 2:05:49.920
 nope because he he doesn't care how he wins he cares that he wins yeah which makes him very

2:05:49.920 --> 2:05:56.000
 difficult to beat because he knows when you strategize to do that where you look at the

2:05:56.000 --> 2:06:01.600
 rule set and you develop a plan to to get through the matches then you've really got to figure out

2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:06.640
 a way to get that person off that game plan you know whether you get ahead by a penalty or something

2:06:08.640 --> 2:06:14.960
 right there like he wouldn't give me the sleeve so i grabbed all of his fingers

2:06:15.680 --> 2:06:22.960
 oh nice in which i's open like like this way or i grabbed them the other way and i started

2:06:22.960 --> 2:06:30.560
 lifting them uh yeah nice oh like first playing mercy like this yeah uh this is great because he

2:06:30.560 --> 2:06:35.920
 wouldn't give me the sleeve and i needed an attack and i'm like okay i can't hold on to this forever

2:06:35.920 --> 2:06:39.920
 because that judge is gonna see it so let me just do a quick throw here while i'm using the fingers

2:06:39.920 --> 2:06:48.720
 and the he's holding on yeah he and then i just sit out yeah and then yeah he goes to get up and i

2:06:48.720 --> 2:06:56.080
 go to get on top and right here nice that elbow you get him oh you got him yeah it looks like i elbow

2:06:56.080 --> 2:07:03.280
 him did you do it kind of no i didn't even i at the time i never knew this happened yeah until after

2:07:03.280 --> 2:07:09.360
 i watched this like three or four years later didn't even know i didn't even feel it look at that it's

2:07:09.360 --> 2:07:15.920
 so he's legitimately angry here yeah he's angry and of course you can't you can't move why would you

2:07:15.920 --> 2:07:20.480
 move look at this this moment right there's this gold if you're not watching this on video you're

2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:26.080
 missing out you do you never get this in judo no i don't know if that's ever happened that little

2:07:26.080 --> 2:07:31.760
 face off especially on a stage like this the reference and then he brings us in to like talk

2:07:31.760 --> 2:07:35.600
 to us and he's like hey we're good right like you guys aren't about to do what i think you're about to

2:07:35.600 --> 2:07:41.280
 do you put up here like hey shake hands again because the first time we did it that wasn't

2:07:41.280 --> 2:07:48.640
 good enough well you got to do it again the heartbreaking part about this and why the ijf

2:07:48.640 --> 2:07:56.720
 switched it to an unlimited golden score because we fought five minutes through the entire normal

2:07:56.720 --> 2:08:02.800
 part of the match and then we did the entire overtime period of three minutes now one penalty

2:08:02.800 --> 2:08:09.120
 was given no gripping infractions false attacks like no stalling that's great there was nobody

2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:13.440
 was really backing up yeah i mean it was you know so what was jimmy telling you here

2:08:14.640 --> 2:08:18.400
 how was he was he talking to you at all he's not allowed to talk during medical

2:08:19.120 --> 2:08:25.840
 things and my nose is now broken but he's also the nose is broken from what um i caught an elbow

2:08:25.840 --> 2:08:33.680
 from him glad his face is clean that's fun and right here like i was pissed i was so angry at

2:08:33.680 --> 2:08:39.520
 the medic because he's fumbling around and i'm like my whole plan is to break the germin mentally

2:08:39.520 --> 2:08:44.000
 yeah you got to hurry up with the tape man like he's supposed to be tired like he's not supposed

2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:52.240
 to be resting is jimmy yelling here he can't no not here not here but during the match yeah

2:08:52.240 --> 2:08:56.000
 and you can see i just take it from him and i'm like give it to me i'm gonna do it myself get out of

2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:03.520
 here how scared is the medic he's like this guy's gonna he can't even tear the tape he's like how

2:09:03.520 --> 2:09:11.600
 nervous he is we made fun of him for this yeah so much yeah throughout the years still due to this

2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:18.320
 day all right here we go oh you look great getting here can't really see don't care it was there's

2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:22.000
 some outcome in your mind that you could possibly beat him on the ground with a submission or a

2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:27.760
 pin you knew you're gonna have to throw him i knew i was gonna have to if i was gonna throw him or

2:09:27.760 --> 2:09:35.680
 on bar him or pin him whatever the case may be it was gonna be his mental like i'm just tired of

2:09:35.680 --> 2:09:42.720
 this yeah right he's too cagey of a player he's too experienced you know he has to mentally make

2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:48.000
 that choice to give that inch and then you just have to be ready to take it so i was just waiting

2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:56.400
 for it and so now this is four minutes in one minute left yeah okay oh um is that in your game

2:09:56.400 --> 2:10:02.000
 plan two potentials like zoom engage like the sacrifice throws them because the whole point of

2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:07.280
 that that technique and the sacrifice throws wasn't because i thought i was gonna throw him but

2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:14.640
 it disrupts the pattern enough to like get him to make a potential mistake yeah like see he should

2:10:14.640 --> 2:10:21.680
 have gotten a shido there hands in the face but again that's just part of judo yeah he poked me

2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:29.120
 in the eyeball this is a rough match it does he act at all or no like was he acting frustrated

2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:34.640
 or anything like that was all like he's like acting for the ref you know what i mean like oh that

2:10:34.640 --> 2:10:40.880
 all that kind of stuff you're just going in yeah hard not stop yeah like angry aggressive

2:10:40.880 --> 2:10:47.520
 of feeling cardio here at all like i don't i didn't get tired during this and then we're just

2:10:47.520 --> 2:10:53.760
 always pressing for time runs out now we're into golden score 12 minutes and 38 seconds later

2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:59.600
 yeah you think about every judo exchange right every time we rip up every time we attack sometimes

2:10:59.600 --> 2:11:04.960
 it can take longer to get back to the line than the entire exchange yeah so the more aggression

2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:11.520
 the more exchanges you have the longer the time stretches then here the six seconds left and

2:11:11.520 --> 2:11:22.480
 golden score your tape is uh is now yellow and red yeah with sweat and blood literally and time is

2:11:22.480 --> 2:11:28.640
 out now what are you thinking here do you think you won the match i i thought i won the match a

2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:37.280
 minute ago i remember thinking to myself like if this goes to the flags i won no doubt in my mind

2:11:39.440 --> 2:11:46.640
 because i felt like the whole time like i was going to him yeah right he was never coming at me

2:11:47.840 --> 2:11:53.680
 yeah that's the way it felt and like that's the way it felt body language wise just the intensity

2:11:53.680 --> 2:12:02.320
 how fast you're moving towards him you're constantly going for throws now if you want to rewind that we

2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:07.840
 can talk about the whole because it's a part of this clip so wait wait a minute uh they all went

2:12:07.840 --> 2:12:13.760
 blue they all did so in in judo there's three referees two on the side one in the center and

2:12:13.760 --> 2:12:18.640
 they all vote and now let's pause it right there now the way this is supposed to work they raise

2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:25.360
 their flags they do like a one two count and then on three they all raise it together yeah now as a

2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:32.720
 little pretext to this entire match up until this point not one match at the olympic games has ever

2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:40.000
 been a split decision meaning out of three people not one of them voted against the other group members

2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:48.320
 so they were all unified blue or all unified white yeah right which is statistically difficult

2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:54.640
 to imagine yes it's almost like the they had a referee meeting and said it's better for the

2:12:54.640 --> 2:13:04.640
 olympics to never have a split yeah okay so the question becomes if you click that frame by frame

2:13:04.640 --> 2:13:13.920
 right so right now we have all the refs with their flags out and then click that so the middle

2:13:13.920 --> 2:13:20.720
 middle guy is he is all the way up all the way up the other side judges haven't moved we now have

2:13:20.720 --> 2:13:30.160
 one side ref all the way up then we have a third side ref all the way up yeah so there there's a

2:13:30.160 --> 2:13:35.760
 there's a time point when the middle guy has the flag all the way up if not 80 90 of the way there

2:13:35.760 --> 2:13:43.680
 yeah then the other one does and then the third one goes uh so now the question becomes who really

2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:53.040
 like did the outside refs really have an opinion or were they told to wait for the center one to

2:13:53.040 --> 2:14:01.760
 start and then lift whatever flag the center ref picked yeah this is very unfortunate because

2:14:01.760 --> 2:14:07.360
 it's very honestly it's very possible that they had this meeting um this this is the problem with

2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:14.800
 the the olympics they sometimes it's also the problem in the Soviet Union with communism you think

2:14:14.800 --> 2:14:19.200
 the the committee knows what's good for the people and so on so they decide

2:14:19.200 --> 2:14:26.720
 universally as opposed to letting the magic of the olympics be be what it is but nevertheless

2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:33.600
 the in this case the center ref decided blue like what do you think do you think it's just a

2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:42.320
 shitty call or like he has the right to pick but yeah the problem is is the other two I don't think

2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:51.680
 did yeah so and that's so when you do this frame by frame again right like I can see from my own

2:14:51.680 --> 2:14:59.040
 perspective two of the refs and I see them both blue right so when you fast forward that a little

2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:05.920
 bit to get to like all the flags I see the two go blue and I go I look over and I look at the other

2:15:05.920 --> 2:15:13.600
 guy and I'm like really yeah all three I fought for eight minutes and I can't even get a vote I

2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:24.160
 didn't even get a penalty I can't even get a vote and that's when I broke I like oh I couldn't believe

2:15:24.160 --> 2:15:35.920
 it and I'm not gonna lie he looked shocked and here you're on your knees you're crying literally

2:15:35.920 --> 2:15:44.720
 crying yeah I think it's the end amazing match oh such a war I mean both people can't believe what

2:15:44.720 --> 2:15:51.120
 happened I know that's the end like honestly I wish we had the rules that we do today as far as the

2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:58.160
 unlimited golden score because I would have loved to have seen what would have happened what was Jimmy

2:15:58.160 --> 2:16:06.640
 saying here to you I mean I guess there's nothing to say yeah he he was kind of apologizing for the

2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:15.600
 way the the scores went because he knows how badly you want it he saw the match and he felt I deserved

2:16:15.600 --> 2:16:21.200
 to win it yeah based on like you know what happened but he probably with all his experience knows

2:16:21.200 --> 2:16:27.680
 that this is what the Olympics are about the refs sometimes yep I mean that's the magic of it man

2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:35.600
 well and at the same time we're at we're in the Olympic semi final in a sport that's dominated

2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:41.280
 by certain continents and when you look at the three refs on the mat they're all european

2:16:41.280 --> 2:16:48.640
 yeah you're telling me there couldn't have been one panam one african one oceana you know different

2:16:49.680 --> 2:16:54.800
 like why'd they all have to be european but to be fair it's back to your sauna story

2:16:55.520 --> 2:17:00.720
 correct dealt with this stuff before and and you've won over this stuff before and that's

2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:06.800
 why like I was broken and you thought you won here those and when I hindered on that for

2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:14.640
 a year and a half like I couldn't even stand I was done but I'm pretty sure there's a slow

2:17:14.640 --> 2:17:20.400
 motion replay on this when I watch they all excited that fucking guy yeah he's all happy

2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:29.520
 it's relieved yeah hey hi guys I did it yeah so here's like teeth my teeth are right slow

2:17:29.520 --> 2:17:35.360
 motion replay of the flag being raised the hard being broken Travis just bending over right here

2:17:35.360 --> 2:17:41.600
 watch watch his reaction like he like you could see his mouth like open and awe like yeah really

2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:46.560
 yeah and he's looking at two refs just like I am he didn't celebrate until he looked at the third

2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:54.240
 one and said oh all three so you think he knew he I think in his head like I don't think he really

2:17:54.240 --> 2:17:59.840
 believed he was winning he did enough to win yeah yeah because when his mouth draw like

2:17:59.840 --> 2:18:06.400
 oh yeah hey all three like that's not really the reaction you would give

2:18:07.280 --> 2:18:12.960
 yeah I mean that was uh that's one of the greatest matches I've ever seen I mean

2:18:12.960 --> 2:18:20.240
 obviously it's painful for you but that pain first of all sets the stage for 2016 but even

2:18:20.240 --> 2:18:27.040
 without that I think it was just a beautiful story at the Olympics you've still did incredible

2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:36.560
 job at the Olympics you stood toe to toe I think in in hindsight having lost that match did more

2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:44.800
 for me and more for the sport yeah as a whole me losing that match yeah I mean stories aren't about

2:18:45.520 --> 2:18:50.320
 winning stories they're about the fighting so and that may have one hell of a story but

2:18:50.320 --> 2:18:59.440
 but it it also has to do with you know treachery is probably not the right word to use it's probably

2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:07.520
 the wrong word entirely to use but because of the conflict in the match and because of how

2:19:07.520 --> 2:19:14.320
 the refs handled the match there at the end it created controversy that was spoken about for

2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:22.160
 months on world media right I remember articles being written about the Olympics and you know

2:19:22.160 --> 2:19:27.600
 the reffing and how it was corrupt and that match was one of them there was another one

2:19:27.600 --> 2:19:34.080
 in fencing where like something happened with the timer where one of the fencers I guess what

2:19:34.080 --> 2:19:42.160
 happens in fencing the timer resets up a second if it's down so the fencer got one second played

2:19:42.160 --> 2:19:50.720
 out I think like 27 or 28 times and then won on like 30 so like there was like clock fixing for

2:19:50.720 --> 2:19:56.720
 fencing there was this match that I think just got publicity good or bad publicity is publicity for

2:19:56.720 --> 2:20:04.000
 judo and then you came back to I mean this is the hard thing after this heartbreak to step up

2:20:04.000 --> 2:20:12.880
 and continue fighting right I really really struggled like unbelievably struggled from 2012

2:20:12.880 --> 2:20:21.120
 to like 2014 I almost quit numerous times I was so angry I mean at one point I got so mad at the

2:20:21.120 --> 2:20:26.240
 IJF feeling like they were fucking me every step of the way I threw a water bottle at a referee

2:20:26.960 --> 2:20:32.560
 after a match I cussed out a referee one time on a mat I got suspended from the sport because

2:20:32.560 --> 2:20:39.120
 I was just so angry at that point in time and IJF is the international judo federation and

2:20:39.120 --> 2:20:44.080
 there are there the people that supply the referees basically like the they're kind of run the sport

2:20:44.080 --> 2:20:55.360
 they're on the low scale so you sent a few emails 2014 15 basically quitting one of them said I'm

2:20:55.360 --> 2:21:01.840
 mentally and physically broken another said with a subject line I'm done yep the weight cuts didn't

2:21:01.840 --> 2:21:10.160
 break you no so if this broke you you were really going through a hard time I was like you know what

2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:14.960
 we're just gonna like dumb it down a little bit and get some wins under our belt I'm gonna go to a

2:21:14.960 --> 2:21:23.040
 world cup which is like three stages down or four stages down from like the olympic games like this

2:21:23.040 --> 2:21:27.360
 should be like a cakewalk like making the final of a world cup should be a walk in the park

2:21:27.360 --> 2:21:37.920
 I show up I barely beat a 16 year old kid barely then I got smoked in the second round I got

2:21:37.920 --> 2:21:44.960
 thrown three times I was like I'm fucking done they changed all the fucking rules they fucked me

2:21:44.960 --> 2:21:51.680
 out of the olympics like what am I supposed to do and it was at that moment when I wrote the email

2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:57.360
 where I remember sitting at a bar I don't drink by the way but I was sitting at a bar

2:21:58.560 --> 2:22:04.800
 at the hotel sending this email and I got a response back from Jimmy and he goes well just

2:22:05.600 --> 2:22:10.480
 just stay for the training camp go to Germany and then whatever happens don't worry about it

2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:16.240
 we'll talk when you get home I was like fuck that fuck these people fuck the rules I don't

2:22:16.240 --> 2:22:21.280
 fucking care anymore I'm just gonna do judo the way I want to do judo if I fucking get sheeted out

2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:27.760
 fuck them that was my response can you become an olympic champion can you become an olympic

2:22:27.760 --> 2:22:32.960
 medalist with that kind of thinking you think or no was that that's counterproductive yeah okay

2:22:33.680 --> 2:22:39.440
 just just checking because maybe that's also liberating the expectation was no longer that

2:22:39.440 --> 2:22:43.600
 Travis is going to win this tournament the expectation was Travis is going to come home

2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:48.160
 before I can pissed off we're going to have to figure out how to manage a pissed off person

2:22:48.160 --> 2:22:53.600
 that's trying to quit that shouldn't be quitting and the people still believe that you can be a

2:22:53.600 --> 2:22:58.880
 medalist again yeah like who believed that Jimmy believed it the team managers believed it some

2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:04.560
 of my teammates still believed it my training partners still did but they're not the ones that

2:23:04.560 --> 2:23:12.800
 are cutting the weight flying around feeling like you know all of your judo is now known void right

2:23:12.800 --> 2:23:19.360
 because at this point they took away leg grabs entirely you couldn't break a grip with two hands

2:23:19.360 --> 2:23:27.040
 right the meta of judo has changed again right so I got fucked out of it they took away how I did

2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:33.280
 judo again and now it's just got more difficult so when I'm sitting in the hotel and I'm sending

2:23:33.280 --> 2:23:39.440
 this email I remember being at the training camp like I was like I don't even fucking care what the

2:23:39.440 --> 2:23:43.760
 rules are I'm just gonna fucking throw people I don't even care from cheating doesn't matter to

2:23:43.760 --> 2:23:49.200
 me I'll just play stupid yeah right so I just started going back and doing judo without the leg

2:23:49.200 --> 2:23:56.160
 grabs but with all the same gripping that I was doing beforehand and then when I got to Germany

2:23:56.160 --> 2:24:02.240
 I was like I don't fucking care I was like if I got a cheat to win then I got a fucking cheat to

2:24:02.240 --> 2:24:10.800
 win if I get sheeted out like then I get sheeted out and I won Germany uh which event to Germany

2:24:10.800 --> 2:24:18.080
 the German Grand Prix which was a week after losing the World Cup because I was trying to do judo

2:24:18.080 --> 2:24:24.560
 around the new ruleset I wasn't just trying to do judo right because when you get to the highest

2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:33.280
 level your game tends to morph around you know what can you can or cannot get away with I was

2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:38.240
 more focused on trying to figure out what I can and can't get away with and I stopped actively

2:24:38.240 --> 2:24:43.760
 doing judo once I said fuck whatever the rule changes are I'm just gonna keep doing judo the

2:24:43.760 --> 2:24:50.800
 way I know how to do judo and if I get a penalty then so be it and so that that win that started

2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:58.240
 the road back the road back yeah because now it's like I don't care if you penalize me or not because

2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:04.240
 I'm gonna throw that guy anyways I'm gonna beat him anyways and if I get a sheeto for doing something

2:25:04.240 --> 2:25:09.200
 wrong then I'll just stop doing that one thing and just keep doing all the other things that they

2:25:09.200 --> 2:25:12.640
 told me I probably shouldn't be doing but they're not calling me on it so I'm just gonna keep doing

2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:24.160
 it well you you found yourself to 2016 Olympics was that ever a doubt by the way after this

2:25:24.160 --> 2:25:34.080
 after 2014 in Germany I had a lot of doubt after the concussion in 2015 I remember when I first

2:25:34.080 --> 2:25:42.080
 came back after four months of nothingness that like even trying to like train the room would

2:25:42.080 --> 2:25:46.960
 start to like tilt the world on me and then when I finally got over that and I could start doing

2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:54.080
 things again I stepped on the mat for the Pan Ams and I was like drowning is not the right word

2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:58.800
 but like everything was being done in such a slow motion like I had sandbags everywhere

2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:06.880
 that like I just couldn't keep up like mental fog yeah like I remember fighting the Brazilian

2:26:06.880 --> 2:26:14.320
 for in the semifinal of Pan Ams I was halfway through this match I'm just like eyes roll up

2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:18.320
 I'm like I'm just gonna fucking wing it I just fucking winged it and I got countered and thrown

2:26:18.320 --> 2:26:24.560
 free pwn and I was like I don't even know what to do and I couldn't even think clearly and that's

2:26:24.560 --> 2:26:30.320
 when I was like I may not come back yeah you don't have control over how to come back from this it's

2:26:30.320 --> 2:26:35.520
 like it's just your mind and yeah it's not not operating there it's not like I can like oh my

2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:39.280
 right hand's not working because it's fractured let me figure out a way I can not use that like

2:26:39.280 --> 2:26:44.960
 when your mind's not working like it's the one thing you need yeah like you gotta have it

2:26:45.680 --> 2:26:51.280
 I can work through anything else I needed that though so how did you come back from that time

2:26:51.280 --> 2:26:56.160
 that's when I wrote another email and I was like I'm fucking off team USA I'm not fucking I'm all

2:26:56.160 --> 2:27:01.040
 done with USA Judo I'm done with the tour I was like I quit but I'm gonna go do my own thing

2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:06.080
 and they were like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa can't quit now the Olympics is in like a year like

2:27:06.080 --> 2:27:09.600
 let's talk about this again because it's the second time I've tried to quit in like two years

2:27:10.160 --> 2:27:16.560
 right so then we sit down in Jimmy's office and he's like whoa whoa whoa you can't quit

2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:21.440
 you're gonna kick yourself if you don't go to Rio I'm telling you right now don't do that to yourself

2:27:22.000 --> 2:27:27.440
 let's figure out a way of like doing this and I was like because when we trained before we did it

2:27:27.440 --> 2:27:32.080
 as a unit right we all went to the same tournaments we all went to the same training camps and I'm

2:27:32.080 --> 2:27:38.320
 like you guys are treating me like I'm the same player I used to be I go I don't I'm not operating

2:27:38.320 --> 2:27:42.720
 at the level you think I'm operating at I go I can't do that and he goes well what do you want to do

2:27:43.600 --> 2:27:47.680
 and I gotta tell you what Jimmy you know I'm being serious because my answer

2:27:47.680 --> 2:27:51.280
 is something you'd never would have expected I go why don't you just send me to Japan for

2:27:51.280 --> 2:27:58.240
 three weeks and he was like really I hated Japan I refuse to go there up until this point

2:27:59.040 --> 2:28:04.960
 but I was like I have to get to a point where I can get so tired and get through it

2:28:05.600 --> 2:28:11.600
 that like my judo will come back and my body will learn again and when you say Japan you

2:28:11.600 --> 2:28:17.120
 meet the Kodokan like what what's Tokai that is that the highest level of judo it's one of the

2:28:17.120 --> 2:28:21.440
 top colleges in the world yeah and that's so you can go with the best people in the world you can

2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:27.200
 go to war with them top level like strong players yeah there's a lot of very strong players there's

2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:33.520
 a lot of middle class players and there's a lot of volume of rounds so you value all of it the

2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:38.400
 middle class too like that because when you're tired like you can't just train in areas where

2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:44.160
 you're battling for every inch at some point you have to be successful

2:28:44.160 --> 2:28:50.880
 right so you still under duress and under strain and through exhaustion you still have to have the

2:28:50.880 --> 2:28:54.720
 ability to score yeah well if you're training with the best people in the world all the time

2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:59.760
 you're not always going to be able to score so you still need those B level players in order to

2:28:59.760 --> 2:29:07.840
 really develop again what is it like if you can comment briefly on training in Japan what's it

2:29:07.840 --> 2:29:12.320
 like to go into a different place you probably don't speak the language that well

2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:18.640
 speak the language that well like is there an isolation aspect to it is it like purely about

2:29:18.640 --> 2:29:25.920
 judo now i really want it to be isolated no training partners no coaches i wanted to get back to my

2:29:25.920 --> 2:29:32.720
 roots and just learn how to fight again i don't want to figure out how to beat the german i don't

2:29:32.720 --> 2:29:41.280
 want to figure out how i can develop a new entry into my sale against you know whoever it may be

2:29:41.280 --> 2:29:45.680
 it's not you just want to fight hard just want to fight let me get back to fighting let me get back

2:29:45.680 --> 2:29:51.120
 to like the root of who i am what were those sessions like already we're talking about five

2:29:51.120 --> 2:29:56.720
 minute rounds like what how many six six minute rounds 30 minute breaks 14 rounds a session

2:29:58.720 --> 2:30:02.640
 so what's the 30 minute break 30 30 second break 30 second break

2:30:02.640 --> 2:30:15.680
 like what 14 14 rounds 14 rounds every day every day five five days a week and then 11 or 12 rounds

2:30:15.680 --> 2:30:22.640
 on saturday plus weightlifting plus running plus weightlifting plus running so that those are hard

2:30:22.640 --> 2:30:29.040
 rounds yeah what's it feel like to go through that so you have a bunch of uh just a sea of blackbells

2:30:29.040 --> 2:30:36.160
 japan um i'm sure they're hunting you a little bit depending on who you are i was hunted a little

2:30:36.160 --> 2:30:42.960
 bit like i didn't really struggle because of who i am them as college athletes they want to show to

2:30:42.960 --> 2:30:49.280
 their coaches and their you know higher players like oh look i can throw the world number whoever

2:30:49.920 --> 2:30:56.240
 but if you're just a guy who shows up like them beating you doesn't provide any value or raise

2:30:56.240 --> 2:31:04.720
 their status no but you're your status raising yes so i was actually like in a situation where

2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:10.720
 nobody was watching me and i was free to just battle at my own will okay which is what it was

2:31:10.720 --> 2:31:16.880
 about for me and you just push yourself because i knew how to do that i know how to push myself

2:31:17.760 --> 2:31:23.440
 are you well when you're doing these 14 rounds is every single one a standalone thing for you

2:31:23.440 --> 2:31:29.520
 yep so you're not trying to pace yourself no it's just each one is to as much exhaustion as i can get

2:31:29.520 --> 2:31:34.960
 but then there must be ones where like it's a ground nine where you're got nothing left

2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:39.440
 better figure out how to score it's all you got to do you got to survive and you got to score

2:31:41.440 --> 2:31:47.280
 what's your memories of that those three weeks what's like what stands out to you it seems like

2:31:47.280 --> 2:31:54.480
 um because that's the place where you found the silver medal yep because it's the place most

2:31:54.480 --> 2:32:02.800
 people don't want to be everybody's comfortable i would rather i would rather find out who i am

2:32:02.800 --> 2:32:10.160
 and what i'm made of and find those those endpoints and if i can't find them then that means everybody

2:32:10.160 --> 2:32:18.240
 else has given up before me where there's a few people that just kind of you return to battle

2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:27.760
 over and over in those times and then it was just yep no social media no none of that is just like

2:32:27.760 --> 2:32:33.520
 to lock yourself in your room you come back you've thought about it and you come back with a game

2:32:33.520 --> 2:32:41.200
 plan for that day against some players here there and i would i would develop a hit list like i would

2:32:41.200 --> 2:32:46.320
 be like oh that that mother fucker grabbed me at like 13 and i watched him sit fucking four rounds

2:32:46.320 --> 2:32:49.760
 and then come try to kick the shit out of me i'm gonna fucking grab that guy early i'm gonna beat

2:32:49.760 --> 2:32:55.200
 the shit out of him and you just develop that list there's probably some epic battles in that room

2:32:55.200 --> 2:33:03.440
 right yeah uh what's it look like like how crowded is it very and so you're just like yeah to see a

2:33:03.440 --> 2:33:08.560
 people see a people and you're trying to are you doing groundwork at all just throws just throws

2:33:08.560 --> 2:33:13.040
 no transitions no nothing but if i get pissed off and like you keep dropping or like not let me do

2:33:13.040 --> 2:33:18.240
 what i want to do i'll rip a choke right across your face just to let you know that like yeah and

2:33:18.240 --> 2:33:26.560
 if i wanted to you have a really nice style of just like respectfully bullying the shit out of people

2:33:26.560 --> 2:33:32.480
 because some people call me a bully and i have to remind them that like a bully enjoys like

2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:39.200
 beating up the weak right i want to beat the person that fights back right exactly it's not

2:33:39.200 --> 2:33:44.800
 fun for me if you don't fight back right some of the greatest people i've seen like do this they

2:33:44.800 --> 2:33:49.840
 basically uh you have this in the iowa wrestling rooms they'll push each other into the wall like

2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:55.120
 they get there's like anger but it's ultimately underneath it all it's like a deep respect i

2:33:55.120 --> 2:33:59.920
 was training with colton brown one time and i went to san jose state because i was in california

2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:06.320
 for something and he kept like he kept circling to the edge they had like a cupboard that had like

2:34:06.320 --> 2:34:10.320
 when you opened it it had like all the tape and like medical supplies i was like we'll fucking

2:34:10.320 --> 2:34:14.560
 put you right through that and he kind of lived he kind of giggled and then he went by that edge and i

2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:19.440
 fucking ran him right through it yeah see to me that's an ultimate sign of respect that both you

2:34:19.440 --> 2:34:24.240
 and colton will remember well and we're still friends we still talk it's just i told him i was

2:34:24.240 --> 2:34:34.080
 gonna do it he knew i meant it too yeah he did anyways that just tested me uh yeah listen that's

2:34:34.080 --> 2:34:39.920
 and that same attitude was that's that was in japan just day after day after day after day 14

2:34:39.920 --> 2:34:45.680
 rounds that's that's rough and you didn't sit out rounds and i did it all with a broken hand

2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:55.360
 um how how how did you do with a broken hand you show up every day you show up okay i actually

2:34:55.360 --> 2:35:00.560
 went left or right my right okay so that's okay so you can then focus on gripping with your left

2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:05.760
 it's always the way there's always a way but that means you can't i guess you don't have to grip

2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:10.960
 you're right sometimes because i would palm it with my thumb just like hanging out like this just

2:35:10.960 --> 2:35:16.720
 like this so you can do something so you can do like ogoshi because you have a um because i what

2:35:16.720 --> 2:35:24.080
 were your main throws it was sanagi koshi garuma okay sumi uchimata uchimata but you have this big

2:35:25.920 --> 2:35:31.440
 like ogoshi type of thing like a yeah but not from like around the waist it's from over the

2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:38.000
 shoulder over the shoulder and i can do it with just the one hand oh which one hand the right one

2:35:38.000 --> 2:35:41.840
 i don't need this leave hand you don't need a sleeve hand but what you couldn't do with the

2:35:41.840 --> 2:35:48.640
 broken hand i could because i can just put my hand in the gi so it can't come off and then you just

2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:55.680
 because what happened was three days before i was leaving for japan a guy my hand was rested

2:35:55.680 --> 2:36:01.600
 like this on a mat and the guy boom took my whole thumb off and tore all the tendons in the palm

2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:07.200
 yeah so when i went to the doctor he was like you know we have to put a cast on and i go i'm

2:36:07.200 --> 2:36:11.680
 leaving in three days you're not putting a cast on it and i go this is what i want you to do

2:36:11.680 --> 2:36:18.880
 just like this i said i want you to build a cast that holds it that velcros around so that when

2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:24.320
 i'm not training i can wear it yeah but then when i'm training i'll take it off and then i'll put

2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:33.200
 the tape on it and then whatever happens happens whatever happens happens all right so that's epic

2:36:33.200 --> 2:36:40.080
 and that led you to the 2016 olympics in rio well that led me to winning pan am gold when i got back

2:36:40.080 --> 2:36:48.000
 from japan and then almost getting my leg cut off in 2015 that was like you know maybe a month or two

2:36:48.000 --> 2:36:54.800
 later i was hospitalized for seven days the leg being cut off for what i had three different types

2:36:54.800 --> 2:37:02.960
 of bacterial infections in my right leg a whole leg swelled and it was in my blood skin and in my

2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:12.560
 bone in my right leg so i got stuck at mgh in a hospital for seven days until they figured out

2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:19.680
 what the bacteria source was where was the source of the infection as in in my knee in the knee yeah

2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:25.920
 okay so obviously there's a danger of like that's life threatening yep so when i went into the

2:37:25.920 --> 2:37:30.880
 emergency room when i got back from the world's the lady was like hey you need to call here

2:37:30.880 --> 2:37:36.000
 gonna call because you may lose your leg tonight yeah and then they put me in the hospital what

2:37:36.000 --> 2:37:41.360
 do you think in this whole time are you still thinking about olympics they put me into the

2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:50.000
 room like four hours later the doctor came in um i was at mgh in boston and he was like

2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:56.080
 you have a serious infection in your leg i go he's like we have to keep you hospitalized until

2:37:56.080 --> 2:38:01.520
 we can figure out what it is and i was like buddy i have the olympic games in less than a year i go

2:38:01.520 --> 2:38:07.440
 i don't give a fuck what it is i go just fucking take it out and let me get on with my day he goes

2:38:07.440 --> 2:38:13.440
 we can't do that like i don't understand i go you told me this infected just cut away that part of

2:38:13.440 --> 2:38:18.000
 the tissue drain it do whatever you gotta do and then send me on my way he's like it doesn't work

2:38:18.000 --> 2:38:22.640
 like that he said until we figure out what it is we can't figure out how to stop it from growing

2:38:22.640 --> 2:38:28.320
 or how far it spread so it took him seven days to figure out what it was then once they figured

2:38:28.320 --> 2:38:36.240
 out what it was i went in for surgery to remove it then i spent i think it was eight weeks in

2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:43.200
 home care with a pick line and then i came back from that on the first week and a half of judo

2:38:43.200 --> 2:38:50.080
 i tore my si joint trying to throw a guy and then i came back from that about a month later and then

2:38:51.120 --> 2:38:56.000
 fifth at the conal cup and then the game six months later how quickly do doctors understand

2:38:56.000 --> 2:39:00.560
 who they're dealing with like is that is that difficult for you to explain who Travis Stevens

2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:09.760
 is when you go to visit a doctor i don't think they understand you know their role is to get me to

2:39:09.760 --> 2:39:15.520
 do my job to the best of their ability as a doctor right meaning it's going to be less than what they

2:39:15.520 --> 2:39:26.480
 want and they and they struggle conceptually with like but the textbook tells me this and i go but

2:39:26.480 --> 2:39:31.360
 i'm not a textbook right like when you go to physical therapy the first thing they do is

2:39:31.360 --> 2:39:37.840
 they pull out that binder that says day one we do this exercise i go but i have my own goals

2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:44.000
 your job is to help me meet my goal let's let's work a plan to do that or i gotta go find somebody

2:39:44.000 --> 2:39:50.640
 else did uh the doctors in general people outside of your close in the group step up if they didn't

2:39:50.640 --> 2:39:59.200
 i found somebody else and typically i could find a person who knew the right person i always wonder

2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:04.640
 with people like because i'm constantly surrounded by one of the biggest problems in my life has been

2:40:04.640 --> 2:40:10.160
 there's a lot of people in my life who love me very much but who want me to the equivalent of that

2:40:10.160 --> 2:40:16.640
 situation um you know definitely don't go to the olympics and definitely like like it seems like

2:40:16.640 --> 2:40:22.960
 the world is full of people that want you to be average and happy yes which is great which is fine

2:40:22.960 --> 2:40:27.760
 i mean i perhaps that's the way it should be like you know my parents people close to these that's

2:40:27.760 --> 2:40:33.280
 what love how love manifests itself often in people but then like i think the ultimate

2:40:33.920 --> 2:40:39.360
 manifestation of love is understanding who this person is here's a madman who's driven towards a

2:40:39.360 --> 2:40:48.160
 particular thing and the best thing for you to do is not to say like rest is to say work harder

2:40:49.440 --> 2:40:57.200
 like fuck your infection yeah you should be training yeah have you ever met anybody as crazy as you

2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:05.280
 that can help you most of us who get to this point get there because we're all a little unstable

2:41:05.280 --> 2:41:12.720
 yeah even my wife glida right like when she was getting ready for 2016 um or when she was getting

2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:21.680
 ready for 2020 because she moved to boston um to be a coach she had a a neck problem right

2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:29.680
 and at that at some point in time it's like what's really important day to day life

2:41:29.680 --> 2:41:39.360
 or judo and believe it or not the doctor in canada was like i am never under any circumstances

2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:45.920
 doing an MRI of your neck again that's what she told her she goes if you have me do an MRI

2:41:45.920 --> 2:41:50.800
 you're not doing judo again so just know if you hurt your neck and it requires an MRI

2:41:51.840 --> 2:41:57.200
 you're done with judo forever yeah so decide if you want to do judo or not that was a conversation

2:41:57.200 --> 2:42:02.560
 we actually had to have that's a cool thing for a doctor to say i mean it depends how bad

2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:09.440
 ass they sound when they say it so that's a tough conversation judo one what's what's this with your

2:42:09.440 --> 2:42:14.960
 wife what's that relationship like so you're both a little crazy a little bit in the in a good sense

2:42:15.840 --> 2:42:22.160
 or from my perspective in a good sense yeah it's just we've we understand that when it

2:42:22.160 --> 2:42:29.600
 it when you set a goal to do something you're not signing on for the good yeah you're signing

2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:35.200
 on for the bad and i don't think a lot of people understand that that's like a valentine's day

2:42:35.200 --> 2:42:41.520
 card from travis stevens it's you have to like accept everything negative that could possibly

2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:46.320
 happen and until you do you're never gonna make it because you'll always sell yourself short

2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:51.680
 yeah you'll never go far enough and if you sign up for the whole thing then the negative is just

2:42:51.680 --> 2:42:57.040
 like oh great like i expected that if you're experiencing the negative they're also experiencing

2:42:57.040 --> 2:43:02.240
 the negative and if you overcome it maybe they'll get knocked out from yep maybe they won't deal

2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:07.200
 with it maybe they won't train through it right when i had my five herniated disc and i was in

2:43:07.200 --> 2:43:13.040
 a neck brace i was still in the gym at 7 am yeah doing whatever it is i could do because my job

2:43:13.040 --> 2:43:18.960
 is to be at the gym david goggans i don't know if you know the guy he's he's gone he's damaged

2:43:18.960 --> 2:43:26.640
 a lot of parts of his body like you trying to achieve things so you know unlike you his achievements

2:43:26.640 --> 2:43:32.800
 are like your achievements come with the metal he's just running in the darkness in the middle

2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:37.840
 of nowhere by himself it's like i mean it's the same probably as with you if you're able to be

2:43:37.840 --> 2:43:43.920
 introspective about it is he's just battling his own inner demons and working through those

2:43:43.920 --> 2:43:51.760
 and is breaking up breaking his body doing so are you cognizant of the tradeoff of the fact that

2:43:51.760 --> 2:43:58.640
 you know you're damaging your body to get to these levels of achievements of this level of

2:43:58.640 --> 2:44:03.920
 excellence of this level of greatness i mean i guess that depends on what you consider damage

2:44:03.920 --> 2:44:09.520
 really because i don't really see that i have damaged my body if anything i think i've strengthened

2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:17.760
 it my body can go through more than yours can yeah who's is weaker yeah right it's just like

2:44:17.760 --> 2:44:21.760
 it's just like the tie boxers right yeah in order to strengthen their shins they got to break it a

2:44:21.760 --> 2:44:26.960
 few times yeah it's just nature of the beast you just uh had to break a bunch of stuff to find

2:44:26.960 --> 2:44:31.600
 where the weak points are and then made them stronger yeah or strengthen the areas around

2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:37.760
 it to strengthen it by you know a sheer relation to it but the problem is like you may not be able

2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:47.920
 to do judo like for until you're 70 why not i may not be able to do judo to the level i used to

2:44:47.920 --> 2:44:52.000
 yeah don't get me wrong but i can still do judo you can still do judo and i think a lot of people

2:44:52.000 --> 2:44:58.160
 struggle with they want to keep doing it like they used to be able to do it i don't try to do judo

2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:04.400
 like i used to like you're seeing here i i'm not that guy anymore i accept that i don't even try

2:45:04.400 --> 2:45:10.640
 to be that guy anymore i'm a completely different player today than i am when i was winning olympic

2:45:10.640 --> 2:45:22.160
 medals and so i guess when you're looking at like my journey and the tradeoff is i never sacrificed

2:45:22.160 --> 2:45:30.720
 anything the people around me sacrificed for me and i never had a downturn after the olympics

2:45:30.720 --> 2:45:38.160
 because i never identified as an olympian you know a lot of olympians suffer from depression

2:45:38.160 --> 2:45:43.520
 because they identify as it now they don't have who they are where was your personal

2:45:44.960 --> 2:45:51.440
 moment of greatness like or do you not experience life that way where you were truly proud to be

2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:57.920
 yourself like every day i wake up you're you wake up and you're not proud of who you are then

2:45:57.920 --> 2:46:04.080
 and you've really got to seek out some like help so that's first of all okay i i'll do that because

2:46:04.640 --> 2:46:10.400
 i definitely am not proud of who i am i just wonder if you didn't identify with the olympics

2:46:11.120 --> 2:46:18.160
 was there times maybe in the training room maybe in japan like where you're you just kind of felt

2:46:18.160 --> 2:46:26.400
 like i get more of an emotional i guess trigger right where like i feel proud of what i've done

2:46:26.400 --> 2:46:37.360
 when i've set to a task and i've done it so almost any task and the more challenging the task

2:46:37.360 --> 2:46:46.640
 the more reward you've fought a lot of amazing battles in 2016 olympics so you got you beat the

2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:53.440
 let's see the world number four and the quarter finals it's like a replay every single olympics

2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:59.360
 you're all the pictures i got terrible draws saying terrible draws and then you're facing this is

2:46:59.360 --> 2:47:04.000
 where i was like watching this i'm like yeah he's screwed you faced the world number one the georgian

2:47:04.560 --> 2:47:11.520
 and by by the way for people who don't know he beat me five times to my beating him once and

2:47:11.520 --> 2:47:18.400
 the one time i beat him was in london and all other times he beat me he beat me by poem and not by

2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:25.920
 like a little throw like he threw me on my head at one point we were in georgia i'm fighting him

2:47:25.920 --> 2:47:30.800
 in the final i go to my teammate and i go guess what make sure you watch this fight somebody's

2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:36.560
 getting thrown free poem this match ain't at the same magical distance and about a minute in i tried

2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:42.000
 to take his head off with a big koshi grimo which is like a head and arm he caught me and then

2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:48.960
 threw me on my head and ended the match so first of all we're watching the video of you again standing

2:47:48.960 --> 2:47:54.560
 next to the to the guy leading up to your semi final match so here if you uh if you win this you're

2:47:54.560 --> 2:47:59.840
 guaranteed a medal yep but the chances of you winning from my fan perspective i was like god

2:47:59.840 --> 2:48:05.200
 damn it uh you and the rest of the world except for me except for you what what are you saying

2:48:05.200 --> 2:48:10.240
 you're talking to yourself here what are you saying my name is travis stevens i'm an olympic

2:48:10.240 --> 2:48:17.040
 champion i will not be denied the george is probably like what the hell is this guy saying

2:48:17.600 --> 2:48:25.200
 what is he talking to himself so he was probably ultra confident yeah had to be the difference is

2:48:25.920 --> 2:48:32.160
 is i understood the last five times he beat me i was purposely trying to throw him not beat him

2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:39.360
 hmm i wanted to find out if i could turns out i can't but i don't need to throw him to beat him

2:48:40.560 --> 2:48:49.760
 i need to know how to not lose but you're still going for stuff here but all of my attacks drag

2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:56.320
 him to the ground yeah drag they're never standing on my feet which is a complete which is a

2:48:56.320 --> 2:48:59.760
 distinction that we talked about at the very beginning right you have throws where you're

2:48:59.760 --> 2:49:04.720
 standing and throws where you're dropping every time i try to throw him standing he throws me

2:49:04.720 --> 2:49:10.160
 free pony picks me up and he throws me on my head literally so what i did is i just needed to get

2:49:10.160 --> 2:49:15.920
 to that last one minute mark which is what he does mentally in his own judo where he changes into a

2:49:15.920 --> 2:49:22.720
 panic and just tries to like do things that are uncharacteristic so you knew he's going to start

2:49:22.720 --> 2:49:29.520
 panicking here as you get as the match draws to close and you both have a pashido and actually we

2:49:29.520 --> 2:49:37.280
 did we pass the point where i went for broke and i broke my rule which one i went for a crazy foot

2:49:37.280 --> 2:49:45.360
 sweep um like iphone switch thing i can't remember what it's called because it's not used that often

2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:50.800
 and he actually landed on top of me and some people wanted it to be called iphone but he had

2:49:50.800 --> 2:49:55.680
 actually let go of the gi and was looking for the mat so he didn't have any control so they

2:49:55.680 --> 2:50:01.520
 didn't award him a point yeah and here we go now we're getting down into the next year he's getting

2:50:01.520 --> 2:50:07.920
 frustrated great yeah i love it perfect second penalty no big deal we just got to get to the

2:50:07.920 --> 2:50:16.480
 one minute mark that's all we got to do so there's no panic here for you you know i'm right where i

2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:25.280
 need to be and look at now if you go back into this match uh i would love for somebody to go back

2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:33.760
 and see how many times he did a drop right iphone senagi probably never yeah so why is he doing it

2:50:33.760 --> 2:50:42.240
 now because he panics and he changes his judo at that one minute mark so look out look how much i

2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:48.240
 kept that grip yeah you kept you have that grip this whole time yeah have your left hand walking

2:50:48.240 --> 2:50:56.400
 him down walking him down that he he you keep the grip as he's throwing yeah which were you

2:50:56.400 --> 2:51:01.920
 thinking choke as he drops or no it's just kind of natural instinct yeah because we drilled it

2:51:01.920 --> 2:51:07.760
 i spent two years drilling this transition and then very so for people that don't do judo jiu jitsu

2:51:07.760 --> 2:51:13.440
 it's like really nice you keep everything is nicely controlled to where you're keeping that

2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:18.720
 gi under his chin like it's really tight control like it's very like your cognitive i guess is

2:51:18.720 --> 2:51:23.120
 drilling but your cognizant of the position of your wrist the whole time and you can tell based

2:51:23.120 --> 2:51:29.600
 on like just years of doing it whether it's under or it's not right you can just feel the difference

2:51:29.600 --> 2:51:34.080
 and it's probably even if you wanted to stop that it's very difficult because your whole time it's

2:51:34.080 --> 2:51:40.400
 like once it's under it's almost impossible to stop for people who practice jiu jitsu don't practice

2:51:40.400 --> 2:51:48.000
 judo one of the very annoying things about judo is in order to do gi chokes they have to be under

2:51:48.000 --> 2:51:54.400
 the chin yes even though the kind of intense jokes you do work just fine over the chin but

2:51:55.680 --> 2:52:01.200
 and the the kicker here and why we practice this choke was because when you go back and watch all

2:52:01.200 --> 2:52:06.800
 of the other matches he always does this tripod when i try to do arm locks yeah which is typically

2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:11.520
 what i would do yeah and when i do that he ends up sliding out and i end up falling off right

2:52:12.160 --> 2:52:18.400
 so you step up here with the choke he does a tripod where he sticks his button to the air and you

2:52:21.280 --> 2:52:27.920
 do what's the name of this choke bow and arrow no but okay let me when you do from like from that

2:52:27.920 --> 2:52:33.840
 position is there a way this entry into the bow and arrow i guess because you're doing we we refer

2:52:33.840 --> 2:52:38.480
 to a judo as a british triangle british when they when they're in that turtle position and you do

2:52:38.480 --> 2:52:45.520
 that rolling motion cool and here when you go into that you can fall off of them like you said if

2:52:45.520 --> 2:52:51.200
 you're going for an arm bar but here literally because you have it under the chin really well

2:52:51.200 --> 2:52:57.280
 there's just a nice control and i've already planned on it being on his chin that's why i've hooked

2:52:57.280 --> 2:53:03.520
 the arm yeah right it's already starting to go straight probably this choke in the early stages

2:53:03.520 --> 2:53:12.320
 like a few frames before feels like it uh like you're safe it's fine like like the head will

2:53:12.320 --> 2:53:18.240
 slip out or something like that yeah and that's why my left knee is up by his shoulder to keep that

2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:26.800
 pressure down so that he can't posture it up when did you know you have this oh i was right here

2:53:28.960 --> 2:53:34.000
 i i actually panicked um right about here

2:53:36.560 --> 2:53:43.520
 was maybe his head to come out my hand i tore the muscle in my palm because i was pulling so hard

2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:52.000
 that i'm like and he may not tap yeah like is he is my hand just gonna give out beforehand

2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:56.880
 and there he is we're right on this edge right yeah so like if we roll a little bit outside

2:53:56.880 --> 2:54:01.520
 and i still don't have it like that ref could stop it yeah and then i felt him tapping and

2:54:01.520 --> 2:54:14.800
 oh the that he is um he's hard broken i felt surprised there it is the relief olympic olympic final

2:54:17.200 --> 2:54:24.080
 and he knew he knew he lost an olympic medal right there because he already knew that the

2:54:24.080 --> 2:54:34.320
 japanese guy was going to be his bronze that he never beats see the but also he probably in his

2:54:34.320 --> 2:54:41.040
 head was confident that he'll be in the final correct and so like this he almost is surprised

2:54:41.680 --> 2:54:46.400
 yeah it's not supposed to happen this way and it's the second time it's happened

2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:56.080
 and that's how you became an olympic medalist man that must be a great feeling

2:54:57.120 --> 2:55:03.920
 that must be a great feeling right here just like all the years of injuries all of it

2:55:07.360 --> 2:55:13.200
 as as fans that watch this too it's like holy shit he actually did it it's a packed stadium too

2:55:13.200 --> 2:55:23.840
 now one empty seat oh man so uh i mean what were you thinking here i'll just focus on the next

2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:34.320
 match yeah it took me maybe like a minute or so to like decompress and then like get back to like

2:55:34.320 --> 2:55:45.920
 my normal state for the final so the the final is against the uh the russian here what can you say

2:55:45.920 --> 2:55:54.400
 about your mindset what you're saying the exact same thing travel stevens olympic champion i will

2:55:54.400 --> 2:56:01.440
 not be denied because i had felt like in london and throughout the years i felt like i kept getting

2:56:01.440 --> 2:56:07.040
 robbed so i made sure in my monitor to add that little bit at the end to reassure myself that like

2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:12.560
 they are not going to control the outcome of today i'm going to control the outcome what did you

2:56:12.560 --> 2:56:19.520
 know about the russian everything um and i i honestly i thought i had won the olympics right

2:56:19.520 --> 2:56:26.240
 now and i still do think that today just like mentally when you think about it that

2:56:26.240 --> 2:56:36.560
 i've won like yeah he threw me but it was like a one in a million chance that that worked for him

2:56:37.440 --> 2:56:42.800
 like come on so the so it's not like you feel lucky to be in the final it's like

2:56:44.560 --> 2:56:50.720
 again remember i'm i'm anticipating the goal like i'm i'm past that i think there's a

2:56:50.720 --> 2:56:55.120
 confidence in the way you're moving in the way you're yeah like i have his sleeve he's not breaking

2:56:55.120 --> 2:57:02.320
 it like still walking him down still going forward like um i knew exactly how i was going to beat him

2:57:04.080 --> 2:57:09.600
 and i developed the plan because when i was getting ready for rio we brought in a lot of the top

2:57:09.600 --> 2:57:15.120
 japanese players that weren't invited to the camp for the national team to boston so i had four

2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:20.720
 people three of them were on the national team one of them had won the universities in japan

2:57:20.720 --> 2:57:28.720
 all at 81 kilos i only got thrown once during camp for a month oh like i was i was ready

2:57:31.280 --> 2:57:38.960
 i just i fucking slipped what does it happen right when he threw me so if you let this play out

2:57:38.960 --> 2:57:44.240
 really quick there's a point right here where i'm going to come around his back and i'm kind of going

2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:49.520
 to just yoko su temei which means like a lateral drop and i'm just going to bring him down to the

2:57:49.520 --> 2:57:55.040
 floor which isn't a throw right here yeah it's more of like a a takedown right i'm trying to get

2:57:55.040 --> 2:57:59.280
 him to the ground because i want to burn him he doesn't do any waza yeah so i'm just going to

2:57:59.280 --> 2:58:06.480
 keep burning him and you can see that like i get really close here he just went a little too far

2:58:07.120 --> 2:58:13.120
 to his side during this exchange and like he's running i'm like ah he

2:58:13.120 --> 2:58:22.240
 he's very wiry for an 81 kg player yeah there's not much like muscle on him

2:58:23.360 --> 2:58:27.840
 but he uses his length and his leverage very well and you can see like i'm really burning the clock

2:58:27.840 --> 2:58:33.440
 here like i'm owning these exchanges more than i'm owning the tachi waza ones the ones in our feet

2:58:33.440 --> 2:58:38.480
 so you weren't trying to necessarily like submit him here or like really hard or like

2:58:38.480 --> 2:58:47.040
 um pin him you're trying to break him a bit i'm doing both i'm being overly physical um

2:58:48.240 --> 2:58:53.680
 and to a lot of the bjj people who are watching this like they're like oh well i would have done

2:58:53.680 --> 2:58:59.840
 this i would have done that you've got to think like if that referee who's refing the judo side

2:58:59.840 --> 2:59:06.560
 of it looks at it for a couple seconds and's like uh he's not really moving yeah they'll stop it yeah

2:59:06.560 --> 2:59:12.640
 so you're uh like you understand judo yeah what's called nae was a gone work like what you

2:59:12.640 --> 2:59:17.680
 because you're really showing it to the ref yes you have to show movement and progression

2:59:19.200 --> 2:59:24.240
 i'd hurt the forehead like see i threw that hand in there kind of hard yeah ripping it across his

2:59:24.240 --> 2:59:33.840
 face just because i gotta i gotta tell you there's a calm well no he does look a little a little

2:59:33.840 --> 2:59:41.680
 broken but the the russians have like this calmness they're pretty good at well don't forget they've

2:59:41.680 --> 2:59:49.200
 competed like this for a long time yeah it's all he knows and this is where i lose it see how my knee

2:59:49.200 --> 2:59:53.840
 hit the ground yeah my knee wasn't supposed to touch the ground yeah i was supposed to sit to

2:59:53.840 --> 2:59:59.840
 my hip to bring him down something happened where my knee touched yeah and it didn't happen in the

2:59:59.840 --> 3:00:05.920
 first one it just happened there it's like that we never should have been in that predicament yeah

3:00:07.040 --> 3:00:13.440
 and that's that's one of the things where when you're looking at you know sports for anybody

3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:19.920
 who's trying to improve you have to when you're when you're trying to improve you've really

3:00:19.920 --> 3:00:28.800
 got to ignore the ends of the spectrums right the the oopsies and the they got lucky and you only

3:00:28.800 --> 3:00:34.640
 focus on the middle like the technique i was doing was perfectly sound the it just happened

3:00:34.640 --> 3:00:38.960
 that the one oopsie happened on the stage it shouldn't have happened on and there's no

3:00:41.040 --> 3:00:44.080
 there's no amount of drilling that will ever

3:00:45.200 --> 3:00:51.360
 like prevent that from happening and that's just the the that's sports that's sports especially

3:00:51.360 --> 3:00:58.640
 olympics especially judo when it's like one yeah one mistake oopsie can just be your that's it that's it

3:00:58.640 --> 3:01:02.640
 you know it really requires and you have to wrap your head around the idea of like

3:01:02.640 --> 3:01:06.880
 if you want the ability to beat these people and throw these people like you got to be willing

3:01:06.880 --> 3:01:13.600
 to get thrown yourself yeah like this is unboxing there's no like i'm going to stand in a place where

3:01:13.600 --> 3:01:19.360
 he can't hit me and i can hit him because we have the gi and because they can grab it they have just

3:01:19.360 --> 3:01:25.680
 as much ability to throw you as you them so how'd you feel here how long was the duration of you

3:01:25.680 --> 3:01:32.960
 feeling upset that you didn't get the gold versus never felt it never felt it just because he didn't

3:01:32.960 --> 3:01:39.040
 beat me right right it's an important distinction because when i'm training and when i'm competing

3:01:39.920 --> 3:01:46.800
 like i understand that i take risks and i accept those consequences that's why i take them that's

3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:53.760
 a consequence that's not him being the better judo player that dominated a match and i didn't

3:01:53.760 --> 3:01:59.520
 have an answer and then he threw me then i would be a little upset like when you're tired and somebody's

3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:05.440
 coming at you and like you can't do anything about it that's a shitty feeling yeah you know

3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:12.640
 and that wasn't this and that wasn't this like i accept losing when it's when it's my fault

3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:20.080
 well that was a hell of a story man so from 2008 2012 just the sheer number of injuries

3:02:20.080 --> 3:02:29.760
 the weight cuts all of that the wanting to quit the the doubts uh i'm sure you did not get like the

3:02:29.760 --> 3:02:34.480
 fans probably started disappearing somewhere between the second and the third olympics like the

3:02:34.480 --> 3:02:41.600
 support from it did judo within the united states and just everybody you know just

3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:51.040
 like usoc tried to cut all my funding in 2015 and say now you're too old yeah so through all of that

3:02:51.040 --> 3:02:57.040
 to win the medal i mean that's what the olympics is about is is there some like when you look back

3:02:57.600 --> 3:03:02.320
 does that seem like another person is this like another lifetime ago or like that's a

3:03:02.320 --> 3:03:08.800
 hell of an accomplishment how do you feel about the whole thing it's a it's an interesting kind of

3:03:08.800 --> 3:03:14.800
 predicament because there's like those cookie cutter answers about how proud you are and how

3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:22.800
 grateful you are but at the end of the day it's not who you are so that that skill set and that

3:03:22.800 --> 3:03:31.680
 mentality that you know it took to accomplish that that's who you are and so this was just a

3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:39.440
 stepping stone in in who i am so it's in the past to me like there's no shrine in my house

3:03:39.440 --> 3:03:44.800
 that has like an olympic medal in it i can't remember last time i looked at it so you're

3:03:44.800 --> 3:03:51.520
 saying like the all the stories the skills along the way that's like you right now sitting here's

3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:59.520
 the shrine yeah the who you become along the journey is really what the prize is right like

3:03:59.520 --> 3:04:06.640
 when you think about any of them most of the people that you know go through that depression

3:04:06.640 --> 3:04:13.520
 after the games it's because that is their shrine like that is who they've identified as that is who

3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:19.280
 they've told the world the community their friends their family that's how they've identified

3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:25.680
 i've identified as the person who perseveres overcomes and accepts challenges

3:04:25.680 --> 3:04:33.840
 so like i all those things are just like you know put in a suitcase off to the side and

3:04:33.840 --> 3:04:41.680
 i'm on to the next great chapter thing that i'm trying to do and it's it's both sad and cool that

3:04:42.880 --> 3:04:47.760
 very few people in the world get to to experience what it's like to be you i mean this level

3:04:47.760 --> 3:04:58.880
 of of having gone through that yeah journey everyone has the opportunity to yeah yeah i mean

3:04:58.880 --> 3:05:07.120
 i've done a few um difficult things in my life but i gotta tell you weight cuts and sauna um

3:05:07.680 --> 3:05:11.200
 and i would tell people right now who are listening like don't go through that

3:05:11.200 --> 3:05:18.720
 it and i think a lot of wrestlers a lot of young judo players a lot of long young like just combat

3:05:18.720 --> 3:05:26.000
 sports people where weight classes are a thing they almost take a sense of pride like when i hear

3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:30.640
 them talking about like oh how much weight do you have to cut if you have to cut a pound more it's

3:05:30.640 --> 3:05:36.160
 like you've accomplished more like you're tougher yeah like you're not like there's no there's no

3:05:36.160 --> 3:05:43.920
 trophies for that you whatever the reason had a job to do and you got it done and that that is truly

3:05:43.920 --> 3:05:50.560
 inspiring no matter how hard that there's a big deep lesson to learn from that then you start getting

3:05:50.560 --> 3:05:56.560
 to the specifics of whether you should weight cut or not but if we don't then most of the great things

3:05:56.560 --> 3:06:01.280
 we have in this world we wouldn't have the reason we have many other great things is because people

3:06:01.280 --> 3:06:07.280
 did that weight cut the equivalent of the weight cut for whatever the discipline in there's a difference

3:06:07.280 --> 3:06:14.640
 between having to do it because you have to and you get through it yeah then setting yourself up

3:06:14.640 --> 3:06:20.400
 to do that because you think it's the cool thing or the thing you're supposed to be doing in order

3:06:20.400 --> 3:06:26.640
 to be successful yeah there are plenty of like two time olympic medalist i probably could have been

3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:31.840
 a two time olympic medalist had i not cut that much weight i probably would have multiple world

3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:36.880
 medals had i not cut that much weight because my body wouldn't have been that broken yeah there's

3:06:36.880 --> 3:06:43.360
 always the other side of it so just when you're looking at it like i just hear it in like young

3:06:43.360 --> 3:06:48.240
 kids even some of my own like when you hear them talk about like where their weight's at they almost

3:06:48.240 --> 3:06:53.760
 take a sense of pride on how much they have to lose because they hear stories like this and it's

3:06:53.760 --> 3:07:02.000
 like that's not the takeaway i did it because i had to i was put in a situation where like i may not

3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:05.840
 have gone to this game that i moved up to 90 kilos because i wouldn't have had time to grow into the

3:07:05.840 --> 3:07:10.880
 division and then you get the job done and then you get the job done you're right there's a

3:07:12.720 --> 3:07:18.400
 it's just a very important difference and that's also with sleep that's what people talk to me about

3:07:18.400 --> 3:07:23.600
 there should not be any glorification of not sleeping yes there should not be a glorification of

3:07:23.600 --> 3:07:32.080
 cutting weight but if that's on the way to your whatever is that fire inside you that you know

3:07:32.080 --> 3:07:38.320
 needs to get done like the job at hand if you need to sacrifice in some of those ways you get the

3:07:38.320 --> 3:07:45.040
 job done yes yeah and uh the wakeout is an interesting one because it's different i mean you you could

3:07:45.040 --> 3:07:50.480
 speak to this there's different sports in which the weight is more important than others and

3:07:50.480 --> 3:07:56.000
 there's different levels to this game i think at the level you operated in that was probably

3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:02.080
 essential yeah like there's huge games change completely from 81 kg to 90 kg it's a huge weight

3:08:02.080 --> 3:08:07.440
 jump it's it's first of all it's weight but then the strategy it's like so much changes the height

3:08:07.440 --> 3:08:12.240
 and all those kinds of things the physical like people don't understand it but the physical size

3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:18.400
 of a 90 kilo judo player versus the physical size of an 81 kilo judo player it's like putting a human

3:08:18.400 --> 3:08:23.680
 in a human like there's enough space that's not like you know you could stand next to your friend

3:08:23.680 --> 3:08:28.800
 who's 180 pounds and you could be 160 and you guys could look identical yeah it is different when

3:08:28.800 --> 3:08:34.800
 both the 90 kilo 100 kilo and 81 kilo both have six percent body fat and they're cutting into the

3:08:34.800 --> 3:08:39.360
 class and it always feels like there's more variety at 90 kilo because some of them are

3:08:39.360 --> 3:08:45.440
 lanky and tall yeah and some are short and stocky it's like 81 is more uniform which i

3:08:45.440 --> 3:08:50.480
 but then the you know the flip side of that is the this is why i like in jiu jitsu again amateur

3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:56.560
 competing against bigger guys like i love that more i like i like cutting weight just so i'm slim

3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:00.480
 like that's why i feel the best one the same thing that you mentioned but like i love going against

3:09:01.280 --> 3:09:08.880
 220 that because in jiu jitsu the the weight doesn't get amplified in the sport like the weight

3:09:08.880 --> 3:09:16.080
 is just the weight right if you can if you can leg press 220 and you can bench 220 then

3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:22.320
 yeah you can train with a guy who's 220 that's that's easy they're not gonna hurt you and i mean

3:09:22.320 --> 3:09:27.600
 there's there is a truth that you know light weights and middle weights in jiu jitsu and the

3:09:27.600 --> 3:09:32.320
 same is true for judo it's just like a lot more of them that means if you want to be

3:09:32.320 --> 3:09:40.560
 be is you're just competing at a higher level so like there's much more variety of games the

3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:46.320
 level is much higher so you're taking on a bigger challenge even if you're like um have a weight

3:09:46.320 --> 3:09:51.360
 advantage so those are all the senses you have to kind of make and certainly in jiu jitsu people

3:09:51.360 --> 3:09:55.440
 that are weight cutting are silly i mean that's that's the natural beginner thing to do is to

3:09:55.440 --> 3:10:02.560
 feel um the way the nervousness about competition expresses itself is through the desire to be

3:10:03.600 --> 3:10:08.720
 as light as possible which is the totally wrong desire to have right like when you

3:10:09.680 --> 3:10:18.800
 when you look at me now i'm probably like 230 right but i probably have the strength of a 70

3:10:18.800 --> 3:10:26.080
 kilo judo player yeah right the weight doesn't really do much yeah i mean you have the same

3:10:26.080 --> 3:10:31.520
 thing with wrestling yeah the skinny the skinny guys the skinny you that we're looking at there

3:10:31.520 --> 3:10:36.080
 just the amount of power in that person yeah it's fascinating because it doesn't look like you

3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:42.240
 have some muscle but it doesn't look but i've felt the power of some of those people yeah it's scary

3:10:42.240 --> 3:10:47.200
 yeah it's different that's the best way i can describe it it's like scary it's like oh

3:10:47.200 --> 3:10:52.960
 shit again it's the food chain you're not at the top of the food chain yeah that's the

3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:58.320
 best natural feeling when you go with some judo people um what's your sense about this recent

3:10:58.320 --> 3:11:05.280
 olympics what uh stands out to you as um so like uh teddy renare who was on a big run for a long time

3:11:05.840 --> 3:11:11.760
 many consider to be one of the greatest judo players of all time two time olympic golden

3:11:11.760 --> 3:11:18.800
 medalist and uh bronze medalist two time olympic bronze medalist the four olympics uh not counting

3:11:18.800 --> 3:11:24.960
 like team stuff just doing individual and then like yeah i'm not sure how they're gonna yeah i'm

3:11:24.960 --> 3:11:29.760
 not sure how they're gonna catalog that team event like are they all technically olympic champions

3:11:29.760 --> 3:11:34.560
 or is france an olympic champion no they're all technically olympic champions but i'm gonna ignore

3:11:34.560 --> 3:11:40.000
 that is that how they're gonna classify it now according oh sorry according to wikipedia

3:11:40.000 --> 3:11:44.240
 like according to the internet i don't know according to ijf or whatever because you know

3:11:44.240 --> 3:11:51.360
 some of those players never you know want to match they just filled a spot oh that's even a starker

3:11:51.360 --> 3:11:57.280
 example oh that's sad you know they lost in the individual and then they also lost in the team

3:11:57.840 --> 3:12:06.240
 and so well it's interesting because in in the case of uh teddy uh he was you know important

3:12:06.240 --> 3:12:13.760
 to the win against japan in this olympic so like in the team event so like if you i feel like you

3:12:13.760 --> 3:12:19.360
 should put that in the equation to say who won gold right it it does feel like he won gold in the

3:12:19.360 --> 3:12:25.840
 team because he carried the team well you have like namora at 60 kilos from japan three time

3:12:25.840 --> 3:12:33.680
 olympic gold medalist no team event yeah yeah are you are you gonna weigh teddy's team event

3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:38.160
 no we're not we're not arguing this of course no i'm just wondering how like the ijf like when

3:12:38.160 --> 3:12:44.640
 you look at a player stat yeah is it gonna be like team gold medal for the olympics versus

3:12:44.640 --> 3:12:52.160
 like their own personal gold medal yeah i think in sports we have to be brutally honest and i think

3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:59.760
 hopefully this doesn't piss off people i hope it does but judo is an individual sport it's honestly

3:12:59.760 --> 3:13:06.320
 just that one athlete maybe the athlete and coach all right if you look at the big big picture but

3:13:06.320 --> 3:13:12.480
 there's no there's no team in judo that's the beauty of combat sports that's the honesty of it

3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:18.080
 that's the the brutality of losing to another human being in a combat sport that's why it's so

3:13:18.080 --> 3:13:25.280
 damn embarrassing when you get slammed is because it's like you there's no team to uh uh to like

3:13:25.280 --> 3:13:30.640
 carry some of that responsibility it's all on you and you suck that's what you lost there's that

3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:36.240
 weight and that's why it's like magical it's not it's not like soccer it's not uh it's not like

3:13:36.240 --> 3:13:41.840
 basketball yeah i couldn't play team sports because if one of my teammates wasn't doing their job

3:13:41.840 --> 3:13:46.400
 correctly i would go play their position that i'm gonna do it better than you yeah but that you

3:13:46.400 --> 3:13:50.880
 know some of the greatest leaders of teams also do that michael jordan is like that right i mean

3:13:50.880 --> 3:13:59.280
 it's like with your actions you raise the the level for everybody like excellence is expected and

3:13:59.280 --> 3:14:04.800
 therefore everybody needs to step up so some of some of the greatest uh i would say uh team leaders

3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:10.480
 are individualists the heart but it's okay so daddy i think ten time world champion non team

3:14:11.680 --> 3:14:16.640
 regular uh it's a big number but i think he has some like open weight categories in there open

3:14:16.640 --> 3:14:21.200
 weight right right i mean you can count those right i mean that that's interesting it's the

3:14:21.200 --> 3:14:25.920
 same division twice it's the same division twice that's right one day after another yeah that's right

3:14:25.920 --> 3:14:31.280
 i don't know if i want to count that yeah well i mean that's one of the the reasons people don't

3:14:31.280 --> 3:14:39.200
 usually put heavy weights in judo as like the greatest of all time because the level of competition

3:14:39.200 --> 3:14:49.280
 is lower yes uh but anyway he did lose in this match to um to a young russian yep uh tamerlan

3:14:49.280 --> 3:14:56.480
 bachev match also not on the internet thank you olympics i am definitely going to go on some

3:14:56.480 --> 3:15:02.240
 rants on the internet because uh i love it as a fan of um olympics i feel like this definitely

3:15:02.240 --> 3:15:08.400
 needs to change moving forward that like every single major olympic event i'm also like i also

3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:12.320
 like random sports like weightlifting even though i don't do olympic weightlifting it's fun just to

3:15:12.320 --> 3:15:19.600
 watch fun to watch such high level of excellence and the fact that we can't just freaking watch the full

3:15:20.480 --> 3:15:26.160
 like each nicely categorized event is really heartbreaking in judo in olympic weightlifting

3:15:26.160 --> 3:15:33.920
 and track and gymnastics all of that anyway uh so teddy lost i mean that does that stand out to you

3:15:33.920 --> 3:15:38.640
 if you were to like recap the things that you remember from this olympics i picked him losing

3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:44.960
 already like in my predictions lose which where that match or just in general somewhere in the

3:15:44.960 --> 3:15:50.720
 final in the final you thought yeah final or was it semi when i looked at his draw because he decided

3:15:50.720 --> 3:15:58.400
 not to compete throughout the water do like the bare minimum to go because of his age i didn't think

3:15:58.400 --> 3:16:05.360
 he would have enough energy to battle his way through yeah the draw that he had and sure enough

3:16:05.360 --> 3:16:12.160
 he didn't he he felt earlier than i thought but he just he's not the young athletic person he used

3:16:12.160 --> 3:16:19.120
 to be and when they changed the rules to judo they allowed people to take people into really

3:16:19.120 --> 3:16:27.440
 really deep waters which you saw at this olympics which you know it did it ruin the sport or did it

3:16:27.440 --> 3:16:34.320
 not like i'm not sure but it was definitely difficult to watch would you put him at the greatest

3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:38.800
 of all time or asked another way like who do you think is the greatest judo player of all time

3:16:39.680 --> 3:16:44.480
 he's definitely not the greatest judo player but he's definitely the best competitor

3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:49.280
 what's the difference in judo player and competitor there's an ability to like

3:16:49.280 --> 3:16:58.400
 do the act of judo of like throwing pinning arm locking versus can you win a judo match

3:17:00.400 --> 3:17:05.440
 right like when you look at somebody like namora who like through everyone he fought

3:17:05.440 --> 3:17:12.880
 through three olympics multiple world championships multiple things like that's a pure judo player

3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:18.320
 in the essence of judo he can throw pin or arm lock just about anybody he steps on the mat with

3:17:18.320 --> 3:17:28.160
 during his time teddy tended to when you look at his judo because of his size again it's just because

3:17:28.160 --> 3:17:35.440
 he's in the heavyweight category he was so much bigger so much stronger people just couldn't handle

3:17:35.440 --> 3:17:41.040
 it and you would see really good judo players just break yeah like they could hang in there for a

3:17:41.040 --> 3:17:46.720
 little bit but eventually his size like you can't control that weight weight moves weight and when

3:17:46.720 --> 3:17:52.480
 you have to use all your strength to keep him upright and off of you your muscles just give

3:17:52.480 --> 3:17:57.920
 out because you don't have somebody of that stature and that skill like to train with to train

3:17:57.920 --> 3:18:04.960
 those muscles so what you're thinking more like those uh 73 81 90 k g people that just stand in

3:18:04.960 --> 3:18:12.160
 the pocket and just give yeah everything like what comes to my mind is like a koga koga you know

3:18:12.160 --> 3:18:18.320
 a namura who's a 60 kilo guy but again like his dynamics and how long he was dominant for

3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:26.800
 like it just do you put value to like epic throws like singular moments of greatness

3:18:27.920 --> 3:18:35.680
 if it's against um a noteworthy player in a noteworthy position there are a lot of highlights of

3:18:35.680 --> 3:18:42.560
 people that are good judo players but their highlights are of you know scrubs yeah on the

3:18:42.560 --> 3:18:50.320
 ijf circuit right it's like great the japanese guy through the guy from you know senegal free

3:18:50.320 --> 3:18:56.800
 poem great we kind of expected that you took the world number one against the 330th person in the

3:18:56.800 --> 3:19:01.760
 world what do you think was going to happen like when i see those highlights like thrown around

3:19:01.760 --> 3:19:07.600
 like social media i'm like that's not a highlight they might as well have just been at the dojo

3:19:07.600 --> 3:19:14.160
 like practice and throws if you look at the like top 10 list for judo uh kano always comes up you

3:19:14.160 --> 3:19:20.560
 know as um but he's not somebody that i don't think his results are there but you don't really

3:19:20.560 --> 3:19:28.160
 know how he got there so it's it's hard for me to like i can't see his judo yeah so i'm not sure

3:19:28.160 --> 3:19:32.400
 kano by the way is the founder of judo for people who don't or consider to be the founder of judo

3:19:32.400 --> 3:19:38.160
 yeah the sport evolves yeah the players that are like if you took champions from the past and you

3:19:38.160 --> 3:19:43.520
 fought them against the players of today they're they're it's not happening and that goes with

3:19:43.520 --> 3:19:48.560
 anything right yeah so every time you think of like who's the best of all time it's probably

3:19:48.560 --> 3:19:55.440
 somebody within a generation or two of today yeah if i'm gonna pick my my top three let's say

3:19:55.440 --> 3:20:00.800
 top three and i would go generationally speaking i would pick ono for today

3:20:02.640 --> 3:20:10.080
 probably iliatus for like my time frame like the from a developmental standpoint and then i

3:20:10.080 --> 3:20:17.200
 probably go koga and then before koga i'd probably go namura as like the person of that generation

3:20:17.200 --> 3:20:26.080
 that people like as a whole in judo respected yeah well in the case of uh i wonder if people feared

3:20:26.080 --> 3:20:33.600
 koga yeah yeah like here that that little guy's gonna get under you and you're gonna go for a ride

3:20:33.600 --> 3:20:39.040
 you know he was 78 kilos when he took second at the all japan's which is an open weight class yeah

3:20:39.600 --> 3:20:45.040
 you know like he he could throw down with anybody any weight class and still went

3:20:45.040 --> 3:20:50.800
 he was one of the early people that planted the seed of judo love of judo and you it's like yeah

3:20:51.520 --> 3:20:59.040
 and when i looked at him like that was how like i wanted my judo to be portrayed that style yeah

3:20:59.760 --> 3:21:03.760
 and then iliatus iliatus you just like i mean you have a similar attitude to him

3:21:04.400 --> 3:21:06.400
 so you just like the way he cares that's where we get along

3:21:09.200 --> 3:21:13.360
 you guys hang out i mean i'd love to see that conversation i remember when we were talking

3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:18.880
 about like his coaching i was like why didn't you take this team or like why'd you pick this

3:21:18.880 --> 3:21:23.200
 team and he's like i can't work with those people like those people are weak for children

3:21:23.760 --> 3:21:29.040
 like they don't know how to train hard i love that guy uh what about ono because he was competing

3:21:29.040 --> 3:21:34.800
 in this olympics he got he got gold in this olympics right uh yeah yeah he lost in the

3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:39.200
 team tournament though i think he just didn't care yeah he just really wanted to throw that guy

3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:44.000
 he like throws everybody yeah so he's he represents the thing you're mentioning

3:21:44.800 --> 3:21:51.360
 i sent up to the judo fanatics best of uh ono is there something that stands out to you about him

3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:58.960
 that's especially you find beautiful like or powerful about his technique um his adaptability

3:21:58.960 --> 3:22:06.240
 to the situations and understanding of like what needs to happen in order to throw these people

3:22:06.240 --> 3:22:12.800
 um i specifically watched a match with his and i was going to do a breakdown video on it because

3:22:13.360 --> 3:22:21.440
 is there a match do you remember what it is it's him versus um garvey of hungry um is he good at

3:22:21.440 --> 3:22:27.280
 gripping so we're watching the match against hungry uh so at the one minute comes right here

3:22:27.280 --> 3:22:32.800
 coming up i've heard he's freakishly strong i've never had the ability to to train with him so i'm

3:22:32.800 --> 3:22:39.600
 not obviously looks super skinny but but when you see him without his gi jacket on like rather than

3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:45.520
 he's a jack dude which is uncharacteristic of a japanese player from back in the day

3:22:46.480 --> 3:22:50.400
 in a way changed all that he was like we're gonna get physical to compete with the europeans

3:22:50.400 --> 3:22:54.000
 that's another one of the greats right and yeah he doesn't get mentioned enough

3:22:54.000 --> 3:23:06.080
 and he's a righty here yeah okay and this is where he started setting it up

3:23:06.080 --> 3:23:09.600
 it's like you can see he was standing in like a left handed stance and then he changes

3:23:11.680 --> 3:23:19.200
 so he grips almost like a double uh uh double sleep not a double sleep but the tricep the tricep

3:23:19.200 --> 3:23:27.200
 and the the front sleeve standing like a lefty and no body grip just tricep and sleeve and

3:23:27.200 --> 3:23:34.160
 there was like the the biggest whip and twist of a of a new chimata yeah he doesn't actually lift him

3:23:34.160 --> 3:23:43.680
 off the floor yeah and if you look at it in like slow motion almost um yeah let's yeah there we go

3:23:43.680 --> 3:23:53.600
 um the hungarian player was like 100 defense and he still did this right so right here like

3:23:53.600 --> 3:24:00.480
 press pause this this is like and identify if you're trying to like learn you don't figure

3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:06.320
 out how to set it up because knowing how to get to the point right before you pull the triggers

3:24:06.320 --> 3:24:11.920
 probably the most important so when we watch this play out what ono is going to do is he's

3:24:11.920 --> 3:24:16.800
 going to pivot off his right leg right here he's going to back step with his left and it's going to

3:24:16.800 --> 3:24:22.160
 pull ungarvey's front leg all the way forward into what we would call like a neutral square stance

3:24:22.960 --> 3:24:28.560
 so he plants hard and look at an interesting pull with the oh no it's not tricep he almost

3:24:28.560 --> 3:24:32.800
 like he starts with the tricep and he like collects the gear something like that but it's

3:24:32.800 --> 3:24:38.400
 still above the elbow because you can see the bend right and right here see how he never put

3:24:38.400 --> 3:24:44.640
 back it up a little bit that this is kind of like one of those things yeah pause it right there

3:24:45.280 --> 3:24:51.520
 so when he puts his right foot down he's pulling so hard with his back that when ono goes to put

3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:58.000
 his left foot down it never touches the mat but by putting his left foot back it actually pulls

3:24:58.000 --> 3:25:03.360
 him garbys foot forward and so he's able to speed up his throw by just continuing that

3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:10.640
 motion back yeah which what was supposed to have been a step turned out to just in the middle of

3:25:10.640 --> 3:25:16.000
 the action he makes a split second decision before putting the foot down to just continue yeah because

3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:21.360
 he recognizes that feeling in his hands yeah and so it's like it never it's a swing like he never

3:25:21.360 --> 3:25:26.560
 touches the ground but it never it never started as like a big swing to a back step yeah he changed

3:25:26.560 --> 3:25:31.520
 his mind partway through so it's supposed to be a back step right yeah and then he goes nope

3:25:31.520 --> 3:25:36.800
 he's bringing that foot forward i'm just going to go for it and wait is he full like full air

3:25:37.600 --> 3:25:43.600
 look at that boom boom and look at if you go a few more steps forward right there his hip

3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:51.040
 is the same height as ungarvey shoulder yeah because he's leaning so far into the throw

3:25:51.040 --> 3:25:57.600
 with his body weight and he's allowing that tricep grip to rotate that's going to draw ungarvey

3:25:57.600 --> 3:26:05.360
 forward and now when you pause it right here you think about the sheer physics to like get your body

3:26:05.360 --> 3:26:11.520
 into this position jimmy and i were so like when we saw this for the first time we tried to just

3:26:11.520 --> 3:26:18.240
 stand like that and we couldn't do it his left foot is pointing straight ahead his chest is

3:26:18.240 --> 3:26:23.600
 perpendicular to that foot or parallel with it right and his head is by his foot yeah is that

3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:29.280
 only possible in the midst of a throw do you think he works on making like i think he's done this

3:26:29.280 --> 3:26:36.240
 particular throw not this style of it but uchimara so much yeah that his body has adapted to be able

3:26:36.240 --> 3:26:42.160
 to do this so when people are trying to learn and like break down videos yeah they don't understand

3:26:42.160 --> 3:26:50.640
 like the power he has and what we call end range motion yeah look at that so like look at the full

3:26:50.640 --> 3:26:57.760
 range of motion he takes right yeah that left foot swings all the way around and the torso starts

3:26:58.480 --> 3:27:05.360
 like at three o clock and it goes all the way around like almost back to the three o clock yeah

3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:10.000
 like a little bit like that what and he never lifts his leg above his hip

3:27:12.720 --> 3:27:18.320
 and the crazy part is he never fell over during any of it yeah look at that stayed on his feet

3:27:18.320 --> 3:27:27.280
 what's he doing is that is that a matter of pride or just i think that's just habit the way the

3:27:27.280 --> 3:27:33.760
 forces work like he can just stay up i that's one of the most beautiful throws i've ever seen

3:27:35.600 --> 3:27:41.120
 there's so much wrong with it but it worked it worked because when you think about remember

3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:44.880
 when we talked about the very beginning like he's got to get his center of gravity under his

3:27:44.880 --> 3:27:48.720
 wow well here's one of the top players in the world throwing another top player in the world

3:27:48.720 --> 3:27:57.120
 with his hip at that guy's shoulder height and it's still working it's okay so he this generation

3:27:57.120 --> 3:28:03.840
 he could be the great yeah and like he switched a lot of those details of the throw in the middle

3:28:03.840 --> 3:28:08.400
 in the middle and that that only is that means he's probably what like a hundred thousand times

3:28:08.400 --> 3:28:15.520
 that throws happen yeah i saw you went to chess recently so you're like me a bit of a beginner

3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:22.080
 in chess uh you're part of launching the website effective chess so i gotta ask maybe it's a

3:28:22.080 --> 3:28:26.960
 personal question but uh do you have advice to yourself and to other beginners in exploring

3:28:26.960 --> 3:28:33.840
 chess of how to one have fun and two to start getting good it's nice to see like olympic caliber

3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:43.600
 athlete take on a difficult task with a beginner's mind so like what's that process like i'm a huge

3:28:43.600 --> 3:28:51.920
 fan of just learning new things in general right like when i left judo like i took a job as you

3:28:51.920 --> 3:28:59.840
 know marketing for fuji sports and i was getting frustrated with designers so i learned photoshop

3:28:59.840 --> 3:29:04.080
 i also got angry with the photographers so now i take all the photos too

3:29:04.880 --> 3:29:11.760
 just because i don't mind learning you know i've spent my entire judo career learning all the time

3:29:11.760 --> 3:29:17.520
 like adding new techniques finding new ways practicing developing and so when it comes to

3:29:18.080 --> 3:29:24.720
 chess i treat it just like i do anything else i just stick to one plan and i learn all the ins and

3:29:24.720 --> 3:29:31.920
 outs of that one plan and then i develop another plan right like i'll my practice like a london

3:29:31.920 --> 3:29:37.520
 opening for example and just i don't even care if i win or lose i just want to figure out how i'm

3:29:37.520 --> 3:29:43.600
 gonna lose and then figure out how i'm gonna win and once i know that position is now done

3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:48.560
 then i start with another position and then once i figured out how i'm gonna lose and how

3:29:48.560 --> 3:29:54.000
 i'm gonna win the next thing i do is i don't go to a third i figure out the bridge between the two

3:29:55.120 --> 3:30:00.320
 like at what point during my openings can i transition back into this opening right so

3:30:00.320 --> 3:30:05.120
 like you have like some basic openings and you want to see how they go wrong how they go right

3:30:05.120 --> 3:30:10.000
 all the different ways and then that starts to solidify a higher level concept of that particular

3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:13.680
 opening and you start to stitch together the concepts the concepts together because being

3:30:13.680 --> 3:30:20.240
 able to go from one to another and then back and forth is part of the reasons why like i was

3:30:20.240 --> 3:30:27.520
 successful at judo is just because everything i do at some point it touches that spider web

3:30:27.520 --> 3:30:32.560
 of like being able to get from one area to another we refer to it as like a toolbox right you need

3:30:32.560 --> 3:30:37.040
 more tools in your toolbox but if you're always grabbing the wrong tool for the right for that

3:30:37.040 --> 3:30:43.120
 job then you're just not going to have success actually forgot to ask you mentioned a few greatest

3:30:43.120 --> 3:30:47.760
 chess players of all time and i noticed he didn't mention vladimir putin i'm gonna ask you about

3:30:49.760 --> 3:30:56.960
 his judo do you by chance know much about his judo what do you think about you know a president

3:30:56.960 --> 3:31:02.800
 of a major nation being a judo black belt and i think from what i've seen pretty good at it

3:31:03.920 --> 3:31:11.040
 i think it shows you know if he if he actually got it like let's let's go with that premise of

3:31:11.040 --> 3:31:20.800
 like he earned it right that just shows like a level of like physical persistence and mental

3:31:20.800 --> 3:31:27.680
 fortitude to be able to like you know take those beatings and just keep showing up until you've

3:31:27.680 --> 3:31:33.600
 overcome yeah and can now give those beatings as you know in japan and russia you get it by just

3:31:33.600 --> 3:31:38.240
 like when you're young it's easier to get a black belt when you're like just go through a bunch of

3:31:38.240 --> 3:31:46.800
 beatings for like 10 years in your in your teenage years but there's also from it springs like a

3:31:46.800 --> 3:31:53.440
 camaraderie like he there's a definitely a brotherhood and and sisterhood in terms of judo to where

3:31:53.440 --> 3:31:59.280
 you're you're connected forever because of that that for many people it's their childhood connection

3:31:59.280 --> 3:32:04.800
 you sort of leave judo you know in your 20s in your 30s but that's always there and the same is true

3:32:04.800 --> 3:32:13.360
 with wrestling so it's it's interesting to see him pay respect to that like by going with the with

3:32:13.360 --> 3:32:18.800
 the russian national judo team and i think you did obviously they they have to get thrown right

3:32:18.800 --> 3:32:23.680
 but just you can tell and you probably can tell even better but you can tell when a person moves

3:32:24.400 --> 3:32:30.880
 in a way where you're like okay you've had like 10 years of beatings and you can tell yeah the way

3:32:30.880 --> 3:32:38.320
 they pull the way they move yeah but i also like in contrast to the us national team or the i don't

3:32:38.320 --> 3:32:45.360
 even think there's a national team for us right it's it's the pager judo center right uh that

3:32:45.360 --> 3:32:50.160
 there is some it's really cool when there's a camaraderie like that amongst the highest level

3:32:50.160 --> 3:32:55.440
 olympic caliber athletes in russia i suppose japan might have similar kind of thing and and then you

3:32:55.440 --> 3:33:02.880
 have the you can have the system of people together and then you can have a strong coaching staff

3:33:02.880 --> 3:33:07.600
 not just like a coach but a coaching staff and you can have the nation backing that staff i mean

3:33:07.600 --> 3:33:11.840
 yeah and then the result is like you have some incredible level of judo emerge

3:33:13.920 --> 3:33:17.680
 is there something you could say we didn't we didn't talk much about jimmy i mean

3:33:17.680 --> 3:33:25.600
 i mean he was a critical part of your just like of your perseverance through all the all that

3:33:25.600 --> 3:33:31.600
 you had to go through um what did you learn from jimmy what are some impacts that he had on your

3:33:31.600 --> 3:33:40.640
 life both on the mat and off the mat you know if we had to like put it down to like a very simple

3:33:40.640 --> 3:33:49.280
 thing he taught me how to win right it wasn't necessarily like the technical side of judo

3:33:49.280 --> 3:33:55.600
 like we went over gripping we went over this we adapted that but the real strength to jimmy was

3:33:55.600 --> 3:34:02.880
 like he knows how to win and most people think well if i get really good at this technique

3:34:02.880 --> 3:34:11.040
 i'll be able to throw people with it not win that is not how the world of sports works right like i

3:34:11.680 --> 3:34:17.360
 remember in one of my youtube videos i was doing a breakdown of a match from the cuba grand prix

3:34:17.360 --> 3:34:22.880
 where i was fighting a mongolian guy he's kicking the shit at me i'm not gonna lie four minutes in

3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:30.000
 like he was just throwing me like left and right he was so fast i felt like i just couldn't get to him

3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:38.640
 in the last 30 seconds he changed he started protecting his lead instead of continuing the

3:34:38.640 --> 3:34:43.360
 fight the way the entire match was going in his favor he made a mental shift and when he made

3:34:43.360 --> 3:34:50.720
 that mental shift i beat him yeah because he didn't know how to win the fight he can win

3:34:50.720 --> 3:34:58.240
 exchanges but he can't win the fight so the last thing you want to do is have to win every exchange

3:34:58.240 --> 3:35:06.480
 in a match you want to know how to kick it into sixth gear like when to step off the gas when to

3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:13.280
 focus on gripping when to attack how often to attack all those things like and you've had those

3:35:13.280 --> 3:35:17.760
 conversations with jimmy like this is not like how to stop trying to win every exchange that

3:35:17.760 --> 3:35:22.480
 kind of thing yeah and instead because i was a brawler before i was like i threw you once i'm

3:35:22.480 --> 3:35:28.960
 throwing you again yeah and sometimes you get caught yeah why would i do that i'm already winning what

3:35:28.960 --> 3:35:33.360
 about like the mental side of the game the preparation all those things one of the biggest

3:35:33.360 --> 3:35:39.040
 things jimmy brought to the forefront when it came to like the mental side was the visualization

3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:46.640
 right and when i started visualizing myself winning i started seeing more success but

3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:53.440
 once i started seeing more success with the visualization also came self doubt because

3:35:53.440 --> 3:36:01.360
 as i'm starting to picture myself like i would picture myself before fighting church's villi

3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:07.280
 i'm gonna throw him with goshiguruma and i can see it and if i stand in the shoot for too long

3:36:08.240 --> 3:36:14.480
 you start to like but what if he counters then you go well if he counters with this

3:36:14.480 --> 3:36:19.200
 i'm gonna counter with that but you already let that doubt in and then you start playing this

3:36:19.200 --> 3:36:24.400
 like five step scenario but you still come out on top but all that doubt has like seeped into your

3:36:24.400 --> 3:36:32.720
 mind right and a lot of people don't understand that that's a bad thing you're still winning in

3:36:32.720 --> 3:36:38.080
 your mind but you're also doubting yourself in your mind yeah once you let the like that little

3:36:38.080 --> 3:36:44.800
 slip in it's uh it's destructive yeah and so i remember i was at the world championships i can't

3:36:44.800 --> 3:36:51.600
 remember what year it was but i was ready like i was healthy i was ready to go and we all thought

3:36:51.600 --> 3:36:58.560
 like this is the year travis wins the worlds i go out there in the first round i'm in the shoot for

3:36:58.560 --> 3:37:04.880
 like 45 minutes like the match went into golden score then the next match went into golden score

3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:09.520
 and the fucking next match went into golden score then the referee came and told me you can't wear

3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:14.640
 your gi then big jim goes why can't he wear his gi any gi that has his name on it we're not going

3:37:14.640 --> 3:37:19.280
 to let him wear he has to wear a different gi so then i go fuck you i'm leaving and i walked out

3:37:19.280 --> 3:37:23.680
 there and i fought i lost in golden score because i did a coachy and they called it a false attack

3:37:23.680 --> 3:37:30.480
 and i went great i'm out of the fucking worlds but when i was in the shoot i struggled because

3:37:30.480 --> 3:37:37.200
 i started allowing the like hungarian guy that i was gonna face to do things to me that i would

3:37:37.200 --> 3:37:43.600
 have to play defense to and then counter it's like great but now i'm doubting my own ability

3:37:43.600 --> 3:37:50.880
 so i went to a sports psychologist and the big game changer for me was i focused more on the

3:37:51.440 --> 3:37:58.640
 emotional physical response that happens in matches rather than the actual you know quote

3:37:58.640 --> 3:38:03.920
 unquote like instagram picture that would have happened yeah so when i was getting ready for

3:38:03.920 --> 3:38:11.040
 2016 you think about like how do you feel like standing in the shoot like what does your body

3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:16.160
 feel like is your heart racing how's your breath is your mouth dry and then you think about like

3:38:16.160 --> 3:38:20.560
 okay the ref just started the match what happens like how what's the atmosphere like how do you

3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:27.120
 emotionally respond to these things more so than me trying to beat a specific judo player

3:38:27.120 --> 3:38:32.160
 right like oh the ref just gave you a penalty at a minute 30 like how do you feel

3:38:33.200 --> 3:38:36.960
 and then you start thinking about the physical responses and when you do that really well

3:38:37.600 --> 3:38:41.440
 you can actually get the pins and needles and your body will start to sweat and your heart

3:38:41.440 --> 3:38:48.480
 will start to race as if you're in it because it's not about the technique it's more about the

3:38:48.480 --> 3:38:53.440
 physical like what does it feel like to have your fingers ripped out of a gi in the first exchange

3:38:53.440 --> 3:39:00.160
 now my hands can feel that that's fascinating and then on a cellular level like i fought the

3:39:00.160 --> 3:39:06.480
 olympic game so many times to the point where like it is no longer a goal it's an anticipation

3:39:06.480 --> 3:39:12.800
 right so down to the experience of the grip break that just the sweat the the heart beating the yeah

3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:17.600
 does it feel to have your head smashed into a mat and driven across the mat with a mat burn

3:39:17.600 --> 3:39:23.200
 yeah and then getting about that yeah and getting back up yeah like with a bit of a burn

3:39:23.200 --> 3:39:28.480
 all the kinds of actual sensations and the actual sensation of what it takes to fight it you don't

3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:34.560
 match not a strategy like but the actual sensations experience that's fascinating because then your

3:39:34.560 --> 3:39:39.920
 body's gonna fight hundreds of matches without the physical damage and you could probably get

3:39:39.920 --> 3:39:47.760
 really far with that and not also in just judo but basically anything you can simulate yeah if you

3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:57.040
 learn how to simulate well you've lived a very uh a hell of a life is there advice you can give to

3:39:57.040 --> 3:40:04.560
 young people instead of high school college you know thinking about their career thinking about life

3:40:05.120 --> 3:40:06.560
 how to live one they're proud of

3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:18.800
 I think the the number one thing I can tell people is and how I've lived my life is you've

3:40:18.800 --> 3:40:23.200
 really got to like forget everybody in your life right now your mother your father your

3:40:23.200 --> 3:40:28.800
 grandparents your girlfriend your boyfriend whoever it is and really decide like what is

3:40:28.800 --> 3:40:37.280
 gonna make you happy right at some point in my career the act of pushing my body to the limit

3:40:38.160 --> 3:40:46.960
 made me happier than winning a grand slam medal pushing my body to the limit didn't make me happier

3:40:46.960 --> 3:40:54.000
 than winning an olympic medal right there was a there's a balance there and I think a lot of

3:40:54.000 --> 3:41:00.720
 people struggle with living their life where they're happy and they make other people happy or take

3:41:00.720 --> 3:41:07.680
 in their their feelings into the considerations of what they need to do in their life and I think

3:41:07.680 --> 3:41:14.720
 if they can cut those strings sooner it'll allow you to get over it quicker and get to a happier

3:41:14.720 --> 3:41:20.880
 place sooner and then as long as you're focusing on what's making you happy the things you do that

3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:27.040
 make you happy will attract other people who do those things that will in turn build stronger

3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:35.280
 better relationships and then you will also realize the the best form of yourself and inspire many

3:41:35.280 --> 3:41:44.000
 others like yeah you've inspired me to uh whatever the hell I've done uh at least to do a slightly

3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:49.520
 better job than I otherwise would have by doing martial arts by taking that uh journey and I think

3:41:49.520 --> 3:41:56.160
 becoming a better person because of it so Travis I have been I continue to be uh one of your biggest
