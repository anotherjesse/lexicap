 The following is a conversation with Mark Normand, a New York comedian who has a way

00:04.640 --> 00:10.800
 with words that is often both dark and hilarious. Let there be a warning, dear friends, to proceed

00:10.800 --> 00:17.760
 with caution and to wear protection. You may, in fact, need it. He has a special on his YouTube

00:17.760 --> 00:24.400
 called Out to Lunch and a new special on Netflix as part of the Stand Up Season 3 series I recommend

00:24.400 --> 00:30.400
 you watch. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in

00:30.400 --> 00:37.520
 the description. And now, here's my conversation with Mark Normand. I asked Tim Dillon about

00:37.520 --> 00:42.320
 Bukowski first, so let me continue on that tradition and ask you about something that

00:42.320 --> 00:48.960
 Charles Bukowski said about love. Are we rolling? Yes. Oh geez, no hello, no nothing. Nope. I thought

00:48.960 --> 00:56.560
 I was robotic. Bukowski said love is a fog that burns away with the first daylight of reality.

00:57.120 --> 01:03.360
 So Mark Normand, let me first ask you about love. What are your thoughts about love? You talk about

01:03.360 --> 01:10.960
 your relationship quite a bit. Do you think love can last? I do, but I think it's work. Everybody

01:10.960 --> 01:19.280
 wants love to be this prepackaged, perfect, euphoric thing, but it's like a good body.

01:20.080 --> 01:24.560
 We're all born with a good body, but you got to keep it in shape and it's the same with a loving

01:24.560 --> 01:30.720
 relationship. I think you, nobody wants to do the work. That's the problem. You talked about,

01:31.280 --> 01:35.920
 I think you told a story about being unfaithful to a previous girlfriend or something like that.

01:35.920 --> 01:42.400
 I think the story goes that you were like drifting apart. Who are you talking to? Bert

01:42.400 --> 01:46.800
 Kreischer maybe or something like that? Yeah, we were high school sweethearts dated for like

01:46.800 --> 01:52.080
 12 years and then. So that wasn't love anymore. That was more like a relationship. It was comfort,

01:52.080 --> 02:00.480
 it was routine and we just slipped into that kind of married life autopilot world and I tried to

02:00.480 --> 02:06.720
 break up I think and it didn't take. It was one of those things. Our lives are just so baked in

02:07.360 --> 02:12.880
 and then I think I cheated and she caught me and it was ugly and then we went to therapy to try

02:12.880 --> 02:17.680
 to work it out, but it's much like a car that gets into a wreck. The door just never closed the

02:17.680 --> 02:24.320
 same. You know what I mean? Yeah. So what are your thoughts about the commitment like outside of

02:24.320 --> 02:30.800
 love marriage? I think it's an antiquated idea. I think it's kind of silly and unrealistic and I

02:30.800 --> 02:35.440
 think we're coming out of that as we get all polyamorous and non binary and queefy and all

02:35.440 --> 02:40.400
 this stuff. I think we're slowly moving away from that, but I think a lot of the ladies

02:41.280 --> 02:48.320
 more majority women like marriage like the idea of it. Like I'm a fiance now or whatever you call

02:48.320 --> 02:56.400
 it. I'm gauged and I mean she is just going hog wild. She's loving it. She's got the dress thing,

02:56.400 --> 03:02.720
 pick a venue, flower and she's deep in whereas I feel guilty because I'm just like, oh geez.

03:04.560 --> 03:08.320
 Is it planned already? What's the wedding? It's a squid game. I'm just living life.

03:10.320 --> 03:16.800
 It's planned. It's in New Orleans. I'm from there and it's next year. Are you married?

03:16.800 --> 03:22.000
 No, single. Virgin? Of course, yeah. I can't imagine. I bet you'd be great in bed. You're

03:22.000 --> 03:27.680
 ripped. Best hairline in podcasts. Yeah, I don't know. I haven't tried yet, so we'll have to see.

03:27.680 --> 03:32.800
 All right. Well, let me know. Pretty big hog on you. Yeah, I could see you packing a crazy,

03:33.680 --> 03:39.840
 crazy tool downtown. That matters to girls? Apparently, yeah. That's all I hear about.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.880
 Okay. New Orleans. You grew up in New Orleans? Yeah. Born and raised.

03:44.880 --> 03:51.760
 Tremay, outside the French Quarter. Ever been? Yeah. Don't remember it. Oh, you drink? Yeah,

03:51.760 --> 03:56.560
 I drink. Of course, I drink. I don't know. I can't tell if you have fun. No, not really, but Russian.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.800
 I mean, Russian, of course, I drink vodka, all that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah. I don't know.

04:01.840 --> 04:07.280
 Beer was just labeled an alcoholic beverage in 2011. Fun fact. What do you mean? In Russia.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.880
 It was just drinks. It was just like apple juice before. It finally got declared legally as an

04:12.880 --> 04:19.840
 alcoholic beverage. Which means you can regulate it, that kind of thing. I guess so. Yeah. See,

04:19.840 --> 04:23.200
 that's where your brain goes. Yeah. I just go all these fucking Ruskies. I didn't even know

04:23.200 --> 04:27.760
 there's rules about drinking. It's good. I'm learning about Russia from you. So,

04:28.640 --> 04:36.480
 what's the difficult memory experience from childhood in New Orleans that made you the man

04:36.480 --> 04:44.960
 you are today? I don't know if it made me the man, but jeez, I had a lot of scuffles in the

04:44.960 --> 04:50.400
 neighborhood with I was the white kid in the neighborhood. So, I was automatically the odd

04:50.400 --> 04:56.720
 man out, the minority, the weirdo, the dork, the dweeb, the honky. So, just a lot of memories of

04:57.840 --> 05:02.640
 getting slapped in the face by guys and just having to take it because there's like five guys there

05:02.640 --> 05:06.080
 and they'd be like, oh, look, you don't even fight back. And you're like, what am I going to do?

05:06.080 --> 05:12.080
 Hit you and then get beat up by these guys. So, a lot of that stuff was a big bummer growing up,

05:12.080 --> 05:17.840
 got robbed all the time, lost a lot of bicycles, had a bicycle taken from under me. That was pretty

05:17.840 --> 05:26.960
 brutal. These kids pulled up, you know, they're like 17 and I was 13 and I had a face paint on,

05:26.960 --> 05:32.400
 like I had a not black face, but I was at a summer camp and I had a rainbow face painted on me. We

05:32.400 --> 05:38.160
 were helping kids that day. So, I let them put paint on me. And so, now I'm riding home. What a

05:38.160 --> 05:43.600
 mark. What a goober I am. I'm riding home and these guys see me a mile away. I'm a sitting duck

05:43.600 --> 05:48.000
 and they go, we can take his bike. He's got a fucking rainbow on his cheek. So, they just go,

05:48.000 --> 05:52.960
 hey, you know, like cut in front of you. They go, let me try your bike. I go, I'm good. I'm good.

05:52.960 --> 05:57.440
 I knew what they wanted. And they go, let me try the bike and then just push me and took the bike.

05:57.440 --> 06:03.600
 The stuff like that was really shaping the insecurity, the self worth.

06:05.600 --> 06:09.280
 They did. Because I've been mugged when I was younger too.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.600
 Really? Yeah. It changes your view of human nature a little bit.

06:13.600 --> 06:17.200
 For sure. You go, wow, I didn't know people could be this mean. It's cool.

06:18.160 --> 06:23.120
 Inconsiderate. I'm always worried about it. Did I fart too much? Am I annoying? Am I pissing this

06:23.120 --> 06:29.120
 guy off? But what a way to live. I want the bike. I'm taking it. Fuck his feelings.

06:30.000 --> 06:36.080
 For me, that quickly turned into realizing that that's just a temporary phase that those folks

06:36.080 --> 06:43.760
 are in. They have a capacity to be good. For some reason, for me, that was a motivation to see,

06:43.760 --> 06:50.800
 can we discover, can we incentivize them to find a better path in life? I wasn't all like,

06:50.800 --> 06:55.680
 I don't know, Gandhi about it. Of course, I was pissing all those kinds of things, but

06:56.800 --> 07:03.280
 I don't know. It seemed like just the kind of thing you might do when you're younger.

07:03.280 --> 07:10.640
 You hope. But this is adult crime, obviously. Yeah, I know. But yeah, exactly. And then it solidifies

07:10.640 --> 07:16.160
 and then you're beyond saving at some point. But it's like, there's always an opportunity to

07:16.160 --> 07:22.320
 make a better life for yourself, to become a better version of yourself.

07:22.880 --> 07:27.360
 Yeah. And I remember coming home crying with no bike. And my mom, my parents are like,

07:28.080 --> 07:32.960
 liberal to a fault where they were like, oh, well, they need it. They're poor kids in the

07:32.960 --> 07:38.480
 neighborhood. You're like, all right. But I also have a bicycle that I ride around. And I also

07:38.480 --> 07:44.880
 like to live in an area that's not just riddled with theft and vandalism, but they were just like,

07:44.880 --> 07:49.120
 ah, they need it. And then it was a moot point, we just moved on. So I remember very young being

07:49.120 --> 07:56.400
 like, all right, I got to figure my shit out. Okay. So you said you were beat up quite a bit,

07:56.400 --> 08:00.160
 like bullying and stuff pushed around. I was never hospitalized or anything. But you know,

08:00.160 --> 08:04.960
 you get a black guy here and there and a bloody nose, stuff like that. And it was just the out

08:04.960 --> 08:10.080
 numbered thing. The violence didn't really bother me because you're just kids, you're boys. Yeah.

08:10.080 --> 08:17.760
 But it was the predatory, let's get them. We can take him down. He's an easy target.

08:17.760 --> 08:24.800
 That's what kills you, the mental part. Yeah. Until you actually said I didn't realize,

08:24.800 --> 08:30.880
 because I've been in what do you call them, scuffles. And there was just one that stands

08:30.880 --> 08:36.480
 out to me where, yeah. Let's hear it, Fatty. Bring it on. And you do jujitsu and all that stuff,

08:36.480 --> 08:41.760
 right? Yeah, I can see the guns through the suit. You're like John Wick. All right. Well,

08:41.760 --> 08:45.520
 I used to have, now you're going to start making fun of me. I used to have long hair for like a

08:45.520 --> 08:48.960
 couple of years. I was in a band playing music and stuff like that. And there was,

08:50.320 --> 08:54.080
 like most of the fights I've been in were basically one on one, maybe a little bit like,

08:54.880 --> 09:02.320
 a little extra stuff, but not outnumbered. And this one particular time, I've learned a lot

09:02.320 --> 09:07.200
 of lessons, but one of them was, there was a fight started between me and this other person.

09:08.080 --> 09:13.600
 And then his buddies, I guess, were there. Uh oh. And they, as opposed to like breaking

09:13.600 --> 09:20.880
 it up or letting it happen, one of them grabbed my hair. It's the first time anybody grabbed,

09:20.880 --> 09:25.200
 like used it in my hair in a fight, which I haven't since then realized that that's actually

09:25.200 --> 09:28.960
 a really powerful grip and a powerful weapon. Oh yeah. Oh, very vulnerable of you.

09:28.960 --> 09:33.520
 And then my head got pulled back and they pulled me down to the ground. Like I couldn't do anything.

09:33.520 --> 09:38.880
 It was so, I remember being exceptionally frustrated. Yes. That was the feeling like,

09:38.880 --> 09:44.240
 I can't do anything here. I'm like trapped. And then they, there was just like kicking me and

09:44.240 --> 09:50.160
 hitting me and stuff like that. And the outnumbered part of it, because I always kind of remember

09:50.160 --> 09:56.880
 the trapped part because I just hated from a fighting grappling perspective how like,

09:56.880 --> 10:02.240
 the feeling was this isn't fair. Yes. That's what it is. It's a deep, deep unfairness. Yeah.

10:02.240 --> 10:06.720
 That you just can't, you can't win. The mob wins. Yeah. The mob wins.

10:06.720 --> 10:10.640
 Scary stuff. And, but it makes a, makes a man out of you in a weird way that builds character.

10:10.640 --> 10:15.840
 You realize life isn't fair early and you, you go on from there. So it's something there. And

10:15.840 --> 10:20.000
 look at you today. They're probably, you know, eating out of a dumpster at a Krispy Kreme and

10:20.000 --> 10:26.560
 you're here, got eight podcasts. You're doing great. You're talking to giant Titans of the industry.

10:26.560 --> 10:30.720
 No, I, I do remember returning home that night. I mean that, you said you were crying.

10:31.440 --> 10:36.000
 That's really formative. Like, that's the point in which you get to decide, what do I make of

10:36.000 --> 10:41.440
 this moment? I mean, especially when you're younger, maybe it's not presented to you that way. But like,

10:41.440 --> 10:47.600
 some of the greatest people in history were bullied in these kinds of ways. And they made

10:47.600 --> 10:51.680
 something of themselves in this moment, like bullied by life in some kind of way. It's,

10:51.680 --> 10:58.400
 it's like an opportunity for growth. It's weird, but like hardship even in small doses is like

10:58.400 --> 11:02.480
 an opportunity for growth. Totally. I mean, look at Richard Pryor. They say he's labeled as the

11:02.480 --> 11:07.120
 best comedian of all time, grew up in a whorehouse, watch his mom get plowed by these guys in the,

11:07.120 --> 11:13.440
 in the middle of Indiana, I want to say. And just who had a harder life. He would suck dick for

11:13.440 --> 11:20.720
 drugs, all this stuff growing up, beat up. And then the weird thing is, oops, sorry, that's my

11:20.720 --> 11:25.600
 birth control alarm. And then the, the whole world is like trying to get rid of bullying.

11:25.600 --> 11:29.840
 But we still do bullying, but now it's accepted bullying. It's very strange.

11:29.840 --> 11:33.360
 So you're, you're a proponent of beating kids up? Is that what you're saying?

11:33.360 --> 11:41.600
 Yes. And sex with them. All right. But no, I just think it's part of life and it's horrible. It's

11:41.600 --> 11:46.480
 like rain. You got to have it. Look, a rainy day is a bummer, you know, but you need it. And I think

11:46.480 --> 11:52.960
 it's similar to that. What was your relationship like with your, your mom, your dad? Well,

11:52.960 --> 11:55.840
 what are some memorable moments with them? What did you learn from them?

11:55.840 --> 12:05.040
 Good parents, the giving thoughtful, a little out to lunch, you know, they were workaholics. So

12:05.040 --> 12:10.640
 that was, it was hard to get a lot out of them. And my dad was kind of an angry dad. I think he

12:10.640 --> 12:15.760
 just had like a weird childhood and he's just trying to make it and he's trying to provide,

12:15.760 --> 12:19.760
 but it's hard. And we live in this horrible neighborhood and we're getting robbed all the

12:19.760 --> 12:25.920
 time. So life was kind of coming down on him all the time. So then he'll take it out on you or

12:25.920 --> 12:33.200
 whoever he would snap. But great parents, they cared, they put us first. But there wasn't a lot of,

12:34.960 --> 12:37.920
 I don't know, you see, you never go to a friend's house as a kid and there's like a

12:37.920 --> 12:42.480
 picture of a ski trip and you're like, ski trip. What the hell is that about? You know,

12:42.480 --> 12:48.320
 it was a lot of that and smart, very smart people, but I don't know how well they were at

12:48.320 --> 12:52.720
 socializing. So you never like bonded with them like in a deep human level?

12:52.720 --> 12:59.200
 Some body, but rarely deep. Yeah, it was just almost co worker. It cold out. Huh?

12:59.200 --> 13:03.680
 What? It's cold out, huh? Oh yeah, like that kind of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, gotcha.

13:03.680 --> 13:08.240
 Get there a little bit, but it, my parents are done. I hope they never do this. But they would do

13:08.240 --> 13:13.280
 a thing where my dad especially would do a thing where he would, uh, he knew how to cut you down

13:13.280 --> 13:16.880
 right to the bone. And so after a while, you're like, I'm not even going to interact with this

13:16.880 --> 13:22.160
 guy because he, he can get you so well. One time we were at a, uh, like a Thanksgiving,

13:22.160 --> 13:26.640
 some kind of family of event and all the cousins are there. And I remember I was holding court.

13:26.640 --> 13:33.520
 I was a young boy finding my comedic legs in this weird tumultuous sea we call a family

13:33.520 --> 13:38.800
 and I was killing and, um, my dad comes out when he goes, what are you holding court?

13:39.440 --> 13:44.880
 And I was like, ah, and I felt like I was this big. I just shrunk down. He just nailed it

13:44.880 --> 13:48.000
 because in my head I'm like, I'm holding court. Look at me. I got the whole room and he goes,

13:48.000 --> 13:52.240
 what are you, what are you holding court here? Who the hell do you think you are? And I was like,

13:52.240 --> 13:55.840
 he's right. I shouldn't be holding court. Who the fuck am I? I'm nobody. So, uh,

13:56.480 --> 14:00.640
 stuff like that. Was he aware that you think he wasn't? He wasn't. I don't think he was, but

14:00.640 --> 14:07.840
 do you, do you give, um, parents a pass when they're unaware of the destructive? Like,

14:07.840 --> 14:11.840
 is it better when they're unaware? Cause it seems like that's the way that's true. That's

14:11.840 --> 14:19.200
 way the way parents often fail is they're not intentionally malevolent. They're just like

14:19.200 --> 14:24.480
 coolest. Yeah. It's a bittersweet thing. Cause you're like, okay, he's not malicious. He's not

14:24.480 --> 14:31.200
 trying to hurt me, but also he doesn't know he hurt me. I don't know. It's, it's tough. Cause

14:31.200 --> 14:38.080
 if he was trying to hurt you, I guess that would be worse. So you're the fully baked Mark

14:38.080 --> 14:46.800
 Norman cake at this point. Uh, what do you, uh, fruit salad, you know, the sense of self worth

14:46.800 --> 14:54.080
 you mentioned. I think in your comedy, there's a sense like you hate yourself. You think? I

14:54.080 --> 14:58.640
 didn't know if that came through. Shit. I was trying to hide that part. God damn it. I mean,

14:58.640 --> 15:06.080
 when you like in the privacy of your mind, are you able to love yourself or is it mostly self

15:06.080 --> 15:11.840
 hate? What happened to this podcast? I didn't know it was on a Mr. or Dr. Phil. Dr. Phil. I thought

15:11.840 --> 15:19.040
 we were going to talk about engineering and climate change and rockets. Uh, okay. Starts with love

15:19.040 --> 15:25.680
 goes to rockets. All right. I like that. I like that's a t shirt. Um, I mean, like, what's the

15:25.680 --> 15:32.640
 question? Sorry. Do I feel love? No, no, no, like, uh, yeah, yeah. So are you, um,

15:34.720 --> 15:41.440
 like this engine of being self critical of just being constantly anxious about how the world

15:41.440 --> 15:47.120
 perceives you, these kinds of things. Is this something that you just go to for, for comedy?

15:47.120 --> 15:52.880
 Or is this who you are as a human being? I think I, I don't want to explore it. I think I get

15:52.880 --> 15:58.000
 around it. You know, I tap dance around it, but I get it out a little with my act, maybe, because

15:58.000 --> 16:04.240
 I, I can't do it. I'm not doing it in real life. So I'll get out this, uh, no love, not loving

16:04.240 --> 16:07.360
 myself. I don't know who wants to love themself. Everybody always like, you got to love yourself.

16:07.360 --> 16:10.480
 And then when you meet somebody who does love yourself, you're like, I fucking hate this guy.

16:11.120 --> 16:15.520
 Don't you hate the guy who's upset? I'm great. I'm awesome. Life is good. You're like, ah,

16:15.520 --> 16:20.400
 this guy sucks. I'd rather an insecure guy. So maybe I want to stay insecure. Maybe I don't want

16:20.400 --> 16:27.840
 to find this love for myself. Well, okay. So self love, like just appreciating who you are or

16:27.840 --> 16:33.040
 like appreciating the moment of being grateful doesn't have to express itself by the guy saying,

16:33.680 --> 16:38.240
 I'm awesome. True. It's more just like humility. He's just like walking calmly through the world

16:38.240 --> 16:43.520
 and just being grateful to be alive, that kind of thing. And just, and like, oh, being appreciative

16:43.520 --> 16:49.040
 of all the accomplishments he made so far. I say all this because mostly I'm extremely self critical

16:49.040 --> 16:56.320
 and everything I do. And so, um, and I kind of enjoy it. I think it's a nice little engine that

16:56.320 --> 17:00.640
 it makes it fun. It makes life fun. Cause it's like, if you hate everything you do,

17:01.920 --> 17:07.520
 like you've done in the past, that gives you like, all right, we can do better. Yes. But

17:07.520 --> 17:11.360
 that's the key is making itself critical. Always trying to get better. I could change this. I could

17:11.360 --> 17:15.920
 tweak this. I could improve this. When you just go, I hate that I do this. I suck. You just shut

17:15.920 --> 17:21.520
 down. So that's the key is, is always being productive with the, with the criticism. Yeah.

17:21.520 --> 17:25.920
 And the basics of life, I'm just like grateful for it to be alive. That's nice to be a couple,

17:25.920 --> 17:32.800
 like couple of that with two legs. Again, the hairline, the hog, the muscles, the world,

17:32.800 --> 17:37.200
 you got a good brain on you. I mean, you're, you're lucky. You're in the top. You know,

17:37.200 --> 17:41.680
 most people are fat as shit at Burger King right now, hitting their kids. You're in a,

17:41.680 --> 17:48.080
 you're in a Ramada hotel sitting with a, you know, a low level comedian. For the record,

17:48.080 --> 17:52.880
 I ate McDonald's last night. All right. Well, you're human. Well, just so you know,

17:53.440 --> 17:57.920
 this is not me defending. I'm not sponsored by McDonald's, but I mostly eat meat and there's

17:57.920 --> 18:03.840
 nothing wrong with the, the beef they have. It's actually one of the easiest ways late at night.

18:03.840 --> 18:08.240
 I think it's two worse. I don't know if it's actually. It's, it's actually rats. Yeah, you're

18:08.240 --> 18:13.840
 right. But hey, it's just meat. I'm a meat guy myself. They say in 20 years, we're going to

18:13.840 --> 18:17.680
 look back and go, uh, can you believe people ate meat? It's going to be like slavery.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.480
 Yeah. There's some mythical, difficult things with factory farming.

18:22.480 --> 18:27.200
 Yeah. So let's ride it out now. We still got it. And now it's on record.

18:28.720 --> 18:32.160
 Tom Waits says something about New York. You like Tom Waits?

18:32.160 --> 18:35.760
 I think he's underrated. I think he's got great, he's got a great, uh,

18:35.760 --> 18:41.040
 he's great equips and quotes. Check him out on YouTube. He's got some montages and

18:41.040 --> 18:44.640
 supercuts of him being hilarious. What does he say about, um,

18:46.800 --> 18:50.240
 I'd rather have a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy.

18:50.240 --> 18:53.440
 That was the one. That was the one that sold me. I was like, this guy's awesome.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.800
 Yeah. But his music, cause he's just a genius musician.

18:56.800 --> 19:01.520
 Yeah. Anyway, he was talking about New York. I was walking around these, I'm in New York right

19:01.520 --> 19:05.920
 now. We're in New York right now. It's still a magical city to me. A lot of people are quite

19:05.920 --> 19:12.240
 cynical about it, about the state of things, but not, not like Michael Malis, like a lot of friends

19:12.240 --> 19:16.320
 of mine. They're just a lot of folks in San Francisco, New York, there's something about

19:16.320 --> 19:20.800
 the pandemic where people have become quite cynical about the place they are and they tried

19:20.800 --> 19:25.280
 to escape. It's interesting. I mean, they're asking some difficult questions about what they are in

19:25.280 --> 19:31.120
 life. They're having like a self impose midlife crisis is good, I think for everybody to go

19:31.120 --> 19:36.000
 through this process, but I think, I hope New York reemerges. It will.

19:36.000 --> 19:41.040
 As the flourishing place for the weirdos. Anyway, the Tom Wade said, New York, of course,

19:41.760 --> 19:49.040
 is to be in endless surreal situations where a $50,000 gunmetal Mercedes pulls up in a

19:49.040 --> 19:56.240
 puddle of blood and outsteps a 25 karat blonde with a $2 wrist watch. And he goes, he keeps

19:56.240 --> 20:03.360
 going on. So like it's like, that's like bars. He's like a rap. Yeah, he's good. But basically,

20:03.360 --> 20:12.720
 just the absurdity of it all, lots of money, lots of weirdos, degenerates and dreamers and the whole,

20:12.720 --> 20:18.480
 the whole mix of it. Do you think, do you think that's an accurate description of what New York

20:18.480 --> 20:23.840
 is today? Like, is there still place for the weirdos and just the interesting artists,

20:23.840 --> 20:32.800
 the, the edgy, the comedians, the, the creators, the, the, the, the entrepreneur is like,

20:33.520 --> 20:40.320
 as opposed to like Wall Street, as opposed to like rich folk and then like hopeless folk.

20:40.320 --> 20:45.200
 Yeah, I think it's definitely changed a lot. There's a, there's a tiny corner for us weirdo

20:45.200 --> 20:50.240
 artists. New York used to be where you went to make it as a painter or whatever, a comedian or a

20:50.240 --> 20:55.040
 singer. And there were all these dives and shit boxes and all these places you could go. And now

20:55.040 --> 21:01.520
 there's now it's more pink berries and subway sandwiches and Chase Banks. So it's definitely

21:01.520 --> 21:06.320
 lost a lot of its creative edge. It's just money, money keeps coming in. And now you see all these

21:06.320 --> 21:13.040
 comedians move to Nashville, Austin, Denver, whatever. So it doesn't have the, the power it

21:13.040 --> 21:19.040
 used to have of like, you got to be here. If you want to make it, that's definitely gone. So that

21:19.040 --> 21:24.800
 hurt the city a lot. The city is, is way more soulless. When I moved here in 07, I mean, not

21:24.800 --> 21:31.440
 only did I get mugged three times in the first year, but it was a hub of like, it felt like

21:31.440 --> 21:34.880
 things were happening here. You know, it was, it was an energy. It was an electricity. And we

21:34.880 --> 21:39.200
 still have the electricity, but it's also maybe just cause it's Times Square. There's Soho. There's

21:39.200 --> 21:45.120
 a Wall Street. So we got the staples, but there is a little bit of that. It's almost like a marriage.

21:45.120 --> 21:50.400
 Like, yeah, we're in love, but it's not as passionate as it once was. That's how I would equate New

21:50.400 --> 21:56.240
 York. What gives you hope? You're pretty hopeful about it though. I'm hopeful just because I know

21:56.240 --> 22:01.440
 it's magical. And I, and I think it has to be, I mean, it's the epicenter of America. Like,

22:01.440 --> 22:06.800
 this is where the immigrants came. And this is where the stock market is. And the entertainment

22:06.800 --> 22:12.800
 industry, a lot of it is here. So I think it's, it's going to happen, but it's something like

22:12.800 --> 22:17.040
 the bottom has to fall out. And then people have to move back here and all that. So something,

22:17.600 --> 22:20.640
 the corporations are kind of fucking us. They're just buying everything.

22:20.640 --> 22:25.600
 Well, that's true for everything. It's true for Austin probably as well. People are just buying

22:25.600 --> 22:29.440
 out land and all that kind of stuff. You always hear a Hemingway and Dolly and all these guys

22:29.440 --> 22:35.600
 went to Paris in the 20s or whatever that was. Yeah, I get it now. I feel like, why do these

22:35.600 --> 22:39.360
 guys go to Paris? You know, why are these artists? And now I get it because it's like,

22:39.360 --> 22:44.000
 it's freer there. That's why Austin became like that Paris, where everybody's like,

22:44.000 --> 22:50.480
 I got to get out of LA. I'm going there. And maybe, but we came back from that, you know,

22:50.480 --> 22:55.760
 the seventies were wild and nineties were cool. So maybe it'll come back. I just take a decade.

22:55.760 --> 22:58.720
 Well, there's always, that's how stories are told. There's always pockets of

22:59.760 --> 23:05.200
 like Paris within New York, right? True. There's just an opportunity to

23:05.200 --> 23:10.320
 let your weird flourish is there in New York, I'm sure. I mean,

23:12.560 --> 23:15.360
 it's there. You got to find it before it was front and center.

23:16.000 --> 23:21.360
 What's your favorite thing about New York? Like what kind of things just like,

23:21.920 --> 23:27.600
 I mean, how long is this pod? I could go on. It's too much to put into one hour. We've got

23:27.600 --> 23:33.360
 other questions, but I love that one neighborhood is wildly different than the next. I mean,

23:33.360 --> 23:37.600
 little Italy, and then you take four steps. Now I'm in Chinatown. I mean, and then the history

23:37.600 --> 23:43.600
 there and then the stories and the food and the culture and all that. And then you go 10 feet

23:43.600 --> 23:47.760
 over here. Now you're in Brooklyn and this is insane as a whole nother world. And it's almost

23:47.760 --> 23:56.080
 like a little America in one, you know, a city and it's great. And just the fact that they pulled

23:56.080 --> 24:01.040
 it off like Fifth Avenue goes way up and you're like, there's a billionaire's house next to a

24:01.040 --> 24:06.080
 hobo. And then this is a black guy who's fighting with a Cuban guy and an Asian guy is trying to

24:06.080 --> 24:11.200
 get in the middle of them and the cabbies from the Middle East. And there's so many beautiful

24:11.200 --> 24:15.440
 women here. And there's so many brilliant minds here. And the pace is great. It keeps people

24:15.440 --> 24:20.640
 moving. I mean, it just, you can't beat it. And the city will fuck you in the ass too. Don't get

24:20.640 --> 24:26.560
 me wrong. You landed JFK and you're like, Oh God, I got mugged. My Uber driver called me a

24:26.560 --> 24:34.160
 homo. I stepped in human shit. Where the fuck am I? So yeah, it's bad news. But that bad news,

24:34.160 --> 24:38.400
 it's almost like the bullying. It kills you in a weird way, but it makes you stronger and you

24:38.400 --> 24:43.040
 build more layers and layers and layers. That's why some new guys, some hayseed from Milwaukee

24:43.040 --> 24:50.080
 shows up. You've been here 10 years and you go, let me help you out because you got to adjust.

24:50.080 --> 24:54.960
 You're going to get your ass kicked for like six months. But I know the ropes a little and I think

24:54.960 --> 25:00.240
 you need a little of that. If the treadmill is not on, you're not going to run. New York,

25:00.240 --> 25:04.720
 the treadmill is on. So it just makes you run and it makes you better and look at wears on you.

25:04.720 --> 25:09.840
 You probably lose 10 years of your life living in New York versus Indianapolis, but

25:11.040 --> 25:17.360
 it's a better life. Have you seen 25th hour? Yeah. It's been a while. Spike Lee joint?

25:17.360 --> 25:23.680
 Yeah, Spike Lee joint. I mean, at Norton, there's a whole like monologue there about New York.

25:23.680 --> 25:31.440
 Oh, that's right. But they're talking about just, he has like a mix. There's like melancholy music,

25:31.440 --> 25:36.080
 I think, or just a melancholy feel to the whole thing, but there's an anger and a disgust with

25:36.080 --> 25:41.520
 the city. But through the anger and the disgust comes out like a love for the city. Same with

25:41.520 --> 25:47.280
 was Taxi Driver in New York? Oh yeah. It's going crazy. Yeah. So like that, there's something

25:47.280 --> 25:56.000
 about that. What is that? What is that grit of the city that like pushes you down?

25:56.000 --> 26:02.320
 Well, that's the beauty of the city is it's this tribal human nature like the sex shops and fist

26:02.320 --> 26:08.480
 fights and racism and all this tension, but yet it's the epicenter of technology and finance

26:08.480 --> 26:14.560
 and sophistication on Fifth Avenue. So you get that juxtaposition. It's kind of like in Boston.

26:14.560 --> 26:19.600
 You go to Boston, they got MIT, they got Hobbit, they got all this shit. And then they got the

26:19.600 --> 26:24.480
 fishermen, the blue collar douchebags, the Irish guys, the immigrants, you know, and you get that

26:24.480 --> 26:31.280
 mix of like insanely smart with Wicked Pissa and these two worlds. And that's a good thing.

26:31.280 --> 26:36.880
 It's like when a black guy fucks an Asian lady, that's a good looking kid. You get a mix. We're

26:36.880 --> 26:41.680
 mixing two totally different things. They're coming together and it makes it like peanut butter and

26:41.680 --> 26:47.200
 chocolate. Peanut butter and chocolate. I've never tried that. What? Peanut butter. Maybe I have.

26:47.200 --> 26:52.080
 I'm talking about Reese's, man. Like Reese's, yeah, and yeah, yeah. Oh, it's the best candy.

26:52.080 --> 27:01.360
 Yeah. Without the fakeness of LA, without the kind of facade. Yeah, LA's tough.

27:02.880 --> 27:06.720
 What's the difference between LA comedy and New York comedy, too?

27:06.720 --> 27:13.920
 I think one place you kind of go to make it and be discovered and be loved and one place

27:13.920 --> 27:18.880
 you go, you can get all that in New York, too, but I think in New York it's more of a school,

27:18.880 --> 27:25.200
 a boot camp of comedy. Let's make great comedy. Let's make original comedy. Let's watch the other

27:25.200 --> 27:31.600
 guys and gals who are at the show, at the clubs and learn from them and try to hang out with them

27:31.600 --> 27:37.280
 and absorb some of them. In LA, it's like, when am I on? I'm next. Get out of my way.

27:37.920 --> 27:42.880
 I'm the star here. I'm a bigger star than you. Oh, this guy's actually a big star. I got to

27:42.880 --> 27:47.680
 outwork. It's just a lot of that instead of like, damn, that was funny. I got to be that funny.

27:47.680 --> 27:51.200
 Damn, I wish I had a joke. Look, I don't want to speak for LA comics because there's

27:52.080 --> 27:56.960
 Bill Burr and the Gelseneck. There's brilliant LA comic, but they all cut their teeth in New

27:56.960 --> 28:03.280
 York. Just saying. Then they moved to LA. It's a good point. All these people kill their comics,

28:03.280 --> 28:08.480
 but New York started in New York, moved to New York. There is something about comics that's

28:08.480 --> 28:12.800
 staying in New York for a long time, though, like Dave Vitell. You know about Dave? Yeah,

28:12.800 --> 28:18.320
 he wants to do this podcast. He does? Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Dave Vitell. But it's almost like he

28:18.320 --> 28:24.880
 doesn't want to make it. I don't know. I mean, you probably know him, but it feels like you just,

28:24.880 --> 28:31.440
 maybe it's romanticizing it, but you're like, you almost just love the art of comedy of like

28:31.440 --> 28:36.160
 becoming funnier, crafting the jokes, becoming funnier than the other comics, like competing

28:36.160 --> 28:42.240
 with each other kind of thing. Not over like money or fame or any of that. Just purely the

28:42.240 --> 28:46.240
 comedy of it. Totally. That's Dave. That's him in a nutshell. He's like that guy in the movies in

28:46.240 --> 28:51.120
 the 80s, action movies where they're like, they go up to a creek in Montana and some guys living

28:51.120 --> 28:56.080
 in a cabin and he's sharpening a stick and they go, the Russians are coming. They're invading.

28:56.080 --> 29:00.160
 We need you. You're the best commando. And he's like, I gave that up, man. I'm done with that

29:00.160 --> 29:04.480
 lifestyle. They're like, but you're the best. We need you. And he has to suit up eventually.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.840
 You know, he looks at a picture of his dead wife and he goes, fuck it. I'm going. And then they,

29:07.840 --> 29:15.040
 you know, fight the Ruskies. But he's that guy. He just is gifted. He's like got a gift from Allah

29:15.040 --> 29:20.000
 and he's the best. Yeah, a lot of comics give him props. It's always surprising to me. I didn't

29:20.000 --> 29:26.800
 because it's surprising to me because he hasn't really made it like big. He did in the 90s. He

29:26.800 --> 29:30.800
 was huge. He had his own TV show. He was the boy. Yeah. Yeah. That show was, that show was awesome.

29:30.800 --> 29:35.600
 But I mean, like as big as I think he deserves to be. So I, well, that's art. The mainstream

29:35.600 --> 29:40.960
 shit is always the worst. It's like McDonald's versus some hole in the wall. I know I'm shitting

29:40.960 --> 29:46.240
 on McDonald's again, but it's good. And, you know, certain comics we could name are good, but

29:46.240 --> 29:55.200
 the, the delicacy is going to be less talked about and less household namey than, than the

29:55.200 --> 30:02.960
 mainstream hacky shit. Yeah, it's funny because he hasn't, I think he was on Joe Rogan's show once,

30:02.960 --> 30:09.760
 maybe. Yeah. And he was with somebody else. Jeff Ross. Yeah. He might have been with Jeff

30:09.760 --> 30:16.560
 Ross. Oh yeah. Cause they did that, like two mics thing, whatever. Yeah. But he's the quickest guy.

30:16.560 --> 30:23.120
 There's no one funnier. Yeah. Yeah. Him and you, you're super quick. Your appearance on,

30:23.120 --> 30:28.720
 recent appearance on Rogan's hilarious. Oh, thanks. Just so fast. You're on with Ari and

30:29.440 --> 30:33.040
 Shangillis. Shangillis. Yeah. That was fun. We're going back in January.

30:33.040 --> 30:41.360
 I don't know when this comes out. This has never come out. Neither will you. We're having fun.

30:41.360 --> 30:49.440
 Yeah. All right. So what does it feel like to bomb in standup comedy, like to fail? Maybe the

30:49.440 --> 30:54.480
 psychology of it first, like, just take me through it. Cause we're talking about being

30:55.760 --> 31:02.000
 outnumbered in a fight, just being beat up. Very similar. By the way, this is like a no eye contact

31:02.000 --> 31:07.520
 off. Yeah. Yeah. We're both uncomfortable with it. Yeah. It's great. It's kind of nice to be with

31:07.520 --> 31:14.480
 my people. But yeah. Dina should have paper to look at her. I'm going, I got a good sweet spot

31:14.480 --> 31:22.960
 right there. Nice. Yeah. It's a nightmare, but it's part of it. It's the validation too is the

31:22.960 --> 31:28.720
 worst part. Cause whenever you do comedy and kill, you can be a great comic, but even David

31:28.720 --> 31:31.680
 tell these brilliant guys, they feel like they're getting, you feel like you're getting away with

31:31.680 --> 31:34.800
 something. I don't have a day job. I'm telling jokes for a little bit. I'm talking about my

31:34.800 --> 31:38.640
 dick up here and they're fucking loving me and they call me a genius and all this. I'm talking

31:38.640 --> 31:43.520
 about my sack. Yeah. You know, and, uh, and it's great. It makes people happy and it's funny, but

31:44.320 --> 31:48.800
 uh, that bombing, when you bomb, you go, your first thought is like, yeah, you're right. At

31:48.800 --> 31:52.880
 first you're like, fuck you got what? You don't like this shit. And then you just start going in.

31:52.880 --> 31:57.680
 You're like, yeah, maybe it isn't that good. Maybe they're right. I do suck. I knew I sucked.

31:57.680 --> 32:04.000
 I should become a mailman, you know, and, uh, it stinks and it feel, you feel alone and you feel

32:04.000 --> 32:08.400
 like you wasted their time and then you're like, what was I thinking? I could be a comedian. What

32:08.400 --> 32:14.480
 the fuck? Who am I? You know, Eddie Murphy. What am I doing here? So, uh, it's a lot of just spiraling

32:14.480 --> 32:20.880
 out of horrible thoughts, but I also love that it hurts so bad. Bombing fucking hurts because

32:20.880 --> 32:25.520
 now, now everybody doesn't do it. I think a lot more people could do comedy probably and figure

32:25.520 --> 32:31.440
 it out, but the bombing is so brutal that it keeps, uh, one time I went to Minneapolis, I was

32:31.440 --> 32:35.520
 like, this is a great city. I mean, the sun is shining. Why isn't this city like packed and they're

32:35.520 --> 32:38.960
 like, cause the winters are so bad and we love it cause it keeps everybody out. And I feel like

32:38.960 --> 32:43.760
 the same about comedy. The bombs are so brutal. I've had bombs where I'm in bed. I'm just staring

32:43.760 --> 32:49.120
 at the ceiling like, what the fuck was that? Like you have PTSD. I bombed at an arena once, 20,000

32:49.120 --> 32:56.400
 people. I did 30 minutes to silence. So it's not just like one joke fails. It's like they start

32:56.400 --> 33:01.520
 piling on like it's irrecoverable. Yes. And one joke failing is very common. Like a lot of audience

33:01.520 --> 33:05.680
 don't even notice like that bomb. Cause you get, you know, you got so many jokes in a row. You can

33:05.680 --> 33:10.400
 sandwich a good one, then a bad one, then a good one. But when you bomb, it's almost like they chose,

33:10.400 --> 33:16.640
 we don't like you. Nothing you say will redeem yourself. And, uh, it's hard to get out of.

33:16.640 --> 33:20.560
 It's like being pulled down by your hair. You can't get back. I can't win this fight no matter

33:20.560 --> 33:26.400
 what. Can you like get him back by acknowledging like the elf in the room that like,

33:26.880 --> 33:30.320
 That helps, but they're still going to go. That was funny when he made fun of it, but

33:30.320 --> 33:36.000
 he sucks. He still sucks. He still sucks. That's the worst part. You're going, no, this is good.

33:36.000 --> 33:38.480
 You guys just don't like me. Just cause you don't like me. It doesn't mean I'm bad.

33:39.360 --> 33:43.360
 Yeah. I like going to open mics a lot. Just, just listening because

33:43.360 --> 33:48.320
 first of all, I think the audience in the open mic, at least the ones I've been to,

33:49.440 --> 33:54.160
 is, um, most I guess other comedians or like, at least people who don't seem to want to laugh

33:54.160 --> 34:00.400
 at anything. And so I just love it because it's human nature and perseverance that is best.

34:00.400 --> 34:05.520
 But here's comedians, like clearly, uh, this is mostly in Austin. They have a dream.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.000
 Like, why would you get up there? Right.

34:08.000 --> 34:14.880
 Right. Maybe some weird, you know, New Year's resolution bullshit, but for the most part,

34:14.880 --> 34:18.400
 it's people who want to be comedians. Like a lot of the open micers that people

34:18.400 --> 34:22.560
 who have clearly have done this for quite a long time, like at least a year or two,

34:22.560 --> 34:29.840
 maybe five years. And they're often not very funny. And, um,

34:29.840 --> 34:38.080
 um, the just bombing in front of an audience of like 20, where they're just sitting there,

34:39.120 --> 34:45.360
 like almost like mocking them with their eyes or maybe, and I don't know, and they still push

34:45.360 --> 34:50.400
 through. They still, they still like, as if they're doing an arena and everybody's laughing.

34:51.040 --> 34:58.080
 They still, they still got that energy trying almost like to an audience that doesn't exist.

34:58.080 --> 35:02.880
 Like an audience of their dreams. Cause I guess that you have to do that to keep the energy of

35:02.880 --> 35:09.360
 the act going. And it's just so beautiful to watch them try it. It's, uh, and also the,

35:09.360 --> 35:14.480
 what happens, open mic, I don't know, five minutes, whatever they do, they, you know,

35:14.480 --> 35:21.680
 walk off and that walk back, you know, off stage and like, you can't, what, who do they look at?

35:21.680 --> 35:26.320
 Like, what do you look at? Do you make eye contact with people? Do you look at your phone?

35:26.320 --> 35:32.240
 You look at your feet. You just zone out. You kind of kind of go white, you know,

35:32.240 --> 35:37.680
 you just hear white noise and go out. It's, it's tough, but you got it. You need a little,

35:38.400 --> 35:42.720
 a little delusion to be a comedian to get into it. It takes a little bit of delusion. Like,

35:42.720 --> 35:47.680
 you think you can do this, you know, you got 10 years ahead of you of hell and you're up for this.

35:48.480 --> 35:53.120
 And you know, most comics, we see a horrible crowd and we see our friend bomb and we go,

35:53.120 --> 36:00.160
 yeah, he's bombing, but I'll get him. I'll get him. And then you don't get him. But that's,

36:00.160 --> 36:04.880
 that's human nature too. It's like, they don't like him, but they're like me. And you need a

36:04.880 --> 36:08.400
 little of that to keep going as a comedian. But you don't want too much delusion because then

36:08.400 --> 36:13.840
 you're a psycho, but you need a little. Well, the psycho could be good for a comedy.

36:13.840 --> 36:19.120
 That's true too. Love psychos. I mentioned you offline, um, that talked to Elon and we talked

36:19.120 --> 36:23.760
 about doing standup that he's thinking maybe do a few minutes of standup. Say, if you need a coach,

36:23.760 --> 36:29.440
 Elon, I got you. Um, well, maybe you should move to Austin to coach him full time.

36:30.400 --> 36:37.200
 Hopefully they can fly me in. So what, what advice would you give to somebody who, um,

36:37.200 --> 36:44.000
 who wants to try and do five minutes, like the early steps of, uh, trying to go to an

36:44.000 --> 36:49.120
 open mic and say something funny? Well, that's the irony of comedy is, I don't know if it's irony,

36:49.120 --> 36:53.200
 but it's like the beginning is the hardest part. Usually the beginning is the easy part.

36:53.200 --> 36:57.680
 Hey, I'm playing this level of Mario. I'd start a jump over one Koopa Troopa, whatever.

36:57.680 --> 37:02.160
 And then the end is like, Jesus Christ, I got 30 guys coming at me. Comedy's the opposite. The

37:02.160 --> 37:07.520
 beginning is like, it's a gauntlet. It's just obstacles. And it's like you said, open mics.

37:07.520 --> 37:11.920
 You, I watch these famous comedians on Netflix and you go, this would all bomb an open mic.

37:11.920 --> 37:16.080
 They're killing in, you know, Radio City. This would bomb an open mic. That's the weird part.

37:16.080 --> 37:22.720
 So it's almost, you have to go through hell just to get to the, the promised land. And, uh, I would

37:22.720 --> 37:27.200
 say rehearse the shit out of it because you're going to get frazzled up there. Everybody thinks,

37:27.200 --> 37:31.440
 oh, this is good material, but you also forget about the other part of delivering it, having

37:31.440 --> 37:36.880
 confidence, being likable, having timing, having a cadence, figuring out who you are,

37:36.880 --> 37:41.440
 figuring out what the audience thinks you are or how they perceive you. Cause you can go up there

37:41.440 --> 37:45.680
 and say all this, but they go, why's the guy, he's clearly gay. Why is he actually not gay?

37:45.680 --> 37:49.120
 You know, that's all that. Now they're not listening to the joke. So like, you got to know

37:49.120 --> 37:54.960
 how you look. And, uh, it's just repetition, repetition and bombing is not failure. That's

37:54.960 --> 37:58.960
 what you got to remember. I mean, look, if you, if you do a, a killer hour and then you take it

37:58.960 --> 38:05.760
 to Netflix and bomb, you fucked up, but bombing is not failure. It's just data. It's going, oh,

38:05.760 --> 38:11.040
 okay, I got to read, retool that. That didn't work. Something wrong there. They missed a word there.

38:11.040 --> 38:18.080
 So you got to treat the, uh, the act almost like, uh, like, uh, like ingredients in a, in a, in a

38:18.960 --> 38:22.960
 cooking and a dish, you know, like, oh, that, I put too many eggs in, take an egg out. You got

38:22.960 --> 38:27.680
 to treat it like that. And look, when you pull a bad cake out of an oven, you go, I fucked up,

38:27.680 --> 38:32.240
 but it doesn't hurt your feelings. But when you bomb and fuck up, it hurts your feelings.

38:32.240 --> 38:36.800
 So you got to factor that into your feelings going to be hurt and just almost be a robot and

38:36.800 --> 38:41.920
 just keep going towards that open mic. You know how scary an open mic is? Bombing sucks, but bombing

38:41.920 --> 38:47.760
 in front of other comedians is way worse because they know what just happened and they could have

38:47.760 --> 38:53.600
 saved you and they didn't. So it's way worse. And they're going to be your quote unquote friends

38:55.120 --> 39:01.760
 for this journey. Yeah. No, these are evil people. Most twisted fucked up hurt people.

39:01.760 --> 39:08.000
 Can you tell like in those early days, let's just talk about that, like the open mic level,

39:08.000 --> 39:12.960
 that a joke is going to be good on paper. Like I'll give you my experience because, uh,

39:15.200 --> 39:17.520
 maybe you can be my coach in this particular moment.

39:17.520 --> 39:25.680
 Please. I feel like Larry Nasser. All right. That's fun, huh? Joking, everybody. I hope nobody

39:25.680 --> 39:31.840
 takes this seriously. There's, I now have an amazing team of folks who help me with editing

39:31.840 --> 39:36.240
 and they're now currently sweating. You gotta leave that one in. That was quick. Yeah, that's

39:36.240 --> 39:44.640
 pretty good. I'll eat that one. That was good. All right. So, you know, going in front of an

39:44.640 --> 39:52.240
 audience, just even to give a lecture terrifies me, which I've done, but open mic, I mean that to me,

39:52.240 --> 39:57.920
 perhaps that's why I like going open mics and listening is because I just, it terrifies me so

39:57.920 --> 40:05.280
 much that idea of going up there and bombing. I mean, it's scary and to do even like one minute

40:05.280 --> 40:11.280
 to be honest is scary and five minutes. I'm also watched enough open mics to realize that five

40:11.280 --> 40:17.760
 minutes is a long time. I mean, it depends on your comedy, but if you're doing fast stuff,

40:17.760 --> 40:25.680
 five minutes is a really long time. Oh, it's eternity. I guess with a long story, two is a

40:25.680 --> 40:29.440
 long time because if the story is not worth, you're building up to something. If the story is

40:29.440 --> 40:35.280
 going to fail, you just spent all that time telling the story that completely went flat.

40:35.280 --> 40:39.520
 Completely. Got nothing. I guess if you have a series of jokes, you can at least try to recover

40:39.520 --> 40:43.600
 and like do the Mitch Heidberg thing where like, all right, I'll cross that off. Yeah, yeah.

40:43.600 --> 40:51.040
 Yeah. Well, I'm able to, like I've tried to write a few things and I'm able to tell that it's really

40:51.040 --> 40:57.200
 bad. Well, that's better than most. Most people's egos kick in and go, no, this is good. No,

40:57.200 --> 41:02.080
 see, I'm able to introspect that. Like it seems funny. I mean, I guess the thing I'm looking for

41:02.080 --> 41:10.560
 is original. Like there's easy stuff that you think is funny, but to me, originality is the

41:10.560 --> 41:18.880
 thing you should be looking for because then that's what's actually becomes funny. Or rather,

41:19.840 --> 41:27.680
 if it's original, even if it bombs, that feels like more a beautiful art creation that you did.

41:27.680 --> 41:32.480
 Like at least you swung for it. Like you did something unique because even with open mic,

41:32.480 --> 41:37.520
 your first five minutes, there's so many, just go to enough open mics, you'll hear like all the,

41:37.520 --> 41:42.320
 there's like a list of jokes that you just go to. First of all, you can make fun of the fact that

41:42.880 --> 41:47.680
 you're at an open mic, that you're like doing this the first time and so on. You can do a lot

41:47.680 --> 41:52.720
 of stuff where you make fun of your appearance in some way and so on. But like, yeah, you could do that.

41:53.360 --> 41:59.360
 You know, that takes actually, that's way harder than people realize to do it in an original way.

41:59.360 --> 42:07.760
 Yes. To present who you are as a person, very quickly, enough to then put that person down in

42:07.760 --> 42:12.960
 front of everybody else. So you have to reveal the audiences like that because they go, he knows

42:12.960 --> 42:18.240
 what we're thinking. Yeah, exactly. But do it again in an original way. And so like when I'm

42:18.240 --> 42:26.080
 trying to write stuff, not that I've tried long, it's like 30 minutes, but as enough to see like,

42:26.080 --> 42:32.160
 oh, shit, to write something original is really difficult. It is. But do you got a bit? Anything?

42:32.160 --> 42:36.480
 No. You didn't write any one line or anything? For this? No. Well, just in general,

42:36.480 --> 42:41.280
 ever in your life, ever written a joke? Oh, yeah. Oh, okay. No, but I don't have anything in my

42:41.280 --> 42:50.240
 mind. So the jokes that I've written have more, like for some reason, my mind goes to like dark

42:50.240 --> 43:00.320
 places. And not actually dark in the Mark Norman dark because you go really dark to where it's

43:00.320 --> 43:09.920
 like almost absurd. My natural inclination is to go to like a dark historical place like Hitler

43:09.920 --> 43:21.840
 and Stalin and almost go to that place and then talk about something absurd there. So like don't

43:21.840 --> 43:29.920
 go like all the way, I don't know, I don't want to give examples because it'll be clipped, but

43:31.600 --> 43:37.920
 the Mark Norman style, look it up. He has a special on his YouTube. That kind. I want to almost

43:37.920 --> 43:44.160
 explore the dark aspects of human nature more kind of connected to actual historical figures.

43:44.160 --> 43:50.720
 That's the inclination. Like, I don't know, Nature's Metal, the Instagram channel that

43:50.720 --> 43:57.040
 explores like the darkness of nature, like something there. See, that's good that you already know

43:57.040 --> 44:02.240
 that you've kind of gotten to the core of your comedy already. And that's interesting. That's a

44:02.240 --> 44:06.880
 step ahead. Yeah, I can hear. I mean, with most things that I do in life, I can like hear the

44:06.880 --> 44:13.120
 music from a distance. Like in myself, like, okay, if you have anything, this is the direction it'll

44:13.120 --> 44:18.000
 be without actually knowing exactly all the steps. And that's a nice motivation to be like, all right,

44:18.000 --> 44:22.720
 well, if you do this for a long time, maybe you'll have a chance to get there. But you have to,

44:23.680 --> 44:28.720
 that's where it's a feature to be super self critical, I think. But then that's why

44:28.720 --> 44:34.560
 it's fucking terrifying to walk up to a stage, stand there and probably forget everything.

44:34.560 --> 44:38.400
 Yeah, that's the other part nobody thinks about. Just goes right out of your head. You go fight or

44:38.400 --> 44:44.320
 flight. It's ugly. My first years were horrific bombing, horrific stammering, horrific not

44:44.320 --> 44:48.080
 remembering the punchline. Like, you got to even maybe you got a little setup going and they're

44:48.080 --> 44:52.160
 kind of on board and you're like, ah, how's that camera? I can't remember how it goes. And you

44:52.160 --> 44:58.080
 just hate yourself. It's a nightmare. But you've already kind of, maybe if you haven't done stand

44:58.080 --> 45:02.640
 up or whatever, but you kind of know your voice. And that's, yeah, that's pretty advanced.

45:02.640 --> 45:08.000
 So you're not trying to be somebody else. I guess, yeah, just for having done like podcast and

45:08.000 --> 45:13.200
 lecture and so on. That helps. You've embarrassed, I've already done some of the work of the stand

45:13.200 --> 45:18.240
 ups do, which is embarrass yourself in front of others for prolonged periods of time. Yes. Yeah.

45:18.240 --> 45:24.320
 So I'd done that without actually developing the funny. Right, right, right. But maybe the funny

45:24.320 --> 45:30.960
 just is not that difficult to develop. No, it's super difficult, of course. But I mean, maybe

45:30.960 --> 45:36.000
 the essential work of a stand up comedian is just the embarrassment of like finding who you are.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.560
 Yeah, that's a part of it for sure. You know, in the beginning, you're like,

45:39.120 --> 45:43.280
 water bottle, what's funny about water bottle? I'm a funny guy. I can make this funny. But that's

45:43.280 --> 45:49.280
 not it. You know, it's, it's your shit, your shit, like your dark stuff. For me, I tend to gravitate

45:49.280 --> 45:54.480
 towards dark, but in a weird way where, you know, people will say like, Hey, don't objectify women.

45:54.480 --> 45:58.080
 But then they go, Caitlyn Jenner is beautiful. And you're like, well, wait,

45:58.080 --> 46:06.320
 I know something's off here. Why can you objectify her but not the supermodel? So what's going on

46:06.320 --> 46:13.120
 there? And I like to play with that. So I have this joke where I say, Caitlyn Jenner. Oh,

46:13.120 --> 46:16.560
 women go, Caitlyn Jenner is beautiful, beautiful woman. I go, well, you look like her and they go,

46:16.560 --> 46:22.160
 fuck you. And you're like, there's a lot of truth there. But I like exploring that kind of,

46:22.880 --> 46:27.040
 oh, you're trying to get one over on me or you're lying to yourself or what are we doing here?

46:27.040 --> 46:32.000
 And I like, I like that kind of comedy. I don't see color. Well, I'm black. No, you're not.

46:33.120 --> 46:35.600
 You know, that's fun because you're, you're lying.

46:37.680 --> 46:43.520
 Yeah. Okay. So like big time comedians, such as yourself, don't like to think of yourself in

46:43.520 --> 46:49.840
 this way. But yeah, this is like where you over philosophize comedy. But

46:50.480 --> 46:54.000
 Yeah, definitely. It seems like comedians.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.800
 Don't say important. Nothing worse than a comedian who thinks they're important.

46:56.800 --> 47:02.000
 Yeah. So I was going, I was trying to find, as I was trying to say these words, I realized

47:02.000 --> 47:08.080
 how cliche it is and how uninteresting it is. So I'm going to just, but there's something.

47:08.080 --> 47:11.360
 I'm worried this whole thing is uninteresting. I'm like, who cares about comedy? There's like

47:11.360 --> 47:16.640
 six comics on the planet. But nobody cares. Okay. I trust you in the, in the pilot seat.

47:16.640 --> 47:21.440
 You know what you're doing. You got, you got listeners. They've tuned out long ago.

47:21.440 --> 47:25.520
 They've tuned out long ago. Dan Carlin on here, huh? Is he around?

47:25.520 --> 47:30.400
 Yeah. We're just going back and forth on Twitter just now. He's a huge fan. He was on here before

47:30.400 --> 47:37.600
 he'll be back. I've been actually really trying to volunteer myself aggressively with Dan Carlin

47:38.720 --> 47:43.680
 for like a Russian episode where I could speak Russian. I, there's, there's certain documents

47:43.680 --> 47:49.760
 saying, I talked with Jaco about this too. Certain things. I mean, I just love the challenge of

47:49.760 --> 47:55.680
 bringing Russian documents that I can read in Russian and it can translate and can try to capture

47:55.680 --> 48:03.440
 the, the depth of the writing in, in the Russian language and communicate to the American audience.

48:03.440 --> 48:09.120
 So much has lost in translation. Like there's so much pain and poetry in the Russian language.

48:09.120 --> 48:15.360
 It's just connected to the culture. Every language, not every language, but many languages are

48:15.360 --> 48:21.280
 uniquely able to capture the culture of the people. I mean, in some way they're the representation

48:21.280 --> 48:26.320
 of the culture of the people. And so Russian is definitely that represents the full history

48:26.320 --> 48:31.040
 and culture of the 20th century with all the atrocities, all the, all the broken promises,

48:31.040 --> 48:36.720
 all those kinds of things. Norm says Russian literature is, it's the most tapped into human

48:36.720 --> 48:42.960
 existence than anything else. Norm. McDonald. Yeah. Big, big Russian literature guy.

48:42.960 --> 48:48.800
 Dostoevsky, all that shit. It's funny that there is a gap with comedians too. There's a culture

48:48.800 --> 48:54.800
 of Russian comedy, like standup comedians that are told. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know these Russians.

48:55.360 --> 49:00.800
 I mean, I don't know today. I mean, more from the 80s and 90s. And there was a.

49:00.800 --> 49:06.800
 Yakov. That's all I know. That's not, so there's like, of course, that's, that's.

49:06.800 --> 49:14.480
 I've never seen that offended. No, no, no, it's not offended. There's a different,

49:14.480 --> 49:20.880
 there's like the kinesons and the, there's the edgy. Is that Russian? What do you mean?

49:20.880 --> 49:24.880
 Wait, I thought you said there was Russian comics. Yeah, Russian. I mean, I'm comparing them.

49:24.880 --> 49:30.480
 For style. I'm giving you, I'm giving you like a style of darkness. Like that's the kind of people

49:30.480 --> 49:38.800
 that kind of challenge. They give again, this is to how important comedians are, is they give a

49:38.800 --> 49:46.480
 voice to people where in the Soviet Union, you really can't like express your opposition to

49:46.480 --> 49:54.080
 the government. And so comedians are exceptionally important there for just, just, I don't know,

49:54.080 --> 49:57.760
 channeling the anger, even when sometimes it's not the actual opposition to the government,

49:57.760 --> 50:03.040
 they're just channeling the anger, the frustration with the absurdity of life. Like,

50:04.080 --> 50:10.320
 you know, when there's a shortage of food, shortage of jobs, the absurdity of the bureaucracy,

50:10.320 --> 50:19.120
 like the top heavy government, just all of that can only sometimes be expressed with like dark,

50:19.120 --> 50:24.640
 absurd humor. And that actually, why there's a culture of that kind of humor, you know,

50:24.640 --> 50:31.120
 you gather on the table with vodka and all you can do is just talk shit and just

50:31.760 --> 50:36.880
 be offensive, say horrible shit, ball bust. I mean, I make school shooting jokes and people

50:36.880 --> 50:40.400
 go, how do you do that? I'm like, well, maybe that's how I deal with it. Yeah. You know,

50:40.400 --> 50:46.080
 like how come I gotta, I gotta empathize the way you do. Maybe we're different.

50:46.080 --> 50:52.560
 All right. So now let's skip the whole open mic thing and crafting jokes.

50:53.600 --> 50:54.640
 Oh, that's tough.

50:55.280 --> 51:00.320
 Kerouac said, one day I will find the right words and they will be simple.

51:02.000 --> 51:06.480
 When do you know the joke is done? It's perfect. You're somebody that does like

51:07.360 --> 51:15.600
 really sharp, like fast jokes. Well, so like there's somebody, I don't know,

51:15.600 --> 51:22.640
 I don't know who you see yourself in the same school as like your darker and faster than

51:22.640 --> 51:27.920
 Hedberg, I think, in terms of like, just, I don't know, the turns you take are very...

51:29.040 --> 51:32.160
 Thanks. I appreciate it. I think I got some Norm McDonald and maybe...

51:32.160 --> 51:32.880
 Norm, that's right.

51:32.880 --> 51:39.520
 You know, obviously Norm, but Chris Rock was huge for me. Chris, old like 90s, Chris Rock was like,

51:40.240 --> 51:44.000
 I didn't know you could do jokes like that. I always loved George Carlin and Groucho Marx and

51:44.000 --> 51:49.600
 Bill Murray. There's so many different types of comedy, but when I saw the bigger and blacker

51:49.600 --> 51:54.800
 bring the pain, I was like, oh my God, this is like, it hit me. So that was big. And then

51:54.800 --> 51:59.280
 Norm's just like the funniest guy on the planet. So him being the smartest guy in the room,

51:59.280 --> 52:06.800
 but acting dumb was great. So yeah, Chris Rock has that way of cutting to the bullshit,

52:06.800 --> 52:11.520
 which I mentioned earlier. I like that cutting through the bullshit kind of style of comedy,

52:11.520 --> 52:15.680
 because you kind of go, oh, I'm not crazy. That's what I thought too. I was too scared to say,

52:15.680 --> 52:20.320
 but I thought that and he's saying it in a room of people are laughing. Maybe I'm not an idiot.

52:21.120 --> 52:21.920
 So that helped me.

52:22.800 --> 52:30.000
 So it's observational, but not Jerry Sineff observational. It's like going to the darker

52:30.000 --> 52:32.400
 thing within society.

52:32.400 --> 52:38.800
 But I like him too, but seeing it, doing it about stuff like in your life, society.

52:38.800 --> 52:43.200
 Yeah. Race, gender, government, politics, all that kind of stuff.

52:43.200 --> 52:48.400
 Exactly. Exactly. Sex, human emotions, jealousy, whatever it is. That's the good stuff.

52:50.160 --> 52:51.920
 How'd you feel when Norm passed away?

52:53.360 --> 52:58.800
 That was a bummer because he was, you know, what, 61? And I just didn't see it

53:00.080 --> 53:06.320
 coming. And I just, I've watched so many hours of his stuff and I've met him and he's like,

53:06.320 --> 53:10.080
 he was like this comedic bar, like, hey, we got Norm. You know, there's so much

53:10.080 --> 53:14.720
 shit comedy. Then you see Norm and you're like, this is next level. This is savant type shit.

53:14.720 --> 53:21.600
 And then to lose him is like, ah, Norm had 20 more years at least of just content and content

53:21.600 --> 53:26.320
 and thoughts and his point of view. And that's, we'll never get that. And that sucks.

53:27.520 --> 53:33.200
 Yeah. There is something about artists like Jimi Hendrix dying too early. It's like, you wonder

53:33.200 --> 53:37.600
 what was next. Yeah, what was next. But then part of it is like,

53:39.440 --> 53:44.400
 you know, it all ends for all of us. And it's like walking away early is,

53:46.400 --> 53:53.600
 it's kind of admirable. It's almost like I did a pretty good job. Yeah. I'm good with that.

53:53.600 --> 53:57.520
 And especially the way he did, which is not telling anybody. I know,

53:57.520 --> 54:01.360
 nine years, his best friends didn't even know. And in this world of like victim hood,

54:01.360 --> 54:05.600
 and I need clicks and I need people to love me. He could have, he got, you know, canceled and

54:05.600 --> 54:09.360
 yelled at and in trouble. And he could have pulled that cancer card and he never did. I mean,

54:09.360 --> 54:13.440
 the integrity on this motherfucker. Did you get a chance to interact with him? Like what,

54:14.080 --> 54:19.280
 how often did you meet him? I met him once at the comedy cellar and we chatted for five minutes.

54:19.280 --> 54:23.360
 And then he went on and did the letterman set that he did. He was running the letterman set.

54:23.360 --> 54:28.880
 And sweet guy, nice guy. I didn't know him that well, but I mean, he's just brilliant.

54:28.880 --> 54:36.400
 And I also love a brilliant guy who does stupid stuff. That's a fun, fun little combo there.

54:36.400 --> 54:41.840
 Like silly guys who are actually brilliant. Also, you know, like Louis CK is a brilliant

54:41.840 --> 54:47.440
 comic and he'll do a joke about farting on a kid. And you're like, that's great that he still

54:48.400 --> 54:52.560
 finds farts funny. And he's also this comedic genius guy. I like that.

54:52.560 --> 55:00.160
 And doesn't really acknowledge the genius. Yeah. Yeah. I like smart people. They're silly.

55:00.720 --> 55:05.920
 Yes. That's a good combo. Like you said, Elon is silly. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. Yeah.

55:05.920 --> 55:10.720
 Because we taught, we teach kids like, Hey, put that down, stop that, quit cutting up,

55:10.720 --> 55:14.880
 quit horsing around. But maybe that's some kind of sign of brilliance there.

55:14.880 --> 55:21.440
 Yeah. Being like childlike and silly is a kind of wisdom. I feel like those people are way wiser

55:21.440 --> 55:26.720
 than the people that no offense to me wear a suit and take themselves away too seriously.

55:26.720 --> 55:30.400
 No, but you got a spark in you. A little bit. You got a little, what's the word?

55:31.040 --> 55:36.880
 Not elf. Imp. A little imp in you. Give that a go. You know what imp?

55:37.920 --> 55:43.440
 Yeah, let's look at this. It's like a little. Is that a Tolkien character? Imp. Yeah,

55:43.440 --> 55:47.760
 might be. An imp is the European mythological being similar to a fairy or a demon. He called

55:47.760 --> 55:55.120
 me a fairy. Well, okay. Similar to a fairy or a demon. I feel like that's a big leap.

55:55.120 --> 56:00.480
 Big leap. Yeah, that's not a great info bio there. Frequently described in folklore and

56:00.480 --> 56:05.680
 superstition. The word may perhaps derive from the term imp, spelled with a Y.

56:05.680 --> 56:11.920
 You used to denote a young grafted tree. It's a little mischievous. You got a twinkle.

56:11.920 --> 56:15.520
 You're this serious buttoned up guy, but this is a twinkle. There's a twinkle.

56:15.520 --> 56:19.280
 Wow. And the audience can see the twinkle. And that's why he resonate, I think.

56:21.280 --> 56:26.640
 Oh, sorry. Deep analysis by Mark Norman. Psychological analysis. Okay. But then

56:27.360 --> 56:31.200
 back to the crafting of the joke, you said Chris Rock and Norman Donnell, like what for you?

56:32.560 --> 56:36.640
 How do you know when the joke is like done? Are there some jokes when you're like,

56:36.640 --> 56:44.080
 are proud of like, wow, that's, that's well done. Yeah. Yeah. The joke is done. It's a tough question

56:44.080 --> 56:48.160
 because there's so many different kinds of jokes. It's what we call a chunk, which is a big idea

56:48.160 --> 56:54.480
 with a bunch of jokes in the middle of it and then a big crescendo at the end. Or there's a one liner

56:54.480 --> 57:00.400
 or there's a tag of a joke that's also a joke. So the joke's coming different.

57:01.440 --> 57:05.680
 Like I have a joke where I say, I met my girl on that Jewish app. What's that Jewish app called?

57:05.680 --> 57:15.840
 A PayPal. Nice. That's what the rest you want from the crowd. But it's a fun turn because you

57:15.840 --> 57:20.320
 say your thing and then I hit you with a misdirect. And that's what a joke is. If joke is basically

57:20.320 --> 57:25.280
 me saying something that makes sense, but you didn't see it coming. Yeah. And that's a perfect

57:25.280 --> 57:30.320
 example of that. So that joke took forever to figure out, by the way, you know, and you have to go

57:30.320 --> 57:35.840
 to different services like PayPal. What's funniest? Exactly. And I figured PayPal is funny because it

57:35.840 --> 57:41.920
 has the word pay in it. Yeah. You know, Venmo. It's also not really a good word. Venmo PayPal.

57:41.920 --> 57:45.760
 It just hits better. Yeah. PayPal is funnier somehow. It's funnier somehow. And that's the

57:45.760 --> 57:50.000
 beauty of comedy. There's a weird little magic into it. You can get technical all day and formulaic,

57:50.000 --> 57:55.040
 but there's still that little bit of a fairy dust that you don't know why this is funnier.

57:55.040 --> 58:02.640
 Or imp dust. Imp dust. Yes. For the why. Okay. So you know what joke is done when it kills and

58:02.640 --> 58:07.920
 it is a roundness to a joke when you feel like this is buttoned up. This is done here. It's

58:07.920 --> 58:13.200
 simplicity the right word there. Yeah. Is it like you're chopping stuff away or you're adding

58:13.200 --> 58:17.840
 stuff? Like what does it feel like? Simplicity is always the best angle. I mean, you can get

58:17.840 --> 58:22.400
 real high concept with a joke and still make it work, but the simpler, the better. I saw

58:22.400 --> 58:28.800
 Dave Chappelle on stage once and Chris Rock and Demetri Martin were in the back watching

58:28.800 --> 58:33.280
 in awe. And Dave Chappelle, I can't remember the joke, but he said something about sex or women.

58:33.840 --> 58:39.440
 And Demetri Martin goes, eh, it's a little easy. And Chris Rock goes, that's why it's good. And I

58:39.440 --> 58:44.320
 remember hearing that as a young comic like, I'm getting this like, you know, comedy lesson right

58:44.320 --> 58:50.400
 here for these two Titans. And so that was fun. Simple is key. So the easy is okay. That's such

58:50.400 --> 58:58.000
 a weird, I think I remember reading or hearing Eminem say something about maybe the song,

58:58.720 --> 59:05.440
 one of the songs, he's like, I knew it was going to be good because it got like really repetitive

59:05.440 --> 59:12.720
 and annoying very quickly. I mean, that's the sort of the music equivalent of it's too easy.

59:12.720 --> 59:20.160
 Like if it's like super catchy as a musician, you might get very quickly bored of it. Or like as

59:20.160 --> 59:25.840
 you're creating it now, it's too, it's too easy. It's like, there needs to be some more complexity

59:25.840 --> 59:32.480
 to it. But I like complexity, but the best guys who are the ones who make complex shit look simple.

59:33.440 --> 59:37.920
 Like you ever heard that, uh, Ben Franklin story where he's talking to his friend, his friend's

59:37.920 --> 59:44.400
 like, I'm going to start a hat store. So he puts a sign out says hats for sale, $12. And Ben

59:44.400 --> 59:48.960
 Franklin looks at it goes, uh, well, you don't need the $12 because you know, all they need to know

59:48.960 --> 59:52.640
 is that you got hats for sale. He's like, all right. So he loses the $12 makes a new sign hats

59:52.640 --> 59:57.120
 for sale. And he goes, you know, you don't really need for sale because it's a business. People

59:57.120 --> 1:00:01.600
 can put that together. So he just goes, all right, it makes a new sign. It says hats. And then Ben

1:00:01.600 --> 1:00:06.400
 Franklin's like, you know, you don't really need the word hat. You can just put a picture of a hat.

1:00:06.960 --> 1:00:10.480
 And he made a new sign, just a picture of a hat and like help the business or something. This is

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:15.280
 like some old wives tale or whatever. But I think about that all the time when I'm writing, I thought

1:00:15.280 --> 1:00:20.800
 this was going to like, there was no sign. It went like super like, that could work too.

1:00:22.960 --> 1:00:28.960
 What like as a comedian, some, I'm a fan of yours. I enjoy, I really enjoy you in conversations.

1:00:28.960 --> 1:00:34.800
 Like, because you're now getting nothing out of this. All right. I can't like emotion.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:41.600
 You're tough not to read cold inside. I mean, just the quickness you have. Obviously,

1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:47.520
 you're also a great standup comedian. What's your favorite medium to shine in? So you have a

1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:53.760
 podcast yourself, an excellent podcast. Thanks. You're often a podcast guest. Yeah.

1:00:54.880 --> 1:00:58.480
 Which is always fun to listen to how you're going to deal with the different people.

1:00:58.480 --> 1:01:04.000
 You're great on Rogan. Oh, thanks. What, what do you enjoy most?

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.760
 Podcasts are great because you can, you can stretch out a little more. You can breathe a

1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:12.080
 little, you know, with a standup set. I like to be like, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. But

1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:16.480
 podcasts are great because it's conversational. So you can be, it's almost like you're being

1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:21.360
 funny with your friends. Whereas the stage is like a, this is a piece. This is a presentation.

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:28.080
 But I think the, the podcast is great, but you don't get the reaction unless the host is laughing.

1:01:28.080 --> 1:01:32.640
 You can't hear the guy in his car in New Jersey driving to work on, ah, every now and

1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:35.360
 I'll read a comment like, I spit out my coffee when you said this. And I'm like,

1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:40.800
 but it's not immediate. You want the immediate. So standup will always be number one, but there's

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:46.640
 no better feeling than killing in a room of people who don't know who you are strangers.

1:01:46.640 --> 1:01:50.960
 You're in the middle of nowhere. You left your wife at home. You left your kids. You left your

1:01:50.960 --> 1:01:57.200
 house. You're in the middle of bumfuck, Dickville and murdering for these hillbilly, nobody,

1:01:57.200 --> 1:02:03.600
 whatever it is. And they're slinging their beers and cheering you on and they carry out and you

1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:09.200
 fuck some fat lady and you leave and you get back to your hotel and you go, holy shit. What was that?

1:02:09.200 --> 1:02:15.600
 No one will ever know about it. Just lost in the ether. That's the best feeling. Yeah. Killing

1:02:15.600 --> 1:02:21.600
 an obscurity is Bill Burwood say. Yeah. This is one of the things that sucks about giving lectures

1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:31.280
 like at universities or giving lectures in general is when you look at the audience,

1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:36.800
 you know, several hundred students, they all have a bored look on their face. Yeah, of course.

1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:42.160
 Like even like my, my face now probably looks bored, but I'm actually excited to be talking to you.

1:02:42.160 --> 1:02:47.440
 But there's something about just, there's something about a comedy club. Maybe this is the

1:02:47.440 --> 1:02:52.080
 contingent of laughter, but like it gives people the freedom to just laugh, to like,

1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:57.920
 to remove the facade of like, you don't have to, you don't have to pretend like you don't care.

1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:03.680
 Like if you care, you can show it and have fun with it. Probably liquor is helpful too.

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:08.400
 It helps for sure. But there is a, especially, and that's why comedy I think is so popular

1:03:08.400 --> 1:03:15.280
 right now because HR is up our ass. We're scared of old tweets that might come back to haunt us.

1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:19.920
 What did I say on that interview? Even people at offices are like, I put something on Facebook

1:03:19.920 --> 1:03:26.720
 in 1999. That was about fat tits that I liked. Should I get rid of that? Even people say like,

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:31.920
 there's no cancel, whatever. There is something in the air right now and that wasn't there before.

1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:36.480
 Yeah. It's the video. I'm a Karen. I got caught at Trader Joe, whatever it is. This,

1:03:36.480 --> 1:03:40.080
 people rat on each other now. Everybody's tattletailing because they want the clicks. It's

1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:47.520
 a horrible society we've crafted. But stand up comedy gets you to come out and now people do

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:51.760
 it at stand up shows too, sadly, but it gets you to come out and let that inhibition down.

1:03:51.760 --> 1:03:56.160
 Like, because we're all human. We've all had the fucked up thoughts like, man, that guy's fat as

1:03:56.160 --> 1:03:59.440
 shit. It doesn't mean you hate the guy. It doesn't mean you hate fat people. It doesn't mean you're fat

1:03:59.440 --> 1:04:03.280
 shaming, but you can't say that at the office. You can't go, Bob, you're fat as shit. You'll get

1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:09.200
 fired for body shaming. But at the club, you go, that guy's fat as shit. The crowd goes, he is

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:14.080
 fat as shit. And it's this weird cathartic thing because all we do is tamp shit down.

1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:17.520
 It's kind of like you ever meet a girl who's like all prim and proper in the bedroom. She's like,

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:23.120
 put a lamp up my ass, you know, whatever it is. It's because we got to get it out. We're all

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:27.360
 repressed in some way. So I guess what you're saying is comedy is important.

1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:36.880
 Yes. Callback. Go play it, sir. What do you think about Austin? What do you think about the comedy

1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:41.440
 scene, Austin? We'll talk about LA, New York. What do you think about what Joe's trying to create

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:48.640
 there? So I should say that the reason I moved to Austin, I have this dream of, it wouldn't be

1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:55.360
 funny if I said this dream of becoming a comedian. An audience at least. Yeah, that's true. You know,

1:04:55.360 --> 1:04:59.920
 I would say you can hear the music in the distance. I have this dream around robotics and

1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:04.240
 artificial intelligence, whether it's a company, whether it's something else that I was just pulling

1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:08.800
 me to do. I actually wanted to move to San Francisco and then all my friends in San Francisco said,

1:05:08.800 --> 1:05:19.280
 no, it's the wrong place. At this time, the cynicism there is just not conducive to taking

1:05:19.280 --> 1:05:24.560
 big leaps into the unknown, excited about the future kind of thing. And Austin was that,

1:05:26.400 --> 1:05:30.400
 for me in particular with Elon Musk, but also just the energy that everybody had,

1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:37.040
 including Joe, the excitement about the future. I don't care if Austin burns to the ground and

1:05:37.040 --> 1:05:43.760
 it actually is a complete failure. Being excited about the future seems to be like optimism about

1:05:43.760 --> 1:05:49.120
 the future. It seems to be the thing that actually makes that future happen, makes a great future

1:05:49.120 --> 1:05:57.680
 happen. So it's always cool for me to see Joe super excited about creating a culture in Austin,

1:05:59.200 --> 1:06:05.440
 making it a comedy hub. I don't want to overstate it, but I think he really believes it'll be a

1:06:05.440 --> 1:06:11.760
 very big place for comedy in the United States in general in the world. And so just even believing

1:06:11.760 --> 1:06:19.760
 that, that's powerful. You start to make it happen. That energy is there. Anyway, so that's

1:06:19.760 --> 1:06:26.000
 for me from just an outsider watching the fun of it. I should also mention for less of an outsider,

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:32.400
 more insider in the martial arts world, partially probably because of Joe, I'm not sure, like John

1:06:32.400 --> 1:06:40.400
 Donahar, Gordon Ryan, the B team, all those folks, that might be gibberish to you, but those are

1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:44.880
 like some of the greatest grapplers and martial artists of all time. So it's also becoming this

1:06:44.880 --> 1:06:51.920
 hub of martial arts. So the whole thing is just beautiful. Anyway, what are your thoughts about

1:06:51.920 --> 1:06:58.560
 that scene? Well, there's a lot here, a lot of things to mention. One, I think Joe did do that

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:04.400
 to a degree. Like all these people with Segura lives there now. A lot of comics live there.

1:07:04.400 --> 1:07:09.360
 He's opening clubs. Other clubs are opening. I think it's happening. That's the other thing is

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:13.200
 people go, everybody's moving to Austin. Austin's the new hub. And then they look at their watch

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:18.720
 and they go, five minutes went by, nothing changed. It's going to take years, but everybody wants it

1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:25.360
 now, now, now. Well, Austin, there's no industry there. There's no Netflix, whatever. And you're

1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:29.200
 like, yeah, I know, but it needs a minute. You can't just do this overnight. So people forget

1:07:29.200 --> 1:07:34.480
 that. So it could happen huge. Just give it some time. I mean, he's opening a club. I went and

1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:40.000
 saw it. It's incredible. Like it's so perfect for comedy. It's every detail. It's incredible. But

1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:48.320
 so it could happen still. I do think there's a little biting off more than they can chew with

1:07:48.320 --> 1:07:54.480
 Austin because it's not that big. It's spread out. I mean, yeah, it's not big. And the infrastructure

1:07:54.480 --> 1:08:01.520
 is not quite there to support it. But it has a lot of, you know, comparing from the tech side,

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:06.640
 it has a lot of land to expand into. So it might become this. That helps.

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:11.520
 Like you're basically establishing, it's kind of like New York. You're establishing these whole

1:08:11.520 --> 1:08:17.280
 neighborhoods. And you have the freedom to do that because there's a lot of space on all sides.

1:08:17.280 --> 1:08:24.880
 Yes. Okay. So that helps. So again, maybe some time. I do agree with this, that new hope that's

1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:29.760
 kind of built into human beings of like, let's go to America. Let's go to the utopia. We even have

1:08:29.760 --> 1:08:35.680
 it with space. Let's go to Mars. We got to see what's over there. And it's just red, dusty bullshit.

1:08:35.680 --> 1:08:40.000
 But you still got to go. So I'm with you on that about this new hope, this new land.

1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:45.040
 And I think that is beautiful. And I think there's a lot of haters. I think there's a lot of

1:08:45.040 --> 1:08:49.600
 naysayers who hate change, who hate anything new. And then I think you got to go, Hey,

1:08:49.600 --> 1:08:56.000
 that hurts. That sucks. But blow me dickless. I'm trying something. You're a loser. Stop hating on

1:08:56.000 --> 1:09:01.760
 me. I mean, how many people hate Elon Musk, you know? Yeah, it's hilarious. I mean, there's some

1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:07.360
 of the criticism on Austin would be, it's like a fad. Like a lot of people are really people are

1:09:07.360 --> 1:09:12.720
 excited about Austin. And somehow that's like, it's like when Green Day became famous, you no

1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:19.040
 longer want to be a fan of Green Day. But to me, like this. Austin was already a cool town. Like

1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:24.240
 every comic five years ago was like, Oh, I got Austin this weekend. I can't wait. So it already

1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:30.320
 had a buzz. But some people think maybe the buzz was the cool part. The fact that it was like this

1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:37.280
 off the beaten path city. And now I get to visit it and then leave. But I think it could still be

1:09:37.280 --> 1:09:43.280
 this comedy tech booming place. It just will take some time and people want it right now. Well,

1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:51.600
 on the tech side, it's, it's already there. It's getting there very fast. So I mean, Elon's really

1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:58.400
 pushing that with the factory. It's just a huge number of people are moving there with jobs.

1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:03.200
 Like you're already starting. And then the opportunities to launch new companies is just

1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:08.960
 incredible. I guess it's not right now. It's like within months, within a year, that kind of thing.

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:15.200
 But like, it's an opportunity to just start to build shit in a new place. And it's cool. It's

1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:20.640
 kind of like, you know, go to Mars, like we get to start over. Yeah. And I like the hope aspect.

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:27.280
 I think that's huge for people. And I'm all for it. I hope it works out. I don't know if it will.

1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:33.280
 But I don't know anything about economies and city scans, planning and all that shit. So it

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:37.760
 might be too early to say, but I hope it works. He's still talking about Austin or Mars?

1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:44.320
 Austin. Mars is, there's nothing there. There's no vagina there. There's no food there. There's no

1:10:44.320 --> 1:10:50.560
 water there. I don't know. It seems, I get space travel. I think it's important, but I don't know

1:10:50.560 --> 1:10:59.680
 Mars is really going to move the needle. So what are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX and

1:10:59.680 --> 1:11:04.720
 launching rockets into space? I think it's all good because you could say, Hey, we could just

1:11:04.720 --> 1:11:08.960
 feed everybody. And I was like, Yeah, that's true. By the way, these guys give a ton of money to like

1:11:08.960 --> 1:11:15.600
 philanthropy shit that nobody cares about. By the way, you know, it's weird. Like he could feed Nigeria

1:11:15.600 --> 1:11:20.560
 and with pocket change of his and you're like, Well, maybe he has, you know, like I heard Bill

1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:26.000
 Gates gave back so much money to save 6 million lives. But that's a reverse Holocaust, by the way.

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:33.440
 That's pretty good. What have you done? You're a barista. So, you know, I just think I think

1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:39.040
 space travel is good because you learn about the place you're living in from going to space.

1:11:39.600 --> 1:11:43.680
 It kind of helps you learn about this more. You could say, What's the point of going to

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:49.760
 this other there? But it does help, I think. Yeah, doing difficult things in the engineering space

1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:56.000
 seems to be a way to develop like as a, as almost like an accident, as a side effect of doing a

1:11:56.000 --> 1:12:00.960
 really difficult thing in a team of brilliant people, you develop things like the internet.

1:12:00.960 --> 1:12:04.880
 And you could argue that the internet maybe is not so good for society. No, I'm just kidding.

1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:09.520
 That's good and bad. Yeah. But it's like a pull up. You're trying to get your bicep going. But

1:12:09.520 --> 1:12:13.360
 hey, before you know, you got decent forearms, but you weren't working on the forearms. You

1:12:13.360 --> 1:12:17.440
 wanted to buy, but you got the four. And I think that's kind of what space travel is.

1:12:18.400 --> 1:12:22.000
 I like how this like pivoted into a workout routine advice.

1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:26.320
 I'm trying to get an analogy going here. All right. They work pretty well.

1:12:26.320 --> 1:12:32.080
 I'll take it. All right. What are your thoughts about, since I'm a robotics person,

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:38.640
 I'd be curious to see like what do you think about the space at all about first of all,

1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:45.760
 autonomous vehicles with Tesla autopilot and Waymo self driving car. I'm not sure if you're

1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:50.800
 familiar with all the autonomous vehicles and so on. So those are robots on wheels.

1:12:50.800 --> 1:12:54.720
 And then there's also legged robots. So next time you're in Austin,

1:12:54.720 --> 1:13:01.840
 you get to meet some of the legged robots I've been working on. And I find those kind of

1:13:01.840 --> 1:13:11.280
 a fascinating way to explore the nature of intelligence in our computers, but also explore

1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:18.720
 our own intelligence and also explore our own like what makes us connect to other

1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:26.080
 living beings, whether it's dogs, cats, or other humans. Like there's some magic there

1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:31.760
 that's beyond just intelligence. And like when I have the robot dog, there's some aspect to it

1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:38.240
 that, I don't know, brings me joy in a way that a dog does, in a way that a good friend does.

1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:43.360
 Oh, that's interesting. And I'm not sure if that's some kind of anthropomorphism,

1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:50.800
 like where I'm projecting my hopes for this, what this thing is, but it's kind of built in.

1:13:50.800 --> 1:13:55.040
 I mean, it's just a source of joy. Maybe it's connected to the fact that there's just like

1:13:55.040 --> 1:14:03.200
 a loneliness within all of us, within me. And it's just nice to have other things in your life

1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:08.000
 that move, that recognize you, that kind of thing. I mean, I suppose it's nice to even just have a

1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:12.800
 plant. Yeah, it is plant goes a long way. You see a guy with plants in his apartment, it changes

1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:16.320
 the apartment because they're alive. You got a water room, you got to put sun on them. So yeah,

1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:20.400
 I think there's something there. And I think you can see people's reactions when you show them

1:14:20.400 --> 1:14:26.000
 them advanced technology, like these dog robots, or these robots that dance and shit, people are

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:32.000
 like, what the fuck, like it hits home in some way, whether it's fear or you want to fuck them

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:39.120
 clearly, whatever it is, but it does connect with you in some way. So I'm with you. And I think

1:14:39.120 --> 1:14:42.160
 this is why I don't think robots will take over. You always hear that robot, they're making them

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:47.680
 too advanced, they're going to wipe us out, blah, blah, blah. If robots get at human emotions,

1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:51.360
 that is scary because they could, they could get mad at us and kill us and they're stronger,

1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:55.040
 they don't need sleep, they don't need food, they don't need water, they don't get jealous,

1:14:55.040 --> 1:15:00.480
 you know, but if they have emotions, then I think we can dominate them because who's had

1:15:00.480 --> 1:15:05.280
 emotions, who knows emotions better than us. We've got thousands of years of evolutionary

1:15:05.280 --> 1:15:09.760
 emotional bullshit. We can go, hey, robot, I heard you, your wife fucked that black and

1:15:09.760 --> 1:15:17.440
 decker, huh? They're going to crumble. We can bully them. Emotionally manipulate robots. Yes,

1:15:17.440 --> 1:15:23.360
 that's when we'll win. Right now, they could kill us, they could just, we'd all die, then we shoot

1:15:23.360 --> 1:15:29.120
 them back, that's no good. But if they do get emotions, then we can go, hey, you look like

1:15:29.120 --> 1:15:32.640
 hell, what is that, a rusty bolt? Hey, you're dropping some oil there, you know, you loser.

1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:37.280
 I think we can win if they do get emotions. This goes back to your father being able to

1:15:37.280 --> 1:15:42.240
 undercut you with a single word. You're right. Yeah, so we're the creators of the robots and

1:15:42.240 --> 1:15:47.920
 then the robots will just, you would say the exact thing where the robot would be like,

1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:52.960
 that son of a bitch. And then it goes back to his hole and just sits there miserable.

1:15:52.960 --> 1:15:58.560
 Right, yeah, hardware looks more like software to me. You can't get it up. Yada, yada, yada.

1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:02.000
 Yeah. But I'm not worried about robots and I think self, what do you think about the

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:07.600
 self driving cars? Is that just wiping out the horse and buggy? Isn't that just progression

1:16:07.600 --> 1:16:12.800
 of technology? Yeah, so I don't know if you've driven it in a Tesla, for example. I have,

1:16:12.800 --> 1:16:18.560
 I wrote in the, uh, the past drive it. Yeah, there's several stages in that. I think it's the

1:16:18.560 --> 1:16:23.680
 problem is way harder than people realize. And for quite a while, it'll just make driving more

1:16:23.680 --> 1:16:29.840
 pleasant. It'll make it less stressful. It'll take over some of the boring bits for you and make

1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:35.760
 it easier. Like there's something that happens actually when the car is driving for you in

1:16:35.760 --> 1:16:40.000
 the following way. Like it's, it's staying in the lane. It's keeping distance to the car in front

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:45.520
 of you. Maybe it's changing lanes. It allows you to relax a little bit. Like you become,

1:16:46.480 --> 1:16:51.200
 you still have to be alert, but you become like a passenger and you get to like take in the world.

1:16:51.200 --> 1:16:58.960
 I mean, somehow that's more relaxing without making you necessarily like bored more. It's

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:03.440
 energizing more. So I just think it makes the driving experience more pleasant. But when you

1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:07.440
 actually fully automate cars, when you can just completely tune out and start reading a book

1:17:07.440 --> 1:17:15.920
 or go to sleep, that might change, uh, society like in ways we don't even understand because you'll

1:17:15.920 --> 1:17:23.040
 have, I mean, the, the, you'll probably change the nature of roads because the cars, because now

1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:30.240
 you can be super productive. And so no longer quite matters to you as much how long it takes to get

1:17:30.240 --> 1:17:37.120
 from point A to point B because you're not wasting that time. You just continue working. Yeah. It's

1:17:37.120 --> 1:17:43.120
 like public transit that comes to you. Exactly. And so they, there will be maybe less roads and

1:17:43.120 --> 1:17:47.360
 bigger roads and it will just change the nature of how we get from point A to point B. I think

1:17:47.360 --> 1:17:53.360
 you're right. But then couple that also with the fact that we seem to be more and more comfortable

1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:58.880
 existing in the digital world. Yeah. So like maybe we won't want to go outside more and more.

1:17:58.880 --> 1:18:02.800
 We'll just interact with each other virtually. And I don't mean Zoom meetings. I mean, just

1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:11.360
 in other ways that's, uh, that's, that's more fulfilling than a Zoom meeting. But then maybe

1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:17.280
 not because like there's something deeply uncompelling about Zoom meetings. Like podcasts

1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:23.440
 that are remote, unless they're super information dense, at least to me as a podcast fan, kind of

1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:27.760
 suck. They suck. There's no connected. It goes back to the dog thing with the Zoom. There's no

1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:32.320
 connection. Yeah. And we're not, you know, I don't understand why they're, we're not even making eye

1:18:32.320 --> 1:18:36.320
 contact. I know, but it's just something there. It's in the room. There's pheromones and that's

1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:41.520
 like out of our understanding probably. It's just some kind of weird biological, you know,

1:18:41.520 --> 1:18:47.440
 you ever have Cheerios in a bowl? The Cheerios tend to, they tend to go together. You see a

1:18:47.440 --> 1:18:50.800
 cluster of Cheerios. They're never really hanging out on the other side. And that's kind of how

1:18:51.440 --> 1:18:56.000
 people are in real life. I wonder what the physics of that is. So they, they, they come

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.760
 together and they stick. There's somebody with molecules. Yeah. I don't know, I can't remember

1:18:59.760 --> 1:19:03.680
 what it was, but it was fascinating. And I think that's how people are. And I think you try to

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:12.240
 write a TV show or, or craft a movie with your team, Zoom, nothing there. It's like phone sex

1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:18.640
 versus penetration. One day you'll learn that. I, I know nothing of either the, I look forward

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:23.360
 because I think there's a phone sex Netflix documentary that this is show or something

1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:28.000
 like that, that is really popular. I want to go watch. At least I can learn about that.

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:35.920
 Okay. I could send you some links on the internet. Yeah. Yeah. But yeah, self driving car,

1:19:35.920 --> 1:19:40.720
 I think it's just inevitable it's coming and these truckers are going to have to figure something out.

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.840
 Yeah. I mean, that's, that's an under understood industry actually, because there's not,

1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:51.520
 there's a lot of trucking jobs and people don't want to, well, people don't want to actually

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:57.120
 take them anymore because it's such a difficult job. So it won't have, or a lot of people believe

1:19:57.120 --> 1:20:02.640
 it won't have as big of a negative impact as folks anticipate. There'll be other automation.

1:20:02.640 --> 1:20:07.120
 I think they'll have a huge impact. Yeah. For sure. I mean, you already see it in McDonald's,

1:20:07.120 --> 1:20:11.280
 you go to the beep, beep, beep. Why do you want to get yelled at by the heavy set woman of color,

1:20:11.280 --> 1:20:15.120
 you know, for making a bad order when you can just, you know, hit the screen.

1:20:16.240 --> 1:20:21.840
 But those interactions I think are human. I mean, that's part of life. So it is scary taking away

1:20:21.840 --> 1:20:26.720
 everything. How long till we're not fucking? That's common too. Yeah. Then there's going to have two,

1:20:26.720 --> 1:20:32.240
 two types of people. Are you a fuck in real life? Are you a digital fuck person? I'm a digital. I

1:20:32.240 --> 1:20:37.920
 like real fucking. Sorry, we can't date. That's common. Well, there's also the, the reproduction

1:20:37.920 --> 1:20:44.480
 side of sex, which is like with genetic engineering, you'll be able to specify a little bit of

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:52.160
 details. I talked to Jamie Mertzo about that, like where you can specify, like,

1:20:53.200 --> 1:21:00.880
 you know, it'll start with like, I want my child not to have like a high likelihood of diabetes

1:21:00.880 --> 1:21:06.000
 or something like that. And then you get to specify like intelligence is get to specify those kinds

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:11.360
 of parameters until you're like basically trying to create a perfect human and you lose some of

1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:17.680
 the magic of the flaws that make us who we are. Yes. And, you know, I'm pretty sure in the full

1:21:17.680 --> 1:21:29.360
 lineup of humans, like, so let me give you some information. I'm sure you researched this thoroughly,

1:21:29.360 --> 1:21:42.160
 but a male of the human species of the Homo sapien produces 500 billion sperm cells in a lifetime. So

1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:51.120
 that's all some more than others. That's all uniquely genetically unique humans that you could

1:21:51.120 --> 1:21:58.160
 produce. So even across those 500 billion, you can select. And so I mean, like abort some or no,

1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:03.040
 you can choose which of them you want. I mean, just imagine all the genetic possibilities that

1:22:03.040 --> 1:22:12.480
 are there, like all the possible like you won the race. Yes. Shocking. This is all the 500

1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:19.200
 billion. You have to imagine what the competition was. Oh, just tarts all day long handicap.

1:22:19.840 --> 1:22:26.000
 Well, so it's not actually the fastest sperm or like it's I think a lot of his timing and luck.

1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:30.960
 That's what it seems like. There's actual papers on this and I've actually been reading them. I

1:22:30.960 --> 1:22:36.720
 hope so. So it's not just like the fastest sperm to the egg. Okay. There's a timing thing. So you

1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:42.480
 were just lucky. All right. I believe that. So it's interesting to think about like once you're

1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:51.040
 able to specify some parameters of what your child is like, how that changes the nature of

1:22:51.040 --> 1:23:02.160
 even just like the intimacy of two humans getting together and making creating together a child.

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:07.280
 Yeah. I mean, it changes it. It's almost like, I don't know, it becomes like a factory

1:23:09.120 --> 1:23:14.880
 line of some kind. If you don't meet naturally. Yeah. If you don't meet naturally and then you

1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:21.360
 don't and you get to optimize your child, then it's yeah, then it's something like you have to

1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:27.120
 consider utilitarian type of things like what's good for society and it'll probably be regulation

1:23:27.120 --> 1:23:32.160
 about what kind of children you can have and not like your child cannot have an IQ below this or

1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:39.040
 above this or something like that. Your child cannot. We already kind of do that with VIP clubs

1:23:39.040 --> 1:23:44.400
 like you're kind of ugly or women go, Hey, he's not tall enough. We kind of do it a little.

1:23:44.400 --> 1:23:49.280
 Yeah. Especially sexually. Yeah, we do. Can't get on the roller coaster if you're this short,

1:23:49.280 --> 1:23:53.840
 whatever it is, you know, we do it in some capacity. But here, this would be like

1:23:55.120 --> 1:24:01.840
 fully transparent and to a degree that it's hard to imagine. Like the way we currently do it,

1:24:01.840 --> 1:24:06.880
 you can at least get around it. Yes. You can at least like trick your way onto the roller coaster

1:24:06.880 --> 1:24:11.760
 even if you're short. Right. Or the fat guy can get rich so he can get laid. You know, there's other

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:19.200
 ways. At the risk of asking the totally wrong person this question, what advice would you

1:24:19.200 --> 1:24:25.760
 give to young people today in high school and college about how to have a successful career

1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:30.240
 or career that they're proud of or maybe have a life that they're proud of?

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:36.320
 Well, first of all, you got to be, you got to want a life you're proud of. Not everybody has

1:24:36.320 --> 1:24:44.480
 any integrity. A lot of people just want short money. I want to feel good, look good right now.

1:24:44.480 --> 1:24:50.880
 I want to do Molly. Boom. I'll feel good, you know, but you should space it out. It's almost

1:24:50.880 --> 1:24:55.360
 like saving money so you can use it later. Nobody wants to save money. What do they say? Like 11%

1:24:55.360 --> 1:25:01.840
 of America actually has money saved? A thousand dollars or some shit? It's wildly low. Everybody

1:25:01.840 --> 1:25:09.280
 wants it now, now. What do you call it? Immediate gratification. I think the key to happiness and

1:25:09.280 --> 1:25:15.760
 satisfaction is working for something. Even if it's, it's like a baby. If you could have a baby

1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:20.720
 in five minutes, if a woman, you got to, you jizzed in her and she had a baby, oh five minutes,

1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:26.480
 boom, newborn, healthy. I think you'd be more likely to throw it away if you could make it that

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:32.880
 quick. It's the fact that you spent nine months backbreaking the labor, the lactating, the ripped

1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:38.160
 placenta and the hymen or whatever the fuck. That's what makes you love it. And I think it's the same

1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:43.600
 with comedy or, or making money or whatever. Look at these kids who, who like child stars,

1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:48.240
 they all become heroin addicts at like 22 because they've just, their sensors are burned out,

1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:53.040
 their pleasure sensors. You didn't have to earn it. I think earning it is a big part of life

1:25:53.040 --> 1:26:00.080
 and always try to do better, try to do more, try to learn new things. Hey, I'm bored, life sucks,

1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:05.360
 life, play the piano then you chuch, but you, you won't do it because it takes effort and, and

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:10.880
 failure and all that, but that's the good part. And I know it's hard to see. So I think that's,

1:26:11.440 --> 1:26:17.680
 that's a good, good key to life is work hard at something you care about and then love the result.

1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:23.280
 The, the hard work, the journey is actually way more important than just getting something.

1:26:23.280 --> 1:26:28.320
 Everybody wants to go on Amazon. I got a package. Then you feel good for 10 seconds and let's go

1:26:28.320 --> 1:26:34.240
 on Amazon again. And then you just, it's just a dumb cycle of you being disgusting and gluttonous.

1:26:34.800 --> 1:26:38.720
 So work for it. Everybody wants to take steroids and just, I'm buff.

1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:41.600
 What'd you point at me? Well, I'm just saying Russian or what?

1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:48.720
 Well, I saw the, the Icarus, but no, I'm not saying you're on Roy's. I'm just, you'd be way bigger,

1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:55.680
 but I'm just saying, you know, work for something. And then I would also, young people eat shit early,

1:26:56.480 --> 1:27:01.920
 eat shit early. I know a guy who kind of got canceled or whatever, and he had an out early,

1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:07.520
 but he tried to get by and he tried to ride it and it all came crumbling down. But if he had

1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:13.120
 eaten it early, like, yeah, I fucked up. I did that, whatever it was, he would have, he would

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:17.920
 have just kind of been, been shit on for a month and then it would have gone away. But now it's

1:27:17.920 --> 1:27:22.480
 his whole identity and that sucks. So eat shit early. And I know it's hard to see what I mean

1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:28.640
 early. I'm in the present, but look ahead, look back. This time will pass. I mean, look at high

1:27:28.640 --> 1:27:33.760
 school. High school was the biggest thing in our lives. Oh my God, this exam. Susie Q hates me.

1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:37.600
 The football player beat me up. I'll never recover. Now you don't even think about high school. It's

1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:42.400
 just a blip in your dumb life, you know? And that's what this is now. This will just be a blip.

1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:50.800
 So remember that and work towards something and work hard and care about the result. If the result

1:27:50.800 --> 1:27:54.960
 isn't good, try it again. And failure is not always bad. Failure, we look at failure as this

1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:01.760
 end all be all. My life's over. I failed, but failure is really just learning. So that's something.

1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:10.320
 So in summary, eat shit early and eat shit often. Yes. All right. Mark Norman. Eat ass.

1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:17.600
 That's escalated quickly. All right. I have a list of random questions for you. What activities

1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:25.760
 make you lose track of time? Oh, have that go into that zone. You have this happiness

1:28:25.760 --> 1:28:32.080
 contentment about you that you just truly enjoy. Yeah. I think good conversation. I'll sit at

1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:37.840
 the comedy cellar with friends, maybe a little whiskey's flowing. And when you're really just

1:28:37.840 --> 1:28:46.240
 vibing and inhibiting. You can do it. What is it? Inhibited. Uninhibited. When you're just

1:28:46.240 --> 1:28:49.680
 vibing and you're uninhibited and you're saying crazy shit and you're laughing and you're not

1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:54.960
 worried, am I seeming cool right now? Am I seeming likable? When you're just you 100% and it's all

1:28:54.960 --> 1:28:59.040
 coming out of you and then they're saying stuff and you go back and forth and you feel that excitement.

1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:03.120
 Oh, they're talking, but I want to say my thing. And you know, you get all keyed up. I love that.

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:06.800
 And I look at my watch and I'm like, fuck, it's three in the morning. We've been talking for five

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:13.200
 hours. So I love that. That makes the time fly by. Also, I bought a, speaking of self driving cars,

1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:23.040
 I bought a 1973 BMW car and it's classic and it's stick shift and it's grizzly and gritty and

1:29:23.040 --> 1:29:28.160
 rusty and it's a bucket of bolts, but I love driving it. Bucket of bolts. Yeah. You're in

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:34.080
 town ways, you're poets. Have you taken like a long trip anywhere, like road trip in your life

1:29:34.080 --> 1:29:40.960
 or with this BMW? Not with it. It's pretty new, but I will. It's a new 1997. Yeah. It's new to me.

1:29:41.840 --> 1:29:46.320
 And it just, it goes in the face of everything we're doing now. Everything is digital. Everything

1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:51.680
 is automated. Everything is hands off. Everything is delivered and this is the most hands on thing

1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:56.720
 in the world. And I am dialed in, man. I got the tachometer. I keep an eye on that. Oh, I made,

1:29:56.720 --> 1:30:01.840
 I put the wrong gear and shit. Oh, it's about to stall. Put some gas, put some clutch and it's all

1:30:01.840 --> 1:30:09.440
 just brainpower and staying in focus and all that. And it's the opposite of tweeting and texting

1:30:09.440 --> 1:30:15.760
 and watching porn or whatever. So I almost needed that in my life. So I bought this car just to have

1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:22.160
 this little exercise. I hope you don't mind that I'm just trying out random questions I wrote on

1:30:22.160 --> 1:30:27.600
 you that are completely, they're like completely insane. I'm a guinea pig, jizz in my face.

1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:34.400
 Break it on, baby. This would be edited down to five minutes. If everyone on earth disappeared

1:30:34.400 --> 1:30:41.680
 and it was just you left, what would your days look like? What would you do? That's tough because

1:30:41.680 --> 1:30:49.440
 I'm already an introvert and I try to avoid people mostly. Like I won on one, but crowds and all that

1:30:49.440 --> 1:30:54.800
 is tough. So basically unchanged. Yeah. That's what I was going to say. But then that's the irony is

1:30:54.800 --> 1:31:01.120
 I would be so sad to not talk to anybody. So it's this weird, bitter sweet thing. But I don't know

1:31:01.120 --> 1:31:06.080
 what I would do, man. I guess it's kind of like when you're hungover, you just go into the primal

1:31:06.080 --> 1:31:13.920
 survival mode. I got to get food. I need water. I'm horny. Jerk off. You just go, you're not like

1:31:13.920 --> 1:31:21.200
 playing the piano or painting or at the gym. So I think I would just go in urges, man. Primal urges.

1:31:21.200 --> 1:31:28.640
 Find food. Store food. Am I safe? Make weapons. Build a shelter that I can't get attacked in.

1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:33.840
 I would go all survival mode. And then once I maybe realize if I was safe or not, there's no wild

1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:41.920
 roaming dogs. I would start exploring and maybe somehow get a vehicle and I would try to expand

1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:49.200
 and that would be it. And I maybe had journal. Exploring what to try to find new experiences.

1:31:49.200 --> 1:31:54.320
 New life. If there's other, maybe there is another guy out there. Oh, so always there's

1:31:54.320 --> 1:31:59.840
 the possibility. Yeah. Hope. And then maybe there's a better place I could live. Let's find that and

1:31:59.840 --> 1:32:04.800
 then moving on. Maybe there's more food over here. So yeah, the hope would drive me. But it would be

1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:10.400
 bleak and sad and horrible also. So what you're saying is you really want other people to be there

1:32:10.400 --> 1:32:17.840
 so you can hide from them. Yes. Well said. All right. What's the item on your bucket list that

1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:24.560
 you haven't done yet? Think about something you'd be very upset if you died and you haven't done.

1:32:24.560 --> 1:32:31.520
 Well, I'm terrified of having kids just because I'm a child myself and I'm selfish and lazy in a

1:32:31.520 --> 1:32:35.760
 way. So kids are like, this is your whole life now. This is it. You got to not let this thing die.

1:32:35.760 --> 1:32:40.080
 You got to love it. You got to raise it. So kids scare the shit out of me, but I also feel like

1:32:40.080 --> 1:32:47.600
 if I don't have them, I'll regret it. Well, you've seen so many people like you who are fundamentally

1:32:47.600 --> 1:32:56.080
 changed by kids. It's a source of happiness even though you didn't anticipate it. Yeah.

1:32:57.200 --> 1:33:04.400
 So you penciled it into your bucket list. Yes. It might be on there. Okay. You want kids?

1:33:04.400 --> 1:33:13.840
 Yeah. Well, I want kids. I want to get married. I want to have kids. I don't like choice.

1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:19.600
 So in the following way, I appreciate the value of scarcity and the power of scarcity.

1:33:19.600 --> 1:33:24.080
 I don't like the modern dating culture. It's not some religious thing, whatever. I just like

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:29.920
 one girl for a long time or at least swinging for that always, like swinging for the fences.

1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:34.160
 Well, you could be swinging right now. There's a different use of the word swinging. Sure,

1:33:34.160 --> 1:33:39.200
 sure. But I'm saying you could be, you look great, you're handsome, muscular. Thank you.

1:33:39.200 --> 1:33:42.480
 You get the job done. So I feel like you wouldn't leave without an orgasm on her.

1:33:42.480 --> 1:33:47.440
 Yeah. But I just like to, you know, about furries. I like to dress up as animals and

1:33:47.440 --> 1:33:51.120
 I just have trouble finding others who like the same. They're out there. I could show you some

1:33:51.120 --> 1:33:57.680
 chat rooms. You're also my coach for the internet. Okay. What are you most afraid of?

1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:07.760
 I guess on Unlived Life. I'm always a big fan growing up of like wild guys, you know,

1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:14.640
 like these Teddy Roosevelt's who would go out and hunt lions and like bar fighting guys. I was

1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:21.040
 obsessed with Hunter S. Thompson types. And look, this is what I love about guys like,

1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:27.360
 who's a good example, like Hemingway. Hemingway was the manliest guy. He had the rifle and the

1:34:27.360 --> 1:34:32.720
 elephant gun and the whiskey and the riding and the women and the fistfights. But people forget

1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:36.640
 at the other side of that coin is I'm sure he was in a lot of hotel rooms weeping. I'm sure he was

1:34:36.640 --> 1:34:40.400
 lonely as fuck. I'm sure he had some wicked hangovers. I mean, he killed himself for Christ's

1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:46.720
 sake. So obviously he was dealing with something. So the key to me is having this adventurous life,

1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:52.640
 living to the fullest, doing crazy shit, scaring yourself, but also not killing yourself. Like

1:34:52.640 --> 1:35:00.080
 also not hating because I used to party a lot hard. I used to bang a lot of gals and the flip

1:35:00.080 --> 1:35:05.680
 side is like, this girl hates you now or you got herpes or you're hungover or your mom is like,

1:35:05.680 --> 1:35:10.720
 where are you? You never call me anymore. You're like, oh, my mom. Let ties go with my mom. I

1:35:10.720 --> 1:35:16.160
 got to connect. So there's a horrible side to the party animal. The Keith Richards, we don't see,

1:35:16.720 --> 1:35:22.880
 is not pretty. I mean, he's already weird looking, but he's partying, he's smoking, he's living,

1:35:22.880 --> 1:35:28.560
 but there's another side of that coin. And I think the key to life is living that fucking crazy,

1:35:28.560 --> 1:35:37.360
 awesome, badass life and also having some meaning and a little bit of what's the word,

1:35:38.240 --> 1:35:43.040
 not just not killing yourself, not going sad, not being depressed. There's a medium there,

1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:49.520
 a sweet spot. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. So taking big leaps and

1:35:50.560 --> 1:35:55.760
 having way, grabbing life by the balls, but at the same time not crushing the balls that metaphor

1:35:55.760 --> 1:36:01.040
 work at all. Perfect. Look, evil can evil. We all know him. What a badass, fearless. Oh,

1:36:01.040 --> 1:36:05.600
 man, what a cool dude. He's got balls of steel, but he's also lived like the back half of his

1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:11.760
 life in a fucking Marka Lounger where his legs were made of steel and he couldn't see straight

1:36:11.760 --> 1:36:17.520
 and his dick didn't work. So you know what I mean? You got to have a balance, but you still want

1:36:17.520 --> 1:36:24.240
 to balance. I'm willing to take a little bit of shit for a little bit of fun, but you don't want

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:31.040
 to go too hard. You got to still risk it. I mean, Hunter S. Thompson, it didn't end well, but

1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:37.440
 it's quite a ride. Quite a ride. What small act of kindness were you once shown that you will never

1:36:37.440 --> 1:36:45.600
 forget? Wow, that's a great question. I just wrote these for the guinea pig. You're the guinea

1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:49.920
 pig. That's great. That's a keeper. Okay, that's a keeper. This is where like workshopping questions

1:36:49.920 --> 1:36:56.160
 take. All right, I'll take it. Now you're open biking. This is your version. Let's see. There's

1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:00.720
 a couple of ladies in high school who were kind enough to hand job me. That was nice,

1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:04.800
 which I really appreciate. I don't think women know how much that means to us. You know, women

1:37:04.800 --> 1:37:08.320
 are like, I'm not a piece of meat or whatever. And you're like, I know, but if you just gave me a

1:37:08.320 --> 1:37:14.080
 hand job, it would make my world. It's like telling a kid he's smart or loved. See, most people

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:20.160
 mentioned like a math teacher middle school that would inspire them to get into science. Give a

1:37:20.160 --> 1:37:24.160
 shout out to the... Well, that's part of it. That's not the nicest, but I'm just saying that goes a

1:37:24.160 --> 1:37:32.160
 long way. All right. Let's see. Kindness. That's a great question. I want to give you a good answer.

1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:38.080
 I got lost when I was like six. I was walking around my dad and I zoned out and went away.

1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:42.880
 And next thing you know, I don't know where I am. I'm in a neighborhood. This old guy

1:37:42.880 --> 1:37:49.200
 finds me crying on a lawn somewhere and he goes, uh, come inside and he tried to call my parents

1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:55.200
 and nothing came of it. Eventually they found me after like nine hours. Cops were there. The FBI

1:37:55.200 --> 1:38:00.160
 is out there. Fucking helicopters. And I guess, you know, that's nice. This old guy took me in

1:38:00.160 --> 1:38:07.280
 for a couple hours and just sat me down and kept me safe. That's something. Yeah. Oh, how about

1:38:07.280 --> 1:38:16.720
 Enus? My transvestite nanny. Very kind. He, uh, did you hear about this? No. Okay. We had this

1:38:16.720 --> 1:38:21.040
 transvestite nanny. He was like a drag queen, but it was in the 90s. It was weird. It was new.

1:38:21.760 --> 1:38:26.880
 And, uh, my bike got stolen and he, you know, my parents like, Hey, what are you going to do?

1:38:26.880 --> 1:38:30.960
 They're poor kids, you know? And he was like, fuck it. Let's, we're going to go get that bike.

1:38:30.960 --> 1:38:37.440
 And I was like, this guy's in a wig and high heels, big black guy. And I'm like, uh, what are you

1:38:37.440 --> 1:38:42.160
 going to do? You know, it's gone. And he's like, no, we're going to go get it. So we got in the van

1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:47.360
 and drove around my neighborhood, saw the kids fuck with the bike, you know, five street tuffs.

1:38:48.080 --> 1:38:52.480
 And, uh, he goes, all right, you want to come out or should I just do this? And I was like,

1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:58.640
 you do it. I'm terrified. What are you crazy? And he got out of the van in full, you know,

1:38:58.640 --> 1:39:03.440
 heels and wig. And he went up to these guys and they went off. Oh my God, look at this fucking guy,

1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:09.520
 homo, fagging, all this shit. You know, it's the 90s. And he just stared at them long enough to

1:39:09.520 --> 1:39:13.280
 where they were kind of like, all right, well, I guess we're going to fight you now. And he goes,

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:17.440
 that's not your bike. And they go, what are you going to do about it? And he puts his hand on

1:39:17.440 --> 1:39:21.760
 the middle of the bike and they didn't do anything. And he just picked it up and said, that's what I

1:39:21.760 --> 1:39:26.720
 thought. Put the bike over shoulder, slid the van door open, threw the bike in and we drove off.

1:39:26.720 --> 1:39:31.600
 Somebody stuck up for you. Yeah. And you know, I mean, he could have got, I mean,

1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:38.880
 they had tools. They could have fucking tuned him up two seconds. That actually like takes courage.

1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:45.520
 Oh yeah. Real courage. And then that, the reason you do and act like that is that

1:39:46.320 --> 1:39:51.920
 makes a kid like you feel like there's somebody on your side. That's powerful. Someone on your side

1:39:51.920 --> 1:39:58.720
 is big. Is big. That goes a long way. Especially when they have the risk of getting their ass kicked

1:39:58.720 --> 1:40:06.000
 or their job taken away or whatever it is. Now we're going to get philosophical, maybe a little

1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:14.640
 bit emotional. Would you rather lose all your old memories or never be able to make new ones?

1:40:14.640 --> 1:40:24.160
 It's a tough one, but I'd go easy answer, make new ones. But don't you think all the shitty

1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:30.720
 things that happen to you? Oh, so my hard drive is wiped clean. It's not, is it memories or is it

1:40:30.720 --> 1:40:37.280
 how every memory affected me too? I mean, this is a very... How do they go hand in hand? I think

1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:42.800
 the reality about memories is you replay them often. You go back to them, even when you're not

1:40:42.800 --> 1:40:48.560
 aware of it. You really go back often like that. And they change. You change them too. Yeah, you

1:40:48.560 --> 1:40:56.640
 change them to suit your understanding of the world. Yes. And so the dark view you have,

1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:04.160
 both the hope and the cynicism you have about the world is so deeply grounded in the memories

1:41:04.160 --> 1:41:10.480
 that you're basically, I would say, if you erase all memories, I think you're really starting over

1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:18.800
 with maybe the wisdom of how the world works, but not so much your personality's gone. You would

1:41:18.800 --> 1:41:24.800
 really... It'd be interesting how your comedy would change. Maybe you would have a good sense

1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:31.760
 of timing. You would have a good sense of the writing process, maybe, but like...

1:41:33.040 --> 1:41:36.720
 Now you're making some good points, but let me ask you this. Let's say I go to Lake Cuomo with

1:41:36.720 --> 1:41:45.280
 my girlfriend. Now, I keep my old memories. Let's say I go to the Tuscany with the lady.

1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:50.000
 I just won't remember that. Yeah, but you get to experience it in the moment.

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.640
 Okay. You get to enjoy it. Can I look at a photo of it?

1:41:55.120 --> 1:42:01.360
 Yes. But what the hell is this? Yeah, exactly. Oh, fascinating. It's exact. The rules are pretty

1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:08.000
 simple. I think everyone knows how the rules go. Yeah, so what... Well, I was going to say start

1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:12.080
 new ones, but then I realized I wouldn't be who I was without them. That's what you're saying.

1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:17.680
 So I guess I'd keep them because I am 38, so I've gotten a good chunk out of life.

1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:22.160
 Yeah. And let's be honest, how many years do you have left? I know, right? I got eights.

1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:28.320
 Is it better to have loved... Okay, this question is ridiculous. Is it better to have loved than

1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:33.600
 lost or to have never loved at all? It sounds cliche, but there's a question.

1:42:34.400 --> 1:42:39.520
 Definitely better to loss. So you enjoy the ups and downs? Yeah, that's life.

1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:46.320
 We're sun and rain, baby. I kind of like both the whole thing. The loss,

1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:54.160
 every time you lose something, it really makes you distinctly realize how much you valued it.

1:42:54.160 --> 1:43:02.880
 Yes. When I'm sad, when I'm feeling alone, and I'm sitting there alone at home,

1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:10.480
 and I wish I could hang out with somebody, that's like a realization how awesome people are.

1:43:10.480 --> 1:43:17.120
 Yeah. So it's like the missing the... Yeah. We don't have a lot of that in life anymore,

1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:21.200
 because we can have anything we want immediately. So the missing has gone away, which again

1:43:21.200 --> 1:43:28.080
 drives down the joy of having it. So I think you're right. You need both.

1:43:29.120 --> 1:43:34.160
 So like you said, you have a condition, a terminal condition, not much, many years left.

1:43:34.160 --> 1:43:38.560
 Do you think about your mortality? You think about that? All day, every day.

1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:43.120
 Are you afraid? Not afraid, because it's inevitable. So it's more like,

1:43:43.840 --> 1:43:48.560
 what are we, how are we going to handle this? It's like the winter is coming. Let's stock up on

1:43:48.560 --> 1:43:54.320
 some nuts. The existential nature of it, the fact that this ride ends, what the hell are you doing

1:43:54.320 --> 1:44:01.520
 any of this for? Satisfaction, cappiness? Short term, but there is a presumption there

1:44:02.400 --> 1:44:06.880
 that it kind of goes on forever. I think if you truly think about the fact that it ends...

1:44:08.640 --> 1:44:15.120
 Your brain almost shuts it down. There's some kind of protective switch that just goes off.

1:44:15.120 --> 1:44:21.600
 I mean, that's why the Stoics encourage people to meditate on death because it somehow

1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:28.240
 reorganizes your priorities. It helps you like, holy shit, this ends, make the most of the day.

1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:32.800
 Yes. It's just a nice thing, but still you can't quite comprehend that the thing ends.

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:39.120
 Little things too. People go like, oh, we got a layover between our flights. It's an hour.

1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:42.400
 What are we going to do for an hour? It's like, maybe what are you going to do for an hour?

1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:47.200
 You're going to kill an hour. How are we going to kill this hour? This is part of your life.

1:44:47.200 --> 1:44:50.080
 You're just trying to get rid of it? You're just trying to kill it? That always blew my mind.

1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:55.680
 Like, hey, fuck it. Let's go hit the airport bar. Let's get a candy bar or something,

1:44:55.680 --> 1:45:01.840
 anything with bar. But it's just, you've got to live. I hate this. How are we going to burn?

1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:05.840
 Oh, the bar didn't open for 15 minutes. What are we going to do? Well, we got 15 minutes.

1:45:05.840 --> 1:45:10.640
 We got the world as our oyster. Yeah, I make the most of it. And like you said,

1:45:10.640 --> 1:45:16.400
 in modern day, actually the boredom is a gift. Like when you're waiting for something,

1:45:16.400 --> 1:45:22.720
 that's a gift. You get to be with your thoughts. Those are the same thoughts you'll have when

1:45:22.720 --> 1:45:29.600
 you're on your deathbed. There won't be a, you won't be scrolling TikTok on your deathbed.

1:45:29.600 --> 1:45:33.040
 I hope not. Jesus. You'd be a little more, actually, maybe you would be.

1:45:33.040 --> 1:45:37.360
 What a sad existence. Because it would be a good, like content creators would be like,

1:45:37.360 --> 1:45:42.880
 ooh, I'm dying. This would be good content. Yeah. I want to be able to film the exact moment.

1:45:42.880 --> 1:45:48.800
 It goes, like, last words. I wonder what my last words will be. It's a good way to like

1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:53.440
 end the account with a bang. Yep. I like that. Well, you know that you've ever seen that meme

1:45:53.440 --> 1:45:58.560
 where the old guy in bed, he goes, I wish I had tweeted more, you know, and then he dies. It's

1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:02.160
 so true. Could be the future. What do you think is the meaning of life?

1:46:02.160 --> 1:46:09.120
 I don't think there is one. Everybody always throws that out there. There isn't a meaning. I think

1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:13.280
 we're here. We're lucky to be here. I think there's no afterlife. There's no heaven. That's,

1:46:13.280 --> 1:46:17.120
 that's all shit. We tell ourselves to feel better. And I think you got to just,

1:46:17.680 --> 1:46:24.880
 it's like saying, what is the meaning of this food I made? Well, it's just you enjoy the food.

1:46:24.880 --> 1:46:32.000
 You try to get the most out of it. You built the food. You prepared it. So just get what you

1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:39.680
 can out of it. Don't die and try to make it last as long as possible. Yeah. But you look at earth.

1:46:39.680 --> 1:46:46.240
 It's like four billion years old and life started early on, like, like simple cell

1:46:46.240 --> 1:46:51.840
 bacteria life, like a one billion years in. And then it started like having lots of

1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:58.000
 aggressive interaction. Eventually there's predator and prey and there's sex, lots of sex,

1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:03.600
 lots of sex, lots of violence. Oh yeah. And then, you know, through natural selection,

1:47:03.600 --> 1:47:10.160
 there's just a whole evolutionary process of, of animals that have loved and lost and murdered

1:47:10.160 --> 1:47:14.560
 and gotten murdered and all that kind of stuff. And it's somehow led to human civilization. We're

1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:19.440
 super busy trying to create things and creating beautiful art, creating beautiful comedy.

1:47:20.160 --> 1:47:26.320
 Yeah. Just always creating something new. It feels like it's tending towards something like,

1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:32.400
 it's not dying. If you die tomorrow, you still have all these hours of pods. So it's kind of,

1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:36.640
 you're thinking of cheating death in a subconscious way, I think. Right. You know who

1:47:36.640 --> 1:47:42.720
 Ernest Becker is and. I've heard the name. It's a book called The Now of Death, this idea that,

1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:51.360
 that if you don't acknowledge. Books on my show. Girls love it. Really? Like Dostoyevsky. No, I'm

1:47:51.360 --> 1:47:57.040
 just, I'm saying, you want to bring Tolstoy Dostoyevsky, Russian literature. It's back to norm.

1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:03.440
 It's good to bring to, because no American has read any Russian literature, but they all appreciate

1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:06.720
 it if you bring it. And it's not like they're going to ask you and you'll generate questions

1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:10.640
 because they haven't read it. Yep. So you can always pretend like you've read it. So it's a.

1:48:10.640 --> 1:48:13.360
 It's a little dense. Can we get a shortened version?

1:48:14.160 --> 1:48:20.160
 Cliff notes. Yes. Or make a movie with Ben Stiller that I can just go, oh, this is based on

1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:27.440
 what is it? Life and death? No, it's the one. War and peace. War and peace. Yeah. So Ernest

1:48:27.440 --> 1:48:32.560
 Becker's theory and there's this whole terror management theory that basically says that like

1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:40.160
 our terror of death, our fear of death is one of the central creative forces of the human condition.

1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:45.360
 It's the reason we're trying to, yeah, cheat death. We're trying to delude ourselves that somehow we

1:48:45.360 --> 1:48:49.760
 can become immortal through our art. That's why you've uploaded your special to YouTube because

1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:55.440
 you think your special will outlive all of human civilization. You think YouTube will

1:48:55.440 --> 1:48:59.600
 outlive all of human civilization. That can go away tomorrow. That can go away tomorrow.

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:07.600
 All of this can go away. So I'm truly grateful, Mr. Mark Norman, that you would spend your very

1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:12.080
 valuable time with me today, even though it could all go away. This could be the last day of our

1:49:12.080 --> 1:49:18.160
 lives. And won't you be quite upset? This is how you spent it. Ah, yeah, in your hotel room. What

1:49:18.160 --> 1:49:23.760
 am I? You're like Harvey Weinstein here. You've screwed me up and now I feel fucked. Just wait

1:49:23.760 --> 1:49:29.120
 what we have ready for you after the podcast is over. All right, brother. Thanks so much for
