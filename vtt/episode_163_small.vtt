 The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein, his fourth time on the podcast,

00:05.680 --> 00:12.160
 both sadness and hope run through his heart and his mind, and the result is a complicated,

00:12.160 --> 00:15.760
 brilliant human being who I am fortunate to call a friend.

00:35.600 --> 00:42.080
 topics in this or other conversations that you listen with an open mind and forgive me or the

00:42.080 --> 00:48.240
 guests for a misstep in an imperfectly thought out statement. To have any chance at truth,

00:48.240 --> 00:54.160
 I think we have to take risks and make mistakes in conversation and then learn from those mistakes.

00:54.720 --> 00:59.200
 Please try not to close your mind and heart to others because of a single sentence or an

00:59.200 --> 01:04.160
 expression of an idea. Try to assume that the people in this conversation are just people in

01:04.160 --> 01:10.800
 general are good, but not perfect and far from it, but always striving to add a bit more love

01:10.800 --> 01:16.880
 into the world in whatever way we know how. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,

01:30.880 --> 01:40.080
 off this planet and I think you don't often talk about extra terrestrial life, intelligent life out

01:40.080 --> 01:44.880
 there. Do you wonder about this kind of thing about intelligent civilizations out there?

01:44.880 --> 01:51.760
 I do, but I try to not wonder about it in a particular way. In a certain sense, I do find

01:51.760 --> 01:56.960
 that speculating about Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster and Space Aliens is kind of a recreation

01:56.960 --> 02:02.720
 for when things aren't going very well. At least it gives us some meaning and purpose in our lives.

02:03.440 --> 02:09.440
 So I worry about, for example, the simulation hypothesis is taking over from religion. You

02:09.440 --> 02:14.640
 can't quite believe enough to go to church or synagogue or the mosque on the weekend. So then

02:14.640 --> 02:19.040
 you just take up an interest in the simulation theory because that's something like what you do

02:19.040 --> 02:26.240
 for your job coding. I do think that in some sense, the issue of aliens is a really interesting one,

02:26.240 --> 02:34.560
 but has been spoiled by too much recreational escapism. The key question that I find is,

02:36.000 --> 02:41.920
 let's assume that it is possible to look out at the night sky and see all of these distant worlds

02:41.920 --> 02:46.800
 and then go visit them. If that is possible, it's almost certainly possible through some

02:48.320 --> 02:54.320
 as yet unknown or not accepted theory of physics beyond Einstein.

02:56.480 --> 03:03.200
 It doesn't have to be that way, but probably is. If that theory exists, there would be a

03:03.200 --> 03:08.240
 percentage of the worlds that have life in sort of a Drake equation kind of a way that would have

03:08.240 --> 03:17.360
 encountered the ability to escape soon enough after unlocking the power of the atom at a

03:17.360 --> 03:25.840
 minimum and whatever they have that is probably analogous to the cell on that world. So assuming

03:25.840 --> 03:32.960
 that life is a fairly generic thing that arises, probably not carbon based, probably doesn't have

03:32.960 --> 03:42.080
 DNA, but that something that fits the pattern of Darwinian theory, which is descent with variation,

03:43.760 --> 03:49.200
 differential success. And thereby constantly improving and so on that through time, there'll

03:49.200 --> 03:54.400
 be a trajectory where there'll be something increasingly complex and fascinating and beautiful

03:54.400 --> 03:59.920
 like us humans, but much more. That can also off gas whatever entropy it creates to give

03:59.920 --> 04:05.200
 an illusion that you're defeating thermodynamics. So whatever these things are, probably has an

04:05.200 --> 04:11.280
 analog of the bilipid layer so that cells can get rid of the chaos on one side of the barrier and

04:11.280 --> 04:16.400
 keep order on the other. Whatever these things are that create life, assuming that there is a

04:16.400 --> 04:24.000
 theory to be found that allows that civilization to diversify, we would have to imagine that

04:24.000 --> 04:30.960
 such a civilization might have taken an interest in its concept of the universe and have come here.

04:32.320 --> 04:37.520
 They would come here. They would have a deep understanding of the physics of the universe

04:37.520 --> 04:43.040
 sufficient to have arrived here. Well, there's two questions, whether they could arrive physically

04:43.040 --> 04:50.320
 and whether their information could be sent here and whether they could gain information from us.

04:50.320 --> 04:57.280
 It's possible that they would have a way of looking into our world without actually reaching it. I

04:57.280 --> 05:06.480
 don't know. But yes, if my hope, which is that we can escape this world, can be realized if that's

05:06.480 --> 05:13.680
 feasible, then you would have to imagine that the reverse is true and that somebody else should be

05:13.680 --> 05:20.720
 here. First of all, I want to say this. My purpose when I come on to your show and I reframe the

05:20.720 --> 05:27.200
 questions is not to challenge you. I can sit inside all of those. It's to give you better audio and

05:27.200 --> 05:32.800
 video because I think we've been on an incredible role. I really love what you do. I am trying to

05:32.800 --> 05:37.520
 honor you by being as disagreeable about frame breaking as possible. I think some of your listeners

05:37.520 --> 05:42.640
 don't understand that it's actually a sign of respect as opposed to some sort of a complex

05:42.640 --> 05:47.600
 dynamic, which is I think you can play outside of some of the frames and that these are sort of

05:47.600 --> 05:51.760
 offerings to get the conversation started. Let me try to break that frame and give you something

05:51.760 --> 06:00.800
 different. Beautiful. I think what's going on here is that I can prove effectively that we're

06:00.800 --> 06:05.680
 not thinking about this in very deep terms. As soon as I say we've got to get off this planet,

06:05.680 --> 06:13.040
 the number of people who assume that I'm talking about faster than light travel is very high. Faster

06:13.040 --> 06:21.120
 than light travel assumes some sort of Einsteinian paradigm that then is broken by some small

06:21.120 --> 06:28.000
 adjustment. I think that that's fascinating. It shows me that our failure to imagine what could

06:28.000 --> 06:37.120
 be being said is profound. We don't have an idea of all of the different ways in which we might be

06:37.120 --> 06:45.440
 able to visit distant worlds. All we think about is, okay, it must be Einsteinian space times and

06:45.440 --> 06:55.840
 then some means of exceeding the speed limit. It's fascinating to me that we've lost the ability

06:55.840 --> 07:02.240
 to just realize we don't know the framework and what does it even mean? One of the things I think

07:02.240 --> 07:08.560
 about a lot is worlds with more than one temporal dimension. It's very hard to think about more

07:08.560 --> 07:16.240
 than one temporal dimension. That's a really strong mental exercise of breaking the framework

07:16.240 --> 07:20.240
 in which we think because most of the frameworks would have a single temporal dimension.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.880
 First of all, most of the frameworks in which we think would have no temporal dimension,

07:24.880 --> 07:31.280
 would have pure mathematics, the differential geometry that Riemann came up with in the 1800s.

07:32.880 --> 07:38.960
 We don't usually talk about what we would call split signature metrics or Lorentzian

07:38.960 --> 07:44.560
 signature. In fact, if it weren't for relativity, this would be the most obscure topic out there.

07:45.440 --> 07:50.080
 Almost all the work we do is in Euclidean signature and then there's this one freakish case

07:50.080 --> 07:55.440
 of relativity theory in physics that uses this one time and the rest spatial dimensions.

07:56.880 --> 08:00.640
 Fascinating. It's usually momentary and just looking at space.

08:01.280 --> 08:08.000
 Yes. We have these three kinds of equations that are very important to us. We have elliptic,

08:08.000 --> 08:16.480
 hyperbolic, and parabolic. The idea is if I'm chewing gum after eating garlic bread,

08:16.480 --> 08:25.440
 when I open my mouth and I've got chewing gum between my lips, maybe it's going to form an

08:25.440 --> 08:31.120
 elliptic object called a minimal surface. Then when I pop that and blow through it,

08:31.120 --> 08:34.400
 you're going to hear a noise that's going to travel to you by a wave equation,

08:34.400 --> 08:38.320
 which is going to be hyperbolic. But then the garlic breath is going to diffuse

08:38.320 --> 08:42.400
 towards you and you're eventually going to be very upset with me according to a heat equation,

08:42.400 --> 08:47.840
 which will be parabolic. Those are the three basic paradigms for most of the work that we

08:47.840 --> 08:53.600
 do. A lot of the work that we do in mathematics is elliptic, whereas the physicists are in the

08:53.600 --> 08:57.680
 hyperbolic case. I don't even know what to do about more than one temporal dimension because

08:57.680 --> 09:04.000
 I think almost no one studies that. I can't believe you just captured much of modern physics

09:04.000 --> 09:07.920
 in the example of chewing gum. I have an off color one, which I chose not to share,

09:07.920 --> 09:15.840
 but hopefully the kids at home can imagine. That is the place where we come from.

09:16.640 --> 09:23.440
 Now, if we want to arrive at a possibility of breaking the frameworks with two versus zero

09:23.440 --> 09:28.160
 temporal dimensions, how do we even begin to think about that? Well, let's think about it as

09:28.160 --> 09:35.680
 you and I getting together in New York City. If you tell me, Eric, I want to meet you in

09:35.680 --> 09:44.000
 New York City, go to the corner of 34th Street and 3rd Avenue, and you'll find a building on

09:44.000 --> 09:50.720
 the northwest corner and go up to the 17th floor. When we have 3rd Avenue, that's one

09:50.720 --> 09:56.240
 coordinate, 34th Street, that's a second coordinate, and go up to the 17th. What time is it? Oh,

09:56.240 --> 10:03.120
 12 noon. All right. Well, now imagine that we traded the ability to get up to a particular

10:03.120 --> 10:07.440
 height in a building. It's all flat land, but I'm going to give you two temporal coordinates.

10:07.440 --> 10:14.960
 Meet me at 5 p.m. and 12 noon at the corner of 34th and 3rd. That gets to be too mind blowing.

10:14.960 --> 10:20.800
 I've got two separate watches. And presumably that's just specifying a single point in those

10:20.800 --> 10:26.080
 two different dimensions, but then being able to travel along those dimensions. Let me see your

10:26.080 --> 10:34.000
 right hand. You have no watch on that. I'm very concerned, Lex, that you're going through life

10:34.000 --> 10:40.800
 without a wristwatch. That is my favorite and most valued wristwatch. I want you to wear it.

10:40.800 --> 10:47.680
 This guy's funnier than basically any human on earth. That has been in my family for months.

10:47.680 --> 10:56.320
 It's a Fitbit. Now, what I want you to understand is Lex Fridman is now in a position to live in

10:56.320 --> 11:02.160
 two spatial and two temporal dimensions, unlike the rest of us. I clearly am only fit for four

11:03.280 --> 11:08.800
 spatial dimensions. So I'm frozen, whereas you can double move. I can double move,

11:08.800 --> 11:15.520
 which is funny because this is set in Austin time, so it's 4 p.m. and this is set in Los

11:15.520 --> 11:22.000
 Angeles time. That's just with an affine shift in mod 12. My point is, wouldn't that be interesting

11:22.000 --> 11:25.520
 if there were two separate timescales and you had to coordinate both of those,

11:25.520 --> 11:28.640
 but you didn't have to worry about what floor of the building because everything was on the

11:28.640 --> 11:35.200
 ground floor. That is the confusion that we're having. And if you do one more show,

11:36.320 --> 11:40.080
 then they're going to put a watch on your ankle and you're only going to have one spatial dimension

11:40.080 --> 11:46.480
 that you can move around. But my claim is that all of these are actually sectors of my theory,

11:46.480 --> 11:52.880
 in case we're interested in that, which is geometric unity. There is a 2,2 sector and a 3,1

11:52.880 --> 11:58.960
 and a 1,3 and a 0,4 and a 4,0. And all of these sectors have some physical reality. We happen

11:58.960 --> 12:05.760
 to live in a 1,3 sector, but that's the kind of thinking that we don't do. When I say we have to

12:05.760 --> 12:10.080
 get off this planet, people imagine, oh, okay, it's just Einstein plus some ability to break the law.

12:10.800 --> 12:16.880
 By the way, even though you did this for humor's sake, I perhaps am tempted to pull a Putin.

12:19.520 --> 12:27.440
 Am I going to get whacked? No, not quite. But he was given a Super Bowl ring to look at,

12:27.440 --> 12:31.680
 and he, instead of just looking at it, put it on his finger and walked away with it.

12:31.680 --> 12:38.000
 Robert Kraft? Robert Kraft, that's right. So, in the same way, I will, if you don't mind,

12:38.000 --> 12:42.000
 walk away with this Fitbit and taking an entirety of your life story with it,

12:42.000 --> 12:45.120
 because there's all these steps on it. Boy, have you lost a lot of weight.

12:47.920 --> 12:49.600
 And where have I been? Exactly.

12:50.560 --> 12:53.600
 Right. That's what we're talking about. We're talking about, you want to get into aliens.

12:53.600 --> 12:58.720
 Let's have an interesting alien conversation. Let's stop having the typical free will conversation,

12:58.720 --> 13:04.000
 the typical alien conversation, the typical AGI morality conversation. It's like, we have to

13:04.000 --> 13:08.400
 recognize that we're amusing ourselves because we're not making progress. Time to have better

13:08.400 --> 13:13.280
 versions of all these conversations. Is there some version of the alien conversation that could

13:13.280 --> 13:17.760
 incorporate the breaking of frameworks? Well, I think so. I mean, the key question would be,

13:18.480 --> 13:25.040
 we've had the Pentagon release multiple videos of strange UFOs that undermined a lot of us. I

13:25.040 --> 13:30.560
 just think it's also really fascinating to talk about the fact that those of us who were trained

13:30.560 --> 13:36.080
 to call BS on all of this stuff just had the rug pulled out from under us by the Pentagon choosing

13:36.080 --> 13:41.600
 to do this. And you know what the effect of that is? You've opened the door for every stupid theory

13:42.320 --> 13:48.800
 known to man. My aunt saw a ghost. Okay. Now we're going to have to listen to,

13:48.800 --> 13:52.480
 well, hey, the Pentagon used to deny it. Then it turned out there were UFOs, dude.

13:52.480 --> 14:01.040
 Dude, whoever is in charge of lying to the public, they need a cost function that incorporates the

14:01.840 --> 14:06.080
 damage and trust because I held this line that this was all garbage and all BS.

14:07.200 --> 14:11.360
 Now I don't know what to think. There's a fascinating aspect to this alien discussion,

14:11.360 --> 14:15.760
 the breaking of frameworks that involves the release of videos from the Pentagon,

14:15.760 --> 14:21.840
 which is almost like another dimension that trust in itself or the nature of truth and information

14:21.840 --> 14:28.720
 is a kind of dimension along which we're traveling constantly that is messing with my head to think

14:28.720 --> 14:37.280
 about because it almost feels like you need to incorporate that into your study of the nature

14:37.280 --> 14:45.040
 of reality is like the constant shifting of the notation, the tools we use to communicate that

14:45.040 --> 14:51.200
 reality. And so what am I supposed to think about these videos? Is it a complete distraction?

14:51.200 --> 14:55.680
 Is it a kind of cosmic joke? I don't know. But you know what? I'm tired of these people. Just

14:55.680 --> 15:00.080
 completely tired of these people. The people on the Pentagon side or the people who are interpreting

15:00.080 --> 15:07.600
 this stuff on the Pentagon side? I'm tired of the authorities playing games with what we can know.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.560
 The fact that you and I don't, do you have a security clearance?

15:11.680 --> 15:15.040
 Some level of it for, because I was funded for DARPA for a while.

15:15.040 --> 15:21.600
 I don't have a security clearance. You know, I am going to release whatever theory I have. And

15:21.600 --> 15:27.840
 my guess is, is that there is zero interest from our own government. And so the Chinese will find

15:27.840 --> 15:32.320
 out about it at the same time. Our government does, because Lord knows what they do in these

15:32.320 --> 15:38.320
 buildings. I watch crazy people walk in and out of the intelligence community, walk in and out of

15:38.320 --> 15:45.760
 DARPA. And I think, wow, you're talking to that person? That's really fascinating to me. We don't

15:45.760 --> 15:50.880
 seem to have a clue as to who might have the ball. Complete lack of transparency. Do you think it's

15:50.880 --> 15:57.600
 possible there's, the government is in possession of something deeply fundamental to understanding

15:57.600 --> 16:03.440
 of the world that they're not releasing? So this is one, one thing is, this is one of the

16:03.440 --> 16:10.000
 the famous distractions that people play with, the narrative of alien life forms,

16:10.720 --> 16:14.960
 spacecraft and possession, that the government is in possession of alien spacecraft,

16:14.960 --> 16:19.680
 the popular narrative. I don't think the government really exists at the moment.

16:21.120 --> 16:26.000
 I believe, and this is not an idea that was original to me. There was a guy named Michael

16:26.000 --> 16:30.800
 Tidalbaum who used to be at the Sloan Foundation. And at some point I pointed out that the US

16:30.800 --> 16:35.360
 government had completely contradictory objectives when it came to the military and science.

16:36.080 --> 16:40.800
 And one branch said this, one branch said that. I said, I don't understand which is true. What

16:40.800 --> 16:44.400
 does the government want? And he said, do you think there's a government? And I said, what do

16:44.400 --> 16:50.080
 you mean? He said, what makes you think that the people in those two offices have ever coordinated?

16:51.760 --> 16:57.600
 What is it that allows each office to have a coherent plan with respect to every other office?

16:57.600 --> 17:01.600
 And that's when I first started to understand that there are periods where the government coheres

17:02.320 --> 17:05.760
 and then there are periods where the coherence just decays. And I think that that's been going

17:05.760 --> 17:11.120
 on since 1945, that there have been a few places where there's been increased coherence, but in

17:11.120 --> 17:16.400
 general, everything is just getting less and less coherent. And that what war did was focus us on the

17:16.400 --> 17:23.120
 need to have a government of people and mission capacity, technology, commitment, ideology.

17:23.120 --> 17:30.320
 And then as soon as that was gone, different people, those who'd been through World War II had

17:30.320 --> 17:36.560
 one set of beliefs, those born in the 1950s or late 40s by the time they got to Woodstock,

17:38.320 --> 17:39.520
 they didn't buy any of that.

17:39.520 --> 17:48.400
 So coherence is the complete opposite of bureaucracy being paralyzed by bureaucracy.

17:48.400 --> 17:54.160
 So coherence is efficient functional government, because when you say there's no government,

17:54.160 --> 18:00.640
 meaning there's no emergent function from a collection of individuals, it's just a bunch

18:00.640 --> 18:05.840
 of individuals stuck in their offices without any kind of efficient communication with each other

18:05.840 --> 18:13.280
 on a single mission. And so a government that is truly at the epitome of what a government is

18:13.280 --> 18:15.760
 supposed to be is when a bunch of people working together.

18:15.760 --> 18:21.200
 What are we about? Are we about freedom? Are we about growth? Are we about decency and fairness?

18:22.240 --> 18:26.800
 Are we about the absence of a national culture so that we can all just do our own thing?

18:26.800 --> 18:30.480
 I've called this thing the USAN, the United States of Absolutely Nothing.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.720
 These are all different visions for our country.

18:35.440 --> 18:40.080
 So it's possible that there's an alien spacecraft somewhere and there's like

18:40.080 --> 18:46.000
 20 people that know about it. And then they're kind of, as you communicate further and further

18:46.000 --> 18:50.640
 into the offices that information dissipates, it gets distorted in some kind of way, and then

18:50.640 --> 18:54.400
 it's completely lost. The power, the possibility of that information is lost.

18:55.680 --> 18:59.600
 We bought a house. And I had this idea that I wanted to find out what all the switches did.

19:00.160 --> 19:07.200
 And I quickly found out that your house doesn't keep updating its plans. As people do modifications,

19:07.200 --> 19:11.280
 they just do the modifications and they don't actually record why they were doing what they

19:11.280 --> 19:15.520
 were doing or what things lead to. So there are all sorts of bizarre, like there's a switch in

19:15.520 --> 19:21.840
 my house that says privacy. I don't know what privacy is. Does it turn on an electromagnetic

19:21.840 --> 19:29.200
 field that there's some lead shielding go over the house? That's what we have. We have a system

19:29.200 --> 19:33.280
 in which the people who've inherited these structures have no idea why their grandparents

19:33.280 --> 19:38.480
 built them. I'd be funny if there's a freedom of speech switch that you could also control,

19:38.480 --> 19:40.880
 and it would be a perfect metaphor for our current state of mind. Well, that's different

19:40.880 --> 19:46.480
 because what they figured out is that if they can just make sure that we don't have any public

19:46.480 --> 19:52.880
 options for communication, then, hey, every thing that we say to each other goes through

19:52.880 --> 19:56.480
 a private company. Private companies can do whatever they want. And this is like one of the

19:56.480 --> 20:02.480
 greatest moves that we didn't really notice. Electronic and digital speech makes every other

20:02.480 --> 20:09.440
 kind of speech irrelevant. And because there is no public option, guess what? There's always somebody

20:09.440 --> 20:16.720
 named Sundar or Jack or Mark who controls whether or not you could speak and what it appears to be

20:16.720 --> 20:22.080
 that is being said and who stuff is weighted more highly than others. It's an absolute nightmare.

20:22.080 --> 20:28.320
 And by the way, the Silicon Valley intellectual elite, Lord knows what is going on. People

20:28.320 --> 20:35.200
 are so busy making money that they are not actually upholding any of the values. So Silicon Valley is

20:35.200 --> 20:43.200
 sort of maximally against it. It has this kind of libertarian, free, progressive sheen to it when

20:43.200 --> 20:47.840
 it goes to Burning Man. And then it quickly just imposes rules on all of the rest of us as to what

20:47.840 --> 20:53.120
 we can say to each other if we're not part of the inner elite. So what do you think the ideal

20:53.120 --> 20:58.480
 of the freedom of speech means? Well, this is very interesting. I keep getting lectured on

20:58.480 --> 21:03.760
 social media by people who have no idea how much power the Supreme Court has to abstract things.

21:04.480 --> 21:09.840
 Right now, you have the concept of the letter of the law and the spirit of the law. And the spirit

21:09.840 --> 21:16.000
 of the law would have to say that our speech that matters is free, at least at the level of ideas.

21:16.000 --> 21:21.040
 I don't claim that I have the right to endanger your life with speech or to reveal your private

21:21.040 --> 21:27.280
 information. So I really am not opining about directed speech intended to smear you. And

21:28.160 --> 21:31.920
 that's a different kettle of fish. And maybe I have some rights to do that, but I don't think

21:31.920 --> 21:38.080
 that they're infinite. What I am saying is that the freedom of speech for ideas

21:40.960 --> 21:46.960
 is essential that the court abstract it and shove it down the throat of Google, Facebook,

21:46.960 --> 21:54.960
 Twitter, Amazon, whoever these infrastructure companies are, because it really matters which

21:54.960 --> 22:01.200
 abstraction use. The case that I really like is search and seizure. If I have private data that

22:01.200 --> 22:05.760
 I entered in my house that is stored on a server that you hold outside of my house,

22:07.280 --> 22:12.560
 but I view the is the abstraction that it's only the perimeter of my house that I have the right

22:12.560 --> 22:20.080
 to protect, or does my password extend the perimeter of my house to the data on the server

22:20.080 --> 22:26.640
 that is located outside of my house. These are choices for the court. And the court is supposed

22:26.640 --> 22:32.720
 to pretend that they can divine the true intent of the framers. But all of the sort of, and I've

22:32.720 --> 22:37.760
 taken the call on this, the problem of internet hyenas, people with ready made answers and LOLs

22:37.760 --> 22:43.120
 and you're such a moron. These folks love to remind you, it's a private company, dude, it can do

22:43.120 --> 22:49.120
 whatever it wants. No, the court has to figure out what the abstractions are. And just the way,

22:49.120 --> 22:55.440
 for example, the Griswold decision found that there was a penumbra because there was too little in

22:55.440 --> 22:59.680
 the Constitution. Therefore, there were all sorts of things implied that couldn't be in the document.

22:59.680 --> 23:08.080
 And somebody needs to come up with the abstraction right now that says Jack cannot do it if he

23:08.080 --> 23:14.960
 wants. It's really, so you say the courts, but it's also us, people who think about the world,

23:14.960 --> 23:20.080
 it's you. No, no, no. It's the courts. But the courts don't do this. We're toast.

23:20.640 --> 23:25.680
 But we can still think about it. I mean, I don't feel like going down the drain.

23:25.680 --> 23:30.160
 Here's what I'm thinking about because it's tricky how far it should extend. I mean, that's

23:30.160 --> 23:33.120
 an ongoing conversation. Don't you think the interpretation of the law?

23:34.080 --> 23:38.560
 I think I'm trying to say something very simple and it's just not going to be popular for a while.

23:41.120 --> 23:47.840
 Tech dwarfs previous forms of communication. Print or shouting in a public park.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.600
 And so, you know, I can go to a public park and I can shout if I get a permit. Even there,

23:53.600 --> 23:58.480
 I think it was in the late 1980s in Atlanta. We came up with free speech zones where you

23:58.480 --> 24:03.440
 can't protest at a convention. You bet you can go to a park 23 miles out and they'll fence

24:03.440 --> 24:09.760
 off a little area where you can have your free speech. No, speech is dangerous. Ideas are

24:09.760 --> 24:15.920
 dangerous. We are a country about danger and risk. And yes, I agree that targeted speech

24:15.920 --> 24:21.120
 at individuals trying to reveal their private stuff and all that kind of that is very different.

24:21.120 --> 24:26.720
 So, forget a lot of that stuff. But free speech for ideas is meant to be dangerous

24:28.000 --> 24:34.400
 and people will die as a result of free speech. The idea that one life is too much

24:34.400 --> 24:38.640
 is preposterous. Like, why did we send, if one life is preposterous, why did we send

24:38.640 --> 24:45.520
 anyone to the beaches of Normandy? I just don't get this. So, one thing that I was clearly bothered

24:45.520 --> 24:52.720
 by and maybe you can be my therapist as well. I thought you were mine. This is a little bit of

24:52.720 --> 25:01.280
 a miscommunication on both of our parts then. Because who's paying who for this? I was really

25:01.280 --> 25:10.560
 bothered by Amazon banning parlor from AWS because my assumption was that the infrastructure,

25:10.560 --> 25:18.960
 I drew a distinction between AWS, the infrastructure on which competing platforms could be created

25:20.160 --> 25:27.040
 is different than the actual platforms. So, the standard of the ideal of freedom of speech,

25:28.320 --> 25:35.200
 I in my mind in a shallow way perhaps applied differently to AWS than I did to Twitter.

25:35.200 --> 25:43.680
 It felt that we've created a more dangerous world, that freedoms were violated by banning

25:44.640 --> 25:50.000
 parlor from AWS, which I saw as the computing infrastructure which enables the competition

25:50.000 --> 25:56.480
 of tools, the competition of frameworks of communication. What do you think about this?

25:56.480 --> 26:02.560
 First of all, let me give you the internet hyena answer. I don't understand, dude. Just build your

26:02.560 --> 26:07.920
 own Amazon. Yeah. Right? Yes. So, that's a very shallow statement, but it's also

26:08.960 --> 26:15.920
 one that has some legitimacy. We can't completely dismiss it because there's levels to this game.

26:16.480 --> 26:20.880
 Yes and no, but if you really wanted to chase that down, one of the great things about a

26:20.880 --> 26:25.440
 person to person conversation is opposed to let's have 30 of our closest friends.

26:25.440 --> 26:28.960
 Whenever we have a conversation with 30 of our closest friends, you know what happens?

26:28.960 --> 26:33.520
 It's like passing light through a prism. Every person says something interesting

26:34.160 --> 26:38.000
 and as a result, it's always muddled. Nothing ever resolves.

26:39.200 --> 26:44.480
 Well, one of my conversational techniques you mentioned, you pushed back, is first,

26:44.480 --> 26:50.240
 this childlike naivety and curiosity, but also real or simulated.

26:50.240 --> 26:52.560
 Real, I'm afraid. I would say 80% real.

26:52.560 --> 26:59.760
 All right. So, in this paradigm, how could you not see this coming? I did a show with

27:00.720 --> 27:05.760
 Ashley Matthews, who's the woman behind Riley Reed, and specifically about this. It was about

27:05.760 --> 27:13.040
 the idea that if I move away from politics and go towards sex, I know that there's always a move

27:13.040 --> 27:21.040
 to use the infrastructure to shut down sex workers. And in this case, we had Operation

27:21.040 --> 27:28.800
 Choke Point under the Obama administration. We have a positive passion for people who want

27:28.800 --> 27:32.880
 to solve problems that they don't like. This company, they don't like that company.

27:32.880 --> 27:38.160
 Payday loans would be another one. And so, you have legal companies that are harassed

27:38.160 --> 27:45.840
 by our financial system that you can't, you know, as Riley Reed, Ashley couldn't get a

27:45.840 --> 27:51.840
 MailChimp account according to her, if I understand her correctly. And this idea that you charge

27:51.840 --> 27:57.040
 these people higher rates because of supposed chargebacks on credit cards, even if their

27:57.040 --> 28:03.760
 chargebacks are low. Yes, we have an unofficial policy of harassment. There's something about

28:03.760 --> 28:10.400
 everybody who shows up at Davos. They get drunk in the Swiss Alps, and then they come back home,

28:10.400 --> 28:15.520
 and they coordinate, and they coordinate things like build back better. We don't really understand

28:15.520 --> 28:20.320
 what build back better is, but my guess is that build back better has to do with extremism in

28:20.320 --> 28:26.640
 America. How do we shut down the Republican Party as the source of extremism? Now, I do think the

28:26.640 --> 28:32.160
 Republican Party has got very extreme under Trump. And I do believe that that was responsive to how

28:32.160 --> 28:42.240
 extreme the Democratic Party got under Clinton first, and then Obama, and then Hillary. And in

28:42.240 --> 28:48.560
 all of these circumstances, it's amazing how much we want to wield these things as weapons. Well,

28:48.560 --> 28:53.760
 our extremism is fine because we pretend that Tifa doesn't exist, and we don't report what goes on

28:53.760 --> 29:00.960
 in Portland, but your extremism, my God, that's disgusting. This is the completely ridiculous

29:00.960 --> 29:09.280
 place that we're in. And by the way, our friends, in part, are coked up on tech money, and they

29:09.280 --> 29:14.640
 don't appear to hold the courage of their convictions at a political level because

29:15.200 --> 29:20.560
 it's not in keeping with shareholder value. At some level, shareholder value is the ultimate

29:20.560 --> 29:29.280
 shield with which everyone can cloak themselves. Well, on that point, Donald Trump was banned

29:29.280 --> 29:37.040
 from Twitter. And I'm not sure it was a good financial decision for Twitter, right? Perhaps

29:37.040 --> 29:41.040
 you can correct me if I'm wrong. Well, are you thinking locally, or are you thinking if Twitter

29:41.040 --> 29:48.080
 refused to ban Donald Trump, what is the odds that the full force of the antitrust division

29:48.080 --> 29:54.000
 might find them? I don't know. Oh, I see. I see. So there's a complicated thing. Look, these guys

29:54.000 --> 30:00.400
 are all having a discussion in very practical terms. You can imagine the sorts of conversation.

30:01.040 --> 30:05.600
 Jack, Mark, Sunder, we're really glad you're all here. We're all trying to sing from the same

30:05.600 --> 30:10.880
 hymnal and row in the same direction. We understand free speech. We're completely committed to it,

30:10.880 --> 30:17.040
 but we have to draw on with extremism, guys. We just need to make sure we're all on the same page.

30:17.040 --> 30:26.960
 Well, they use the term violence, too, and they, I think, overapply it. So basically, anybody...

30:27.600 --> 30:34.240
 I'm telling you, I say dumb things to incentivize thoughtful conversation.

30:34.240 --> 30:40.080
 Well, whatever these things are, there is no trace. Like, how old are you, Lex? You're in your

30:40.080 --> 30:47.600
 mid 30s? Yeah, to late 40s. Late 20s to late 40s, somewhere in there. That's the demographic.

30:47.600 --> 30:51.600
 I do think that partially what's happened is that your group has never seen functional

30:51.600 --> 30:57.280
 institutions. These institutions have been so compromised for so long. You've probably never

30:57.280 --> 31:05.200
 seen an adult. Sometimes, I think Elon looks like an adult. I know that he has a wildlife style,

31:05.200 --> 31:09.840
 but I also see him looking like an adult. What does an adult look like, exactly? Oh, you know,

31:09.840 --> 31:16.000
 somebody who weighs things, speaks carefully, thinks about the future beyond their own lifespan.

31:17.120 --> 31:23.360
 Somebody who has a pretty good idea of how to get things done, isn't wildly caught up in punitive

31:23.360 --> 31:29.760
 actions, is more focused on breaking new ground than playing rent seeking games. I mean, I really

31:29.760 --> 31:35.440
 had a positive... I was so completely chastised when Elon must have ended up as the world's richest

31:35.440 --> 31:42.320
 person. He was like, well, that's interesting. Back to work. That's what an adult would do.

31:42.320 --> 31:47.760
 That's what a grownup would do. Weirdly, I said something about, isn't it amazing that the world's

31:48.400 --> 31:53.360
 richest person knows what a Lagrangian is? He made a terrible Lagrange joke about potentials.

31:53.360 --> 31:59.280
 But yeah, I mean, I do think that ultimately, Elon may be one of the closest things we have

31:59.280 --> 32:03.920
 to an adult. And I can tell you that the internet hyenas will immediately descend as to what a

32:03.920 --> 32:08.720
 fraudster he is for pumping his stock price, talking his book and all this stuff. Shut up.

32:08.720 --> 32:14.640
 So, looking at the world seriously and rigorously, you're saying that the people who are running tech

32:14.640 --> 32:23.440
 companies or running the mediums on which we can exercise the ideal of free speech are not adults?

32:24.320 --> 32:28.480
 I think not. I think, first of all, a lot of them are Silicon Valley,

32:28.480 --> 32:34.880
 utopian businessmen, where you talk a utopian line and you use it. You've heard my take,

32:34.880 --> 32:40.320
 which is that the idealism of every era is the cover story of its greatest thefts.

32:40.320 --> 32:44.720
 And I believe that in many ways, the idealism of Silicon Valley about connecting the world,

32:44.720 --> 32:48.640
 the world of abundance, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, is really about the

32:49.760 --> 32:53.600
 software eating the world, as Mark Andreessen likes to say, at the role of these legacy

32:53.600 --> 33:01.280
 properties. And by simply being a bad tech version of something that previously existed

33:01.280 --> 33:06.560
 like a newspaper, you could immediately start to dwarf that by aggregating newspapers and

33:06.560 --> 33:11.040
 newspapers and their digital versions, because digital is so much more powerful. As a result,

33:11.600 --> 33:18.480
 yes, we have lots of man children wandering around what once was the Bay Area and is now

33:18.480 --> 33:26.720
 Austin and Miami and other places, maybe Singapore, that all of these people,

33:27.680 --> 33:31.600
 these are friends of ours, and they're brilliant with respect to a certain amount of stuff.

33:31.600 --> 33:36.240
 But none of them can get off the drip. It's amazing that none of them have FU money.

33:36.960 --> 33:39.040
 We've got billionaires who don't have FU money.

33:39.680 --> 33:45.680
 Okay. I think the argument used by Jack Dorsey was that there was an incitement of violence,

33:45.680 --> 33:51.440
 and not just Jack Dorsey, but everybody that was banning people. And then this word violence was

33:51.440 --> 33:59.040
 used as a kind of just like extremism and so on, without much reason behind it.

33:59.040 --> 34:04.720
 You think it's impossible for Jack Dorsey or anybody else to be, as you said, an adult, a

34:04.720 --> 34:08.560
 grownup and... Well, Jack is pretty close to being a grownup. It seems like he is.

34:08.560 --> 34:11.440
 Yeah. But he's under pressures.

34:11.440 --> 34:16.560
 As you've discussed, it seems that he's been on the verge of almost being

34:17.200 --> 34:22.000
 quite serious and transparent and real. I don't know where the Jack Dorsey that I met went.

34:22.000 --> 34:28.000
 And I worry that that must be something behind the scenes that I can't see.

34:29.040 --> 34:36.320
 From my perspective, what I think is the stress, the burden of that when people are screaming at you

34:37.280 --> 34:40.960
 is overwhelming. Jack is a Zen monk. He really is.

34:42.720 --> 34:50.000
 Jack is an incredibly impressive person, intellectually, morally, spiritually, at least

34:50.000 --> 34:57.600
 for a couple of meetings. I don't know him very well, but I'm very impressed by the person I met.

34:57.600 --> 35:00.240
 And I don't know where that person is. And that terrifies me.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.480
 But do you think somebody could step up in that way?

35:04.480 --> 35:04.480
 No.

35:05.680 --> 35:13.520
 So does a human being have the capacity to be transparent about the reasoning behind the

35:13.520 --> 35:21.280
 banning? Or do you think all banning, eventually, all banning of people from mediums of communication

35:22.400 --> 35:27.840
 is eventually destructive? Or it's impossible for human beings to reason with ourselves about it?

35:27.840 --> 35:34.080
 Well, let's see what the problem is. So my phone has been on airplane mode. I'm going to unlock it.

35:35.040 --> 35:42.320
 I'm going to take a picture of Lex Fridden. Now, if I can, I'm going to tweet that picture out.

35:42.320 --> 35:43.600
 Great.

35:43.600 --> 35:53.760
 But here's the weird part about it. That picture sitting with Lex today.

35:55.840 --> 35:58.000
 This, ladies and gentlemen, is how the sausage is made.

35:58.560 --> 36:09.680
 Okay. In so doing, I have just sent a picture of you and a tiny piece of text all over the planet

36:09.680 --> 36:17.200
 that has arrived at, if statistics tell the truth, just under half a million different accounts.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.280
 And then more from sharing and so on.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.600
 Well, been some of those accounts are dead. We don't really know how many places it went.

36:27.360 --> 36:33.520
 But the key issue with that tweet is that that is a non local phenomenon.

36:34.560 --> 36:34.880
 Yes.

36:34.880 --> 36:44.320
 So I just broadcasted to an entire planet. Somebody in Uganda is reading that at the same time as somebody in Uruguay.

36:45.920 --> 36:54.000
 There is no known solution to have so many people with the ability to communicate non locally

36:54.960 --> 36:59.840
 because locality was part of the implicit nature of speech inside of the Constitution.

36:59.840 --> 37:03.920
 Friction, locality, there were all sorts of other aspects to speech.

37:03.920 --> 37:11.680
 So if you think about speech as a bundle, then it got unbundled.

37:12.720 --> 37:19.600
 And some of those aspects that we were naturally counting on to retard the impact of speech

37:21.040 --> 37:23.840
 aren't present. And we don't have the courage to say,

37:23.840 --> 37:28.640
 I wonder if the First Amendment really applies in the modern era in the same way,

37:28.640 --> 37:32.880
 or we have to work through an abstraction. Either we probably have to amend the Constitution,

37:32.880 --> 37:40.480
 or we have to abstract it properly. And that issue is not something we're facing up to.

37:40.480 --> 37:49.040
 I watch us constantly look backwards. We don't seem to try to come up with new ideas and new

37:49.040 --> 37:54.960
 theories. Nobody really imagines that we're going to be able to wisely amend the Constitution anymore

37:54.960 --> 37:58.880
 inside of the United States. Many people abroad will say, why are these guys talking about the

37:58.880 --> 38:03.520
 US? It's a US centric program. Well, that's because nobody knows where this program lives.

38:04.800 --> 38:08.080
 The fact, by the way, that you and I happen to be in a physical place together

38:08.640 --> 38:12.880
 is also bizarre. It could be anywhere. It doesn't really matter that it happens to be here.

38:13.520 --> 38:16.960
 So the difference between logical and between physical, local, non local,

38:16.960 --> 38:24.320
 frictional, non frictional, it's the same thing with firearms. Nobody imagined that the

38:24.320 --> 38:32.960
 gatling gun was going to be present when you had to reload a musket. That's fascinating to think

38:32.960 --> 38:39.760
 about. You're exactly right that the nature of this particular freedom that seems so foundational

38:39.760 --> 38:46.320
 to this nation, to what made this nation great, and perhaps much of the world that is great,

38:46.320 --> 38:51.600
 made it great, is changing completely. Can we try to reason through how the ideal

38:51.600 --> 38:58.800
 freedom of speech is to be changed? I mean, I guess I'm struggling. It feels really wrong,

38:59.360 --> 39:03.760
 perhaps because I wasn't paying attention to it. It feels really wrong to ban Donald Trump

39:05.120 --> 39:12.240
 from Twitter, to ban not just the president. That's really wrong to me. But this particular

39:12.240 --> 39:22.640
 human for being divisive. But then when there's an incitement of violence, that is an overused

39:22.640 --> 39:32.080
 claim. But perhaps there was actual brewing of local violence happening. So one of the things

39:32.080 --> 39:40.320
 I know was happening on Parler is people were scheduling meetings together in physical space.

39:40.320 --> 39:48.160
 So you're now going back from this dynamic social, large scale, people from Uganda,

39:48.160 --> 39:53.040
 people from all over the world being able to communicate. You're now mapping that into now

39:53.040 --> 39:58.640
 back meeting in the physical space that is similar to what the founding of this nation was.

39:58.640 --> 40:06.000
 The violence were digital. If ransomware suddenly was unleashed. The key issue is the

40:06.000 --> 40:13.920
 abstractions. So what was freedom of speech as a bundle? And then how do we abstract the bundle

40:14.480 --> 40:19.120
 into the digital era? Do you think we just need to raise the question and talk about it? Do you

40:19.120 --> 40:24.800
 have ideas? Well, sure I have ideas. But the key point is that I'm not even welcome in mainstream

40:24.800 --> 40:31.040
 media. I've never seen you on mainstream media. Do you do mainstream media? So we exist in part

40:31.040 --> 40:36.800
 of an alternate universe because the mainstream media is trying to have a coherent story,

40:36.800 --> 40:41.120
 which I've called the gated institutional narrative. And the institutions pretend that

40:41.120 --> 40:47.360
 they plug their fingers in their ears and pretend that nothing exists outside of MSNBC

40:47.360 --> 40:52.080
 talking to CNN about what was in the New York Times as covered by the Washington Post.

40:52.720 --> 40:57.040
 And so that's effectively like a professional wrestling promotion where they, you know,

40:57.040 --> 41:02.160
 the undertaker faces off against Hulk Hogan and Rowdy Roddy Piper. Okay. Well,

41:03.760 --> 41:08.800
 that's very different than MMA. You've recently been on Glenn Beck's program. Yeah.

41:09.600 --> 41:15.600
 And there was this kind of one of the things you've talked about is being able to have this

41:15.600 --> 41:21.600
 conversation. I don't know if you would put it as a type of conversation that was happening outside

41:21.600 --> 41:29.040
 of the mainstream media, but a conversation that reaches across different worldviews and having a

41:29.040 --> 41:35.120
 nuanced or just like a respectful conversation that's grounded and mutual.

41:35.120 --> 41:42.160
 But we can't have the reality because the main model is the center, both left and right,

41:42.160 --> 41:47.840
 is in the process of stealing all the wealth that we built up. And they've organized the extremes

41:47.840 --> 41:55.200
 into two LARPing teams that I've called Magistan and Wokistan. And then you have everybody who

41:55.200 --> 42:00.960
 isn't part of that complex, all seven of us, the number of us who are able to earn a living looking

42:00.960 --> 42:08.880
 at all of these mad people playing this game. There's a phrase inside finance when the investment

42:08.880 --> 42:13.840
 banks are trying to look at price action. And somebody says, this doesn't make any sense.

42:13.840 --> 42:18.720
 And somebody will say, it's just the local stealing from each other. And that's really what we have.

42:18.720 --> 42:25.440
 We've got the leaders of Magistan and Wokistan championing these two teams is sponsored by the

42:25.440 --> 42:29.600
 center because it's a distraction while they steal all the silver and cut the paintings out of the

42:29.600 --> 42:34.560
 frames. That's what you and I are looking at. So when you ask me, like, do you have any ideas

42:34.560 --> 42:41.040
 about the abstraction for free speech? I've never met Mark Zuckerberg. I've never met

42:41.040 --> 42:46.880
 Zuckerberg. I've never met Sundar Pichai. I never met Larry Page. I was once in a room with Sergey

42:46.880 --> 42:53.520
 Brin. I've never spoken to Elon Musk. I hang out with Peter Thiel, but we have a very deep

42:53.520 --> 42:59.440
 relationship, but I don't really speak to that many other people at sort of at this level.

43:00.560 --> 43:07.040
 We're not having any kind of smart conversation at a national level. In fact, it's almost as if

43:07.040 --> 43:14.640
 we've destroyed every sandbox in which we could play together. There's no place that we actually

43:14.640 --> 43:20.720
 talk except long form podcasting. And by the way, they've found, you see what's going on with like

43:20.720 --> 43:29.680
 Alex Stamos and the Hoover Institution. There's a loophole left. Long form podcasting allows

43:29.680 --> 43:35.760
 people to speak at levels above daytime CNN. It's like, well, why do you think they're not watching

43:35.760 --> 43:44.080
 daytime CNN? But you know, that's just silly journalism. They currently have no power to

43:44.080 --> 43:48.800
 displace podcasting. That's why it's so powerful. RSS feed. I mean, that's why the big challenge

43:48.800 --> 43:55.200
 with Joe Rogan and Spotify is like, there's this dance that's fascinating to see is Joe Rogan is

43:55.200 --> 44:02.480
 not part of the system. And then he's also uncancelable. And there's this tension that's

44:02.480 --> 44:10.240
 happening. Well, Howard Stern, Howard Stern became much less relevant. So if they can't control Joe

44:10.240 --> 44:18.400
 by bringing him in house, the key question is, is he going to continue? Like, you know, this

44:18.400 --> 44:24.480
 Joe says this thing about FU money. Yeah. Joe's one of the only people with FU money who's actually

44:24.480 --> 44:35.520
 said FU. Yeah. I don't understand this. I don't have FU money. What exactly is, can we break apart

44:35.520 --> 44:44.320
 FU money? Because I always thought I've been fortunate enough to have always have FU money

44:44.320 --> 44:49.360
 in the sense that my standards were so low that a basic salary in the United States. This is the

44:49.360 --> 44:54.560
 stoic point, which is if you can live on rice and beans, you're uncancelable because you're always

44:54.560 --> 44:59.680
 rich relative to your needs. Right. Isn't that FU fundamental? Why do you say that tech billionaires

44:59.680 --> 45:04.880
 don't have FU money? When you need to hire private security to protect your family,

45:04.880 --> 45:11.200
 how do you protect your two children? I don't have those yet. Bingo. Yeah. My point is that FU

45:11.200 --> 45:18.480
 money insulates everything that you care about. It's not just about you. So you're saying as the

45:18.480 --> 45:25.920
 level of responsibility grows, the amount of money required for FU. We have a war going on.

45:25.920 --> 45:32.400
 The war is on academic freedom. Academic freedom used to be present in the system as a, in terms

45:32.400 --> 45:39.600
 of the idea, we trust our elite. Now we have an idea like, you want to be the elite. You want a

45:39.600 --> 45:44.160
 Lord above us. That's like, first of all, there's like a populist anti elitist thing. Then there's

45:44.160 --> 45:49.600
 the idea that we're going to defer tenure for forever. Then we're going to tell people, stay in

45:49.600 --> 45:55.040
 your lane. Your tenure is only good for your own particular tiny micro subject. Then we're going to

45:55.040 --> 45:59.920
 also control your grants and we'll be able to load up your teaching load if we don't like who you are

45:59.920 --> 46:07.840
 and we'll make your life absolutely impossible. We lost academic freedom and we ushered in peer

46:07.840 --> 46:15.680
 review, which was a disaster. Then we lost funding so that people were confident that they would have

46:15.680 --> 46:21.760
 the ability to do research no matter what they said. As a result, what you find is,

46:21.760 --> 46:26.800
 is a world in which there's no ability to get people to say, no, I'm not going to sign your

46:26.800 --> 46:32.640
 diversity and inclusion forced loyalty oath. I won't sign any loyalty oath. Get the hell out of

46:32.640 --> 46:40.560
 my office. F you. F you and you're connecting money to that. Well, my point is that academic

46:40.560 --> 46:47.680
 freedom is the whole idea behind it was that you will have the freedom of a billionaire

46:48.240 --> 46:56.720
 on a much smaller seller. Right. Okay. We've lost that. Yeah. The only reason in part that I wanted

46:56.720 --> 47:05.440
 to go into academic academics as a profession, as opposed to wanting to do physical or mathematical

47:05.440 --> 47:13.280
 research. The great prize was freedom. Ralph Gomery of the Sloan Foundation previously of IBM

47:13.280 --> 47:19.600
 Research pointed it out. He says, if you lose freedom, you lose the only thing we had to offer

47:19.600 --> 47:25.280
 top minds. Top minds value their intellectual freedom and their physical and economic security

47:25.280 --> 47:33.360
 at a different level than other human beings. And so people say, I don't understand, dude,

47:33.360 --> 47:37.760
 you have the ability to do X, Y, and Z. What's the problem? It's like, well, I value my ability

47:37.760 --> 47:44.640
 to raise the middle finger as an American practically above everything else. I want to talk

47:44.640 --> 47:51.280
 to you about freedom here in the context of something you've mentioned, which one way to

47:51.280 --> 47:57.920
 take away freedom is to put a human being into a cage to create constraints. The other one that

47:57.920 --> 48:06.080
 worries me is something that I think you spoke into Twitter a little bit on Twitter is we bleed

48:06.080 --> 48:19.600
 freedom by kind of slowly scaring you into not doing, not expressing the full spectrum of opportunities

48:19.600 --> 48:29.040
 you can as freedom. So when you ban Donald Trump, when you ban Parler, you give a little doubt in

48:29.040 --> 48:34.800
 the minds of millions, like me, a person who's a tech person, who's an entrepreneur,

48:35.600 --> 48:39.840
 there's a little, that's what I'm afraid of when I look in the mirror. Is there not a little doubt

48:39.840 --> 48:46.000
 in there that limits the amount of options that we'll try? How certain are you that the COVID

48:46.000 --> 48:53.920
 virus didn't come from the Wuhan lab and his biosafety level four? We both know that we're

48:53.920 --> 49:00.400
 both supposed to robotically say the idea that the COVID virus came from a lab is a discredited

49:00.400 --> 49:04.320
 conspiracy theory. There is no evidence that suggests that this is true. The World Health

49:04.320 --> 49:09.600
 Organization and the CDC have both upon this to say otherwise would be incredibly irresponsible.

49:09.600 --> 49:16.640
 And the threat of that is the thing that ultimately limits the freedoms we feel.

49:16.640 --> 49:18.880
 I should be tweeting about Jeff Epstein all the time.

49:20.560 --> 49:26.000
 And you're afraid. It's also boring. I mean, I said it in the public many times.

49:26.000 --> 49:30.480
 Why is it, we don't ask where the records are from the Velard House? Where are the financial

49:30.480 --> 49:36.400
 records? Where are the SEC filings? Where are the questions on the record to the intelligence

49:36.400 --> 49:44.800
 agencies? Was he known to be part of the intelligence community? We're not interested

49:44.800 --> 49:50.080
 in asking questions. Am I going to die as a result of asking the question,

49:50.960 --> 49:55.440
 was Jeff Epstein part of the intelligence community of any nation? Is there a reason

49:55.440 --> 49:59.040
 we're not asking about the financial records of the supposed hedge fund that he didn't run?

49:59.040 --> 50:05.600
 Just like the Wuhan lab. Okay. How do we get to the core of the Jeff Epstein,

50:05.600 --> 50:10.480
 the truth behind Jeff Epstein, in a sense? I mean, there's some things that are just

50:10.480 --> 50:14.560
 like useless conspiracy theories around it, even if they're true. There's some things they get to

50:14.560 --> 50:20.480
 say. I have to say it. You're not going to like it. Look at the 1971 media Pennsylvania break in

50:20.480 --> 50:26.800
 of the Citizens Committee to investigate the FBI. Those kids, and by the way, they weren't all kids,

50:26.800 --> 50:34.720
 did what had to be done. They broke in. They broke the law. It was an incredible act of

50:34.720 --> 50:41.280
 civil disobedience. And God bless Judy Feingold for taking to her, she was going to take to her

50:41.280 --> 50:46.400
 grave that she'd been part of this, like the coolest thing of all time. They didn't say anything for

50:46.400 --> 50:52.240
 forever. So civil disobedience. I mean, you have to. We are founded on civil disobedience.

50:52.240 --> 51:00.480
 Civil disobedience is incredibly, you screw it up and you're just a vandal. You screw it up,

51:00.480 --> 51:08.560
 you're a hooligan. Those cats were so disciplined. It's an art form. It was an art form and they

51:08.560 --> 51:15.920
 risked everything they were willing to pay with their freedom. Those are the sorts of people who

51:15.920 --> 51:22.560
 earned the right by putting themselves at risk. I would not do this. I am not volunteering to break

51:22.560 --> 51:29.760
 into anything. I think it was William Davodon, who was a student of Murray Gelman and a physics

51:29.760 --> 51:36.560
 professor at Haverford, who corralled these people and led this effort. And right now,

51:36.560 --> 51:46.560
 what we need is somebody to blow the lid off of what is controlling everything. I'm happy to hear

51:46.560 --> 51:50.560
 that it's a system of incentive structures, that it's a system of selective pressures. I'm happy

51:50.560 --> 51:54.720
 to find out that it's emergent. I'm happy to find that it's partially directed by our own

51:54.720 --> 52:02.240
 intelligence community. I'm happy to hear that, in fact, we've been penetrated by North Korea, Iran,

52:02.240 --> 52:08.480
 China, and Russia. But I need to know why people aren't... The firebombing of the

52:08.480 --> 52:14.640
 courthouse in Portland, Oregon has no explanation. And somehow, this is normal. This is not normal

52:14.640 --> 52:21.360
 to any human being. We have video that people don't believe. I come back to the shaggy defense

52:22.320 --> 52:30.160
 of it wasn't me. You remember that song?

52:30.160 --> 52:35.040
 Shaggy, yeah, it wasn't me. He caught you banging in a shower on the counter.

52:35.040 --> 52:37.280
 Yeah, exactly. It wasn't me. It wasn't me.

52:37.280 --> 52:44.400
 He says, his friend says, well, your strategy makes no sense at all. This is what MSNBC is doing.

52:46.000 --> 52:51.200
 You dropped him from the graphic. It wasn't me. He came up with another yang. It wasn't me.

52:52.320 --> 52:59.040
 I will never see MSNBC the same again. So you've spoken about him before. I think it'd be nice to

52:59.040 --> 53:03.520
 maybe honor him to break it apart a little bit. Aaron Schwartz. Yeah.

53:04.480 --> 53:09.760
 Why was he a special human being in this ilk of what we're talking about now,

53:09.760 --> 53:16.880
 civil disobedience? How do we honor him now moving forward as human beings who are willing

53:16.880 --> 53:23.040
 to take risks in this world? Well, I don't know. Are you inspired by Aaron Schwartz?

53:23.600 --> 53:27.200
 I am. How do you feel about JSTOR? Let's talk about JSTOR first.

53:27.200 --> 53:34.000
 So let's say what JSTOR is all about. We the taxpayer pay for research.

53:35.920 --> 53:43.200
 And then the people who do the research do all the work for a bunch of companies

53:43.200 --> 53:49.360
 who then charge us $30 an article to read what it is that we already paid for. And if we don't

53:49.360 --> 53:57.440
 cite these articles, we're told that we're in violation. Okay. I almost never call for civil

53:57.440 --> 54:05.200
 disobedience because I don't really want to, but fuck JSTOR, fuck Elsevier, fuck Springer.

54:05.200 --> 54:14.960
 Who the fuck are these people? The smart people need to take the greedy people

54:14.960 --> 54:21.520
 behind the woodshed and explain to them what science is. I have a very old fashioned idea

54:21.520 --> 54:28.320
 that's so out of favor that I will immediately be seen as a knuckle dragger. I believe in the

54:28.320 --> 54:33.120
 great woman theory of history and the great man theory of history. Emmy Nerder is fantastic.

54:36.080 --> 54:42.800
 That's an example. And I believe in editors over peer reviewers. And I believe that wrong

54:42.800 --> 54:47.440
 thing should be allowed into the literature. And I believe that the gatekeeping should go

54:47.440 --> 54:53.760
 toward zero because the costs associated with distribution are very, very slight. I believe

54:53.760 --> 55:01.280
 that we should be looking at the perverse incentives of sending your paper blindly into

55:01.280 --> 55:06.160
 your competitors clutches, particularly if you're a young person being reviewed by an older person.

55:06.160 --> 55:13.680
 Are you familiar with the Duat de Senor? Are you familiar with the legend of the Magnaia?

55:15.760 --> 55:21.360
 No. The Magnaia is the Miller's daughter. And the largest food fight in the entire universe,

55:21.360 --> 55:28.560
 I believe, is held, I think in Italy. It's called the Battle of the Oranges. And it celebrates

55:28.560 --> 55:36.880
 the Miller's daughter who had fallen in love with her beloved. And when it came time for them to

55:36.880 --> 55:46.240
 marry, the Virginal Magnaia was in fact told that the Lord of the land had the right to have

55:46.240 --> 55:52.720
 the first night with the bride. Well, the Magnaia had a different idea. So she seemed to consent to

55:52.720 --> 56:01.120
 this perhaps mythical right, also called the Prima note the first night. And by legend,

56:01.120 --> 56:08.000
 she concealed a dagger underneath her robes. And when it came time for the hated Lord of the

56:08.000 --> 56:15.600
 Manor to extract this right, she pulled the knife out and killed him. And I think it also echoes

56:15.600 --> 56:22.960
 a little bit of particularly wonderful scene from Game of Thrones. But that inspired both men and

56:22.960 --> 56:31.760
 women. And the Magnaia is the legendary hero. Right now, what we need to do is we need to resist

56:31.760 --> 56:38.160
 the Prima note, the right of first look, right? F you, you don't have the right of first look.

56:38.160 --> 56:42.000
 I don't want to send something blindly to my competitors. I don't want to subject myself

56:42.000 --> 56:49.840
 to you naming what work I've done. Why are you in my story? That's my question. Get out of my story.

56:49.840 --> 56:54.320
 If I do work, and then you have an idea, oh, well, it's the Matthew principle,

56:54.320 --> 57:00.000
 to him who has much more will be given. I've gone to the National Academy of Sciences and talked

57:00.000 --> 57:04.800
 about these things. And it's funny, I've been laughed at by the older people who think, well,

57:04.800 --> 57:10.560
 Eric, you know, science proceeds funeral by funeral, that's plonk. You know, the Matthew

57:10.560 --> 57:13.840
 principle, you know, the Matilda principle, that things done by women are attributed to men,

57:14.400 --> 57:17.680
 that these are not new. And you guys just live like this?

57:17.680 --> 57:23.760
 Yeah. So the revolutionary act now is to resist all of these things that are not new.

57:23.760 --> 57:27.520
 So you asked me about Aaron Schwartz. Aaron Schwartz was the Magnaia. One of the things

57:27.520 --> 57:34.400
 you've done very beautifully is to communicate love. And I think about, you know, some of our

57:34.400 --> 57:41.120
 conversations. And you got me to talk a little bit about my own experiences in 02138 and 39.

57:45.280 --> 57:51.040
 We are the product of our trauma. And what people don't understand is that very often,

57:51.040 --> 57:56.960
 when you see people taking countermeasures against what appear to be imaginary forces,

57:57.680 --> 58:00.880
 they're really actually replaying things that really happen to them.

58:00.880 --> 58:06.880
 And having been through this system and watching all of the ways in which it completely rewrites

58:06.880 --> 58:11.520
 the lives of the people who I am counting on to cure our diseases, build our new industries,

58:11.520 --> 58:19.360
 keep us safe from our foes, the amount of pressure the system is putting on the most hopeful minds

58:20.000 --> 58:27.200
 is unimaginable. And so my goal is to empower somebody like an Aaron Schwartz in memory

58:27.200 --> 58:33.120
 and to talk about a Jeffrey Epstein situation. Do you know that the first person outside

58:34.000 --> 58:37.920
 of me to get a look at geometric unity was Jeffrey Epstein?

58:40.240 --> 58:43.680
 How did he know I was working on this? I don't know.

58:43.680 --> 58:49.920
 So your ideas that formed geometric unity was something that his eyes are seeing?

58:49.920 --> 58:58.320
 I was pushed to talk to Jeffrey Epstein as one of the only people who could help me.

58:58.960 --> 59:01.680
 No, no, no, listen to this. Yeah, how does this connect?

59:01.680 --> 59:09.360
 Okay. Well, first of all, my old synagogue, my old school was the conservative minion at Harvard

59:09.360 --> 59:17.600
 Hillel. And I believe it's called Rossofsky Hall after Henry Rossofsky in the economics

59:17.600 --> 59:24.160
 department who was a Japan scholar, if I'm correct. And he became provost or dean of Harvard.

59:25.920 --> 59:32.720
 I believe that that was built with Jeffrey Epstein's money. And I wondered in part whether the

59:32.720 --> 59:38.320
 Jewish students at Harvard all sort of passed through a bottleneck of Harvard Hillel. So that

59:38.320 --> 59:43.280
 was something I found very curious, but I don't know much about it. I also found that Jeffrey

59:43.280 --> 59:48.560
 Epstein hanging around scientists. I don't think that either you or Joe exactly, I mean, got me

59:48.560 --> 59:54.400
 correct in your last interchange. For the record, for people who haven't listened to Joe Rogan

59:54.400 --> 1:00:01.520
 program, Joe has claimed that Eric Weinstein was the only person who has gotten paid. Oh, paid.

1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:08.320
 And you said you also got paid as a young man, right? I believe the word was laid, but allegedly.

1:00:08.320 --> 1:00:10.480
 My hearing isn't so good at age 55. Yeah.

1:00:10.480 --> 1:00:18.000
 All right. Leaving that aside. What was Jeffrey Epstein doing hanging around all of these scientists?

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:25.200
 I don't think that was the same program that was about compromising political leaders and business

1:00:25.200 --> 1:00:29.920
 people and entertainment figures. I think these are two different programs that were being run

1:00:29.920 --> 1:00:35.680
 through one individual. And Joe seemed to think that I didn't think he was smooth. I thought he

1:00:35.680 --> 1:00:42.400
 was glib. I think what Joe is really trying to get out of is that I found his mysticism

1:00:42.400 --> 1:00:50.080
 meretricious. He had an ability to deflect every conversation that might go towards revealing that

1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:54.560
 he didn't know what he was talking about. Every time you started to get close to something where

1:00:54.560 --> 1:01:00.240
 the rubber hit the road, the rubber wouldn't hit the road. And yet, can you help me untangle

1:01:00.240 --> 1:01:09.520
 the fact that you thought deeply about the physics of the nature of our universe,

1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:16.560
 and Jeffrey Epstein was interested. How did he know? I wasn't really talking about this stuff

1:01:16.560 --> 1:01:24.320
 until even my close friends didn't really know what I was up to. And yet, you're saying he did

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:30.800
 not have sufficient brilliance to understand when the rubber hit the road. So why did he have

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:36.000
 sufficient interest and curiosity? Tell you what I thought. I've been waiting to find out,

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:40.480
 does my government even know I exist? Do you have an answer to that question?

1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:48.720
 A couple times, the government has reached out to me. In general, there is zero interest in me,

1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:55.520
 like less than zero interest. I find that fascinating. As far as you know, right?

1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:59.840
 Well, that's what I'm trying to say. The question about not being able to see through

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:05.120
 a half silvered mirror, you don't know what's going on behind the half silvered mirror. To you,

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:12.080
 it's all you see is your reflection. But your intuition still holds. This is where I mentioned

1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:18.560
 that I, this is where I'll say naïve, dumb things. But I still hold on to this intuition that

1:02:19.520 --> 1:02:26.080
 Jeff, I'm not confident in this, but I lean towards that direction that Jeffrey Epstein

1:02:26.080 --> 1:02:29.360
 is the source of evil, not something that's underlying him.

1:02:30.320 --> 1:02:36.000
 You have a bias. It's different than mine. Our Bayesian priors are tutored by different life

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:43.200
 experiences. If I was mostly concerned, like Sam Harris is concerned, that people fill their heads

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:49.680
 with nonsense, I would have a very strong sense that people need order in the world, that they

1:02:49.680 --> 1:02:54.480
 take mysterious situations, they build entire castles in the air, and then they go move in if

1:02:54.480 --> 1:03:01.520
 they really get crazy. The old saying is that neurotics build castles in the air and psychotics

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:06.960
 move in. Coming from a progressive family, we had a different experience. It's really weird

1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:11.760
 when the government is actually out to get you, when they actually send a spy, when they actually

1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:17.840
 engage in disinformation campaigns, when they smear you. And if you've ever had that brought

1:03:17.840 --> 1:03:22.400
 to bear on your family, you have a Howard Zinn sort of understanding of the country,

1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:28.400
 which is different than having a, wow, do people believe crazy stuff because they watch too much

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:34.080
 TV? And both of these things have some merit to them, but it's a question of regulated expression.

1:03:34.080 --> 1:03:38.240
 When do you want to express more Sam Harris and when do you want to express more Howard Zinn?

1:03:39.840 --> 1:03:43.760
 You can express both, correct? The one human being can express both? Sure, but there's a trade

1:03:43.760 --> 1:03:48.160
 off between them. In other words, most people, like the Michael Shermers of the world, are going

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:52.560
 to tilt very strongly to extraordinary claims, require extraordinary evidence. You're going to

1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:56.640
 have that kind of energy. And then somebody else is going to say, how many times do I have to get

1:03:56.640 --> 1:04:01.120
 hit on, how many times do I have to hammer my own thumb before I realize that there's a problem?

1:04:01.920 --> 1:04:07.520
 So, my feeling about this is, yes, people see patterns in clouds. They see faces and

1:04:07.520 --> 1:04:11.600
 scripture and all sorts of things. And it's just random cloud pattern. And it's also the case

1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:16.720
 that there's tremendous pressure not to see conspiracies when conspiracies are relatively

1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:22.240
 more common than the people who shout conspiracy theory will claim. So both of these things are

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:27.200
 true. And you have to ask, when do you express your inner Zinn and your inner Harris? And those

1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:32.720
 are different. One fundamental difference you and I biases aside is you've actually met Jeffrey

1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:42.480
 Epstein. And I'm listening to reverberations years later of stories and narratives throughout the

1:04:42.480 --> 1:04:49.280
 story. Luckily, I only met him once. And I think I had one or perhaps two phone conversations with

1:04:49.280 --> 1:04:54.960
 him other than the one meeting. You can learn a lot in just a few words, right, from a human being.

1:04:54.960 --> 1:05:00.000
 Well, that's true. But I think that the bigger issue was, I saw something that I don't hear

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:07.120
 much remarked upon, which is Jeffrey Epstein is all that there is. In other words, there's the

1:05:07.120 --> 1:05:12.960
 National Science Foundation, National Institute of Health, Howard Hughes, there's all this stuff

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:17.920
 that kind of has the same feel to it, a little bit of variation and difference,

1:05:17.920 --> 1:05:24.080
 department of energy. If you fall outside of that, there's just Jeffrey Epstein. That's what

1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:29.840
 you're told. That's not quite true. There's Kavli. Maybe Jim Simons is now in the game.

1:05:29.840 --> 1:05:35.840
 Peter Thiel has done some stuff. You had Yuri Milner and Mark Zuckerberg try. So there is other

1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:42.160
 money running around, Templeton. But very strongly, there was a belief that if you're

1:05:42.160 --> 1:05:48.400
 doing something really innovative and the system can't fund it because we become pussies, Jeffrey

1:05:48.400 --> 1:05:52.880
 Epstein is your guy. Because it's funnel that you're supposed to go through.

1:05:52.880 --> 1:05:56.320
 That's right. And the idea is that you get called to the great man's house

1:05:57.360 --> 1:06:07.840
 and the sort of lupricious version of Ralph Lauren takes you in and asks you bizarre questions.

1:06:07.840 --> 1:06:13.760
 And maybe he has an island. Maybe he has a plane. And when you're starved,

1:06:15.840 --> 1:06:21.360
 somebody showing you a feast or when you're dehydrated in a death's door and somebody says,

1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:32.240
 I have a well. That's what it is. And so the thought is, wow, can somebody get some effing

1:06:32.240 --> 1:06:37.680
 money into the science system so that we don't have super creeps trying to learn all of our

1:06:37.680 --> 1:06:43.920
 secrets ahead of time? WTF, what is your problem with transparency and taxpayer dollars? Just

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:47.600
 all of you, you wouldn't have a country. You'd be speaking German.

1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:54.080
 So essentially, you believe that human beings would not be able to, when the money is lacking in

1:06:54.080 --> 1:06:59.120
 the system, like in research. We produce public goods. You and I are meant to produce public

1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:04.800
 goods. Now, I sell athletic greens and I sell Theragun and I sell unagi scooters

1:07:05.920 --> 1:07:13.360
 and chili pad. Can I be honest? I love these products. But I didn't get into this game

1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:19.840
 for the purpose of selling. I'm trying to figure out how do you have an FU lifestyle?

1:07:20.560 --> 1:07:25.200
 But you know something Lex? I don't know why you built this channel. It's kind of a mystery.

1:07:25.200 --> 1:07:28.000
 Yeah, I don't know why. I'll tell you why I built my channel.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:32.400
 It's going to be a lot harder to roll me this time in an alley.

1:07:33.520 --> 1:07:40.080
 I got rolled multiple times and my point is I didn't want to become a celebrity. I didn't

1:07:40.080 --> 1:07:47.440
 want to become well known, but it's a lot harder to roll somebody who's getting, you know, I think

1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:52.000
 I'm, I don't know if this is mistaken, but I think I'm the math PhD with the largest number

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:59.440
 of followers on Twitter. And there was nothing you could do before. I mean, again, to put a

1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:04.960
 little responsibility and you, so you've created something really special for the distribution

1:08:04.960 --> 1:08:11.440
 of your own ideas. I mean, but because it's not necessarily currently scalable, you also,

1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:18.160
 perhaps you and I have the responsibility of giving other people also a chance to spread

1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:23.040
 their ideas. I mean, Joe Rogan did this very effectively for a bunch of people that

1:08:23.600 --> 1:08:28.000
 that's why they're angry at him because he's a gatekeeper and he let all sorts of people

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:36.000
 through that gate from Roger, from Roger Penrose to Alex Jones to Jordan Peterson to,

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:42.160
 I mean, even first of all, to you and to Abby Martin to Barry Weiss. Yeah.

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:49.040
 Yeah. That's the problem. Well, but you, you have now successfully built up a thing that

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:55.760
 allows that to carry that over. No, no, no, no. We are all vulnerable to reputational attack

1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:02.160
 because what happens, you see, the problem Lexis is that you are now an institution at some level.

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:06.240
 You walk around with all this equipment in a duffel bag.

1:09:06.240 --> 1:09:13.840
 The last suit, the last suit you'll ever need. And you have the reach

1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:22.080
 of something like CNN to people who matter. Okay. So now the question is, how do we control

1:09:22.080 --> 1:09:25.920
 something that doesn't have a board, doesn't have shareholders, doesn't have to make

1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:36.480
 SEC filing the FCC. So the best answer they have is, well, we just have to destroy reputations. All

1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:42.640
 it takes is for us to take something that gets said or done or alleged. And I think it's incredibly

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:47.120
 important. One of the things people don't understand is, is that I'm, I'm going to fight

1:09:47.120 --> 1:09:52.480
 general reputational attacks, not because some people don't deserve to have their reputations

1:09:52.480 --> 1:10:01.760
 drawn, dragged through the mud, but because it's too powerful of a tool to hand it to CNN, MSNBC,

1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:06.240
 Princeton, Harvard, the State Department. Yes. But as some of it is also

1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:13.040
 Jason Morgan, Muhammad Ali style, being good enough at

1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:21.600
 doing everything you need to do without giving enough meat for the reputational attacks,

1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:28.000
 not being afraid, but not giving enough meat. I don't see why the people who have good ideas

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:32.880
 have to lead lives that are that clean. If you can do it, you can be messy. Yeah. You should be

1:10:32.880 --> 1:10:38.960
 able to be messy that otherwise we're suppressing too many people, too many, too billion minds.

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:46.240
 Yeah. Can you believe Elon Musk smoked a blunt? I still people tell me this. Okay. I have discussions

1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:55.520
 about Elon and people, the Avi Loeb, the Harvard scientist who's talking about a more and more

1:10:56.160 --> 1:11:04.160
 that it might be alien technology. He told me his, this outside the box thinker. Yeah.

1:11:05.120 --> 1:11:12.880
 When speaking to me about Elon said, called him the guy who smoked, he smokes weed,

1:11:12.880 --> 1:11:19.120
 he's the blunt in a dismissive way. Like this guy is crazy because he smoked some weed.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:26.480
 I was looking at him. I was like, why? Wow. Wow. I think you should be able to have

1:11:27.840 --> 1:11:34.240
 consensual drug filled orgies, fuck perfect lives. Yeah. You should be allowed to be messy.

1:11:34.240 --> 1:11:39.440
 Yeah. Right. I take back my statement. I'm just saying. Respectability is the unique prison

1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:48.640
 where all of the gates are open and the inmates beg to stay inside. It's time to end their prison

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:54.080
 of respectability because it's too effective of a means of sidelining and silencing people,

1:11:54.640 --> 1:12:03.680
 including it is better that we have bad people in our system than this idea of no platforming

1:12:03.680 --> 1:12:09.440
 people who are beyond the pale because it's such a simple technique. So how do we, what's

1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:15.520
 the heroic action here on the? Well, for example, having Ashley Matthews on my program. By the way,

1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:24.720
 she was absolutely delightful as a guest. She was, she is polite in the extreme, far more polite than

1:12:24.720 --> 1:12:30.960
 I am. And I had her right after Roger Penrose as a guest because I wanted to highlight this

1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:36.000
 program can go anywhere. We can talk to anyone. What about social media? You've started highlighting

1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:41.840
 people being banned on social media. How do we fight this? Like if you get banned from social

1:12:41.840 --> 1:12:45.920
 media, so you're saying nobody will stand up to me? Well, just figure out what your incentive

1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:50.160
 structure is before. Assume that they're, assume that I get banned on social media because somebody

1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:55.280
 wants to make sure that my message doesn't interfere with the dominant narrative. Yeah. Okay.

1:12:55.280 --> 1:13:02.560
 What will happen? By the way, I'm very glad to be able to explain this on your show because

1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:07.840
 that video will presumably be archived and they can't easily make you take it down.

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:14.080
 Okay. So what's going to happen is, is that there'll be a whole bunch of very low quality

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:18.800
 bot like accounts that dog you every time you talk about me.

1:13:18.800 --> 1:13:24.720
 Right. Dude, it's getting old, getting boring. We already heard you. Dude, that was like,

1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:28.160
 let it go. Not a good look. Not a good look is one of my favorites.

1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:32.880
 But what about the high profile ones? Well, then you'll get a few high profile ones and some of

1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:41.040
 the high profile ones command armies. Right. Like at some point, I had 10,000 people using exactly

1:13:41.040 --> 1:13:45.520
 the same templated tweet tweeting at me. It was just actually, it got to the point where it was

1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:50.560
 funny because everybody said, did you, did you hear that in hipster coffee shop? I was like,

1:13:50.560 --> 1:13:53.840
 why are you all suddenly talking about hipster coffee? It's hilarious.

1:13:56.400 --> 1:14:00.400
 Those things will cause you to think better of it. You'll start to see your follower can't

1:14:00.400 --> 1:14:05.840
 go down because it's easy to give you a bunch of bot like follows and then just pull them.

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:12.000
 So I think that's pretty well known how, and then maybe your account will be suspended and it

1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:16.160
 can't be revoked and you know, et cetera, et cetera. And then three days later, you'll be told it was

1:14:16.160 --> 1:14:21.440
 an error. So let me push back. I just don't see not defending you. Like, okay, so what are the

1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:30.800
 things you would do that, given that I can actually talk to you offline, that would make me not defend

1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:39.440
 you? Well, it's first of all, I can't, I mean, I can imagine some, but all of us have things.

1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:45.680
 If somebody says, do you hear what your boy Lex said about you? What did Lex say about me? Oh,

1:14:45.680 --> 1:14:54.480
 he said you were flawed, dude. Oh, shit. Yeah. You know, they so distressed because none of us

1:14:54.480 --> 1:14:58.880
 want to stand behind flawed people. That's why you have everybody rushing to say, I need a

1:14:58.880 --> 1:15:03.280
 condemn nor condone. I know I don't condemn nor, you know, why, what is that? We're all trying

1:15:03.280 --> 1:15:08.560
 to say for the record, I said that Eric is smarter than me in a brilliant human being,

1:15:08.560 --> 1:15:14.000
 but flawed like all humans are. My point is, I've now come up with a new policy,

1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:19.120
 which is I don't care what my friends have done. I am not disavowing my friends,

1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:23.840
 not because they didn't do the wrong thing. Maybe they did do the wrong thing. I don't know.

1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:29.680
 What's the value of friendship if that's not that? Like, for example, we've had the situation

1:15:29.680 --> 1:15:34.640
 with Brian Callan. Brian Callan was featured recently in Los Angeles Times. I know nothing

1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:40.560
 about the allegations. I can't. I didn't even know Brian at the time, right? I've known him for

1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:44.800
 roughly the time I've been in Los Angeles, maybe a year and a half during that period of time,

1:15:44.800 --> 1:15:50.720
 never seen anything wrong. Now I'm in a situation, what do you think he did? Do you think he didn't?

1:15:50.720 --> 1:15:56.720
 It's like, you know what? I don't know. But I do know this. Everyone's entitled to have friends

1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:02.480
 because we can't afford isolated people. And if your friends do the wrong thing, they're still

1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:08.800
 your friends. And if they do terrible, terrible things, you bring that up with them privately.

1:16:08.800 --> 1:16:13.360
 And it's not my responsibility to disavow in public. We've had this situation

1:16:14.720 --> 1:16:20.560
 that I don't like where particular people that I've been close to, I'm put under tremendous

1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:25.040
 pressure to disavow them. What do you think now about your buddy? I like Dave Rubin and all that

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:30.640
 kind of stuff. Here's the thing. My friends are my friends. I don't disavow my friends.

1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:38.160
 We all need to make a statement that we will not be brought under pressure to disavow our friends,

1:16:38.800 --> 1:16:48.000
 our family members, because mass murderers are dangerous the more isolated they become.

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:54.160
 It is not a good idea to constantly push to isolate people. And it's dangerous.

1:16:54.160 --> 1:17:01.040
 And it sends a signal to everybody else to fit in, to be more cynical about the next

1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:05.600
 we have to each other. If I find out you've been selling heroin to elementary school students,

1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:10.720
 you're still my friend and I will not be disavowing you. And if I have a problem with you

1:17:10.720 --> 1:17:16.720
 selling heroin to elementary school students during school hours, I will bring it up with you

1:17:17.600 --> 1:17:23.760
 privately because we don't need to hear my voice added to that condemnation. Are there things that

1:17:23.760 --> 1:17:29.840
 you could do that would cause me to say, actually, f this guy? Yeah, above and beyond that. But

1:17:29.840 --> 1:17:35.840
 simply doing the wrong thing, I think we've gone down a terrible path. I think isolated people

1:17:35.840 --> 1:17:41.600
 are about the most dangerous thing we could have in a heavily armed society. So I deeply

1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:45.840
 agree with you on Brian Callan and on all these people that quote unquote got canceled.

1:17:47.280 --> 1:17:52.960
 And I'm not saying that I don't know the truth value because we can't. And even if I did know

1:17:52.960 --> 1:18:00.400
 the truth value, I'm not setting up an incentive structure for the personal destruction as a means

1:18:00.400 --> 1:18:05.360
 of letting institutions combat the fact that individuals are the last thing that can say,

1:18:05.360 --> 1:18:10.800
 none of you guys make any sense. I don't treat these things like, you know, I had a conversation

1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:16.480
 where Kevin Spacey was at the dinner table when I came down from a hotel room. And I had a very

1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:22.080
 long conversation with Kevin Spacey. I will not detail because I don't do that as to what we

1:18:22.080 --> 1:18:28.880
 discussed. But we talked very specifically about him being canceled. And I don't think that the

1:18:28.880 --> 1:18:35.040
 world has heard that story in part because there's a very strong sense that he has to be outgrouped.

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:43.040
 And as a result, you know, I mean, do we want, do we want to disavow the space program because

1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:47.200
 it touched Werner von Braun? Do we want to disavow quantum mechanics because Pascal Jordan

1:18:47.200 --> 1:18:52.160
 and Werner Heisenberg passed through it? Is Aaron Fest theorem false because he murdered his child?

1:18:52.880 --> 1:18:59.040
 I mean, at what point do we recognize that we are the problem, humans are humans. And

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:04.800
 there is no perfect, there is no perfect group of people, even all of the most oppressed people,

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:08.800
 the supposed victims of the world, who we now have fetishized into thinking that they're all

1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:13.680
 oracles because their lived experience informs us and their pain is more salient than everyone

1:19:13.680 --> 1:19:21.680
 else's pain. Those people are necessarily great people. You know, it's like none, none of us,

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:26.720
 we can't, we can't do this in this fashion. So when we sit down to have a conversation

1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:33.280
 across the table from somebody, you should be willing to, like you should not have NPR in

1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:38.320
 your mind, you should be willing to take the full risk and to see the good in the person

1:19:38.320 --> 1:19:43.680
 without, with limited information and to do your best to understand that person.

1:19:44.400 --> 1:19:50.160
 Everybody is entitled to a hypocrisy budget. I don't believe this is of institutions.

1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:54.880
 Yeah. Okay. Everybody is entitled to a certain amount of screwing up in life.

1:19:56.080 --> 1:20:02.480
 You're entitled to a mendacity budget. You're entitled to an aggression budget. The idea of

1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:07.760
 getting rid of everybody is, you know, people haven't even blown through their budgets and

1:20:07.760 --> 1:20:13.840
 we're already. Yeah. I think about, for example, one person, I'd be curious to get your thoughts

1:20:13.840 --> 1:20:18.000
 about Alex Jones. Let's not talk about Alex Jones for a second. Let's talk about the National

1:20:18.000 --> 1:20:26.160
 Enquirer. Is everything the National Enquirer says false? No. Okay. Do you remember the John

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:33.360
 Edwards story? Did she run his wife? Sorry. Get a child from an extramarital affair. Yes.

1:20:33.360 --> 1:20:40.880
 I believe that the National Enquirer broke the story. And then what does the New York Times

1:20:40.880 --> 1:20:45.440
 do? The New York Times, I think, is allowed to report that the National Enquirer is making a

1:20:45.440 --> 1:20:51.680
 claim. That way they don't have to substantiate the story. So why is the New York Times talking

1:20:51.680 --> 1:20:57.600
 to Mike Cernovich or using the National Enquirer as the source? Are they using Alex Jones as the

1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:05.680
 source? Here's the big problem that we're having. Why are certain people entitled to talk to everybody

1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:09.760
 and other people are entitled to talk to no one? I don't really understand this. This is an

1:21:09.760 --> 1:21:14.480
 indulgence system. This is how the Catholic Church used to do things. It's hard to fight the system

1:21:14.480 --> 1:21:18.560
 because the reason you don't talk to Alex Jones is because the platforms on which we do the

1:21:18.560 --> 1:21:26.720
 communication will remove you. But I'm not platformed. I used to do NPR and I used to do

1:21:26.720 --> 1:21:33.200
 the news hour and I used to provide stories to Washington Post, New York Times. That has gone

1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:39.280
 away. They've circled the wagons closer and closer and more of us are unacceptable. And right now,

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:45.360
 I have no question that they're going through anybody who has a platform trying to say, okay,

1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:49.920
 what do we have against that person in case we need to shut that down? We have to make a different

1:21:49.920 --> 1:21:54.880
 decision, Lex. And the different decision is that it doesn't matter how many times

1:21:54.880 --> 1:22:05.440
 Joe said the N word. It doesn't matter that somebody else, with mathematical theorems,

1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:08.960
 if the worst person in the world proves a mathematical theorem like the Unabomber,

1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:16.640
 we can't undo the theorem. And I point out Charles Manson's song, Look At Your Game Girl,

1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:21.280
 is an amazing song. It's a really good song. I don't think it's one of the greatest songs ever,

1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:28.480
 but it happens that he wasn't in no talent. And, you know, I don't know how Hitler was as an artist.

1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:30.080
 Fiction, not bad.

1:22:30.720 --> 1:22:36.480
 Okay, we've got to get past this. We've got to get past this idea that we're going to purge

1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:41.680
 ourselves of our badness. And we're just going to, this is like, I likened it to teenage girls

1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:47.680
 in cutting. We're just, all we're doing is destroying ourselves in search of perfection.

1:22:47.680 --> 1:22:52.880
 And the answer is no, we're not perfect. We're flawed. We're screwed up. And we've always been

1:22:52.880 --> 1:22:57.440
 this way. And we're not going to silence everyone who you can point a laser beam at,

1:22:57.440 --> 1:23:02.960
 and say, well, that person, look at how bad that person is. If we do that, kiss the whole thing

1:23:02.960 --> 1:23:09.520
 goodbye. We might as well just, let's learn Chinese. But there is an art to having those messy

1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:15.280
 conversations, whether with Alex or anybody else. Okay, let's talk about Alex. There's

1:23:15.280 --> 1:23:19.920
 particular stuff that Alex does that's absolutely nauseating. And there's other stuff that he's

1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:24.560
 doing that's funny. The methodology of the way he carries. And sometimes he's talking about the

1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:29.520
 truth. And sometimes he's talking about a conspiracy. His variance is incredibly high.

1:23:30.240 --> 1:23:34.800
 The right way to approach Alex Jones or James O. Keefe or the National Enquirer or anything you

1:23:34.800 --> 1:23:43.760
 don't like is to say, great, go long short. What's that mean? Well, if you invest in a mutual fund,

1:23:43.760 --> 1:23:48.240
 all the stocks in the mutual fund are held long. But if you invest in a hedge fund,

1:23:48.800 --> 1:23:53.360
 you do something called relative value trade. It's like, well, you long tech or short tech?

1:23:54.160 --> 1:24:01.280
 Well, actually, I'm long Microsoft and I'm short Google. Why is that? Oh, because I believe Google

1:24:01.280 --> 1:24:06.960
 got way too much attention and that Microsoft has been unfairly maligned. And so this is really a

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:14.720
 play on legacy tech over more modern tech. Okay. Which part of Alex Jones are you long and which

1:24:14.720 --> 1:24:18.560
 part are you short? One of the things that should be a requirement for being a reporter is like,

1:24:18.560 --> 1:24:24.000
 what did Donald Trump do that was good? Nothing. Okay, then you're not a reporter.

1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:31.040
 What did Hitler do that was good? The Rosenstrasse protest.

1:24:31.040 --> 1:24:38.480
 Non Jewish women campaign for their Jewish men to be returned home to them

1:24:39.200 --> 1:24:45.360
 from certain death, almost in death camps. It should have been that not there were no death

1:24:45.360 --> 1:24:51.280
 camps. It should have been that everybody was returned home. But you know what? The fact that

1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:55.200
 the women of the Rosenstrasse protest, I mean, sorry, I get very emotional about,

1:24:55.200 --> 1:25:02.160
 you know, some of the baddest ass chicks in the world got their husbands returned to them,

1:25:03.520 --> 1:25:10.560
 colica vote. And not, I'm not celebrating Hitler. Hitler's the worst of the worst.

1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:17.680
 But God damn it, you know, this idea that we can just say everything that person does is a lie.

1:25:17.680 --> 1:25:24.640
 Everything that person does is evil. This reflects a simplicity of mind that humanity cannot afford.

1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:32.240
 Is Google evil, evil because it will sell you mine comp? Is Amazon evil because it will sell

1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:36.320
 you mine comp? If you find out that mine comp rests on somebody's bookshelves, do you have any idea

1:25:36.320 --> 1:25:43.120
 what it means? If you find out that a scholar use the n word, should that person lose their job?

1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:50.160
 Come on, grow the hell up. I guess our responsibility to lead by example on that.

1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:55.760
 Because you have to acknowledge that the fact, like the current public discourse... Have somebody

1:25:55.760 --> 1:26:03.760
 on your podcast who you're worried about. But do it in a principled fashion. I mean,

1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:11.520
 in other words, I'm not here to whitewash everything. On the other hand, if somebody makes,

1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:18.240
 you know, some allegations, I don't know that I'm obligated to treat every set of allegations as if...

1:26:19.120 --> 1:26:23.760
 Now, how do you defend yourself against them? No, allegations are so cheap to make at this moment.

1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:28.160
 Well, my sort of my standard, I don't know, maybe you could speak to it is,

1:26:28.960 --> 1:26:32.240
 I don't care. Like in the case of Alex Jones, for example, I don't,

1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:38.960
 I'm willing to have a conversation with Alex Jones and people like him. If I know he's not

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:42.320
 going to try to manipulate me. Assume that he is going to try to manipulate you.

1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:45.120
 I can't. Then we're not going to be two humans.

1:26:45.120 --> 1:26:50.560
 Okay, but Lex, I want you to think well of me. I put on a jacket. I don't usually wear a jacket.

1:26:52.320 --> 1:26:53.040
 Thank you, Eric.

1:26:53.040 --> 1:27:00.640
 All right. I'm trying to manipulate you. There's an entire field that says that speech

1:27:00.640 --> 1:27:06.400
 may be best thought of as an attempt to manipulate each other. This is too simplistic.

1:27:06.400 --> 1:27:11.360
 Everything that we keep talking through. Yes. You know better than this.

1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:20.400
 I disagree. I think there is ways. Of course, it's a gray area, but there is a threshold

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:26.960
 where your intent with which you come to a meeting, to an interaction, is one that is not

1:27:27.760 --> 1:27:33.360
 one that's grounded in like a respect for a common humanity, like a love for each other,

1:27:33.360 --> 1:27:36.560
 as deeply messy humans. If somebody is doing really bad stuff,

1:27:36.560 --> 1:27:39.920
 I expect you to try to keep them from doing really bad stuff.

1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:49.200
 But just keep in mind that when I was a younger man, I saw an amazing anti pornography documentary

1:27:50.320 --> 1:27:53.360
 and it was called Rate It X. I don't know where it went,

1:27:55.040 --> 1:28:00.560
 but the conceit of it was we're going to get some pornographers in front of a camera because

1:28:00.560 --> 1:28:06.080
 they want to talk and we're going to ask them about what they do for a living and why it's okay.

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:17.920
 No commentary. Okay. You could potentially, if you really think Alex Jones is the worst,

1:28:17.920 --> 1:28:28.640
 and again, I'm not intimately familiar with him, you could decide to just let him talk.

1:28:28.640 --> 1:28:34.640
 Now, I have decided not to do that with particular people. I've spoken to Stefan Molyneux.

1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:40.000
 Stefan Molyneux makes many good points, it makes many bad points, and he makes many good points

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:46.320
 in bad ways, and I worry about it, and I don't feel that it's not my obligation to make sure

1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:54.160
 that Stefan Molyneux has a voice on the portal. But I did stand up and say I didn't want him banned

1:28:54.160 --> 1:28:59.760
 from social media, and I do think that a lot of the people who are being banned from social media

1:28:59.760 --> 1:29:05.200
 were worried that they're right rather than that they're wrong. I certainly don't really think that

1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:10.960
 I'm worried in some sense that some of the really wrong people are wrong, but if you look at, for

1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:15.760
 example, Curtis Jarvin, there's a tremendous amount of interest. Is Eric going to speak to Curtis

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:21.200
 Jarvin? Curtis Jarvin says many interesting things, and he says many horrible, stupid things,

1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:29.760
 very provocative. I haven't invited him onto the portal, but I haven't said I will never

1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:34.080
 invite him onto the portal. We are all in a difficult position.

1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:41.760
 That's what I'm saying. I think it's a much more difficult task and burden who carry it as people

1:29:41.760 --> 1:29:48.240
 who have conversations because Curtis Jarvin is a good example. How much work do I have to put

1:29:48.240 --> 1:29:52.960
 in reading Curtis's work to really understand? We should talk about the problem of Curtis Jarvin,

1:29:52.960 --> 1:29:57.600
 because I think it's a problem to be illustrative. There's this big question as why does somebody

1:29:57.600 --> 1:30:03.360
 who says such stupid ass things listen to by so many people? Very smart people, people who are

1:30:03.360 --> 1:30:10.240
 part of our daily lives discuss Curtis Jarvin in hush tones. That's a good question. My belief is

1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:17.040
 that Curtis Jarvin has made a number of very interesting provocative points, and they associate

1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:23.360
 Curtis Jarvin as the person who has made these points. They treat the completely asinine stuff

1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:31.040
 that he says that's super dangerous as, well, that's Curtis. Right? Right. They give him the

1:30:31.040 --> 1:30:36.240
 credit for, he's kind of like, sorry to use the term, first principles, deep thinker about

1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:43.760
 in some category. In some space of the world. But as a result, we don't actually know why

1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:50.320
 Curtis Jarvin is knocking around so many Silicon Valley luminaries lives.

1:30:52.080 --> 1:30:56.080
 You said that he said a lot of asinine stupid stuff, and that's the sense I got from a few

1:30:56.080 --> 1:31:01.840
 things I've read, not just about it. This is not just Wikipedia stuff. He's a little, like I've

1:31:01.840 --> 1:31:07.600
 said before, he seems to be careless. I don't think he's careless. No, no, it's like Jim Watson.

1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:15.200
 Jim Watson wants to say very provocative things in order to prove that he's free. It's not a question

1:31:15.200 --> 1:31:22.960
 of careless. He enjoys the freedom to say these things. And the key point is, is that I expect

1:31:22.960 --> 1:31:29.600
 something more of Curtis. I expect that if somebody is insightful about all sorts of things up to that

1:31:29.600 --> 1:31:35.280
 point, that they're going to have enough care. Now, I, for example, make this point repeatedly

1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:41.920
 that vaccines are not 100% safe. Most people who have an idea that anybody is an antivaxxer should

1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:48.560
 be silenced are in a position where they probably don't say vaccines are 100% safe. But you keep

1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:53.200
 finding that statement over and over again. Believe all women. Vaccines are 100% safe.

1:31:53.200 --> 1:31:59.120
 Climate science is settled science. Whatever this Montanbele is, where you make extraordinarily

1:31:59.120 --> 1:32:05.280
 vapid blanket claims, and then you retreat into something, well, defund the pull, you know,

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:12.160
 we don't want no more police actually just means we want the police to not take on mental health

1:32:12.160 --> 1:32:19.600
 duties. We've come up with an incredibly disingenuous society. And what I'm claiming is, is that

1:32:20.240 --> 1:32:26.720
 I might talk to courtesy of them, but I have really very little interest to talk to a guy who

1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:31.760
 seems to be kind of giddy about who makes good slaves and who makes bad slaves. It's like,

1:32:31.760 --> 1:32:37.760
 why do I want to do that on the portal? One, first of all, because just as you said,

1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:44.160
 that's not Curtis's main thing. He has a lot of ideas. And what I've read of him, which is not

1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:51.920
 a huge amount, is he's very thoughtful about the way this world works. And on top of that,

1:32:51.920 --> 1:32:57.680
 he's an important historical figure in the birth and the development of the alt right,

1:32:57.680 --> 1:33:03.680
 or what would be called the right new reaction. Yeah. And there's, so he's in just an important

1:33:03.680 --> 1:33:10.640
 intellectual. And so it makes sense to talk to him. The question is, how much work do you put in?

1:33:10.640 --> 1:33:16.160
 Well, this is the issue of Fugu. I'm not a chef that necessarily can serve that Fugu.

1:33:16.160 --> 1:33:24.080
 So you have a puffer fish. You can eat the puffer fish. You can get a kind of a tingly sensation

1:33:24.080 --> 1:33:28.480
 on your tongue if you get a little bit of the poison organ. But my point is, I don't know how

1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:35.280
 to serve Curtis Jarvan so that, in fact, I'm not worried about what happens. But I believe that

1:33:35.280 --> 1:33:40.720
 if somebody else was a student of the new reactionary movement, that person might be in a better

1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:45.840
 position to host Curtis Jarvan. So somebody, that's a really good example of somebody I think you've

1:33:45.840 --> 1:33:51.280
 spoken with that's an intermediary. That's a powerful one is Michael Malis. And he's spoken

1:33:51.280 --> 1:33:56.400
 with Curtis Jarvan. And Michael wrote a book about... By the way, Michael somewhat changed

1:33:56.400 --> 1:34:03.280
 my mind about Michael Malis. I'm glad he did. I think I would call him a friend. And I think he's

1:34:03.280 --> 1:34:10.960
 a, underneath it all, a really kind human being. And I think your skepticism about him was initially

1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:16.800
 from a surface level of, what did you call him, hyenas, the trolls and so on. I'm not happy about

1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:28.080
 his... It's been so long since I've seen good trolls. Yes. So he needs a higher quality of

1:34:28.080 --> 1:34:37.120
 drolling, but he aspires to that. I mean, it disagree or not. I really enjoy how much care

1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:44.480
 he puts into the work he does, like a North Korea and study of the world and how much privately,

1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:51.680
 but also in public, love he has for people, especially those who are powerless. Just a genuine

1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:59.120
 admiration for them. But I think Curtis actually does too. I don't know. I mean,

1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:02.800
 you have to appreciate the first time I met Curtis, he introduced me and says,

1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:07.280
 I'm the most right wing person you've ever met. I was just like, well, this is a conversation

1:35:07.280 --> 1:35:13.760
 that's already over. It's theatrical in a way that's not conducted to actually having a real

1:35:13.760 --> 1:35:19.360
 connection. Well, it just turned me off because it was like, you need to be the most right wing

1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:24.160
 person. And so it's like, I'm a troll. I'm a troll. Yeah. Okay. Why are we doing this? Yeah.

1:35:24.160 --> 1:35:28.640
 But what I'm trying to get at is different. I'm trying to say that Michael Malice is a friend

1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:32.960
 of yours. If you found out something terrible, you should still be a friend. You should still

1:35:32.960 --> 1:35:38.480
 continue to be his friend. And in Michael Malice's case, it's very likely that we'll find out something.

1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:42.480
 Curtis is an acquaintance of mine because he hangs around with some people that I know.

1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:49.840
 I did not get it. I've started to understand why the people in my life, some of them are Curtis

1:35:49.840 --> 1:35:57.520
 Yavin fans, many of them disregard the stupid stuff. But my feeling is, is that too much poison

1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:02.160
 organ, not enough fish. I don't know how to serve that too intermingled. I'm not your chef.

1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:05.600
 Speaking for defending your friends, staying with your friends,

1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:14.000
 and bringing the old band together again, you coined the term IDW until that's your dark web.

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:21.040
 I like it. It represents a certain group of people that are struggling with,

1:36:21.920 --> 1:36:28.640
 that are almost like challenged the norms of social and political discourse

1:36:29.280 --> 1:36:34.880
 from all different angles. What do you think is the state of the IDW? What do you think is its

1:36:34.880 --> 1:36:42.000
 future? Is it still a useful? Well, it never exists. Is it a protocol? Is it a collection

1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:48.000
 of people featured in an article? What I learned very clearly is that there's a tremendous desire

1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:52.480
 in the internet age to pin people down. What do you say? Who's in it? What are the criterion?

1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:58.640
 I understand. You want to play the demarcation game and you want to make everything that is

1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:05.040
 demarcated instantly null and void. No, thank you. I resisted saying who was in it.

1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:11.040
 I resisted saying what it was. I resisted saying that Barry Weiss's article was the definitive

1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:18.480
 thing. They chose a ridiculous concept for the photographs that we couldn't get out of. I did

1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:22.960
 not want those photographs taken. They decided that the Pulitzer Prize winning photographer

1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:28.160
 needed to take them all at twilight. I don't know some such thing. I didn't even necessarily want

1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:32.720
 to do the article. Barry convinced me that it was the right thing to do. Undoubtedly,

1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:40.640
 Barry was right. I was wrong. But the key point is nothing can grow in this environment. There's

1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:48.400
 a reason we're not building. It does not appear that we found a way to grow anything organic

1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:53.520
 and good and decent that we need right now. That's kind of the key issue. Who's the weed?

1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:56.880
 Do you mean us as a society? Those of us who wish to have

1:37:56.880 --> 1:38:02.400
 a future for our great grandchildren. Let's take the subset of people who are worried

1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:09.840
 about things long after their demise. Do you think it's useful to have a term like the IDW

1:38:09.840 --> 1:38:20.560
 to capture some set of people, some set of ideas or maybe principles that capture what

1:38:20.560 --> 1:38:24.800
 I think the IDW, okay, you can say it's not supposed to me. It doesn't exist. It doesn't

1:38:24.800 --> 1:38:30.080
 mean anything. But to the public, to me, okay, I'll just speak to me. It represented something.

1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:38.560
 It represented, I think I said this to you. In my first attempt to interview the great

1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:44.080
 Eric Weinstein, I said that I spoke this about you, but IDW in general is trying to point out

1:38:44.080 --> 1:38:48.000
 the elephant in the room or that the emperor has no clothes, the set of people that do that in their

1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:54.480
 own way. If there are multiple elephants in the room, the point is that the IDW was more interested

1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:59.600
 in seeing the totality of elephants and trying to figure out how do we move forward as opposed to

1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:05.520
 saying I can spot the other guy's elephant in the room, but I can't see my own. In large measure,

1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:12.400
 we didn't represent an institutional base. Therefore, it wasn't maximally important that

1:39:12.400 --> 1:39:19.040
 we look at our own hypocrisy because we weren't on the institutional spectrum. This is where

1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:24.240
 friendship comes into play with the different figures that are loosely associated with the IDW

1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:38.080
 is you are somehow responsible for the exact thing that you said. Did you hear what Sam Harris said

1:39:38.080 --> 1:39:48.160
 about IDW? That kind of thing. Why chuckled? Lovingly or chuckled? I was angry at some people

1:39:48.160 --> 1:39:54.000
 who had said things that caused Sam to say what Sam said about turning his imaginary club membership

1:39:54.000 --> 1:40:01.840
 into the IDW. People said very silly things. I think that there is just this confusion that

1:40:01.840 --> 1:40:11.120
 integrity means calling out your friends in front of the world. I've been pretty clear about this.

1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:17.120
 I try to choose my friends carefully. If you would like to recuse me because I'm not a source

1:40:17.120 --> 1:40:23.840
 of reliable information, people that I know and love the most, maybe that's reasonable for you.

1:40:23.840 --> 1:40:27.920
 Maybe you prefer somebody who was willing to throw a friend under the bus at the first sign

1:40:27.920 --> 1:40:34.960
 of trouble. By all means, exit my feed. You don't have to subscribe to me. If that's your concept

1:40:34.960 --> 1:40:40.800
 of integrity, you're barking up the wrong tree. What I will say is that I knew these people well

1:40:40.800 --> 1:40:51.120
 enough to know that they're all flawed. Thank you for the callback. The issue is that I love

1:40:51.120 --> 1:40:57.040
 people who are flawed and I love people who have to earn a living even if you call them a grifter.

1:40:57.040 --> 1:41:04.240
 I love people who like the fact that Donald Trump didn't get us into new wars even if you call them

1:41:04.240 --> 1:41:12.480
 alt right. I love the fact that some people believe in structural oppression and want to fight it

1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:16.800
 even if they're not woke because they don't believe that structural oppression is hiding

1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:24.000
 everywhere. I care and love different people in different ways. I think that the overarching thing

1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:30.000
 Lex that we're not getting at is that we were sold a bill of goods that you can go through life

1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:39.120
 like an Eliza program with preprogrammed responses. Well, it's what aboutism? It's both sidesism.

1:41:39.680 --> 1:41:46.480
 It's alt right. It's the loony left. It's campus madness. It's like, okay, why don't you just empty

1:41:46.480 --> 1:41:59.200
 the entire goddamn magazine? All of those prerecorded snips. Now that you've done all of that,

1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:06.240
 now we can have a conversation. Your son put it really well, which is we should,

1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:14.080
 in all things, resist labels. But we can't deal without labels. We have to generalize,

1:42:14.080 --> 1:42:20.000
 but we also have to keep in mind that just in the way in science, you deal with an

1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:25.280
 effective theory that isn't a fundamental one. In science, most of our theories,

1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:32.320
 we consider to be effective theories. If I generalize about Europe, about women, about

1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:41.600
 Christians, those things have to be understood to mean something and not to have their

1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:50.400
 definitions extend so broadly that they mean nothing at all, nor that they're so rigid that

1:42:50.400 --> 1:42:56.880
 their claims that clearly won't bear scrutiny. Lex, what do you really want to talk about? That's

1:42:56.880 --> 1:43:01.200
 always my question to you. That always gets me. That's a good thing. Maybe you are the therapist.

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:07.120
 But you and I could talk about anything. People love, up until now at least,

1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:12.960
 people have loved listening to the two of us in conversation. My feeling is that we're not talking

1:43:12.960 --> 1:43:21.040
 about neural nets. We're not talking about geometric unity. We're not talking about where

1:43:21.040 --> 1:43:26.000
 distributed computing might go. I don't think that we're really focused on

1:43:28.080 --> 1:43:32.160
 some of the most exciting things we could do to transform education. We're still caught

1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:37.840
 in this world of other people that we don't belong in. I don't belong in the world as it's been

1:43:37.840 --> 1:43:44.960
 created. I'm trying to build a new world. I'm astounded that the people with the independent

1:43:44.960 --> 1:43:50.640
 means to help build that world are so demotivated that they don't want to build new structures.

1:43:52.160 --> 1:43:55.440
 The people who do want to build new structures seem to be wild eyed.

1:43:56.080 --> 1:43:58.960
 Wild eyed? What do you mean by wild eyed? They're not.

1:43:58.960 --> 1:44:04.560
 I guarantee you that I will get some message in my DMs. It says, hey, Eric, I'm a third year

1:44:05.200 --> 1:44:13.120
 chemistry student at South Dakota State. I've got a great idea. I just need funding. I want to build.

1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:16.240
 They don't have the means. The people who have the means have become.

1:44:16.240 --> 1:44:22.080
 Or the sophistication. It's like you're looking for somebody who's proven themselves a few times

1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:28.800
 to say, I've got $4 billion behind me that's soft circled. I want to figure out what

1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:34.240
 a new university would be and what it would take to protect academic freedom and who we would hire

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:37.840
 and what are the different characteristics because I can clearly see that everything

1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:43.440
 following the current model is falling apart. Nobody in my understanding is saying that.

1:44:43.440 --> 1:44:52.240
 Nobody is saying, let's take that which is functioning independently and make it less

1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:58.800
 vulnerable. Let's boost those signals. And a critical component as money, you think?

1:44:58.800 --> 1:45:03.840
 It's not only that, but it's also a kind of these people are mobbed up hands off.

1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:10.240
 Let's imagine for the moment that Sundar, Pichai, Jack Dorsey, and Mark Zuckerberg

1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:18.240
 founded a university cum social media entity.

1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:24.800
 And they said, the purpose of this is to make sure that academic freedom will not perish from

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:29.760
 this earth because it's necessary to keep us from all going crazy. And we are going to lock

1:45:29.760 --> 1:45:36.800
 ourselves out. We've come up with this governance system. And the idea is that these people will

1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:42.000
 be assigned the difficult task of making sure that society doesn't go crazy in any particular

1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:48.960
 direction, that we have a fact based reality based feasibility based understanding. We can

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:51.120
 try to figure out where our real opportunities are.

1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:59.120
 It feels like everybody with the ability to do something like that and with the

1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:05.120
 brains and experience and the resources would rather sit in the current system

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:09.600
 and hope to figure out where they can flee to if the whole thing comes apart.

1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:13.600
 Well, yeah, I mean, maybe to push back on a little bit, I agree with you, but

1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:20.400
 it feels like there's some people are trying that. So for example, Google purchased DeepMind.

1:46:21.200 --> 1:46:26.960
 DeepMind is a company that kind of represents a lot of radical ideas. They've become acceptable,

1:46:26.960 --> 1:46:35.040
 actually. AGI, artificial general intelligence, used to be really radical of a thing to talk about.

1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:40.000
 And DeepMind and OpenAI are two places which has made it more acceptable. I know

1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:46.480
 you can now start to criticize, well, they're really now that it's become acceptable,

1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:50.320
 they're not taking the further step of being more and more radical. But that wasn't

1:46:50.320 --> 1:46:56.560
 intended by Google to say that let's try some wild stuff.

1:46:57.440 --> 1:46:58.720
 Sort of like Boston Dynamics.

1:46:58.720 --> 1:47:09.120
 Boston Dynamics is a really good example of trying radical ideas for perhaps no purpose,

1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:15.840
 whatsoever, except to try out their ideas. Well, the idea is that innovation is like

1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:22.000
 dessert. You can have dessert after you solve the problem of the main course and the main

1:47:22.000 --> 1:47:28.560
 course is a bunch of insoluble problems. So that is, we can get into innovation once we

1:47:28.560 --> 1:47:33.360
 perfect ourselves. And you're saying that we need to make innovation the main meal.

1:47:33.360 --> 1:47:39.040
 Well, I'm saying that there really is structural oppression. I mean, if you train

1:47:42.880 --> 1:47:48.320
 a deep learning system on exclusively white faces, it's going to get confused. So let's not

1:47:48.960 --> 1:47:55.360
 disagree that there are real issues around this. In fact, that's an issue of innovation and data.

1:47:55.360 --> 1:48:00.880
 Your data should be responsive. On the other hand, there are things we can't do anything about

1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:08.880
 that are actually fundamental. And those things may have to do with the fact that

1:48:09.680 --> 1:48:16.720
 some of us taste cilantro as soap and some of us don't. There are differences between people.

1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:20.320
 And some of them are in the hardware, some of them are in the firmware, some of them are in the

1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:28.560
 software that is the human mind. And this completely simplistic idea that every failure

1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:36.880
 of an organization to promote each person who has particular intersexual characteristics,

1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:43.680
 we cannot hold progress hostage to that. And you've talked about,

1:48:44.880 --> 1:48:47.920
 perhaps we'll save this for another time because it's such a fascinating conversation.

1:48:47.920 --> 1:48:54.560
 You talked about this with Glenn Beck is the whole stagnation of growth and all that kind of stuff.

1:48:54.560 --> 1:49:02.000
 Your idea is that in as much as the current situation is a kind of Ponzi scheme, the current

1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:07.760
 situation in the United States is a kind of Ponzi scheme built on the promise of constant

1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:21.280
 unending innovation. We need to fund the true innovators and encourage them and empower them

1:49:21.920 --> 1:49:27.440
 and sort of culturally say that this is what this country is about is the brilliant minds.

1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:33.120
 We're going to kill each other if we don't grow. Growth is like an immune system

1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:37.920
 and you always have pathogens present. But if you don't have growth present,

1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:42.560
 you can't fight the pathogens in your society. And right now the pathogens are spreading everywhere.

1:49:43.680 --> 1:49:49.600
 So if we don't get growth into our system fairly quickly, we are in really seriously bad shape.

1:49:50.640 --> 1:49:56.480
 So it's very important that if I had a horrible person who was capable of building something

1:49:56.480 --> 1:50:01.360
 that would give us all a certain amount of what I've called financial beta to some new

1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:07.360
 technology where we all benefit, let's say quantum computing comes in and the dry cleaner

1:50:07.360 --> 1:50:15.840
 has a quantum computing angle. That's necessary to keep this system that we built going. We can

1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:21.200
 try to redesign the system, but our system expects growth and we've started for growth.

1:50:21.200 --> 1:50:25.680
 And the madness that we're seeing is the failure of our immune system to be able to handle the

1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:30.480
 pathogens that have always been present. So people can say, well, this was always there.

1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:38.000
 Yes, it was. What's changed was your immune system. We have got to make sure that one,

1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:44.880
 we understand why diversity is potentially really important. We have mined certain communities

1:50:44.880 --> 1:50:50.560
 to death. You and I are Ashkenazi Jews. Everyone knows that Ashkenazi Jews are good at technical

1:50:50.560 --> 1:50:56.160
 stuff. We know that the Chinese are good at technical stuff. The Indians have many people

1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:03.600
 who are good at technical stuff as the Japanese. I also believe that we have communities where,

1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:08.480
 if you think about the Pareto idea of diminishing returns, if you've never mined a community,

1:51:09.600 --> 1:51:12.160
 many of the people you're going to get at the beginning are going to be amazing

1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:17.440
 because that community, it's like, did you drill for more oil in Texas? Texas is pretty

1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:23.840
 thoroughly picked over. Do you find some place that's completely insane? Maybe there's oil there.

1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:32.080
 Who knows? In particular, I would like to displace our reliance on our military competitors in Asia,

1:51:32.080 --> 1:51:38.880
 in our scientific laboratories, with women, with African Americans, with Latinos, people who are

1:51:38.880 --> 1:51:43.280
 in different categories than we have traditionally sourced. And I would like to get them the money

1:51:44.080 --> 1:51:50.880
 that the market would normally give these fields were we not using visas in place of payment.

1:51:50.880 --> 1:52:01.760
 Now, I have a crazy idea, which is that you and I both play music, and I find the analytic work

1:52:01.760 --> 1:52:05.520
 that I do when I'm trying to figure out chord progressions and symmetries and tritones and

1:52:05.520 --> 1:52:08.960
 all these sorts of things to be very similar to the work that I do when I do physics or math.

1:52:10.720 --> 1:52:16.640
 I believe that one of the things that is true is that the analytic contributions of African

1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:24.320
 Americans to music are probably fungible to science. I don't know that that's true. It's true. I

1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:29.120
 haven't done controlled research, but I believe that it is very important to let the People's

1:52:29.120 --> 1:52:35.200
 Republic of China know that they are not staffing our laboratories anymore, and that we need to

1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:40.960
 look to our own people. And in particular, we are going to get a huge benefit from making sure that

1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:50.000
 women, black Americans, Latinos are in a position to take over some of these things because many

1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:55.040
 of these communities have been underutilized. Now, I don't know if that's an insane idea.

1:52:55.040 --> 1:53:00.400
 I want to hear somebody tell me why it's an insane idea, but I believe that part of what we need to

1:53:00.400 --> 1:53:05.520
 do is we need to recognize that there are security issues. There are geopolitical issues with the

1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:11.440
 funding of science and that what we've done is we've starved our world for innovation. And if

1:53:11.440 --> 1:53:15.680
 we don't get back to the business of innovation, we should be doing diversity and inclusion out

1:53:15.680 --> 1:53:22.160
 of greed rather than guilt. Now, part of the problem with this is that a lot of the energy

1:53:22.160 --> 1:53:29.520
 behind diversity and inclusion is based on guilt and accusation. And what I want is I want to kick

1:53:29.520 --> 1:53:35.280
 ass. And my hope is that diminishing returns favors mining the communities that have not

1:53:35.280 --> 1:53:42.400
 been traditionally mined in order to extract output from those communities. Unless there's

1:53:42.400 --> 1:53:46.080
 a flaw in that plan. If there's a flaw, somebody needs to tell me. If there isn't a flaw,

1:53:46.640 --> 1:53:51.520
 we need to get greedy about innovation rather than guilty about innovation.

1:53:51.520 --> 1:53:55.280
 That's really brilliantly put. My biggest problem with what I see is,

1:53:56.080 --> 1:54:02.080
 exactly speaks to that in the discussion of diversity. It's used when it's grounded in guilt.

1:54:02.080 --> 1:54:06.800
 It's then used as a hammer to shame people that don't care about diversity enough.

1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:14.720
 F that shit. So my point is, I'm excited about the idea of Jimi Hendrix doing quantum field

1:54:14.720 --> 1:54:24.640
 theory. I'm excited about the idea of art Tatum trying to figure out what the neural nets figured

1:54:24.640 --> 1:54:30.320
 out about protein folding. I have some idea of the level of intellect of people who have not

1:54:30.320 --> 1:54:34.400
 found their way into STEM subjects in incredibly technically demanding areas.

1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:39.120
 If there's a flaw in that theory, I want somebody to present the flaw.

1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:47.200
 But right now, my belief is that these things are merit based. And if you really believe in

1:54:47.200 --> 1:54:51.760
 structural oppression, you do not want an affirmative action program. You want to make

1:54:51.760 --> 1:54:58.000
 sure that people have huge amounts of resources to get themselves into position. I want to push out,

1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:03.600
 I just tried this on this clubhouse application. I want to push out Klein bottles as a secret sign

1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:10.320
 inside of rap videos in hip hop. I want people to have an idea that there's an amazing world.

1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:16.480
 And I want to get the people who hopefully I'm trying to lure into science and engineering.

1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:21.440
 I want to get them paid. I don't want them as the cheap substitutes for the fleeing

1:55:21.440 --> 1:55:28.240
 white males who've learned that they can't make any money in science and engineering.

1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:36.000
 So the problem is that we need to take over the ship, Lex. And it doesn't need to be you and me

1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:40.000
 because, quite honestly, I have no desire to administer. I don't want to be the chief executive

1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:46.160
 officer of anything. What I do want is I want the baby boomers who've made this mess and can't see it

1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:56.400
 to be gone. They had almost all of our universities. And I want fresh blood, fresh resources. I want

1:55:56.400 --> 1:56:03.280
 academic freedom. And I want greed for our country and for the future to determine diversity,

1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:06.560
 inclusion as opposed to shame and guilt, which is destroying our fabric.

1:56:08.080 --> 1:56:11.360
 That's as good of a diversity statement as I've ever heard.

1:56:11.360 --> 1:56:20.720
 This is a U turn, but somebody commented on the tweet you sent that as one of the top comments,

1:56:20.720 --> 1:56:26.720
 they definitely have to ask you about cryptocurrency. So it's a U turn, but not really,

1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:30.880
 since you're an economist, since you're deep, not an economist.

1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:37.440
 I mean, I pretend to be an economist hoping that the economists will take issue that I'm not an

1:56:37.440 --> 1:56:42.720
 economist so that I can advance gauge theoretic and field theoretic economics, which the economics

1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:48.720
 profession has failed to acknowledge was a major innovation that happened approximately 25 years

1:56:48.720 --> 1:56:53.600
 ago. I don't think that economists understand what a price index is that measures inflation,

1:56:53.600 --> 1:57:01.920
 nor do I think economists understand what a growth index or a product quantity index is

1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:09.280
 that measures GDP. I think that they don't even understand the basics of price and quantity

1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:17.440
 index construction. And therefore, they can't possibly review field theoretic economics. They

1:57:17.440 --> 1:57:22.320
 can't review gauge theoretic economics. They're intellectually not in a position to manage their

1:57:22.320 --> 1:57:27.520
 own field. You talked about that there's a stagnation in growth currently. I looked at,

1:57:27.520 --> 1:57:33.520
 from my microeconomics, macroeconomics and college perspective, GDP doesn't seem to capture

1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:43.680
 the productivity, the full spectrum of what I think is a functioning, successful society.

1:57:43.680 --> 1:57:50.400
 What do you think is broken about GDP? What does it need to include at these indices?

1:57:51.360 --> 1:57:53.440
 Let me explain what they don't understand to begin with.

1:57:53.440 --> 1:58:04.160
 Sure. Imagine that all prices and all quantities of output are the same at the end of a year

1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:09.760
 as they are at the beginning. And you ask, what happened during that year? Was there inflation?

1:58:11.040 --> 1:58:15.440
 They meandered over the course of the year, but miraculously, they all came back to exactly their

1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:22.160
 values. The amount produced at the end of the year is the same as at the beginning in every

1:58:22.160 --> 1:58:27.680
 single quantity. Typically, the claim would be that the price index should be 1.0 and that the

1:58:27.680 --> 1:58:39.920
 quantity index should be 1.0. That's clearly wrong. Why? Well, it speaks to a fundamental

1:58:39.920 --> 1:58:44.800
 confusion that economists have. They don't understand that the economy is curved and not flat.

1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:52.320
 In a curved economy, everything should be path dependence, but they view path dependence as

1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:57.920
 a problem because they are effectively the flat earth society of market analysis. They don't

1:58:57.920 --> 1:59:03.280
 understand that what they've called, and they've actually called it the cycling problem, is exactly

1:59:03.280 --> 1:59:08.080
 what they need to understand to advance their field. I'll give you a very simple example.

1:59:08.080 --> 1:59:14.720
 Let's imagine that we have Bob and Carol in one hedge fund and Ted and Alice in another.

1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:24.800
 In both cases, the females that is Alice and Carol are the chief investment officers,

1:59:26.080 --> 1:59:31.920
 and Bob and Ted are the chief marketing officers in charge of trying to get money into the fund

1:59:31.920 --> 1:59:38.960
 and trying to get people not to, in fact, remove their money from the funds.

1:59:41.440 --> 1:59:48.480
 If you, in fact, had Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice, and both hedge funds

1:59:49.600 --> 1:59:55.040
 were invested in assets whose prices came back to the same levels and whose exposures

1:59:55.040 --> 2:00:02.960
 were in the same quantities, and you wanted to compensate these two hedge funds, would

2:00:02.960 --> 2:00:11.520
 you compensate them the same necessarily? What if, for example, Carol was killing it

2:00:11.520 --> 2:00:17.280
 in terms of investments? Every time she bought some sort of security, the price of that security

2:00:17.280 --> 2:00:27.280
 went up, but Bob was the worst marketing officer. As chief marketing officer, there were tons of

2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:35.040
 redemptions because Bob was constantly drunk, Bob was making off color comments. Now, as a result,

2:00:35.040 --> 2:00:40.800
 at the end of the year, the fund hasn't grown in size because even though Carol was crushing it in

2:00:40.800 --> 2:00:47.360
 terms of the investments, Bob was screwing up everything and the redemptions were legendary,

2:00:47.360 --> 2:00:52.240
 so people were making money and still pulling it out of the fund. In the other fund,

2:00:54.560 --> 2:00:59.600
 Alice can't seem to buy a base hit every time she gets into a security, the thing plummets,

2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:07.280
 but Ted's amazing marketing skills allowed the fund to get all sorts of new subscriptions and

2:01:07.280 --> 2:01:11.200
 halted the redemptions as people hoped that the fund would get its act together.

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:21.680
 Price indices should be how Carol and Alice are compensated,

2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:34.160
 and quantity indices should be how Bob and Ted are compensated. So even though both funds

2:01:34.160 --> 2:01:40.400
 had closed loops that come back to the original states, what happened during the period that

2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:48.480
 they were active tells you how people are supposed to be compensated. Now, we know that whatever the

2:01:48.480 --> 2:01:55.760
 increase in the price index is compensated by a decrease in the quantity index or conversely,

2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:00.960
 because prices and quantities return to their original values. You could have another fund

2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:06.240
 where nothing much happened, there were no redemptions, no subscriptions, prices, the fund

2:02:06.240 --> 2:02:12.400
 remained in cash the whole time. So in that third fund, let's call that Tristan and Izalda,

2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:19.120
 that fund should have no bonuses paid because nobody did anything, but nobody should be fired

2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:25.280
 either. Now, the fact that the economists don't even understand that this is what their price

2:02:25.280 --> 2:02:30.320
 and quantity indices were intended to do, that they don't understand that you can actually

2:02:30.320 --> 2:02:34.480
 give what would be called ordinal agents, the freedom to change their preferences,

2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:40.480
 and still have something defined as a conus cost of living adjustment.

2:02:41.280 --> 2:02:43.840
 They don't even understand the mathematics of their field.

2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:48.000
 So the indices need to be able to capture some kind of dynamics that...

2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:54.080
 We have had indices that capture these dynamics due to the work of Francois de Vizier since 1925,

2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:59.840
 but the economists have not even understood what de Vizier's index truly represents.

2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:03.920
 What do you miss with such crude indices then?

2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:08.160
 Well, you miss the fact that you're supposed to have a field theoretic subject.

2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:13.360
 The representative consumer should actually be a probability distribution on the space

2:03:13.360 --> 2:03:17.360
 of all possible consumers weighted by the probability of getting any particular pull

2:03:17.360 --> 2:03:24.720
 from the distribution. We should not have a single gauge of inflation. What is that in 1973

2:03:24.720 --> 2:03:30.960
 dollars any more than you should be able to say it was 59 degrees Fahrenheit on earth yesterday?

2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:38.080
 So when we get to the cryptocurrency, what I'm going to say is that because we didn't

2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:43.840
 found economic theory on the proper marginal revolution, because we missed the major opportunity,

2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:49.520
 which is that the differential calculus of markets is gauge theory. It's not ordinary

2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:57.040
 differential calculus. We found that out in finance that it was stochastic differential

2:03:57.040 --> 2:04:02.240
 calculus. We have the wrong version of the differential calculus underneath all of modern

2:04:02.240 --> 2:04:07.440
 economic theory. And part of what I've been pushing for in cryptocurrencies is the idea

2:04:07.440 --> 2:04:13.760
 that we should be understanding that gold is a gauge theory, just as modern economic theory is

2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:19.360
 supposed to be a gauge theory, and that we should be looking to liberate cryptocurrencies, and more

2:04:19.360 --> 2:04:25.840
 importantly, distributed computing, from the problem of this unwanted global aspect, which is

2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:31.120
 the blockchain. The thing that is most celebrated in some sense about Bitcoin is, in fact, the

2:04:31.120 --> 2:04:36.240
 reason that I'm least enthusiastic about it. I'm hugely enthusiastic about what Satoshi did.

2:04:37.840 --> 2:04:43.520
 But it's an intermediate step towards trying to figure out what should digital gold actually be.

2:04:43.520 --> 2:04:51.680
 If physical gold is a collection of up quarks and down quarks in the form of protons and neutrons

2:04:52.400 --> 2:04:57.840
 held together, the quarks by gluons with electrons orbiting it held together by photons with the

2:04:57.840 --> 2:05:03.840
 occasional weak interaction beta decay, all of those are gauge theories. So gold is actually

2:05:04.400 --> 2:05:10.080
 coming from gauge theory, and markets are coming from gauge theory, and the opportunity to do

2:05:10.080 --> 2:05:14.720
 locally enforced conservation laws, which effectively is what a Bitcoin transaction is,

2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:21.600
 should theoretically be founded on a different principle that is not the blockchain. It should

2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:28.880
 be a gauge theoretic concept in which effectively the tokens are excitations on a network of computer

2:05:28.880 --> 2:05:37.920
 nodes, and the fact that let's imagine that this is some token. By moving it from my custodianship

2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:44.000
 to your custodianship, effectively, I pushed that glass as a gauge theory towards your region of the

2:05:44.000 --> 2:05:50.720
 table. We should be recognizing the gauge theory is the correct differential calculus for the 21st

2:05:50.720 --> 2:05:54.400
 century. In fact, it should have been there in the 20th century. You're saying it captures these

2:05:54.400 --> 2:06:03.440
 individual dynamics. Why should my giving you a token have to be, why should we alert the global

2:06:03.440 --> 2:06:08.400
 community in this token that that occurred? You can talk about side change, you can talk about

2:06:08.400 --> 2:06:12.800
 any means of doing this. But effectively, we have a problem, which is if I think about this

2:06:12.800 --> 2:06:20.960
 differently, I have a glass that is extant. You have a glass that is abstent. We're supposed to call

2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:26.720
 the constructor method on your glass at the same moment we call the destructor method on my glass

2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:31.120
 in order to have a conservation principle. It would be far more efficient to do this

2:06:31.120 --> 2:06:37.440
 with the one series system that is known never to throw an exception, which is nature, and nature

2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:42.960
 has chosen gauge theory and geometry for her underlying language. We now know due to work

2:06:42.960 --> 2:06:49.440
 of Pia Malani at Harvard in economics in the mid 1990s, which I was her coauthor on,

2:06:50.720 --> 2:06:59.280
 but I wish to promote her as well as this being my idea. We know that modern economic

2:06:59.280 --> 2:07:04.320
 theory is a naturally occurring gauge theory. The failure of that community to acknowledge that

2:07:04.320 --> 2:07:08.800
 that work occurred and that it was put down for reasons that make no analytic sense

2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:15.680
 is important in particular due to the relatively new innovation of distributed computing

2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:20.640
 and Satoshi's brainchild. You're thinking we need to have the mathematics that captures,

2:07:21.360 --> 2:07:25.760
 that enforces cryptocurrency as a distributed system as opposed to a centralized one where

2:07:25.760 --> 2:07:32.480
 the blockchain says that crypto should be centralized. The abundance economy, much

2:07:32.480 --> 2:07:40.000
 discussed in Silicon Valley or what's left of it, is actually a huge threat to the planet

2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:44.720
 because what it really is is what Mark Andreessen is called software eating the world.

2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:49.200
 What that means is that you're going to push things from being private goods and services

2:07:49.200 --> 2:07:54.400
 into public goods and services. Public goods and services cannot have price and value tied

2:07:54.400 --> 2:08:00.880
 together. Ergo, people will produce things of incredible value to the world that they cannot

2:08:00.880 --> 2:08:05.040
 command a price and they will not be able to capture the value that they have created or a

2:08:05.040 --> 2:08:11.440
 significant enough fraction of it. The abundance economy is a disaster. It will lead to a reduction

2:08:11.440 --> 2:08:18.560
 in human freedom. The great innovation of Satoshi is locally enforced or semi locally enforced

2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:24.960
 conservation laws where the idea is why is gold hard to create or destroy? It's

2:08:24.960 --> 2:08:29.360
 because it's created not only in stars but in violent events involving stars like supernova

2:08:29.360 --> 2:08:37.200
 collisions. When gold is created and we transact, we're using conservation laws.

2:08:37.920 --> 2:08:43.840
 The physics determines the custodianship, whatever it is that I don't have, you now have,

2:08:43.840 --> 2:08:50.720
 and conversely. In such a situation, we should be looking for the abstraction that most closely

2:08:50.720 --> 2:08:54.480
 matches the physical world because the physical world is known not to throw an exception.

2:08:55.040 --> 2:09:01.200
 The blockchain is a vulnerability. The idea that the 51% problem isn't solved, that you could have

2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:08.240
 crazy race conditions, all of these things, we know that they're solved inside of gauge theory

2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:15.200
 somehow. The important thing is to recognize that one of the greatest intellectual feats ever in the

2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:22.240
 history of economic theory took place already and was essentially instantly buried and I will

2:09:22.240 --> 2:09:29.520
 stand by those comments. Satoshi, wherever you are, I probably know you. Are you Satoshi? No.

2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:36.880
 No, no, I don't have that kind of ability. I really don't. I do other things. Speaking of

2:09:36.880 --> 2:09:45.120
 Satoshi and gauge theory, you've mentioned to Brian Keating that you may be releasing a

2:09:45.120 --> 2:09:50.800
 geometric community paper this year or some other form of additional material on the topic.

2:09:52.160 --> 2:09:56.000
 What is your thinking around this? What's the process you're going through now?

2:09:57.040 --> 2:10:01.920
 Well, it's very interesting. I used April 1st to try to start a tradition,

2:10:01.920 --> 2:10:09.360
 which I hope to use to liberate mankind. The tradition is that at least one day a year,

2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:15.520
 you should be able to say heretical things and not have Jack Dorsey boot you off

2:10:15.520 --> 2:10:19.280
 or Mark Zuckerberg. Your provost shouldn't call you up and say, what did you say?

2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:28.640
 We need at some level to have a jubilee from centralized control. And so my hope is that

2:10:28.640 --> 2:10:32.480
 you know what a tradition is in America, something a baby boomer did twice.

2:10:35.760 --> 2:10:45.360
 Impeachment? That's very funny. Anyway, so I'm not a baby boomer, but as an exer,

2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:52.160
 I thought about whether or not April 1st would be a good date on which to release a printed

2:10:52.160 --> 2:10:57.040
 version of what I already said in lecture form, because I think it's hysterically funny that

2:10:57.040 --> 2:11:04.480
 the physics community claims that it can't decode a lecture. It must be paper.

2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:08.400
 And you know what? There will be a steady stream of new complaints

2:11:08.400 --> 2:11:11.280
 up until the point that they fit it into a narrative that they like.

2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:20.000
 Yeah, I'm thinking about April 1st as a date in which to release a document and it won't be

2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:24.560
 perfectly complete, but it'll be very complete. And then they'll try to say,

2:11:24.560 --> 2:11:30.720
 it's wrong, or you already did it, or no, that was done, but what we just did on top of it is

2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:36.160
 brilliant, or it doesn't match experiment or who knows what, they'll go through all of their

2:11:36.160 --> 2:11:44.160
 usual nonsense. It's time to go. Is there still puzzles in your own mind that need to be figured

2:11:44.160 --> 2:11:48.080
 out for you to try to put it on paper? I mean, those are different mediums, right?

2:11:48.080 --> 2:11:54.720
 That was a great question. I did not count on something that turns out to be important. When

2:11:54.720 --> 2:12:00.000
 you work on your own outside of the system for a long time, you probably don't think you're going

2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:06.720
 to be doing this as a 55 year old man. And I have been so long outside of math and physics

2:12:06.720 --> 2:12:13.280
 departments, and I've been occupied with so many other things as you can see, that the old idea

2:12:13.280 --> 2:12:19.840
 that I had was if I always did it in little pieces, then I was always safe because it wouldn't be

2:12:19.840 --> 2:12:27.760
 steelable. And so now those pieces never got assembled completely. In essence, I have all the

2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:35.840
 pieces and I can fit them together. But there's probably a small amount of glue code, like there

2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:40.320
 are few algebraic things I've forgotten how to do. I may or may not figure them out between now

2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:46.720
 and April 1st. But it's pretty complete. But that's the puzzle you're kind of struggling to now

2:12:46.720 --> 2:12:52.400
 figure out to get it all in the same, the glue together. I can't tell you whether the theory

2:12:52.400 --> 2:12:57.760
 is correct or incorrect. But for example, there's what's the exact form of the supersymmetry algebra

2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:03.760
 or what's the rule for passing a minus sign through a particular operator. And all of that

2:13:03.760 --> 2:13:13.440
 stuff got a lot more difficult because I didn't do it. Look, it's a little bit like if you're

2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:18.400
 a violinist and you don't touch your violin regularly for 15 years, you come back to it and

2:13:18.400 --> 2:13:22.480
 you pretty much know the pieces sort of, but there's lots of stuff that's missing, your tone is off

2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:28.480
 and that kind of stuff. I would say I'll get the ship to the harbor and it'll require a tugboat

2:13:29.120 --> 2:13:33.520
 probably to get it in. And if the tugboat doesn't show up, then I'll pilot the thing right into

2:13:33.520 --> 2:13:37.760
 the dock myself. But it's not a big deal. I think that it is essentially complete.

2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:44.640
 Psychologically, just as a human being, this is, I remember perhaps by accident,

2:13:45.360 --> 2:13:52.240
 but maybe there's no accidents in the universe, I was tuned in, I don't remember where on April 1st

2:13:53.600 --> 2:14:00.800
 to you. Oh, I think in your discord, kind of thinking about thinking through this release.

2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:06.000
 I mean, it wasn't obvious that you were going to do it. You were thinking through it. And I

2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:10.480
 remember there was intellectual, personal, psychological struggle with this.

2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:15.440
 Yeah. Well, because I thought it was dangerous. If this turns out to be right, I don't know what

2:14:15.440 --> 2:14:25.680
 it unlocks. If it's wrong, I think I understand where we are. If it's wrong, it'll be the first

2:14:25.680 --> 2:14:35.360
 fool's gold that really looks like a theory of everything. It'll be the iron pyrides of physics.

2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:38.240
 And we haven't even had fool's gold in my opinion yet.

2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:47.440
 Got it. So what is your intuition? Why this looks right to you? Like why it feels like it would be

2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:52.240
 if wrong? I can say it very simply. It's way smarter than I am.

2:14:52.240 --> 2:14:57.440
 Can you break that apart a little more? Like every time you poke at it, it's giving you

2:14:57.440 --> 2:15:00.240
 intuitions that follow with the currently known physics.

2:15:00.240 --> 2:15:03.040
 Well, let's put it in computer science terms. Yes, please.

2:15:03.040 --> 2:15:07.280
 Okay. There's a concept of technical debt that computer scientists struggle with.

2:15:07.840 --> 2:15:11.280
 As you commit crimes, you have to pay those crimes back at a later date.

2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:18.320
 In general, most of the problem with physical theories is that as you try to do something

2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:24.400
 that matches reality, you usually have to go into some structure that gets you farther away.

2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:28.160
 And your hope is, is that you're going to be able to pay back the technical debt.

2:15:29.440 --> 2:15:34.720
 In general, these wind up as checkkiting schemes or like you're funding a startup and there are

2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:43.280
 too many pivots. So you keep adding epicycles in order to cover things that have gone wrong.

2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:52.400
 Yeah. My belief is, is that this thing represents something like a summit to me.

2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:57.600
 And I'm very proud of having found a route up this summit.

2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:04.000
 But the route is what's due to me. The summit can't possibly be due to me.

2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:12.480
 You know, like Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norge did not create Mount Everest.

2:16:13.040 --> 2:16:17.680
 They know that they didn't create that. They figured out a way up.

2:16:18.640 --> 2:16:23.840
 You got to tell me what Mount Everest is in this metaphor relative and also connected to the

2:16:23.840 --> 2:16:29.040
 technical debt. So technical debt is a negative thing that it's kind of, you're a little venture

2:16:29.040 --> 2:16:35.600
 to have to pay it. Are you saying in the, in the ascent that you're seeing now in the theory is

2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:40.160
 you do not have much technical debt? Well, that's right. I think that what happens is, is that early

2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:50.400
 on, what I would say is, I believe now that the physics community has said many things

2:16:50.400 --> 2:16:56.560
 incorrectly about the current state of the universe. They're not wildly off, which is why,

2:16:56.560 --> 2:17:02.160
 like for example, the claim is that there are three generations of matter. I do not believe that

2:17:02.160 --> 2:17:05.280
 there are three generations of matter. I believe that there are two generations of matter and

2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:13.360
 there is a third collection that looks like a generation of matter as the first two, only at

2:17:13.360 --> 2:17:20.240
 low energy. Okay. Well, that's not a frequent claim. People imagine that there are three or more

2:17:20.240 --> 2:17:24.880
 generations of matter. I would claim that that's false. People claim that the matter is chiral,

2:17:24.880 --> 2:17:30.960
 that it is, it knows it's left from its right. I would claim that the chirality is not fundamental,

2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:37.840
 but it is emergent. We could keep going at all these sorts of things. People think that space

2:17:37.840 --> 2:17:42.640
 time is the fundamental geometric, geometric construct. I do not agree. I think it's something

2:17:42.640 --> 2:17:51.600
 that I've termed the observers. All of these different things represent a series of over

2:17:51.600 --> 2:18:01.120
 interpretations of the world that preclude progress. I think you gave some credit to

2:18:01.120 --> 2:18:10.000
 string theory. I think loop quantum gravity, if I remember correctly, as getting close to the

2:18:10.000 --> 2:18:17.920
 fool's gold. I've said that Garrett Leasy phenomenologically gets a lot of things right.

2:18:17.920 --> 2:18:24.720
 He's got a reason for chirality, a reason for uniqueness using E8. In fact, E8 uses something

2:18:24.720 --> 2:18:35.120
 called vial fermions, which are chiral. He has a way of getting Riemann's geometry underneath

2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:39.440
 general relativity to play with Erasmann's geometry, which is underneath the standard model,

2:18:39.440 --> 2:18:44.080
 using something called Cartan connections that are out of favor. He's figured out something

2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:48.320
 involving super connections to make sure that the fermions, the matter in the system,

2:18:48.320 --> 2:18:52.800
 isn't quantized the same way as the bosons were, which is a problem in his old theory.

2:18:53.680 --> 2:18:58.160
 He's got something about three generations for triality. He's got a lot of phenomenological

2:18:58.160 --> 2:19:02.880
 hits. I don't think Garrett's theory works. It also has a very simple Lagrangian. He's

2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:07.760
 basically using the Yang–Mills norm squared, the same thing you would use as a cost function

2:19:07.760 --> 2:19:16.320
 if you were doing neural nets. The string theorists have a different selling point,

2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:21.360
 which is that they may have gotten a renormalizable theory of gravity if quantum gravity was what

2:19:21.360 --> 2:19:26.800
 we were meant to do. They've done some stuff with black holes that they can get some solutions

2:19:28.480 --> 2:19:32.720
 correct, and then they have lots of agreements where they show mathematical

2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:39.920
 truths that mathematicians didn't even know. I'm very underwhelmed by string theory based

2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:44.640
 on how many people have worked on it and how little is supporting the claims to it being a

2:19:44.640 --> 2:19:52.400
 theory of everything. Those are the two that I take quite seriously. I don't yet take Wolframs

2:19:52.960 --> 2:19:58.560
 quite seriously because if he really finds one of these cellular automatons that are really

2:19:58.560 --> 2:20:03.920
 distinct and generative, it'll be amazing. But he's looking for such a thing. I don't think

2:20:03.920 --> 2:20:10.560
 he's found anything. Techmark, I view as a philosopher who is somehow taking credit for

2:20:10.560 --> 2:20:15.600
 Platonism, which I don't see any reason for fighting with Max because I like Max. But

2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:20.000
 if it ever comes time, I'm putting a post it note that I'm not positive that the mathematical

2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:29.120
 universe hypothesis is really anything new. In general, loop quantum gravity really I think

2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:34.080
 grew out of some hopes that the general relativistic community had that they would be able to do

2:20:34.080 --> 2:20:39.920
 particle theory. I don't think that they've shown any particle theoretic realism. Essentially,

2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:47.840
 here's what I really think, Lex. I think we didn't understand how big the difference between

2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:53.040
 an effective theory and a theory of everything is conceptually. Maybe it's not mathematically

2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:57.840
 that different. But conceptually, trying to figure out what a theory of everything—how

2:20:57.840 --> 2:21:03.440
 does the universe—and I've compared it to Escher's drawing hands—how do two hands draw

2:21:03.440 --> 2:21:10.400
 themselves into existence? That's the puzzle that I think has just been wanting. I'll be honest,

2:21:10.400 --> 2:21:20.960
 I'm really surprised that the theoretical physics community didn't even get up on their high horse

2:21:20.960 --> 2:21:26.960
 and say, this is the most stupid nonsense imaginable because clearly, I always say,

2:21:26.960 --> 2:21:32.080
 I'm not a physicist. I'm an amateur with the heart as big as all outdoors.

2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:41.280
 In your journey of releasing this, and I'm sure there may be another American tradition on

2:21:41.280 --> 2:21:54.880
 April 1st that will continue for years to come, there's crumbs along the way that I'm hoping

2:21:54.880 --> 2:22:04.640
 to collect in my naive view of things, of the beauty in your geometric view of the universe.

2:22:07.280 --> 2:22:17.440
 One question I'd like to ask is if you were to challenge me to visualize something beautiful,

2:22:17.440 --> 2:22:23.280
 something important about geometric unity in my struggle to appreciate some of its beauty

2:22:23.280 --> 2:22:26.800
 from the outsider's perspective, what would that thing be?

2:22:28.400 --> 2:22:29.520
 Interesting question.

2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:32.720
 Perhaps we can both have a journey towards April 1st.

2:22:34.880 --> 2:22:35.600
 Take a look at that.

2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:44.400
 Some kind of a scrunchie that I picked up on Melrose—not Melrose, a Montana in Santa Monica.

2:22:45.600 --> 2:22:50.480
 Now, you'll notice that all of those discs rotate independently.

2:22:50.480 --> 2:23:01.040
 Yes. If you rotate groups of those in a way that is continuous but not uniform everywhere,

2:23:01.040 --> 2:23:07.200
 what you're doing is a so called gauge transformation on the torus seen as a U1 bundle

2:23:07.200 --> 2:23:15.440
 over a U1 spacetime. The concept of spacetime here in a very simplified case isn't four

2:23:15.440 --> 2:23:20.800
 dimensional, but it's one dimensional. It's just a circle and there's a circle above every

2:23:20.800 --> 2:23:29.440
 point in the circle represented by those little discs. Imagine, if you will, that we took a rubber

2:23:29.440 --> 2:23:37.120
 band and placed it around here and decided that that was a function from the circle into

2:23:38.560 --> 2:23:43.120
 this circle that is representing a y axis that's wrapped around itself.

2:23:43.120 --> 2:23:47.680
 Well, you would have an idea of what it means for a function to be constant

2:23:47.680 --> 2:23:54.000
 if it just went all around the outside. But what happens if I turn this a little bit? Then the

2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:57.680
 function would be mostly constant. It would have a little place where it dipped and it went back.

2:23:58.320 --> 2:24:05.920
 It turns out that you can transform that function and transform the derivative that says

2:24:05.920 --> 2:24:11.920
 that function is equal to zero when I take its derivative at the same time. That's what a gauge

2:24:11.920 --> 2:24:22.320
 transformation is. Amazing to me that we don't have a simple video visualizing things that I've

2:24:22.320 --> 2:24:30.480
 already had built and that I can clearly demonstrate when you do that torus whose the code of the

2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:38.720
 torus is itself generating spinning. This is a U1 principle bundle. The world needs to know what

2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:43.680
 a gauge theory is, not by analogy, not what Lawrence Krauss is saying. It's like a checkerboard. If

2:24:43.680 --> 2:24:50.640
 you change some of the colors this way, not saying that it's a local symmetry involving

2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:55.600
 like none of those things. It's a theory of differential calculus where the functions and

2:24:55.600 --> 2:25:02.080
 the derivatives are both subject to a particular kind of change so that if a function was constant

2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:08.320
 under one derivative, then the new function is constant under the new derivative transformed in

2:25:08.320 --> 2:25:13.440
 the same fashion. Would you put that under the category of just gauge transformations?

2:25:13.440 --> 2:25:17.600
 Yes, that would be gauge transformations applied to sections and connections where

2:25:17.600 --> 2:25:25.760
 connections are the derivatives in the theory. This is easily explained. It is pathological

2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:30.240
 that the community of people who understand what I'm saying have never bothered to do this in a

2:25:30.240 --> 2:25:38.560
 clear fashion for the general public. You and I could visualize this overnight. This is not hard.

2:25:38.560 --> 2:25:44.320
 The public needs to know in some sense that, let's say quantum electrodynamics, the theory of

2:25:44.320 --> 2:25:49.600
 photons and electrons, more or less electrons are functions and photons are derivatives.

2:25:51.600 --> 2:25:57.040
 You can object in some ways, but basically a gauge theory is the way in which you can translate

2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:04.400
 a shift in the definition of the functions and the shift of the definition of the derivatives

2:26:04.400 --> 2:26:10.480
 so that the underlying physics is not harmed or changed. You have to do both at the same time.

2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:15.920
 Now, you and I can visualize that. If what you wanted to do rather than going directly to geometric

2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:20.640
 unity is that I could sit down with you and I could say, here are the various components of

2:26:20.640 --> 2:26:26.720
 geometric unity. If the public needs a visualization in order to play along, we've got a little

2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:32.320
 over two months and I'd be happy to work with you. I love that as a challenge and I'll take it on

2:26:32.320 --> 2:26:38.400
 and I hope we do make it happen. David Goggins, if Lex doesn't do some super macho thing because

2:26:38.400 --> 2:26:44.160
 he's got to work to get some of this stuff done, you'll understand he'll be available to you after

2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:49.920
 April. Thank you for the escape clause. I really needed that escape clause. I'm glad that's on

2:26:49.920 --> 2:26:55.040
 record. I'm worried 48 miles in 48 hours. By the way, I just want to say how much I admire

2:26:55.040 --> 2:27:03.680
 your willingness to keep this hard core attitude. I know that Russians have it and Russian Jews

2:27:03.680 --> 2:27:09.840
 have it in spades, but it's harder to do in a society that's sloppy and that's weak and that's

2:27:09.840 --> 2:27:16.240
 lazy. The fact that you bring so much heart to saying, I'm going to bring this to jujitsu,

2:27:16.240 --> 2:27:19.360
 I'm going to bring this to guitar, I'm going to bring this to AI, I'm going to bring this to

2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:24.960
 podcasting, it comes through loud and clear. I just find it completely and utterly inspiring

2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:30.000
 that you keep this hard core aspect at the same time that you're the guy who's extolling the

2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:34.800
 virtue of love in a modern society and doing it at scale. Thank you. That means a lot. I don't

2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:39.200
 know why I'm doing it, but I'm just following my heart on it and just going with the gut.

2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:46.480
 This seems to make sense somehow. I personally think we better get tougher or we're going to get

2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:53.040
 in a world of pain. I do think that when it comes time to lead, it's great to have people who

2:27:53.040 --> 2:28:00.160
 you know don't crack under pressure. Do you mind if we talk about love and what it takes to be a

2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:04.480
 father for a bit? Sure. Do you mind if Zev joins us? I'd be an honor.

2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:14.640
 So, Eric, I've talked to your son, Zev, who's an incredible human being, but let me

2:28:14.640 --> 2:28:22.320
 ask you, this might be difficult because you're both sitting together,

2:28:24.080 --> 2:28:32.720
 what advice do you have for him as he makes his way in this world, especially given that,

2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:38.240
 as we mentioned before on Joe Rogan, you're flawed and that just like all humans, you're mortal.

2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:46.800
 Well, at some level, I guess one of my issues is that I've got to stop giving quite so much advice.

2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:55.200
 Early on, I was very worried that I could see Zev's abilities and I could see his challenges,

2:28:55.200 --> 2:29:01.760
 and I saw them in terms of myself. A certain amount of Zev rhymes with whatever I went through

2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:09.760
 as a kid, and I don't want to doom him to the same outcomes that suffice for me. I think that he's

2:29:09.760 --> 2:29:16.000
 got a much better head on his shoulders at age 15. He's much better adjusted, and in part,

2:29:17.360 --> 2:29:22.480
 it's important for me to recognize that because I think I did a reasonably decent job early on,

2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:32.240
 I don't need to get this part right. I'm looking at Zev's trajectory and saying,

2:29:33.200 --> 2:29:38.000
 you're going to need to be incredibly and even pathologically self confident.

2:29:38.800 --> 2:29:42.160
 The antidote for that is going to be something you're going to need to carry on board,

2:29:42.160 --> 2:29:47.680
 which is radical humility, and you're going to have to have those in a dialectical tension,

2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:53.520
 which is never resolved, which is a huge burden. You are going to have to forgive people who do

2:29:53.520 --> 2:29:58.960
 not appreciate your gifts because your gifts are clearly evident and many people will have to pretend

2:29:58.960 --> 2:30:03.440
 not to see them because if they see your gifts, then they're going to have to question their

2:30:03.440 --> 2:30:11.360
 entire approach to education or employment or critical thinking. What my hope is is that you

2:30:11.360 --> 2:30:16.000
 can just forgive those who don't see them and who complicate and frustrate your life and realize

2:30:16.000 --> 2:30:20.000
 that you're going to have to take care of them too. Zev, let me ask you the more challenging

2:30:20.000 --> 2:30:24.000
 question because the guy sitting right here, what advice do you have for your dad?

2:30:24.880 --> 2:30:33.120
 Since after talking to you, I realize you're the more brilliant aside from the better looking

2:30:33.840 --> 2:30:44.480
 member of the family. Sorry. You can say anything you want. This is the last time

2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:49.440
 we're going to be seen left. This could be an awkward drive home.

2:30:51.680 --> 2:31:00.560
 I think sort of a new perspective I've taken on parenting is that it is a task for which

2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:08.320
 no human is really supposed to be prepared. There are Jewish tradition, for example, there are

2:31:08.320 --> 2:31:17.440
 myriad analogies in the Torah and the Talmud that compare the role of a parent to the role of a God.

2:31:18.800 --> 2:31:26.080
 No human is prepared to play God and create and guide a life, but somehow we're forced into it

2:31:26.080 --> 2:31:35.200
 as people. I think sometimes it's hard for children to understand that however their parents are

2:31:35.200 --> 2:31:46.240
 failing is something for which we must budget because our parents play a role in our lives,

2:31:47.360 --> 2:31:53.600
 of which they're not worthy and they devote themselves to regardless because that becomes

2:31:53.600 --> 2:32:09.120
 who they are in a certain sense. I hope to have realistic expectations of you as a human because

2:32:09.120 --> 2:32:16.080
 I think too often it's easy to have godly expectations of people who are far from

2:32:16.080 --> 2:32:24.960
 such a role. I think I'm really happy that you've been as open as you have with me about the fact

2:32:24.960 --> 2:32:37.840
 that you don't pretend to be a god in my life. You are a guide who allows me to see myself

2:32:38.400 --> 2:32:44.160
 and that's been very important considering the fact that by your self teaching paradigm

2:32:44.160 --> 2:32:52.560
 I will have to guide myself and being able to see it and see myself accurately has been

2:32:52.560 --> 2:33:00.960
 one of the greatest gifts that you've given me. So I'm very appreciative and I want you to know

2:33:00.960 --> 2:33:16.560
 that I don't buy into the role that you're supposed to sort of fake your way through in my life but

2:33:16.560 --> 2:33:27.600
 I am unbelievably happy with a more realistic connection that we've been able to build in

2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:33.840
 lieu of it. I think it's been easier on you actually as you come to realize what I don't know

2:33:33.840 --> 2:33:39.040
 and what I can't do and that there's been a period of time I guess that's fascinating to me where

2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:46.400
 you're sort of surprised that I don't know the answer to a certain thing as well as you do and

2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:52.640
 that I remember going through this with a particular mathematician who I held and I still

2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:59.440
 hold in awe named David Kajdan and you know he famously said to him and weirdly our family knew

2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:06.720
 his family in the Soviet Union but he said you know Eric I always appreciate you coming to my

2:34:06.720 --> 2:34:11.280
 office because I always find what you have to say interesting but you have to realize that in the

2:34:11.280 --> 2:34:14.960
 areas that you're talking about you are no longer the student you are actually my teacher

2:34:15.920 --> 2:34:21.280
 and I wasn't prepared to hear that and there are many ways in which as I was just saying with the

2:34:21.280 --> 2:34:29.280
 Mozart I am learning at an incredible rate from you I used to learn from you because I didn't

2:34:29.280 --> 2:34:34.240
 understand what was possible you were very much I mean this is the weird thing there used to be

2:34:34.240 --> 2:34:38.560
 this thing called Harvey the invisible rabbit this guy could had a rabbit that was like six feet

2:34:38.560 --> 2:34:45.200
 tall that only he could see maybe was talking and that was like you at age four is you were saying

2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:50.640
 batch of crazy things that were all totally sensible and nobody else could put them together

2:34:50.640 --> 2:34:57.520
 and so what's wonderful is that the world hasn't caught on but enormous numbers of people

2:34:57.520 --> 2:35:05.760
 are starting to and I really do hope that that genuineness of spirit and that outside the box

2:35:05.760 --> 2:35:14.560
 intellectual commitment serves you well as the world starts to appreciate that I think you're a

2:35:14.560 --> 2:35:19.680
 very trustworthy voice you don't get everything right but the idea that we have somebody at your

2:35:19.680 --> 2:35:23.920
 age who's embedded in your generation who can tell us something about what's happening is

2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:29.920
 really valuable to me and I do hope that you'll consider boosting that voice more than just at

2:35:29.920 --> 2:35:41.280
 the dinner table. I apologize for saying this four letter word but do you love Zav? I was really

2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:47.760
 worried it was going to be another four letter word. There's so many. It doesn't even rise

2:35:47.760 --> 2:35:55.440
 to the level of a question. I mean I just there are a tiny number of people with whom you share

2:35:55.440 --> 2:36:04.000
 so much life that you can't even think of yourself in their absence and I don't know if Zav would

2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:13.360
 find that but it's you can have a kid and never make this level of connection. I think even right

2:36:13.360 --> 2:36:22.240
 down to the fact that you know when Zav chooses boogie woogie piano for his own set of reasons

2:36:22.240 --> 2:36:29.440
 why I would choose boogie woogie piano if I could play in any style it's a question about a decrease

2:36:29.440 --> 2:36:34.960
 in loneliness. You know like my grandfather played the mandolin and I had to learn some

2:36:34.960 --> 2:36:41.440
 mandolin because otherwise that instrument would go silent. You don't expect that you get

2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:49.200
 this much of a chance to leave this much of yourself in another person who is choosing it

2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:59.120
 and recreating it rather than it being directly instilled and my proudest achievement is in a

2:36:59.120 --> 2:37:07.520
 certain sense having not taught him and having shared this much so you know it's not even love

2:37:07.520 --> 2:37:18.080
 it's like well beyond. So you mentioned love for you making a less lonely world. I think I speak for

2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:24.800
 I would argue probably millions of people that you Eric because this is a conversation with you

2:37:24.800 --> 2:37:32.880
 have made for many people for me a less lonely world and I can't wait to see how

2:37:32.880 --> 2:37:41.760
 how you Zav develop as an intellect but also I'm so heartworn by the optimism and the hopefulness

2:37:41.760 --> 2:37:50.320
 that was in you that I hope develops further and lastly I'm deeply thankful that you Eric

2:37:50.320 --> 2:37:59.920
 are my friend and would give me would honor me with this watch. It means more than words can say.

2:37:59.920 --> 2:38:05.040
