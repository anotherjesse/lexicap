 The following is a conversation with Alex Filipenko, an astrophysicist and professor of astronomy

00:05.680 --> 00:11.840
 from Berkeley. He was a member of both the supernova cosmology project and the high Z supernova

00:11.840 --> 00:18.080
 search team, which used observations of the extra galactic supernova to discover that the

00:18.080 --> 00:24.400
 universe is accelerating, and that this implies the existence of dark energy. This discovery

00:24.400 --> 00:31.360
 resulted in the 2011 Nobel Prize for physics. Outside of his groundbreaking research, he is a

00:31.360 --> 00:36.800
 great science communicator and is one of the most widely admired educators in the world.

00:37.520 --> 00:42.000
 I really enjoyed this conversation and am sure Alex will be back again in the future.

00:42.880 --> 00:46.720
 Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:53.600 --> 01:00.400
 caffeine boost, better help and online therapy with a licensed professional, masterclass,

01:00.400 --> 01:04.880

01:10.720 --> 01:17.120
 description to get a discount and to support this podcast. As a side note, let me say that as we

01:17.120 --> 01:23.200
 talk about in this conversation, the objects that populate the universe are both awe inspiring

01:23.200 --> 01:31.280
 and terrifying in their capacity to create and to destroy us. Solar flares and asteroids lurking

01:31.280 --> 01:38.160
 in the darkness of space threaten our humble fragile existence here on earth. In the chaos,

01:38.160 --> 01:45.520
 tension, conflict and social division of 2020, it's easy to forget just how lucky we humans are

01:45.520 --> 01:53.440
 to be here. And with a bit of hard work, maybe one day we'll venture out towards the stars.

02:16.400 --> 02:21.280
 Well, that's a great question. That's one of the big questions of cosmology. And of course,

02:22.400 --> 02:27.280
 we have evidence that the matter density is sufficiently low that the universe will expand

02:27.280 --> 02:33.200
 forever. But not only that, there's this weird repulsive effect. We call it dark energy for

02:33.200 --> 02:38.080
 want of a better term. And it appears to be accelerating the expansion of the universe.

02:38.640 --> 02:44.720
 So if that continues, the universe will expand forever. But it need not necessarily continue.

02:44.720 --> 02:51.600
 It could reverse sign, in which case the universe could, in principle, collapse at some point in

02:51.600 --> 02:57.680
 the far, far future. So in terms of investment advice, if you were to give me and then to bet

02:57.680 --> 03:01.280
 all my money on one or the other, where does your intuition currently lie?

03:01.280 --> 03:05.840
 Well, right now, I would say that it would expand forever because I think that the dark

03:05.840 --> 03:13.440
 energy is likely to be just quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. The vacuum zero energy state is

03:13.440 --> 03:19.440
 not a state of zero energy. That is, the ground state is a state of some elevated energy, which

03:19.440 --> 03:25.840
 has a repulsive effect to it. And that will never go away because it's not something that changes

03:25.840 --> 03:30.720
 with time. So if the universe is accelerating now, it will forever continue to do so.

03:31.600 --> 03:36.640
 And yet, I mean, you're so effortlessly mentioned dark energy. Do we have any

03:36.640 --> 03:41.040
 understanding of what the heck that thing is? Well, not really. But we're getting

03:41.040 --> 03:46.800
 progressively better observational constraints. So different theories of what it might be

03:47.440 --> 03:52.320
 predict different sorts of behavior for the evolution of the universe. And we've been

03:52.320 --> 03:58.960
 measuring the evolution of the universe now. And the data appear to agree with the predictions

03:58.960 --> 04:07.440
 of a constant density vacuum energy, a zero point energy. But one can't prove that that's

04:07.440 --> 04:14.480
 what it is because one would have to show that the measured numbers agree with the predictions to

04:14.480 --> 04:20.080
 an arbitrary number of decimal places. And of course, even if you've got 8, 9, 10, 12 decimal

04:20.080 --> 04:27.600
 places, what if in the 13th one, the measurements significantly differ from the prediction? Then

04:27.600 --> 04:36.160
 the dark energy isn't this vacuum state, ground state energy of the vacuum. And so then it could be

04:36.160 --> 04:42.560
 some sort of a field, some sort of a new energy, a little bit like light, like electromagnetism,

04:42.560 --> 04:50.160
 but very different from light, that fills space. And that type of energy could, in principle,

04:50.160 --> 04:56.160
 change in the distant future. It could become gravitationally attractive for all we know.

04:56.160 --> 05:01.360
 There is a historical precedent to that. And that is that the inflation with which the universe

05:01.360 --> 05:07.600
 began when the universe was just a tiny blink of an eye old, a trillionth of a trillionth of a

05:07.600 --> 05:14.000
 trillionth of a second, the universe went whoosh, it exponentially expanded. That dark energy like

05:14.000 --> 05:21.520
 substance we call the inflaton, that which inflated the universe, later decayed into more or less

05:21.520 --> 05:27.680
 normal, gravitationally attractive matter. So the exponential early expansion of the universe

05:27.680 --> 05:34.800
 did transition to a deceleration, which then dominated the universe for about nine billion years.

05:34.800 --> 05:43.040
 And now this small amount of dark energy started causing an acceleration about five billion years

05:43.040 --> 05:48.080
 ago. And whether that will continue or not is something that we'd like to answer, but I don't

05:48.080 --> 05:55.040
 know that we will anytime soon. So there could be this interesting field that we don't yet understand

05:55.040 --> 05:59.680
 that's morphing over time, that's changing the way the universe is expanding. I mean,

06:00.720 --> 06:05.680
 it's funny that you were thinking through this rigorously like an experimentalist.

06:06.480 --> 06:12.240
 But what about like the fundamental physics of dark energy? Is there any understanding

06:13.680 --> 06:22.160
 of what the heck it is? Or is this the kind of the God of the gaps or the field of the gaps?

06:22.160 --> 06:26.640
 So there must be something there because of what we're observing.

06:26.640 --> 06:32.080
 I'm very much a person who believes that there's always a cause. There are no

06:33.360 --> 06:41.840
 miracles of a supernatural nature. So I mean, there are two broad categories,

06:41.840 --> 06:48.320
 either it's the vacuum zero point energy, or it's some sort of a new energy field that

06:48.320 --> 06:55.280
 pervades the universe. The latter could change with time. The former, the vacuum energy cannot.

06:55.840 --> 07:00.800
 So if it turns out that it's one of these new fields, and there are many, many possibilities,

07:00.800 --> 07:06.400
 they go by the name of quintessence and things like that. But there are many categories of

07:06.400 --> 07:14.720
 those sorts of fields. We try with data to rule them out by comparing the actual measurements

07:14.720 --> 07:21.760
 with the predictions. And some have been ruled out, but many, many others remain to be tested.

07:21.760 --> 07:25.920
 And the data just have to become a lot better before we can rule out

07:25.920 --> 07:31.760
 most of them and become reasonably convinced that this is a vacuum energy.

07:31.760 --> 07:35.440
 So there is hypotheses for different fields with names and stuff like that?

07:35.440 --> 07:39.760
 Yeah, you know, generically quintessence like the Aristotelian fifth essence,

07:39.760 --> 07:46.080
 but there are many, many versions of quintessence. There's K essence. There's even ideas that,

07:46.080 --> 07:51.760
 you know, this isn't something from within this dark energy, but rather there are a bunch of,

07:51.760 --> 07:57.360
 say, bubble universes surrounding our universe. And this whole idea of the multiverse is not

07:57.360 --> 08:02.880
 some crazy mad men type idea anymore. It's, you know, real card carrying physicists are

08:02.880 --> 08:07.840
 seriously considering this possibility of a multiverse. And some types of multiverses could

08:07.840 --> 08:14.400
 have, you know, a bunch of bubbles on the outside, which gravitationally act outward on our bubble

08:15.040 --> 08:21.040
 because gravity or gravitons, the quantum particle that is thought to carry gravity is

08:21.040 --> 08:26.960
 thought to traverse the bulk, the space between these different little bubble membranes and stuff.

08:26.960 --> 08:31.200
 And so it's conceivable that these other universes are pulling outward on us.

08:31.200 --> 08:38.160
 That's not a favored explanation right now. But really, nothing has been ruled out. No

08:38.160 --> 08:44.480
 class of models has been ruled out completely. Certain examples within classes of models have

08:44.480 --> 08:51.760
 been ruled out. But in general, I think we still have really a lot to learn about what's causing

08:51.760 --> 08:58.560
 this observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe, be it dark energy or some forces

08:58.560 --> 09:06.160
 from the outside, or perhaps, you know, I guess it's conceivable that, and sometimes I wake up

09:06.160 --> 09:12.640
 in the middle of the night screaming, the dark energy that which causes the acceleration and

09:12.640 --> 09:18.080
 dark matter that which causes galaxies and clusters of galaxies to be bound gravitationally,

09:18.080 --> 09:25.440
 even though there's not enough visible matter to do so. Maybe these are our 20th and 21st century

09:25.440 --> 09:32.800
 Ptolemyic epicycles. So Ptolemy had a geocentric and Aristotelian view of the world. Everything

09:32.800 --> 09:39.920
 goes around Earth. But in order to explain the backward motion of planets among the stars that

09:39.920 --> 09:45.280
 happens every year or two, or sometimes several times a year for Mercury and Venus, you needed

09:45.280 --> 09:51.360
 the planets to go around in little circles called epicycles, which themselves then went around Earth.

09:51.360 --> 09:59.040
 Yes. And in this part of the epicycle where the planet is going in the direction opposite to the

09:59.040 --> 10:05.440
 direction of the overall epicycle, it can appear in projection to be going backward among the stars,

10:05.440 --> 10:10.720
 so called retrograde motion. And it was a brilliant mathematical scheme. In fact,

10:10.720 --> 10:17.440
 he could have added epicycles on top of epicycles and reproduced the observed positions of planets

10:17.440 --> 10:23.760
 to arbitrary accuracy. And this is really the beginning of what we now call Fourier analysis.

10:24.480 --> 10:31.440
 Any periodic function can be represented by a sum of sines and cosines of different periods,

10:31.440 --> 10:39.120
 amplitudes, and phases. So it could have worked arbitrarily well. But other data show that,

10:39.120 --> 10:46.400
 in fact, Earth is going around the sun. So our dark energy and dark matter, just these

10:46.400 --> 10:52.800
 band aids that we now have to try to explain the data, but they're just completely wrong.

10:52.800 --> 10:58.400
 That's a possibility as well. And as a scientist, I have to be open to that possibility as an open

10:58.400 --> 11:04.640
 minded scientist. How do you put yourself in the mindset of somebody that, or a majority of the

11:04.640 --> 11:09.040
 scientific community, or a majority of people believe that the Earth, everything rotates around

11:09.040 --> 11:21.360
 Earth? How do you put yourself in that mindset and then take a leap to propose a model that the

11:21.360 --> 11:27.520
 sun is, in fact, at the center of the solar system? Sure. I mean, so that puts us back

11:27.520 --> 11:35.680
 in the shoes of Copernicus 500 years ago, where he had this philosophical preference

11:35.680 --> 11:42.720
 for the sun being the dominant body in what we now call the solar system. The observational

11:42.720 --> 11:51.040
 evidence in terms of the measured positions of planets was not better explained by the heliocentric

11:51.040 --> 11:57.840
 sun centered system. It's just that Copernicus saw that the sun is the source of all our light and

11:57.840 --> 12:05.280
 heat. He knew from other studies that it's far away. So the fact that it appears

12:05.280 --> 12:09.760
 as big as the moon means it's actually way, way bigger because even at that time it was known

12:09.760 --> 12:15.600
 that the sun is much farther away than the moon. So he just felt, wow, it's big, it's bright.

12:16.160 --> 12:22.000
 What if it's the central thing? But the observed positions of planets at the time

12:23.040 --> 12:29.840
 in the early to mid 16th century under the heliocentric system was not a better match,

12:29.840 --> 12:35.200
 at least not a significantly better match than Ptolemy's system, which was quite accurate and

12:35.200 --> 12:43.840
 lasted 1500 years. That's so fascinating to think that the philosophical predispositions

12:43.840 --> 12:47.680
 that you bring to the table are essential. So you have to have a young person come along

12:48.400 --> 12:55.680
 that has a weird infatuation with the sun. That almost philosophically is however they're

12:55.680 --> 13:02.320
 upbringing me as they're more ready for whatever the simpler answer is. Right.

13:03.440 --> 13:10.880
 Oh, that's kind of sad. It's sad from an individual descendant of a perspective because

13:11.520 --> 13:18.960
 then that means like me, you as a scientist, you're stuck with whatever the heck philosophies

13:18.960 --> 13:24.800
 you brought to the table. You might be almost completely unable to think outside this particular

13:24.800 --> 13:28.160
 box you've built. Right. This is why I'm saying that as an objective

13:28.160 --> 13:36.400
 scientist, one needs to have an open mind to crazy sounding new ideas. Even Copernicus was

13:36.400 --> 13:42.960
 very much a man of his time and dedicated his work to the pope. He still used circular orbits.

13:42.960 --> 13:49.440
 The sun was a little bit off center, it turns out, and a slightly off center circle looks like a

13:49.440 --> 13:56.480
 slightly eccentric elliptical orbit. So then when Kepler in fact showed that the orbits are actually

13:56.480 --> 14:05.680
 in general ellipses, not circles, the reason that he needed to cobrar his really great data

14:05.680 --> 14:11.200
 to show that distinction was that a slightly off center circle is not much different from

14:11.200 --> 14:17.120
 a slightly eccentric ellipse. And so there wasn't much difference between Kepler's view

14:17.120 --> 14:25.840
 and Copernicus's view, and Kepler needed the better data to cobrar's data. And so that's

14:26.480 --> 14:34.480
 again a great example of science and observations and experiments working together with hypotheses,

14:34.480 --> 14:39.520
 and they kind of bounce off each other, they play off of each other, and you continually need

14:39.520 --> 14:48.480
 more observations. And it wasn't until Galileo's work around 1610 that actual evidence for the

14:48.480 --> 14:54.640
 heliocentric hypothesis emerged. It came in the form of Venus, the planet Venus, going through

14:54.640 --> 15:02.080
 all of the possible phases from new to crescent to quarter to gibbous to full to waning gibbous,

15:02.080 --> 15:07.120
 third quarter waning crescent, and then new again. It turns out in the Ptolemaic system,

15:07.120 --> 15:12.640
 with Venus between Earth and the Sun, but always roughly in the direction of the Sun,

15:12.640 --> 15:20.960
 you could only get the new and crescent phases of Venus. But the observations showed a full set of

15:20.960 --> 15:26.400
 phases. And moreover, when Venus was gibbous or full, that meant it was on the far side of the Sun,

15:26.400 --> 15:31.280
 that meant it was farther from Earth than when it's crescent, so it should appear smaller,

15:31.280 --> 15:38.080
 and indeed it did. So that was the nail in the coffin, in a sense. And then Galileo's other

15:38.080 --> 15:44.160
 great observation was that Jupiter has moons going around it before Galilean satellites,

15:44.160 --> 15:50.400
 and even though Jupiter moves through space, so too do the moons go with it. So first of all,

15:50.400 --> 15:54.320
 Earth is not the only thing that has other things going around it. And secondly,

15:54.320 --> 16:02.240
 Earth could be moving, as Jupiter does, and things would move with it. We wouldn't fly off the

16:02.240 --> 16:06.960
 surface and our moon wouldn't be left behind and all this kind of stuff. So that was a big

16:06.960 --> 16:12.480
 breakthrough as well, but it wasn't as definitive, in my opinion, as the phases of Venus.

16:13.200 --> 16:17.520
 Perhaps I'm revealing my ignorance, but I didn't realize how much data they were working with.

16:17.520 --> 16:28.560
 So it wasn't Einstein or Freud thinking in theories. It was a lot of data,

16:28.560 --> 16:33.840
 and you're playing with it and seeing how to make sense of it. So it isn't just coming up with

16:33.840 --> 16:38.160
 completely abstract thought experiments. It's looking at the data of astronomy.

16:38.160 --> 16:44.480
 Sure, and you look at Newton's great work, the Principia. It was based in part on Galileo's

16:44.480 --> 16:50.240
 observations of balls rolling down inclined planes, supposedly falling off the Leaning

16:50.240 --> 16:57.680
 Tower of Pisa, but that's probably apocryphal. In any case, the Inquisition actually did,

16:58.320 --> 17:03.840
 or the Roman Catholic Church, did history a favor, not that I'm condoning them,

17:03.840 --> 17:09.680
 but they placed Galileo under house arrest, and that gave Galileo time to publish,

17:09.680 --> 17:15.360
 to assemble and publish the results of his experiments that he had done decades earlier.

17:15.360 --> 17:21.120
 It's not clear he would have had time to do that, had he not been under house arrest.

17:21.120 --> 17:26.160
 And so Newton, of course, very much used Galileo's observations.

17:27.280 --> 17:32.800
 Let me ask the old Russian overly philosophical question about death.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.160
 So we're talking about the expanding universe.

17:36.160 --> 17:40.000
 Sure. How do you think human civilization will come to an end?

17:40.000 --> 17:43.120
 If we avoid the near term issues we're having,

17:45.120 --> 17:48.000
 will it be our sun burning out? Will it be comets?

17:48.560 --> 17:54.880
 Okay. Will it be, what is it? Do you think we have a shot at reaching the

17:56.480 --> 17:57.840
 heat death of the universe?

17:57.840 --> 18:07.120
 Yes. So we're going to leave out the anthropogenic causes of our potential destruction,

18:07.120 --> 18:13.520
 which I actually think are greater than the celestial causes.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.160
 So if we get lucky and intelligent, I don't know.

18:18.160 --> 18:23.200
 Yes. So no way will we as humans reach the heat death of the universe.

18:23.200 --> 18:29.760
 I mean, it's conceivable that machines, which I think will be our evolutionary descendants,

18:29.760 --> 18:34.480
 might reach that, although even they will have less and less energy with which to work

18:34.480 --> 18:40.000
 as time progresses, because eventually even the lowest mass stars burn out,

18:40.000 --> 18:42.400
 although it takes them trillions of years to do so.

18:43.760 --> 18:50.400
 So the point is, is that certainly on Earth, there are other celestial threats,

18:50.400 --> 18:56.160
 existential threats, comets, exploding stars, the sun burning out.

18:56.720 --> 19:02.160
 So we will definitely need to move away from our solar system to other solar systems.

19:02.160 --> 19:10.160
 And then the question is, can they keep on propagating to other planetary systems sufficiently long?

19:10.160 --> 19:19.120
 In our own solar system, the sun burning out is not the immediate existential threat.

19:20.400 --> 19:24.240
 That'll happen in about five billion years when it becomes a red giant.

19:24.240 --> 19:28.880
 Although I should hasten to add that within the next one or two billion years,

19:28.880 --> 19:36.240
 the sun will have brightened enough that unless there are compensatory atmospheric changes,

19:36.240 --> 19:41.520
 the oceans will evaporate away. And you need much less carbon dioxide

19:41.520 --> 19:45.440
 for the temperatures to be maintained roughly at their present temperature,

19:45.440 --> 19:50.480
 and plants wouldn't like that very much. So you can't lower the carbon dioxide content too much.

19:50.480 --> 19:55.440
 So within one or two billion years, probably the oceans will evaporate away.

19:56.000 --> 20:03.200
 But on a sooner time scale than that, I would say an asteroid collision leading to a potential mass

20:03.200 --> 20:08.000
 extinction, or at least an extinction of complex beings, such as ourselves,

20:08.000 --> 20:13.920
 that require quite special conditions, unlike cockroaches and amoebas to survive.

20:16.080 --> 20:23.200
 One of these civilization changing asteroids is only one kilometer or so in diameter and bigger.

20:23.840 --> 20:28.000
 And a true mass extinction event is 10 kilometers or larger.

20:28.000 --> 20:34.240
 Now, it's true that we can find and track the orbits of asteroids that might be headed

20:34.240 --> 20:39.440
 toward Earth. And if we find them 50 or 100 years before they impact us, then clever,

20:39.440 --> 20:42.640
 applied physicists and engineers can figure out ways to deflect them.

20:43.200 --> 20:48.320
 But at some point, some comet will come in from the deep freeze of the solar system.

20:48.320 --> 20:52.160
 And there we have very little warning, months to a year.

20:52.160 --> 20:58.960
 Oh, the deep freeze is sort of out beyond Neptune. There's this thing called the Kuiper Belt,

20:58.960 --> 21:06.560
 and it consists of a bunch of dirty ice balls or icy dirt balls. It's the source of the comets

21:06.560 --> 21:11.920
 that occasionally come close to the sun. And then there's an even bigger area called the

21:11.920 --> 21:16.400
 scattered disk, which is sort of a big doughnut surrounding the solar system way out there

21:16.400 --> 21:23.360
 from which other comets come. And then there's the Oort cloud, WRT after Jan Oort,

21:23.360 --> 21:28.880
 a Dutch astrophysicist. And it's the better part of a light year away from the sun,

21:28.880 --> 21:34.000
 so a good fraction of the distance to the nearest star. But that's like a trillion or 10 trillion

21:35.360 --> 21:39.840
 comet like objects that occasionally get disturbed by a passing star or whatever,

21:39.840 --> 21:43.760
 and most of them go flying out of the solar system. But some go toward the sun,

21:43.760 --> 21:52.240
 and they come in with little warning. By the time we can see them, they're only a year or two away

21:52.240 --> 21:58.480
 from us. And moreover, not only is it hard to determine their trajectories sufficiently

21:58.480 --> 22:04.320
 accurately to know whether they'll hit a tiny thing like Earth, but outgassing from the comet

22:04.800 --> 22:12.800
 of gases when the ices sublimate, that outgassing can change the trajectory just because of

22:12.800 --> 22:17.200
 conservation of momentum, right? It's the rocket effect. Gases go out in one direction,

22:17.200 --> 22:21.600
 the object moves in the other direction. And so since we can't predict how much

22:21.600 --> 22:26.400
 outgassing there will be and in exactly what direction, because these things are tumbling

22:26.400 --> 22:32.080
 and rotating and stuff, it's hard to predict the trajectory with sufficient accuracy to know

22:32.080 --> 22:38.160
 that it will hit. And you certainly don't want to deflect a comet that would have missed,

22:38.160 --> 22:43.040
 but you thought it was going to hit and end up having it hit. That would be like the ultimate

22:43.040 --> 22:48.160
 Charlie Brown goat instead of trying to be the hero, right? He ended up being the goat.

22:49.200 --> 22:56.720
 What would you do if it seemed like in a matter of months that there is some

22:57.520 --> 23:01.520
 nonzero probability, maybe a high probability that there would be a collision?

23:02.160 --> 23:05.680
 So from a scientific perspective, from an engineering perspective,

23:05.680 --> 23:12.400
 I imagine you would actually be in the room of people deciding what to do, philosophically too.

23:12.400 --> 23:17.520
 It's a tough one, right? Because if you only have a few months, that's not much time in which to

23:17.520 --> 23:27.120
 deflect it. Early detection and early action are key. Because when it's far away, you only have

23:27.120 --> 23:33.760
 to deflect it by a tiny little angle. And then by a time it reaches us, the perpendicular motion is

23:33.760 --> 23:41.760
 big enough to miss Earth. All you need is one radius or one diameter of the Earth. That actually

23:41.760 --> 23:48.720
 means that all you would need to do is slow it down so it arrives four minutes later or speed it

23:48.720 --> 23:56.160
 up so it arrives four minutes earlier and Earth will have moved through one radius in that time.

23:56.160 --> 24:01.360
 So it doesn't take much. But you can imagine if a thing is about to hit you, you have to deflect

24:01.360 --> 24:06.640
 it 90 degrees or more, right? And you don't have much time to do so. And you have to slow it down

24:06.640 --> 24:12.160
 or speed it up a lot if that's what you're trying to do to it. And so decades is sufficient time,

24:12.160 --> 24:18.880
 but months is not sufficient time. So at that point, I would think the name of the game would be

24:18.880 --> 24:26.960
 to try to predict where it would hit. And if it's in a heavily populated region, try to

24:26.960 --> 24:35.840
 try to start an orderly evacuation, perhaps. But you know, that might cause just so much panic

24:35.840 --> 24:41.200
 that I'm, how would you do with New York City or Los Angeles or something like that, right?

24:41.200 --> 24:47.840
 I might have, I might have a different opinion a year ago. I'm a bit disheartened by, you know,

24:47.840 --> 24:52.800
 in the movies, there's always extreme competence from the government.

24:52.800 --> 24:59.600
 Competence, yeah. Right. But we expect extreme incompetence, if anything, right?

24:59.600 --> 25:04.320
 Yes, no. So I'm quite disappointed. But sort of from a medical perspective, I think

25:04.880 --> 25:09.760
 you're saying there, and a scientific one, it's almost better to get better and better,

25:10.800 --> 25:15.920
 maybe telescopes and data collection to be able to predict the movement of these things or like

25:15.920 --> 25:20.320
 come up with totally new technologies. Like you can imagine actually sending out

25:20.320 --> 25:26.880
 like probes out there to be able to sort of almost have little finger sensors throughout

25:26.880 --> 25:31.840
 our solar system to be able to detect stuff. Well, that's right. Yeah, monitoring the asteroid

25:31.840 --> 25:38.320
 belt is very important. A 99% of the so called near earth objects ultimately come from the

25:38.320 --> 25:42.400
 asteroid belt. And so there we can track the trajectories. And even if there's, you know,

25:42.400 --> 25:46.960
 a close encounter between two asteroids, which deflects one of them toward earth,

25:46.960 --> 25:51.760
 it's unlikely to be on a collision course with earth in the immediate future. It's more like,

25:51.760 --> 25:58.560
 you know, tens of years. So that gives us time. But we would need to improve our ability to detect

25:58.560 --> 26:04.320
 the objects that come in from a great distance. And fortunately, those are much rare that the

26:04.320 --> 26:11.920
 comets come in, you know, 1% of the collisions perhaps are with comets that come in without any

26:11.920 --> 26:20.080
 warning hardly. And so, so that might be more like, you know, a billion or two billion years

26:20.080 --> 26:27.280
 before one of those hits us. So maybe we have to worry about the sun getting brighter on that

26:27.280 --> 26:34.560
 time scale. I mean, there's the possibility that a star will explode near us in the next couple

26:34.560 --> 26:43.040
 of billion years. But over the course of the history of life on earth, the estimates are that

26:44.640 --> 26:53.040
 maybe only one of the mass extinctions was caused by a star blowing up in particular,

26:53.840 --> 26:58.560
 a special kind called a gamma ray burst. And I think it's the Ordovician,

26:58.560 --> 27:06.080
 Sulerian, Sulurian, Ordovician, Sulurian extinction 420 or so 440 million years ago,

27:06.080 --> 27:10.960
 that is speculated to have come from one of these particular types of exploding stars called gamma

27:10.960 --> 27:18.000
 ray bursts. But even there, the evidence is circumstantial. So those kinds of existential

27:18.000 --> 27:27.040
 threats are reasonably rare. The greater danger I think is civilization changing events where

27:27.040 --> 27:34.080
 it's a much smaller asteroid, which those are harder to detect, or or a giant solar flare

27:34.960 --> 27:42.720
 that shorts out the grid in all of North America, let's say now, you know, astronomers are monitoring

27:42.720 --> 27:49.200
 the sun 24 seven with various satellites. And we can tell when there's a flare or a coronal mass

27:49.200 --> 27:55.840
 ejection. And we can tell that in a day or two, a giant bundle of energetic particles will arrive

27:55.840 --> 27:59.760
 and twang the magnetic field of Earth and send all kinds of currents through

27:59.760 --> 28:05.840
 long distance power lines. And that's what shorts out the transformers. And transformers are,

28:05.840 --> 28:10.800
 you know, expensive, and hard to replace and hard to transport and all that kind of stuff. So

28:12.400 --> 28:17.280
 if we can warn the power companies, and they can shut down the grid before the big

28:18.240 --> 28:22.640
 bundle of particle hits, then we will have mitigated much of this now for a big enough

28:22.640 --> 28:28.160
 bundle of particles, you can get short circuits, even over small distance scales. So

28:28.800 --> 28:34.480
 not everything will be saved. But at least the whole grid might not go out. So again, you know,

28:34.480 --> 28:41.280
 astronomers, I like to say, support your local astronomer, they may help someday save humanity

28:41.280 --> 28:47.520
 by telling the power companies to shut down the grid, finding the asteroid 50 or 100 years before

28:47.520 --> 28:55.040
 it hits, then having clever physicists and engineers deflect it. So many of these cosmic

28:55.040 --> 29:01.680
 threats, cosmic existential threats, we can actually predict and do something about or

29:01.680 --> 29:08.800
 observe before they hit and do something about. So it's terrifying to think that people would listen

29:09.520 --> 29:13.280
 to this conversation. It's like when you listen to Bill Gates talk about pandemics

29:13.280 --> 29:19.120
 in his TED talk a few years ago, and realizing we should have supported our local astronomer more.

29:20.000 --> 29:25.200
 Well, I don't know whether it's more, because as I said, I actually think human induced threats

29:25.200 --> 29:29.600
 or things that occur naturally on Earth, either a natural pandemic, or perhaps a

29:29.600 --> 29:36.720
 bioengineering type pandemic, or something like a super volcano, right? There was one event,

29:36.720 --> 29:45.520
 Tobai, I think it was 70 plus thousand years ago, that caused a gigantic decrease in temperatures

29:45.520 --> 29:51.840
 on Earth because it sent up so much soot that it blocked the sun, right? It's the nuclear

29:51.840 --> 29:56.400
 winter type disaster scenario that some people, including Carl Sagan, talked about decades ago.

29:57.120 --> 30:02.160
 But we can see in the history of volcanic eruptions, even more recently in the 19th century,

30:02.160 --> 30:08.880
 Tambora and other ones, you look at the record and you see rather large dips in temperature

30:08.880 --> 30:14.240
 associated with massive volcanic eruptions. Well, these supervolcanoes, one of which,

30:14.240 --> 30:21.040
 by the way, exists under Yellowstone in the central US. I mean, it's not just one or two

30:21.040 --> 30:27.200
 states. It's a gigantic region, and there's controversy as to whether it's likely to

30:27.200 --> 30:33.360
 blow any time in the next 100,000 years or so. But that would be perhaps not a mass extinction

30:33.360 --> 30:38.000
 because you really need to, or perhaps not a complete existential threat because you have to

30:38.000 --> 30:45.840
 get rid of the very last humans for that. But at least getting rid of killing off so many humans,

30:45.840 --> 30:53.120
 truly billions and billions of humans. There have been ones tens of thousands of years ago,

30:53.120 --> 30:59.840
 including this one Tobai, I think it's called, where it's estimated that the human population

30:59.840 --> 31:06.960
 was down to 10,000 or 5,000 individuals, something like that. If you have a 15 degree drop in

31:06.960 --> 31:13.600
 temperature over quite a short time, it's not clear that even with today's advanced technology,

31:13.600 --> 31:17.920
 we would be able to adequately respond, at least for the vast majority of people.

31:17.920 --> 31:21.920
 Maybe some would be in these underground caves where you'd keep the president and a bunch of

31:21.920 --> 31:28.960
 other important people, but the typical person is not going to be protected when all of agriculture

31:29.600 --> 31:36.720
 is cut off. It could be hundreds of millions or billions of people starving to death.

31:36.720 --> 31:41.680
 Exactly. That's right. They don't all die immediately, but they use up their supplies,

31:42.640 --> 31:45.360
 or again, this electrical grid. First of toilet paper.

31:45.360 --> 31:50.320
 There you go. Dash that toilet paper. Or the electrical grid. I mean,

31:50.320 --> 31:57.120
 imagine North America without power for a year. We've become so dependent. We're no longer the

31:57.120 --> 32:02.480
 cave people. They would do just fine. What do they care about the electrical grid? What do

32:02.480 --> 32:08.960
 they care about agriculture? They're hunters and gatherers, but we now have become so used to our

32:08.960 --> 32:14.880
 way of life that the only real survivors would be those rugged individualists who live somewhere

32:14.880 --> 32:20.400
 out in the forest or in a cave somewhere completely independent of anyone else.

32:20.400 --> 32:25.680
 Recently, I recommend it. It's totally new to me, this kind of survivalist folks,

32:25.680 --> 32:32.160
 but there's a lot of shows of those, but I saw one on Netflix and I started watching them.

32:34.320 --> 32:41.840
 They make a lot of sense. They reveal to you how dependent we are on all aspects of this

32:41.840 --> 32:46.080
 beautiful systems we human have built and how fragile they are.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.960
 Incredibly fragile. Yeah.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.960
 This whole conversation is making me realize how lucky we are.

32:52.960 --> 32:58.640
 Oh, we're incredibly lucky, but we've set ourselves up to be very, very fragile. And

32:59.200 --> 33:05.760
 we are intrinsically complex biological creatures that, except for the fact that we have brains

33:05.760 --> 33:10.800
 and minds with which we can try to prevent some of these things or respond to them,

33:10.800 --> 33:18.320
 we, as a living organism, require quite a narrow set of conditions in order to survive.

33:18.320 --> 33:21.920
 You know, we're not cockroaches. We're not going to survive a nuclear war.

33:22.960 --> 33:30.560
 So we're kind of this beautiful dance between, we've been talking about astronomy, that astronomy,

33:31.200 --> 33:37.360
 the stars, like, inspires everybody. And at the same time, there's this pragmatic

33:37.360 --> 33:43.840
 aspect that we're talking about. And so I see space exploration as the same kind of way that it's

33:43.840 --> 33:48.480
 reaching out to other planets, reaching out to the stars, this really beautiful idea.

33:48.480 --> 33:56.560
 But if you listen to somebody like Elon Musk, he talks about space exploration as very pragmatic.

33:56.560 --> 34:03.360
 Like we have to, if we, we have to be, he has this ridiculous way of sounding like an engineer

34:03.360 --> 34:08.960
 about it, which is like, it's obvious we need to become a multiplanetary species if we were to

34:08.960 --> 34:17.200
 survive long term. So maybe both philosophically, in terms of beauty, and in terms of practical,

34:17.200 --> 34:23.600
 what's your thoughts on space exploration, on the challenges of it, on how much we should

34:23.600 --> 34:29.040
 be investing in it. And on a personal level, like how excited you are by the possibility of

34:29.040 --> 34:34.320
 going to Mars, colonizing Mars, and maybe going outside the solar system.

34:34.320 --> 34:39.120
 Yeah. You know, great question. There's a lot to unpack there, of course.

34:39.120 --> 34:39.760
 Sorry, sorry.

34:39.760 --> 34:45.520
 You know, humans are by their very nature, explorers, pioneers. They want to go out,

34:45.520 --> 34:52.400
 climb the next mountain, see what's behind it, explore the option depths, explore space. This

34:52.400 --> 34:58.240
 is our destiny to go out there. And, and of course, from a pragmatic perspective, yes,

34:58.240 --> 35:05.280
 we need to plant our seeds elsewhere, really, because things could go wrong here on Earth.

35:05.280 --> 35:11.600
 Now, some people say that's, that's an excuse to not take care of our planet that, well, we say

35:11.600 --> 35:15.600
 we're elsewhere, and so we don't have to take good care of our planet. No, you know, we should take

35:15.600 --> 35:21.040
 the best possible care of our planet. We should be cognizant of the potential impact of what we're

35:21.040 --> 35:28.480
 doing. Nevertheless, it's prudent to have us be elsewhere as well. So in that regard, I actually

35:28.480 --> 35:34.960
 agree with Elon. It'd be good to be on Mars. That would be yet another place for us to,

35:34.960 --> 35:38.000
 from which to, you know, explore a little further.

35:38.000 --> 35:39.360
 Would that be a good next step?

35:39.360 --> 35:42.080
 Well, that's the good, it's a good next step. I have to happen,

35:42.080 --> 35:47.040
 I happen to disagree with him as to how quickly it will happen, right? I mean, I think he's

35:47.040 --> 35:52.640
 very optimistic. Now, you need visionary people like Elon to get people going and to inspire them.

35:52.640 --> 35:59.440
 I mean, look at the success he's had with multiple companies. So maybe he gives this very optimistic

35:59.440 --> 36:04.960
 timeline in order to be inspirational to those who are, who are going out there and certainly

36:04.960 --> 36:10.320
 his success with, you know, the rocket that is reusable because it landed upright and all that.

36:10.320 --> 36:15.360
 I mean, you know, that's a game changer. It's sort of like every time you flew from San Francisco

36:15.360 --> 36:20.880
 to Los Angeles, you discard the airplane, right? I mean, that's crazy, right? So that's a game

36:20.880 --> 36:27.040
 changer. But nevertheless, the time scale over which he thinks that there could be a real thriving

36:27.040 --> 36:30.400
 colony on Mars, I think, is far too optimistic.

36:30.400 --> 36:36.880
 What's the biggest challenges to you? One is just getting rockets, not rockets, but people out there,

36:36.880 --> 36:44.400
 and two is the colonization. Do you have thoughts about this, the challenges of this kind of prospect?

36:44.400 --> 36:50.160
 Yeah, I haven't thought about it in great detail other than recognizing that Mars is a

36:50.160 --> 36:54.400
 harsh environment. You don't have much of an atmosphere there. You've got less than a percent

36:54.400 --> 37:00.640
 of Earth's atmosphere. So you'd need to build some sort of a dome right away, right? And that

37:00.640 --> 37:08.160
 would take time. You need to melt the water that's in the permafrost or have canals dug from which

37:08.160 --> 37:14.720
 you transport it from the polar ice caps. You know, I was reading recently in terms of what's

37:14.720 --> 37:21.120
 the most efficient source of nutrition for humans that were to live on Mars, and people should look

37:21.120 --> 37:28.560
 into this, but it turns out to be insects. Insects. Yeah. So you want to build giant colonies of insects

37:28.560 --> 37:32.160
 and just be eating them. Insects have a lot of protein, right? Yeah, a lot of protein. And they're

37:32.160 --> 37:39.600
 easy to grow. You can think of them as farming. Right. But it's not going to be as easy as growing

37:39.600 --> 37:44.480
 a whole plot of potatoes like in the movie The Martian or something, right? It's not going to

37:44.480 --> 37:49.840
 be that easy. So there's this thin atmosphere. It's got the wrong composition. It's mostly

37:49.840 --> 37:56.480
 carbon dioxide. There are these violent dust storms. The temperatures are generally cold.

37:56.480 --> 38:00.880
 You know, you'd need to do a lot of things. You need to terraform it basically in order to make it

38:00.880 --> 38:07.920
 nicely livable without some dome surrounding you. And if you insist on a dome, well, that's not going

38:07.920 --> 38:16.240
 to house that many people, right? So let's look briefly then. We're looking for a new apartment

38:16.240 --> 38:22.720
 to move into. So let's look outside the solar system. Do you think you've spoken about exoplanets as

38:22.720 --> 38:29.600
 well? Do you think there's possible homes out there for us outside of our solar system?

38:29.600 --> 38:36.640
 There are lots and lots of homes, possible homes. I mean, there's a planetary system around nearly

38:36.640 --> 38:43.440
 every star you see in the sky. And one in five of those is thought to have a roughly Earth like

38:43.440 --> 38:48.960
 planet. And that's a relatively new discovery. I mean, that's the Kepler satellite, which was

38:48.960 --> 38:54.160
 flying around above Earth's atmosphere, was able to monitor the brightness of stars with

38:54.160 --> 39:01.440
 exquisite detail. And they could detect planets crossing the line of sight between us and the

39:01.440 --> 39:08.160
 star, thereby dimming its light for a short time, ever so slightly. And it's amazing. So there are

39:08.160 --> 39:14.000
 now thousands and thousands of these exoplanet candidates of which something like 90% are

39:14.000 --> 39:21.520
 probably genuine exoplanets. And you have to remember that only about 1% of stars have their

39:21.520 --> 39:28.480
 planetary system oriented edge on to your line of sight, which is what you need for this transit

39:28.480 --> 39:34.480
 method to work, right? Some arbitrary angle won't work and certainly perpendicular to your line of

39:34.480 --> 39:40.080
 sight. That is in the plane of the sky won't work because the planet is orbiting the star and never

39:40.080 --> 39:49.040
 crossing your line of sight. So the fact that they found planets orbiting about 1% of the stars

39:49.040 --> 39:56.080
 that they looked at in this field of 150 plus thousand stars, they found planets around 1%.

39:56.080 --> 40:05.760
 You then multiply by the inverse of 1%, which is, right, 1% is about the fraction of the stars that

40:05.760 --> 40:11.440
 have their planetary system oriented the right way. And that already back of the end of all

40:11.440 --> 40:18.240
 calculation tells you that of order, 50 to 100% of all stars have planets. And then they've been

40:18.240 --> 40:23.200
 finding these Earth like planets, et cetera, et cetera. So there are many potential homes. The

40:23.200 --> 40:30.800
 problem is getting there. So then a typical bright star, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky,

40:30.800 --> 40:40.240
 maybe not a typical bright star, but it's 8.7 light years away. So that means the light took

40:40.240 --> 40:48.560
 8.7 years to reach us. We're seeing it as it was about nine years ago. So then you ask,

40:48.560 --> 40:55.360
 how long would a rocket take to get there at Earth's escape speed, which is 11 kilometers per

40:55.360 --> 41:02.880
 second? And it turns out it's about a quarter of a million years. Now, that's 10,000 generations.

41:02.880 --> 41:09.200
 Let's say a generation of humans is 25 years, right? So you'd need this colony of people

41:10.080 --> 41:15.840
 that is able to sustain itself, all their food, all their waste disposal, all their water,

41:15.840 --> 41:21.360
 all their recycling of everything. For 10,000 generations, they have to commit themselves

41:21.360 --> 41:30.240
 to living on this vehicle, right? I just don't see it happening. What I see potentially happening,

41:30.240 --> 41:36.480
 if we avoid self destruction, intentional or unintentional here on Earth, is that machines

41:36.480 --> 41:42.240
 will do it. Robots that can essentially hibernate. They don't need to do much of anything for a

41:42.240 --> 41:46.800
 long, long time as they're traveling. And moreover, if some energetic charged particles,

41:46.800 --> 41:52.240
 some cosmic ray hits the circuitry, it fixes itself, right? Machines can do this.

41:54.800 --> 41:59.840
 I mean, it's a form of artificial intelligence. You just tell the thing, fix yourself, basically.

41:59.840 --> 42:05.600
 And then when you land on the planet, start producing copies of yourself. Initially,

42:05.600 --> 42:09.360
 for materials that were perhaps sent, or you just have a bunch of copies there,

42:10.000 --> 42:14.000
 and then they set up, you know, factories with which to do this. I mean, this is very,

42:14.000 --> 42:22.560
 very futuristic. But it's much more feasible, I think, than sending flesh and blood over

42:22.560 --> 42:29.360
 interstellar distances, a quarter of a million years to even the nearest stars. You're subject to

42:29.360 --> 42:34.320
 all kinds of charged particles and radiation. You have to shield yourself really well. That's,

42:34.320 --> 42:38.960
 by the way, one of the problems of going to Mars is that it's not a three day journey like going

42:38.960 --> 42:44.320
 to the moon. You're out there for the better part of a year or two, and you're exposed to

42:44.880 --> 42:52.160
 lots of radiation, which typically doesn't do well with living tissue, right? Or living tissue

42:52.160 --> 42:58.880
 doesn't do well with the radiation. And the hope is that the robots, the AI systems might be able

42:58.880 --> 43:09.200
 to carry the fire of consciousness, whatever makes us humans, like a little drop of whatever

43:09.200 --> 43:14.320
 makes us humans so special, not to be too poetic about it. But no, but I like being poetic about

43:14.320 --> 43:20.880
 it because it's an amazing question. Is there something beyond just the bits, the ones and

43:20.880 --> 43:27.200
 zeros to us? It's an interesting question. I like to think that there isn't anything,

43:27.200 --> 43:31.520
 and that how beautiful it is that our thoughts, our emotions, our feelings, our compassion

43:32.640 --> 43:38.480
 all come from these ones and zeros, right? That to me actually is a beautiful thought,

43:38.480 --> 43:45.360
 and the idea that machines, silicon based life effectively, could be our natural evolutionary

43:45.360 --> 43:51.760
 descendants, not from a DNA perspective, but they are our creations and they then carry on.

43:51.760 --> 43:56.240
 That to me is a beautiful thought in some ways, but others find it to be a horrific

43:56.240 --> 44:02.880
 thought. So that's exciting to you. It is exciting to me as well, because to me from a purely an

44:02.880 --> 44:11.040
 engineering perspective, I believe it's impossible to create whatever systems we create that take

44:11.040 --> 44:17.520
 over the world. It's impossible for me to imagine that those systems will not carry some aspect

44:17.520 --> 44:23.520
 of what makes humans beautiful. So a lot of people have these kind of paperclip ideas that

44:23.520 --> 44:28.800
 that will bring will build machines that are cold inside or philosophers call them zombies.

44:30.960 --> 44:38.160
 That naturally the systems that will outcompete us on this earth will be cold and

44:39.200 --> 44:46.960
 non conscious, not capable of all the human emotions and empathy and compassion and love

44:46.960 --> 44:55.760
 and hate. The beautiful mix of what makes us human. But to me, intelligence requires all of that.

44:56.320 --> 45:01.360
 So in order to outcompete humans, you better be good at the full picture.

45:01.920 --> 45:08.400
 Right. So artificial general intelligence in my view encompasses a lot of these attributes that

45:08.400 --> 45:13.360
 you just talked about. Curiosity, inquisitiveness, you know, right?

45:13.360 --> 45:16.960
 It might look very different than us humans, but it will have some of the magic.

45:16.960 --> 45:24.560
 But it'll also be much more able to survive the onslaught of existential threats that either

45:24.560 --> 45:30.000
 we bring upon ourselves or don't anticipate here on earth, or that occasionally come from

45:30.000 --> 45:33.600
 beyond. And there's nothing much we can do about a supernova explosion that just suddenly

45:34.240 --> 45:39.760
 goes off. And really, if we want to move to other planets outside our solar system,

45:39.760 --> 45:47.200
 I think realistically, that's a much better option than thinking that humans will actually make these

45:47.200 --> 45:53.520
 gigantic journeys. And then I do this calculation for my class. Einstein's special theory of

45:53.520 --> 45:58.080
 relativity says that you can do it in a short amount of time in your own frame of reference

45:58.080 --> 46:03.280
 if you go close to the speed of light. But then you bring in E equals MC squared and you figure

46:03.280 --> 46:10.000
 out how much energy it takes to get you accelerated to close enough to the speed of light to make the

46:10.000 --> 46:16.720
 time scale short in your own frame of reference. And the amount of energy is just unfathomable,

46:16.720 --> 46:22.240
 right? We can do it at the Large Hadron Collider with protons. You know, we can accelerate them

46:22.240 --> 46:28.880
 to 99.999% of the speed of light. But that's just a proton. We're gazillions of protons,

46:28.880 --> 46:34.960
 okay? And that doesn't even count the rocket that would carry us, the payload. And you would need

46:34.960 --> 46:41.280
 to either store the fuel in the rocket, which then requires even more mass for the rocket,

46:41.280 --> 46:46.960
 or collect fuel along the way, which, you know, is difficult. And so getting close to the speed

46:46.960 --> 46:52.000
 of light, I think, is not an option either, other than for a little tiny thing like, you know,

46:52.000 --> 46:56.640
 Yuri Milner and others are thinking about this, this star shot project where they'll

46:56.640 --> 47:02.160
 send a little tiny camera to Alpha Centauri 4.2 light years away. They'll zip past it,

47:02.160 --> 47:07.600
 take a picture of the exoplanets that we know orbit that three or more star system and

47:08.320 --> 47:13.680
 say hello real, say hello real quickly and then send the images back to us. Okay. So that's a tiny

47:13.680 --> 47:19.440
 little thing, right? Maybe you can accelerate that to they're hoping 20% of the speed of light

47:19.440 --> 47:24.000
 with a whole bunch of high powered lasers aimed at it. It's not clear that other countries will

47:24.000 --> 47:28.160
 allow us to do that, by the way. But that's a very forward looking thought. I mean, I very much

47:28.160 --> 47:33.760
 support the idea. But there's a big difference between sending a little tiny camera and sending a

47:33.760 --> 47:42.880
 payload of people with equipment that could then mine the resources on the exoplanet that they

47:42.880 --> 47:49.360
 reach and then go forth and multiply, right? Well, let's talk about the big galactic things

47:49.360 --> 47:54.720
 and how we might be able to leverage them to travel fast. I know this is a little bit science fiction,

47:54.720 --> 48:06.160
 but you know, ideas of wormholes and ideas at the edge of black holes that reveal to us that

48:06.160 --> 48:15.840
 this fabric of space time is could be messed with. Yeah, perhaps is that at all an interesting thing

48:15.840 --> 48:23.840
 for you? I mean, in looking out at the universe and studying it as you have, is that also a

48:23.840 --> 48:30.000
 possible dream for you that we might be able to find clues how we can actually use it to improve

48:30.000 --> 48:37.360
 our transportation? It's an interesting thought. I'm certainly excited by the potential physics that

48:37.360 --> 48:44.240
 suggest this kind of faster than light travel effectively or cutting the distance to make

48:44.240 --> 48:49.440
 it very, very short through a wormhole or something like that. Possible? No. Well, you know, call me

48:49.440 --> 48:55.120
 not very imaginative, but based on today's knowledge of physics, which I realize, you know,

48:55.120 --> 48:59.840
 people have gone down that rabbit hole and, you know, a century ago, Lord Kelvin, one of the

48:59.840 --> 49:05.440
 greatest physicists of all time, said that all of fundamental physics is done, the rest is just

49:05.440 --> 49:10.880
 engineering. And guess what? Then came special relativity, quantum physics, general relativity,

49:10.880 --> 49:16.640
 how wrong he was. So let me not be another Lord Kelvin. On the other hand, I think we

49:16.640 --> 49:22.240
 know a lot more now about what we know and what we don't know and what the physical limitations are.

49:23.040 --> 49:29.360
 And to me, most of these schemes, if not all of them, seem very farfetched, if not impossible.

49:30.080 --> 49:34.640
 So travel through wormholes, for example, you know, it appears that

49:34.640 --> 49:41.280
 for a nonrotating black hole, that's just a complete no go because the singularity is a

49:41.280 --> 49:47.440
 point like singularity, and you have to reach it to traverse the wormhole and you get squished

49:47.440 --> 49:53.360
 by the singularity. Okay. Now, for a rotating black hole, it turns out there is a way to pass

49:53.360 --> 49:59.120
 through the event horizon, the boundary of the black hole, and avoid the singularity and go out

49:59.120 --> 50:04.960
 the other side or even traverse the donut hole like singularity. In the case of a rotating

50:04.960 --> 50:09.840
 black hole, it's a ring singularity. So there's actually two theoretical ways you could get through

50:09.840 --> 50:15.360
 a rotating black hole or a charged black hole, not that we expect charged black holes to exist

50:15.360 --> 50:20.800
 in nature because they would quickly bring in the opposite charge so as to neutralize themselves.

50:20.800 --> 50:24.960
 But rotating black holes, definitely a reality. We now have good evidence for them.

50:24.960 --> 50:31.360
 Do they have traversable wormholes? Probably not because it's still the case that

50:32.000 --> 50:38.800
 when you go in, you go in with so much energy that it either squeezes the wormhole shut

50:39.360 --> 50:46.320
 or you encounter a whole bunch of incoming and outgoing energy that vaporizes you. It's called

50:46.320 --> 50:51.440
 the mass inflation instability, and it just sort of vaporizes you. Nevertheless, you know,

50:51.440 --> 50:55.280
 you could imagine, well, you're in some vapor form, but if you make it through, maybe you could

50:56.240 --> 51:00.880
 reform or something. So it's still information. Yeah, it's still information. It's scrambled

51:00.880 --> 51:06.720
 information, but there's a way maybe of bringing it back, right? But then the thing that really

51:06.720 --> 51:13.760
 bothers me is that as soon as you have this possibility of traversal of a wormhole, you

51:13.760 --> 51:19.440
 have to come to grips with a fundamental problem, and that is that you could come back to your

51:19.440 --> 51:26.080
 universe at a time prior to your leaving, and you could essentially prevent your grandparents

51:26.080 --> 51:30.560
 from ever meeting. This is called the grandfather paradox, right? And if they never met, and if

51:30.560 --> 51:36.000
 your parents were never born, and if you were never born, how would you have made the journey

51:37.040 --> 51:46.720
 to prevent the history from allowing you to exist, right? It's a violation of causality,

51:46.720 --> 51:52.800
 of cause and effect. Now, physicists such as myself take causality violation very,

51:52.800 --> 51:57.280
 very seriously. We've never seen it. You took a stand. Yeah, I mean, you know,

51:57.920 --> 52:02.560
 I mean, it's one of these, right, back to the future type movies, right? And you have to work

52:02.560 --> 52:07.520
 things out in such a way that you don't mess things up, right? Some people say that, well,

52:07.520 --> 52:13.600
 you come back to the universe, but you come back in such a way that you cannot affect your journey.

52:13.600 --> 52:21.280
 But then, I mean, that seems kind of contrived to me. Or some say that you end up in a different

52:21.280 --> 52:26.880
 universe, and this also goes into the many different types of the multiverse hypothesis

52:26.880 --> 52:32.000
 and the many worlds interpretation and all that. But again, then it's not the universe from which

52:32.000 --> 52:38.080
 you left, right? And you don't come back to the universe from which you left. And so you're not

52:38.080 --> 52:44.800
 really going back in time to the same universe. And you're not even going forward in time necessarily

52:44.800 --> 52:51.360
 then to the same universe, right? You're ending up in some other universe. So you've, what have

52:51.360 --> 52:58.160
 you achieved, right? You've traveled. You've traveled. You ended up in a different place

52:58.160 --> 53:04.400
 than you started in more ways than one. Yeah. And then there's this idea, the Alcubierre Drive,

53:04.400 --> 53:11.040
 where you warp space time in front of you so as to greatly reduce the distance and you can expand

53:11.040 --> 53:16.880
 the space time behind you. So you're sort of riding a wave through space time. But the problem I see

53:16.880 --> 53:21.120
 with that beyond the practical difficulties and the energy requirements. And by the way,

53:21.120 --> 53:26.400
 how do you get out of this bubble through which you're, you know, riding this wave of space time?

53:26.400 --> 53:30.800
 And Miguel Alcubierre acknowledged all these things. He said, this is purely theoretical,

53:30.800 --> 53:37.040
 fanciful and all that. But a fundamental problem I see is that you'd have to get to those places

53:37.040 --> 53:42.960
 in front of you so as to change the shape of space time, so as to make the journey quickly.

53:43.520 --> 53:49.760
 But to get there, you got there in the normal way at a speed considerably less than that of light.

53:50.560 --> 53:54.480
 So in a sense, you haven't saved any time, right? You might as well have just

53:55.200 --> 53:57.920
 taken that journey and gotten to where you were going.

53:57.920 --> 54:03.760
 Yeah, there's right. What have you done? It's not like you snap your fingers and say,

54:03.760 --> 54:08.640
 okay, let that space there be compressed and then I'll make it over to Alpha Centauri

54:08.640 --> 54:11.520
 in the next month. You can't snap your fingers and do that.

54:12.320 --> 54:18.240
 Yeah. And but yeah, we're sort of assuming that we can fix all the biological stuff that requires

54:18.240 --> 54:24.560
 for humans to persist through that whole process. Because ultimately, it might boil down to just

54:24.560 --> 54:29.360
 extending the life of the human in some form, whether it's through the robot, through the

54:29.360 --> 54:35.200
 digital form, or actually just figuring out genetically how to live forever. Because that

54:35.200 --> 54:41.760
 journey that you mentioned, the long journey, might be different if somehow our understanding

54:41.760 --> 54:46.000
 of genetics, of our understanding of our own biology, all that kind of stuff would,

54:46.720 --> 54:49.920
 that's another trajectory that possibly... Well, right. If you could put us into some

54:49.920 --> 54:55.040
 sort of suspended animation, hibernation or something and greatly increase the lifetime.

54:55.040 --> 54:59.680
 And so these 10,000 generations I talked about, what do they care? It's just one generation

54:59.680 --> 55:05.760
 and they're asleep. Okay. So then you can do it. It's still not easy, right? Because you've got

55:05.760 --> 55:10.160
 some big old huge colony and that just through E equals MC squared, right? That's a lot of mass.

55:10.160 --> 55:17.920
 That's a lot of stuff to accelerate. The Newtonian kinetic energy is gigantic, right?

55:17.920 --> 55:24.560
 So you're still not home free, but at least you're not trying to do it in a short amount of clock

55:24.560 --> 55:31.360
 time, right? Which if you look at E equals MC squared requires truly unfathomable amounts of

55:31.360 --> 55:39.040
 energy because the energy is sort of, it's your rest mass, M knot C squared divided by the square

55:39.040 --> 55:44.080
 root of one minus V squared over C squared. And if your listeners want to just sort of stick into

55:44.080 --> 55:50.960
 their pocket calculator as V over C approaches one, that one over the square root of one minus

55:50.960 --> 55:57.120
 V squared over C squared approaches infinity. So if you wanted to do it in zero time, you'd need an

55:57.120 --> 56:03.360
 infinite amount of energy. That's basically why you can't reach, let alone exceed the speed of light

56:03.360 --> 56:10.000
 for a particle moving through a preexisting space. It's that it takes an infinite amount of energy

56:10.000 --> 56:15.360
 to do so. So that's talking about us going somewhere. What about

56:18.080 --> 56:22.480
 one of the things that inspires a lot of folks, including myself, is the possibility that

56:22.480 --> 56:28.640
 there's other, that this, this conversation is happening on another planet in different forms

56:28.640 --> 56:40.720
 with intelligent life forms. Well, first we could start as a cosmologist. What's your intuition

56:40.720 --> 56:45.840
 about whether there is or isn't intelligent life out there outside of our own?

56:45.840 --> 56:51.680
 Yeah. I would say I'm one of the pessimists in that I don't necessarily think that we're the only

56:51.680 --> 56:59.600
 ones in the observable universe, which goes out roughly 14 billion years in light travel time

56:59.600 --> 57:04.640
 and more like 46 billion years when you take into account the expansion of space. So the

57:04.640 --> 57:10.480
 diameter of our observable universe is something like 90, 92 billion light years. That encompasses

57:11.520 --> 57:17.920
 100 billion to a trillion galaxies with 100 billion stars each. So now you're talking about

57:17.920 --> 57:23.840
 something like 10 to the 22nd, 10 to the 23rd power stars and roughly an equal number of

57:24.400 --> 57:31.920
 Earth like planets and so on. So there may well be other intelligent life.

57:31.920 --> 57:34.960
 But your sense is our galaxy is not teeming with life.

57:34.960 --> 57:40.960
 Yeah, our galaxy, our Milky Way galaxy with several hundred billion stars and potentially

57:40.960 --> 57:43.680
 habitable planets is not teeming with intelligent life.

57:43.680 --> 57:44.720
 Intelligent.

57:44.720 --> 57:48.400
 Yeah, I wouldn't, well, I'll get to the primitive life, the bacteria in a moment.

57:48.400 --> 57:56.640
 But we may well be the only ones in our Milky Way galaxy at most a handful, I'd say,

57:56.640 --> 58:02.640
 but I'd probably side with the School of Thought that suggests we're the only ones in our own

58:02.640 --> 58:12.960
 galaxy just because I don't see human intelligence as being a natural evolutionary path for life.

58:12.960 --> 58:18.480
 I mean, there's a number of arguments. First of all, there's been more than 10 billion species

58:18.480 --> 58:25.680
 of life on Earth in its history. Nothing has approached our level of intelligence and mechanical

58:25.680 --> 58:30.480
 ability and curiosity. You know, whales and dolphins appear to be reasonably intelligent,

58:30.480 --> 58:34.800
 but there's no evidence that they can think abstract thoughts that they're curious about

58:34.800 --> 58:38.320
 the world. They certainly can't build machines with which to study the world.

58:38.320 --> 58:46.880
 So that's one argument. Secondly, we came about as early hominids only four or five million years

58:46.880 --> 58:53.760
 ago and as homo sapiens only about a quarter of a million years ago. So for the vast majority

58:53.760 --> 58:58.480
 of the history of life on Earth, an intelligent alien zipping by Earth would have said there's

58:58.480 --> 59:06.320
 nothing particularly intelligent or mechanically able on Earth. Thirdly, it's not clear that our

59:06.320 --> 59:12.720
 intelligence is a long term evolutionary advantage. Now, it's clear that in the last 100 years, 200

59:12.720 --> 59:18.080
 years, we've improved the lives of millions, hundreds of millions of people, but at the risk

59:18.080 --> 59:23.280
 of potentially destroying ourselves either intentionally or unintentionally or through

59:23.280 --> 59:29.920
 neglect as we discussed before. That's a really interesting point, which is it's possible that

59:29.920 --> 59:36.480
 their huge amount of intelligent civilizations have been born even through our galaxy, but they

59:36.480 --> 59:45.360
 live very briefly. They're flash bulbs in the night. That brings me to the fourth issue,

59:45.360 --> 59:53.120
 and that is the Fermi paradox. If they're common, where the hell are they? Notwithstanding the

59:53.120 --> 59:58.720
 various UFO reports in Roswell and all that, they just don't meet the bar. They don't clear the bar

59:58.720 --> 1:00:06.240
 of scientific evidence in my opinion. There's no clear evidence that they've ever visited us on

1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:12.720
 Earth here. SETI has been now, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence has been scanning

1:00:12.720 --> 1:00:17.200
 the skies, and true, we've only looked a couple of hundred light years out. That's a tiny fraction

1:00:17.200 --> 1:00:27.040
 of the whole galaxy, a tiny fraction of these 100 billion plus stars. Nevertheless, if the galaxy

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:32.640
 were teeming with life, especially intelligent life, you'd expect some of it to have been far

1:00:32.640 --> 1:00:38.560
 more advanced than ours. There's nothing special about when the industrial revolution started

1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:43.440
 on Earth. The chemical evolution of our galaxy was such that billions of years ago,

1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:50.880
 nuclear processing and stars had built up clouds of gas after their explosion that were rich enough

1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:55.200
 in heavy elements to have formed Earth like planets, even billions of years ago. There could

1:00:55.200 --> 1:01:00.480
 be civilizations that are billions of years ahead of ours. If you look at the exponential growth of

1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:06.240
 technology among Homo sapiens in the last couple of hundred years, and you just project that forward,

1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:11.760
 I mean, there's no telling what they could have achieved even in 1,000 or 10,000 years, let alone

1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:19.040
 a million or 10 million or a billion years. If they reach this capability of interstellar travel and

1:01:19.040 --> 1:01:24.960
 colonization, then you can show that within 10 million years or certainly 100 million years,

1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:32.400
 you can populate the whole galaxy. Then you don't have to have tried to detect them beyond

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:38.000
 100 or 1,000 light years. They would already be here. Do you think as a thought experiment,

1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:45.280
 do you think it's possible that they are already here but we humans are so human centric that

1:01:45.280 --> 1:01:52.640
 we're just not like our conception of what intelligent life looks like? Yeah. We don't

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:59.680
 want to acknowledge it. What if trees? Right. I guess in a form of a question,

1:01:59.680 --> 1:02:04.320
 do you think we'll actually detect intelligent life if it came to visit us?

1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:08.880
 Yeah. I mean, it's like you're an ant crawling around on a sidewalk somewhere and do you notice

1:02:08.880 --> 1:02:14.720
 the humans wandering around and the Empire State Building and rocket ships flying to the Moon and

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:20.800
 all that kind of stuff. It's conceivable that we haven't detected it and that we're so primitive

1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:26.000
 compared to them that we're just not able to do so. Like if you look at dark energy, maybe we

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:31.520
 call it as a field. It's just that my own feeling is that in science now through observations and

1:02:31.520 --> 1:02:40.480
 experiments, we've measured so many things and basically we understand a lot of stuff. Fabric

1:02:40.480 --> 1:02:43.920
 of reality. Yeah. The fabric of reality we understand quite well and there are a few

1:02:43.920 --> 1:02:48.720
 little things like dark matter and dark energy that may be some sign of some super intelligence,

1:02:48.720 --> 1:02:54.240
 but I doubt it. Why would some super intelligence be holding clusters of galaxies together?

1:02:54.240 --> 1:02:59.680
 Why would they be responsible for accelerating the expansion of the universe? The point is that

1:02:59.680 --> 1:03:07.040
 through science and applied science and engineering, we understand so much now that I'm not saying we

1:03:07.040 --> 1:03:14.080
 know everything, but we know a hell of a lot. It's not like there are lots of mysteries flying

1:03:14.080 --> 1:03:23.840
 around there that are completely outside our level of exploration or understanding.

1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:33.440
 I would say from the mystery perspective, it seems like the mystery of our own cognition

1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:39.280
 and consciousness is much grander than the degrees of freedom of possible explanations

1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:44.320
 of what the heck is going on is much greater there than in the physics of the observatory.

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:52.320
 How the brain works. How did life arise? Yeah, big, big questions, but they to me don't indicate

1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:59.280
 the existence of an alien or something. I mean, unless we are the aliens, we could have been

1:03:59.280 --> 1:04:05.200
 contamination from some rocket ship that hit here a long, long time ago and all evidence of it has

1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:12.480
 been destroyed. But again, that alien would have started out somewhere. They're not here watching

1:04:12.480 --> 1:04:21.120
 us right now. They're not among us. And so though there are potential explanations for the Fermi

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:26.800
 Paradox and one of them that I kind of like is that the truly intelligent creatures are those

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:32.240
 that decided not to colonize the whole galaxy because they'd quickly run out of room there

1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:37.840
 because it's exponential. You send a probe to a planet. It makes two copies. They go out.

1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:43.680
 They make two copies each and it's an exponential. They quickly colonize the whole galaxy. But then

1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:48.720
 the distance to the next galaxy, the next big one like Andromeda, that's two and a half million

1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:55.360
 light years. That's a much grander scale now. And so it also could be that the reason they

1:04:55.360 --> 1:05:03.200
 survived this long is that they got over this tendency that may well exist among sufficiently

1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:10.640
 intelligent creatures, this tendency for aggression and self destruction. If they bypassed that,

1:05:10.640 --> 1:05:16.240
 and that may be one of the great filters if there are more than one, then they may not be

1:05:17.520 --> 1:05:24.080
 a type of creature that feels the need to go and say, oh, there's a nice looking planet and there's

1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:30.240
 a bunch of ants on it. Let's go squish them and colonize it. No, it could even be the kind of

1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:36.400
 Star Trek like prime directive where you go and explore worlds, but you don't interfere in any

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:43.840
 way, right? And also, we call it exploration as beautiful and everything, but there is underlying

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:50.640
 this desire to explore is a desire to conquer. I mean, if we're just being really honest about...

1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:54.400
 Right now for us, it is, right? And you're saying it's possible to separate,

1:05:54.400 --> 1:06:02.720
 but I would venture to say that you wouldn't, that those are coupled. So I could imagine

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:08.400
 a civilization that lives on for billions of years that just stays on it, like figures out the

1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:15.200
 minimal effort way of just peacefully existing. It's like a monastery. Yeah, and it limits itself.

1:06:15.200 --> 1:06:19.360
 Yeah, it limits itself. You know, it's planted its seeds in a number of places,

1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:25.760
 so it's not vulnerable to a single point failure, right? Supernova going off near one of these stars

1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:31.600
 or something or an asteroid or a comet coming in from the Oort cloud equivalent of that planetary

1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:36.960
 system and without threshing them to bits. So they've got their seeds in a bunch of places,

1:06:36.960 --> 1:06:44.480
 but they chose not to colonize the galaxy. And they also choose not to interfere with this

1:06:44.480 --> 1:06:57.040
 incredibly primitive organism, Homo sapiens, right? Or this is like a TV show for them.

1:06:57.680 --> 1:07:01.520
 Yeah, it could be like a TV show, right? So they just tuned in.

1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:08.160
 Right. So those are possible explanations yet. I think that to me, the most likely explanation

1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:13.840
 for the Parami paradox is that they really are very, very rare. And Carl Sagan estimated

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:19.760
 100,000 of them. If there's that many, some of them would have been way ahead of us, and I think

1:07:19.760 --> 1:07:25.440
 we would have seen them by now. If there are a handful, maybe they're there. But at that point,

1:07:25.440 --> 1:07:31.040
 you're right on this dividing line between being a pessimist and an optimist. And what are the odds

1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:36.960
 for that, right? If you look at all the things that had to go right for us, and then getting back

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:43.040
 to something you said earlier, let's discuss primitive life, that could be the thing that's

1:07:43.040 --> 1:07:48.480
 difficult to achieve. Just getting the random molecules together to a point where they start

1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:54.800
 self replicating and evolving and becoming better and all that. That's an inordinately

1:07:54.800 --> 1:08:01.440
 difficult thing, I think, though I'm not some molecular cell biologist. But it's the usual

1:08:01.440 --> 1:08:06.960
 argument. You're wandering around in the Sahara Desert, and you stumble across a watch. Is your

1:08:06.960 --> 1:08:12.960
 initial response, oh, you know, a bunch of sand grains just came together randomly and formed

1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:20.480
 this watch? No, you think that something formed it, or it came from some simpler structure that

1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:29.680
 then became more complex. It didn't just form. Well, even the simplest life is a very, very

1:08:29.680 --> 1:08:36.000
 complex structure. Even the simplest prokaryotic cells, not to mention eukaryotic cells, although

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:41.280
 that transition may have been this so called great filter as well. Maybe the cells without a

1:08:41.280 --> 1:08:47.440
 nucleus are relatively easy to form. And then the big next step is where you have a nucleus,

1:08:47.440 --> 1:08:52.400
 which then provides a lot of energy, which allows the cell to become much, much more complex and

1:08:52.400 --> 1:09:00.320
 so on. Interestingly, going from eukaryotic cells, single cells, to multicellular organisms

1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:05.040
 does not appear to be, at least on Earth, one of these great filters, because there's evidence

1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:11.520
 that it happened dozens of times independently on Earth. So by a really great filter, something

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:21.520
 that happens very, very rarely, I mean that we had to get through an obstacle that is just

1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:27.600
 incredibly rare to get through. And one of the really exciting scientific things is that that

1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:34.160
 particular point is something that we might be able to discover even in our lifetimes.

1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:39.440
 That find life elsewhere, like Europa or be able to do that.

1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:45.600
 That would be bad news, right? Because if we find lots of pretty advanced life,

1:09:46.400 --> 1:09:51.360
 that would suggest, and especially if we found some defunct, you know,

1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:55.920
 fossilized civilization or something somewhere else, that would be bacteria, you mean,

1:09:55.920 --> 1:09:59.840
 like defunct civilization of like primitive life.

1:09:59.840 --> 1:10:05.680
 I'm sorry, I switched gears there. If we found some intelligent or even trilobites and stuff

1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:09.920
 elsewhere, that would be bad news for us because that would mean that the great filter is ahead of

1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:17.040
 us, right? Because it would mean that lots of things have gotten roughly to our level.

1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:23.920
 But given the Fermi Paradox, if you accept that the Fermi Paradox means that there's no one else

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.640
 out there, you don't necessarily have to accept that. But if you accept that it means that no one

1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:33.600
 else is out there, and yet there are lots of things we've found that are at or roughly at our

1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:39.520
 level, that means that the great filter is ahead of us and that bodes poorly for our long term

1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:48.000
 future. Yeah, it's funny you said you started by saying you're a little bit on the pessimistic side,

1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:53.120
 but it's funny because we're doing this kind of dance between pessimism and optimism because I'm

1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:59.120
 not sure if us being alone in the observable universe as intelligent beings is pessimistic.

1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:05.040
 Well, it's good news in a sense for us because it means that we made it through.

1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:11.840
 Oh, right. See, if we're the only ones and there are such great filters, maybe more than one,

1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:18.080
 formation of life might be one of them, formation of eukaryotic that is with the nucleus cells,

1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:23.920
 be another development of human like intelligence might be another, right? There might be several

1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:29.920
 such filters and we were the lucky ones. And then people say, well, then that means you're

1:11:29.920 --> 1:11:34.400
 putting yourself into a special perspective and every time we've done that, we've been wrong.

1:11:34.400 --> 1:11:40.240
 And yeah, I know all those arguments, but it still could be the case that there's one of us,

1:11:40.240 --> 1:11:46.400
 at least per galaxy or per 10 or 100 or 1000 galaxies, and we're sitting here having this

1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:52.160
 conversation because we exist. And so there's an observational selection effect there, right?

1:11:52.880 --> 1:11:56.640
 Just because we're special doesn't mean that we shouldn't have these conversations

1:11:56.640 --> 1:12:03.200
 about whether or not we're special, right? Yeah, so that's exciting. That's optimistic.

1:12:03.200 --> 1:12:08.640
 So that's the optimistic part that if we don't find other intelligent life there,

1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:15.520
 it might mean that we're the ones that made it. And in general, outside the great filter and so on,

1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:22.640
 it's not obvious that the Stephen Hawking thing, which is it's not obvious that life out there

1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:30.880
 is going to be kind to us. Oh yeah. So I knew Hawking and I greatly respect his scientific

1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:37.120
 work and in particular, the early work on the unification of general theory of relativity

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:41.600
 and quantum physics to two great pillars of modern physics, Hawking radiation and all that.

1:12:41.600 --> 1:12:47.280
 Fantastic work. If you were alive, you should have been a recipient of this year's Physics Nobel

1:12:47.280 --> 1:12:53.600
 Prize, which was for the discovery of black holes and also by Roger Penrose for the theoretical work

1:12:53.600 --> 1:13:00.560
 showing that given a star that's massive enough, you basically can't avoid having a black hole.

1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:05.280
 Anyway, Hawking, fantastic. I tip my hat to him. May he rest in peace.

1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:08.800
 That would have been a heck of a Nobel Prize for black holes. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:13:08.800 --> 1:13:12.880
 A heck of a good group. But going back to what he said that we shouldn't be

1:13:13.520 --> 1:13:19.200
 broadcasting our presence to others, there I actually disagree with him respectfully because

1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:24.720
 first of all, we've been unintentionally broadcasting our presence for 100 years since

1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:32.880
 the development of radio and TV. Secondly, any alien that has the capability of coming here

1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:39.680
 and squashing us either already knows about us and doesn't care because we're just like little ants.

1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:44.880
 And when they're ants in your kitchen, you tend to squash them. But if they're ants on the sidewalk

1:13:44.880 --> 1:13:49.680
 and you're walking by, do you feel some great conviction that you have to squash any of them?

1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:55.760
 No, you generally don't. We're irrelevant to them. All they need to do is keep an eye on us

1:13:55.760 --> 1:14:02.480
 to see whether we're approaching the kind of technological capability and know about them

1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:10.160
 and have intentions of attacking them. And then they can squash us. They could have done it long

1:14:10.160 --> 1:14:16.960
 ago. They'll do it if they want to, whether we advertise our presence or not is irrelevant.

1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:20.800
 So I really think that that's not a huge existential threat.

1:14:21.520 --> 1:14:27.760
 So this is a good place to bring up a difficult topic. You mentioned they might,

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:32.560
 they would be paying attention to us to see if we come up with any crazy technology.

1:14:33.840 --> 1:14:39.520
 There's folks who have reported UFO sightings. There's actually, I've recently found out there's

1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:46.640
 websites that track this, the data and the data of these reportings. And there's millions of them

1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:52.800
 in the past several decades, so seven decades and so on, that they've been recorded.

1:14:52.800 --> 1:15:03.840
 And the ufologists community, as they refer to themselves, one of the ideas that I find

1:15:03.840 --> 1:15:08.560
 compelling from an alien perspective, that they kind of started showing up

1:15:09.360 --> 1:15:13.920
 ever since we figured out how to build nuclear weapons that we should.

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:15.200
 With a coincidence.

1:15:17.040 --> 1:15:20.800
 So I mean, if I was an alien, I would just start showing up then as well.

1:15:20.800 --> 1:15:23.440
 Well, why not just observe us from afar?

1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:29.520
 I know, right. I would figure out, but that's why I'm always keeping a distance and staying blurry.

1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:33.200
 Very pixelated.

1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:37.520
 Very pixelated. There is something in the human condition that,

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:44.400
 a cognition that wants to see, wants to believe beautiful things and some are terrifying,

1:15:44.400 --> 1:15:52.720
 some are exciting, goats, bigfoot is a big fascination for folks. And UFO sightings,

1:15:52.720 --> 1:15:56.960
 I think, falls into that. There's people that look at lights in the night sky and

1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:07.200
 I mean, it's kind of a downer to think in a skeptical sense, to think that's just a light.

1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:10.800
 You want to feel like there's something magical there.

1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:14.560
 Sure. I mean, I felt that first when my dad as a physicist,

1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:19.120
 when he first told me about ball lightning, when I was like a little kid.

1:16:19.120 --> 1:16:19.760
 Very weird.

1:16:21.280 --> 1:16:27.600
 Weird physical phenomena. And he said, his intuition was, tell me this as a little kid,

1:16:28.800 --> 1:16:33.520
 like I really like math, his intuition was whoever figures out ball lightning will get a

1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:40.160
 no ball prize. I think that was a side comment he gave me. I decided there when I was like five

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:44.640
 years old or whatever, I'm going to win a no ball prize for figuring out ball lightning.

1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:49.760
 That was like one of the first sort of sparks of the scientific mindset. Those mysteries,

1:16:49.760 --> 1:16:54.000
 they capture your imagination. I think when I speak to people that report UFOs,

1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:58.240
 that's that fire, that's what I see, that excitement.

1:16:58.240 --> 1:16:59.280
 Yeah, I understand that.

1:16:59.760 --> 1:17:05.360
 But what do we do with that? Because there's hundreds of thousands, if not millions,

1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:10.480
 and then the scientific community, you're like the perfect person. You have an awesome

1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:18.960
 Einstein shirt. What do we do with those reports? Most of the scientific community

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:27.200
 kind of rolls their eyes and dismisses it. Is it possible that a tiny percent of those folks

1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:30.560
 saw something that's worth deeply investigating?

1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:33.680
 Sure. We should investigate it. It's just one of these things where

1:17:33.680 --> 1:17:39.600
 they've not brought us a hunk of kryptonite or something like that. They haven't brought us

1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:45.200
 actual tangible physical evidence with which experiments can be done in laboratories.

1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:51.920
 It's anecdotal evidence. The photographs are, in some cases, in most cases,

1:17:51.920 --> 1:17:53.440
 I would say quite ambiguous.

1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:59.360
 I don't know what to think about. David Freyver is the first person. He's a Navy pilot, commander.

1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:05.760
 Yeah. And there's a bunch of them, but he's sort of one of the most legit pilots and people

1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:08.720
 I've ever met. Right.

1:18:08.720 --> 1:18:12.240
 The fact that he saw something weird. He doesn't know what the heck it is.

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:13.360
 Yeah.

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:19.440
 But he saw something weird. I mean, I don't know what to do with that. On the psychological side,

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:26.800
 so I'm pretty confident he saw what he says he saw, which he's saying is something weird.

1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:34.080
 Right. One of the interesting psychological things that worries me is that everybody

1:18:35.120 --> 1:18:39.760
 in the Navy, everybody in the US government, everybody in the scientific community,

1:18:40.320 --> 1:18:47.520
 just kind of pretended that nothing happened. That kind of instinct. That's what makes me

1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:54.000
 believe if aliens show up, we would all just ignore their presence. That's what bothered me,

1:18:54.000 --> 1:19:01.920
 that you don't investigate it more carefully and use this opportunity to inspire the world.

1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:12.160
 So in terms of kryptonite, I think the conspiracy theory folks say that whenever there is some

1:19:12.160 --> 1:19:17.440
 good hard evidence that scientists would be excited about, there's this kind of conspiracy

1:19:17.440 --> 1:19:22.800
 that I don't like because it's ultimately negative, that the US government will somehow hide the good

1:19:22.800 --> 1:19:28.880
 evidence to protect it. Of course, there's some legitimacy to it because you want to protect

1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:38.160
 military secrets, all that kind of stuff. But I don't know what to do with this beautiful mess

1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:43.760
 because I think millions of people are inspired by UFOs. Right.

1:19:44.480 --> 1:19:47.600
 And it feels like an opportunity to inspire people about science.

1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:53.200
 So I would say, as Carl Sagan used to say, extraordinary claims require extraordinary

1:19:53.200 --> 1:20:03.440
 evidence. I've quoted him a number of times. We would welcome such evidence. On other hand,

1:20:04.640 --> 1:20:11.360
 a lot of the things that are seen or perhaps even hidden from us, you could imagine for military

1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:17.440
 purposes, surveillance purposes, the US government doesn't want us to know. Or maybe some of these

1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:25.280
 pilots saw Soviet or Israeli or whatever satellites. A lot of the or some of the crashes that have

1:20:25.280 --> 1:20:32.720
 occurred were later found to be weather balloons or whatever. When there are more conventional

1:20:32.720 --> 1:20:44.400
 explanations, science tends to stay away from the sensational ones. And so it may be that

1:20:44.400 --> 1:20:50.800
 someone else's calling in life is to investigate these phenomena. And I welcome that as a scientist.

1:20:51.520 --> 1:20:59.280
 I don't categorically actually deny the possibility that ships of some sort could have visited us because,

1:20:59.280 --> 1:21:04.480
 as I said earlier, at slow speeds, there's no problem in reaching other stars. In fact,

1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:09.840
 our Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft in a few million years are going to be in the vicinity

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:15.040
 of different stars. We can even calculate which ones they're going to be in the vicinity of.

1:21:15.040 --> 1:21:20.480
 So there's nothing that breaks any laws of physics if you do it slowly. But that's different.

1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:26.400
 Just having Voyager or Pioneer fly by some star, that's different from having active aliens

1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:33.200
 altering the trajectory of their vehicle in real time, spying on us, and then either zipping back

1:21:33.200 --> 1:21:41.360
 to their home planet or sending signals that tell them about us because they are likely many years,

1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:46.640
 many light years away. And they're not going to have broken that barrier as well.

1:21:47.920 --> 1:21:56.880
 So I just go ahead, study them. Great. For some young kid who wants to do it,

1:21:57.440 --> 1:22:02.640
 it might be their calling. And that's how they might find meaning in their lives is to be the

1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:09.040
 scientist who really explores these things. I chose not to because at a very young age,

1:22:09.040 --> 1:22:14.240
 I found the evidence to the degree that I investigated it to be really quite unconvincing,

1:22:14.880 --> 1:22:21.200
 and I had other things that I wanted to do. But I don't categorically deny the possibility,

1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:27.040
 and I think it should be investigated. Yeah. I mean, this is one of those phenomena that

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:34.640
 99.9% of people are almost definitely there's conventional explanations. And then there's

1:22:34.640 --> 1:22:41.840
 like mysterious things that probably have explanations that are a little bit more complicated.

1:22:43.200 --> 1:22:48.240
 But there's not enough to work with. I tend to believe that if aliens showed up,

1:22:48.240 --> 1:22:57.200
 there will be plenty of evidence for scientists to study. And exactly, as you said,

1:22:58.640 --> 1:23:06.000
 avoid your type of spacecraft. I could see some kind of a dumb thing, almost like a

1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:12.560
 sensor that's statistically speaking, flying by, maybe lands, maybe there's some kind of robot

1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:17.120
 type of thingies that just move around and so on, in ways that we don't understand.

1:23:17.120 --> 1:23:27.680
 But I feel like, well, I feel like there'll be plenty of hard, hard to dismiss evidence. And I

1:23:27.680 --> 1:23:34.400
 also, especially this year, believe that the US government is not sufficiently competent,

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:39.360
 given the huge amount of evidence that will be revealed from this kind of thing,

1:23:39.360 --> 1:23:45.840
 to conceal all of it, at least in modern times. You can say maybe decades ago, but in modern times.

1:23:45.840 --> 1:23:51.520
 But the people I speak to, and the reason I bring it up is because so many people write to me,

1:23:51.520 --> 1:23:52.720
 they're inspired by it.

1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:56.960
 By the way, I wanted to comment on something you said earlier. Yeah, I had said that I'm sort of

1:23:56.960 --> 1:24:04.160
 an epistomist in that I think there are very few other intelligent, mechanically able creatures

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:09.680
 out there. But then I said, yes, in a sense, I'm an optimist, as you pointed out, because it means

1:24:09.680 --> 1:24:15.040
 that we made it through the great filter. I meant originally that I'm a pessimist,

1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:20.320
 I'm a pessimist in that I'm pessimistic about the possibility that there are many,

1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:21.920
 many of us out there.

1:24:21.920 --> 1:24:24.480
 Mathematically speaking, in the Drake equation.

1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:29.920
 Exactly, right. But it may mean a good thing for our ultimate survival. So I'm glad you

1:24:29.920 --> 1:24:33.840
 caught me on that. Yeah, I definitely agree with you. It is ultimately an optimistic statement.

1:24:33.840 --> 1:24:41.200
 But anyway, I think UFO research is interesting. And I guess one of the reasons I've not been

1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:46.320
 terribly convinced is that I think there are some scientists who are investigating this and they've

1:24:46.320 --> 1:24:53.120
 not found any clear evidence. Now, I must admit, I have not looked through the literature to convince

1:24:53.120 --> 1:24:57.920
 myself that there are many scientists doing systematic studies of these various reports.

1:24:57.920 --> 1:25:03.840
 I can't say for sure that there's a critical mass of them. But it's just that you never get

1:25:03.840 --> 1:25:08.480
 these reports from hardcore scientists. That's another thing. And astronomers, what do we do?

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:13.520
 We spend our time studying the heavens. And you'd think we'd be the ones that are most likely,

1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:18.800
 aside from pilots, perhaps, at seeing weird things in the sky. And we just never do

1:25:19.600 --> 1:25:25.040
 of the unexplained UFO type nature. Yeah, I definitely, I try to keep an open mind. But

1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:31.840
 for people who listen, it's actually really difficult for scientists. I get probably,

1:25:31.840 --> 1:25:39.840
 like, this year, I've probably gotten over, probably maybe, maybe over 1000 emails on the

1:25:39.840 --> 1:25:47.600
 topic of AGI. It's very difficult to, you know, people write to me is like, how can you ignore

1:25:48.320 --> 1:25:52.480
 this in AGI side, like this model? This is obviously the model that's going to achieve

1:25:52.480 --> 1:25:56.720
 general intelligence. How can you ignore it? I'm giving you the answer. Here's my document. And

1:25:56.720 --> 1:26:04.480
 there are always just these large write ups. The problem is, it's very difficult to we

1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:12.880
 threw a bunch of BS. Right. It's very possible that you had actually saw the UFO, but you have

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:19.920
 to acknowledge that by UFO I mean an extraterrestrial life, you have to acknowledge the hundreds of

1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:27.520
 thousands of people who are a little bit, if not a lot, full of BS. And from a scientist's

1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:33.920
 perspective, it just, it's really hard work. And it's when there's amazing stuff out there,

1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:40.560
 it's like why invest big foot when evolution in all of its richness is beautiful, who cares

1:26:40.560 --> 1:26:44.640
 about a monkey that walks on two feet or eight or whatever. It's like there's a zillion decoys.

1:26:44.640 --> 1:26:53.840
 At observatories, true fact, we get lots and lots of phone calls when Venus, the evening star,

1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:58.960
 but just really a bright planet, happens to be close to the crescent moon because it's such a

1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:03.520
 striking pair. This happens once in a while. So we get these phone calls, oh, there's a UFO

1:27:03.520 --> 1:27:11.360
 next to the moon. And no, it's Venus. And so they're just, and I'm not saying the best UFO reports

1:27:11.360 --> 1:27:15.360
 are of that nature. No, there's some much more convincing cases and I've seen some of the footage

1:27:15.360 --> 1:27:21.280
 and blah, blah, blah. But it's just, there's so many decoys, right? So much noise that you have

1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:27.200
 to filter out. And there's only so many scientists. So it's hard. There's only so much time as well,

1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:33.440
 and you have to choose what problems you work on. This might be a fun question to ask to kind of

1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:45.520
 explore the idea of the expanding universe. So the radius of the observable universe is 45.7

1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:58.720
 billion light years. And the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years. That's less than the radius

1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:05.840
 of the universe. How's that possible? So that's a great question. So I meant to bring a little

1:28:05.840 --> 1:28:11.040
 prop I have with ping pong balls and a rubber hose, a rubber band. I use it in many of the

1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:17.520
 lectures that one can find of me online. But you have in an expanding universe the space itself

1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:24.880
 between galaxies or more correctly clusters of galaxies expanding. So imagine light going from

1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:33.120
 one cluster to another. It traverses some distance. And then while it's traversing the rest, that part

1:28:33.120 --> 1:28:42.240
 that it already traveled through continues to expand. Now, 13.7 billion years might have gone by

1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:49.440
 since the light that we are seeing from the early stages, the so called cosmic microwave

1:28:49.440 --> 1:28:54.880
 background radiation, which is the afterglow of the Big Bang or the echo of the Big Bang. Yeah,

1:28:54.880 --> 1:29:01.440
 13.7 billion years have gone by. That's how long it's taken that light to reach us. But while it's

1:29:01.440 --> 1:29:08.240
 been traveling that distance, the parts that it already traveled continue to expand. So it's like

1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:14.240
 you're walking on at an airport on one of these walkways, and you're walking along because you're

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:20.720
 trying to get to your terminal. But the walkway is continuing as well. You end up traveling a

1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:25.360
 greater distance or the same distance faster is another way of putting it, right? That's why

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:32.160
 you get on one of these traveling walkways. So you get roughly a factor of pi, but it's more

1:29:32.160 --> 1:29:38.320
 like 3.2, I think. But when you work it all out, you multiply the number of years the universe

1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:45.840
 has been in existence by three and a quarter or so, and that's how you get this 46 billion

1:29:45.840 --> 1:29:55.600
 light year radius. But how is that? Let me ask some nice dumb questions. How is that not traveling

1:29:55.600 --> 1:29:59.760
 faster than the speed of light? Yeah, it's not traveling faster than the speed of light because

1:29:59.760 --> 1:30:06.080
 locally at any point, if you were to measure the light, the photon zipping past, it would not be

1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:12.000
 exceeding the speed of light. The speed of light is a locally measured quantity. After light has

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:18.160
 traversed some distance, if the rubber band keeps on stretching, then yes, it looks like the light

1:30:18.800 --> 1:30:26.240
 traveled a greater distance than it would have had the space not been expanding. But locally,

1:30:26.240 --> 1:30:30.240
 it never was exceeding the speed of light. It's just that the distance through which it already

1:30:30.240 --> 1:30:38.080
 traveled then went often expanded on its own some more. And if you give the light credit,

1:30:38.080 --> 1:30:41.760
 so to speak, for having traversed that distance, well, then it looks like

1:30:41.760 --> 1:30:46.000
 it's going faster than the speed of light. But that's not how speed works.

1:30:46.000 --> 1:30:52.240
 Right, that's not how speed works. Speed and in relativity also, the other thing that is interesting

1:30:52.240 --> 1:30:57.600
 is that if you take two ping pong balls that are sufficiently far apart, especially in an

1:30:57.600 --> 1:31:02.080
 accelerating universe, you can easily have them moving apart from one another faster than the

1:31:02.080 --> 1:31:09.040
 speed of light. So take two ping pong balls that were originally 400,000 kilometers from each other

1:31:09.040 --> 1:31:15.040
 and let every centimeter in your rubber band expand to two in one second. Then suddenly,

1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:23.200
 this 400,000 kilometer distance is 800,000 kilometers. It went out by 400,000 kilometers in

1:31:23.200 --> 1:31:31.280
 one second. That exceeds the 300,000 kilometer per second speed of light. But that light limit,

1:31:31.280 --> 1:31:38.640
 that that particle limit in special relativity applies to objects moving through a preexisting

1:31:38.640 --> 1:31:45.280
 space. There's nothing in either special or general relativity that prevents space itself

1:31:45.840 --> 1:31:50.080
 from expanding faster than the speed of light. That's no problem. Einstein wouldn't have had a

1:31:50.080 --> 1:31:59.360
 problem with a universe as observed now by cosmologists. Yeah, I'm not sure I'm yet ready

1:31:59.360 --> 1:32:06.640
 to deal emotionally with expanding space. That to me is one of the most awe inspiring things,

1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:10.720
 starting from the Big Bang. That's definitely abstract.

1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:22.480
 It's space itself is expanding. Can we talk about the Big Bang a little bit? Sure. The entirety

1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:30.240
 of it, the universe, was very small. Right. But it was not a point. It was not a point.

1:32:30.800 --> 1:32:36.080
 Because if we live in what's called a closed universe now, a sphere or the three dimensional

1:32:36.080 --> 1:32:42.960
 version of that would be a hypersphere. Then regardless of how far back in time you go,

1:32:42.960 --> 1:32:49.760
 it was always that topological shape. You can't turn a point suddenly into a shell. It always had

1:32:49.760 --> 1:32:56.160
 to be a shell. So when people say, well, the universe started out as a point, that's being

1:32:56.160 --> 1:33:01.200
 kind of flippant, kind of glib. It didn't really. It just started out at a very high density.

1:33:01.200 --> 1:33:06.640
 And we don't know, actually, whether it was finite or infinite. I think, personally,

1:33:06.640 --> 1:33:11.280
 that it was finite at the time, but it expanded very, very quickly. Indeed, if it

1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:17.440
 exponentiated and continued in some places to exponentiate, then it could in fact be infinite

1:33:17.440 --> 1:33:22.640
 right now. And most cosmologists think that it is infinite. Wait, sorry. What infinite,

1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:29.120
 which dimension, mass, size? Infinite in space. And by that, I mean that if you were trying to

1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:35.440
 measure, use light to measure its size, you'd never be able to measure its size because it would

1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:40.720
 always be bigger than the distance light can travel. That's what you get in a universe that's

1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:47.920
 accelerating in its expansion. Okay. But if a thing was a hypersphere, it's very small, not a

1:33:47.920 --> 1:33:54.240
 point. Yeah. How can that thing be infinite? Well, it expands exponentially. That's what

1:33:54.240 --> 1:33:59.360
 the inflation theory is all about. Indeed, at your home institution, Alan Gooth is one of the

1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:05.600
 originators of the whole inflationary universe idea, along with Andre Linde at Stanford University

1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:11.680
 here in the Bay Area. And others, Alexi Starabinsky and others had similar sorts of ideas. But

1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:16.480
 in an exponentially expanding universe, if you actually try to make this measurement,

1:34:17.120 --> 1:34:22.960
 you send light out to try to see it curve back around and hit you in the back of the head,

1:34:22.960 --> 1:34:29.280
 if it's an exponentially expanding universe, the amount of space remaining to be traversed

1:34:29.280 --> 1:34:34.960
 is always a bigger and bigger quantity. So you'll never get there from here. You'll never reach

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:39.520
 the back of your head. So observationally or operationally, it can be thought of as being

1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:45.840
 infinite. That's one of the best definitions of infinity, by the way. That's one of the best

1:34:46.480 --> 1:34:52.000
 sort of physical manifestations of infinity. Yeah, because you have to ask, how would you

1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:57.280
 actually measure it? Now, I sometimes say to my cosmology theoretical friends, well, if I took,

1:34:57.280 --> 1:35:02.640
 if I were God, and I were outside this whole thing, and I took a Godlike slice in time,

1:35:03.200 --> 1:35:09.280
 wouldn't it be finite, no matter how big it is? And they object and they say, Alex, you can't be

1:35:09.280 --> 1:35:15.600
 outside and take a Godlike slice of time, you know, because there's nothing outside. Well, I'm not,

1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:22.960
 you know, or also, you know, what slice of time you're taking depends on your motion. And that's

1:35:22.960 --> 1:35:29.920
 true even in special relativity that slices of time get tilted in a sense, if you're moving quickly,

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:38.480
 the axes, X and T actually become tilted, not perpendicular to one another. And, you know,

1:35:38.480 --> 1:35:44.400
 you can look at Brian Green's books and lectures and other things where he imagines taking a loaf

1:35:44.400 --> 1:35:51.360
 of bread and slicing it in units of time as you progress forward. But then if you're zipping along

1:35:51.360 --> 1:35:58.240
 relative to that loaf of bread, the slices of time actually become tilted. And so it's not even clear

1:35:58.240 --> 1:36:04.080
 what slices of time mean. But I'm an observational astronomer, I know which end of the telescope

1:36:04.080 --> 1:36:09.280
 to look through. And the way I understand the infinity is as I just told you that operationally

1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:16.800
 or observationally, there'd be no way of seeing that it's a finite universe, of measuring a finite

1:36:16.800 --> 1:36:24.080
 universe. And so in that sense, it's infinite. Even if it started out as a finite little dot,

1:36:24.720 --> 1:36:33.600
 well, not a dot, I'm sorry, a finite little hypersphere. But it didn't really start out there.

1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:39.920
 Because what happened before that? Well, we don't know. So this is where it gets into a lot of

1:36:39.920 --> 1:36:44.240
 speculation. And let's go, I mean, let's go there. Okay, sure. So, you know,

1:36:45.280 --> 1:36:49.680
 nobody can prove you wrong. The idea of what happened before T equals zero and whether there

1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:54.960
 are other universes out there. I like to say that these are sort of on the boundaries of science.

1:36:54.960 --> 1:36:59.120
 They're not just ideas that we wake up at three in the morning to go to the bathroom and say,

1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:02.400
 oh, well, let's think about what happened before the Big Bang or let there be a

1:37:02.400 --> 1:37:10.080
 multiplicity of universes. In other words, we have real testable physics that we can use to draw

1:37:10.080 --> 1:37:17.920
 certain conclusions that are plausibility arguments based on what we know. Now, admittedly,

1:37:17.920 --> 1:37:25.920
 there are not really direct tests of these hypotheses. That's why I call them hypotheses.

1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:31.280
 They're not really elevated to a theory because a theory in science is really something that has a

1:37:31.280 --> 1:37:38.400
 lot of experimental or observational support behind it. So they're hypotheses, but they're not

1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:42.880
 unreasonable hypotheses based on what we know about general relativity and quantum physics.

1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:50.400
 And they may have indirect tests in that if you adopt this hypothesis, then there might be a bunch

1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:55.040
 of things you expect of the universe. And lo and behold, that's what we measure. But we're not

1:37:55.040 --> 1:38:02.640
 actually measuring anything at t less than zero. Or we're not actually measuring the presence of

1:38:02.640 --> 1:38:08.320
 another universe in this multiverse. And yet there are these indirect ideas that stem forth.

1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:14.640
 So it's hard to prove uniqueness. And it's hard to completely convince oneself that

1:38:15.440 --> 1:38:22.800
 a certain hypothesis must be true. But the more and more tests you have that it satisfies,

1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:29.440
 let's say there are 50 predictions it makes. And 49 of them are things that you can measure.

1:38:30.080 --> 1:38:35.840
 And then the 50th one is the one where you want to measure the actual existence of that other

1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:43.760
 universe or what happened before t equals zero. And you can't do that. But you've satisfied 49 of

1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:50.880
 the other testable predictions. And so that's science, right? Now, a conventional condensed

1:38:50.880 --> 1:38:54.640
 matter physicist or someone who deals with real data in the laboratory might say, oh,

1:38:54.640 --> 1:38:59.360
 you cosmologists, you know, that's not really science, because it's not directly testable.

1:38:59.360 --> 1:39:04.880
 But I would say it's sort of testable. But it's not completely testable. And so it's at the boundary.

1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:10.320
 But it's not like we're coming up with these crazy ideas, among them quantum fluctuations out of

1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:15.920
 nothing. And then inflating into a universe with, you might say, well, you created a giant amount

1:39:15.920 --> 1:39:22.000
 of energy. But in fact, this quantum fluctuation out of nothing, you know, in a quantum way violates

1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:26.960
 the conservation of energy. But you know, who cares, that was a classical law anyway. And then

1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:33.520
 an inflating universe maintains whatever energy it had, be it zero or some infinitesimal amount.

1:39:33.520 --> 1:39:38.800
 In a sense, the stuff of the universe has a positive energy. But there's a negative

1:39:38.800 --> 1:39:44.080
 gravitational energy associated with it. It's like I drop an apple. I got kinetic energy,

1:39:44.080 --> 1:39:48.640
 energy of motion out of that. But I did work on it to bring it to that height.

1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:56.000
 So by going down and gaining energy of motion, positive one, two, three, four, five units of

1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:01.040
 kinetic energy, it's also gaining or losing, depending on how you want to think of it,

1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:06.240
 negative one, two, three, four, five units of potential energy. So the total energy remains

1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:12.240
 the same. An inflating universe can do that. Or other physicists say that energy isn't conserved

1:40:12.240 --> 1:40:17.280
 in general relativity. That's another way out of creating a universe out of nothing, you know.

1:40:17.280 --> 1:40:23.040
 But the point is that this is all based on reasonably well tested physics. And although

1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:30.080
 these extrapolations seem kind of outrageous at first, they're not completely outrageous. They're

1:40:30.080 --> 1:40:36.800
 within the realm of what we call science already. And maybe some young whippersnapper will be able

1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:42.400
 to figure out a way to directly test what happened before T equals zero or to test for the presence

1:40:42.400 --> 1:40:47.680
 of these other universes. But right now we don't have a way of doing that. So speaking of young

1:40:47.680 --> 1:40:56.560
 whippersnappers, Roger Penrose. Yeah. So he kind of has an idea that there may be some

1:40:56.560 --> 1:41:00.560
 information that travels from whatever the heck happened before the Big Bang.

1:41:00.560 --> 1:41:07.520
 Yeah. Maybe. I kind of doubt it. So do you think it's possible to detect something, like actually

1:41:07.520 --> 1:41:13.760
 experimentally be able to detect some, I don't know what it is, radiation, some sort of. Yeah.

1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:18.000
 And the cosmic microwave background radiation, there may be ways of doing that. Right.

1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:25.840
 But is it philosophically or practically possible to detect signs that this was before the Big

1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:32.480
 Bang? Or is it what you said, which is like, everything we observe will, as we currently

1:41:32.480 --> 1:41:36.160
 understand, will have to be a creation of this particular observable universe?

1:41:36.160 --> 1:41:41.120
 Yeah. I mean, you know, if you, it's very difficult to answer right now, because we don't have a single

1:41:41.840 --> 1:41:48.480
 verified, fully self consistent, experimentally tested quantum theory of gravity.

1:41:48.480 --> 1:41:52.880
 Right. And of course, the beginning of the universe is a large amount of stuff in a very

1:41:52.880 --> 1:41:58.080
 small space. So you need both quantum mechanics and general relativity. Same thing if our universe

1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:03.200
 recollapses and then bounces back to another Big Bang. You know, there's also ideas there that

1:42:03.200 --> 1:42:08.240
 some of the information leaks through or survives. I don't know that we can answer that question

1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:15.520
 right now, because we don't have a quantum theory of gravity that most physicists believe in. And

1:42:15.520 --> 1:42:20.640
 belief is perhaps the wrong word that most physicists trust because the experimental

1:42:20.640 --> 1:42:26.320
 evidence favors it, right? Yeah, there are various forms of string theory. There's quantum loop

1:42:26.320 --> 1:42:33.280
 gravity. There are various ideas, but which if any, will be the one that survives the test of

1:42:33.280 --> 1:42:40.880
 time and more importantly, within that the test of experiment and observation. So my own feeling

1:42:40.880 --> 1:42:45.600
 is probably these things don't survive. I don't think we've seen any evidence in the cosmic

1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:53.520
 microwave background radiation of information leaking through. Similarly, the one way or one of the

1:42:53.520 --> 1:42:58.560
 few ways in which we might test for the presence of other universes is if they were to collide with

1:42:58.560 --> 1:43:04.560
 ours, that would leave a pattern, a temperature signature in the cosmic microwave background

1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:10.240
 radiation. Some astrophysicists claim to have found it, but in my opinion, it's not statistically

1:43:10.240 --> 1:43:17.760
 significant to the level that would be necessary to have such an amazing claim, right? It's just a

1:43:17.760 --> 1:43:25.600
 5% chance that the microwave background had that distribution just by chance. 5% isn't very long odds

1:43:26.320 --> 1:43:34.080
 if you're claiming that instead that you're finding evidence from another universe. I mean,

1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:41.280
 it's like if the Large Hadron Collider people had claimed after gathering enough data to show

1:43:41.280 --> 1:43:49.040
 the Higgs particle when there was a 5% chance it could be just a statistical fluctuation

1:43:49.040 --> 1:43:54.880
 in their data, no, they required 5 sigma, 5 standard deviations, which is roughly

1:43:54.880 --> 1:44:00.800
 one chance in 2 million that this is a statistical fluctuation of no physical

1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:06.720
 greater significance. Extraordinary claims require extra there you go. It all boils down

1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:12.400
 to that and the greater your claim, the greater is the evidence that is needed and the more evidence

1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:21.520
 you need from independent ways of measuring or of coming to that deduction. A good example was

1:44:21.520 --> 1:44:27.760
 the accelerating universe. When we found it, evidence for it in 1998 with supernovae with

1:44:27.760 --> 1:44:33.920
 exploding stars, it was great that there were two teams that lent some credibility to the discovery,

1:44:33.920 --> 1:44:40.880
 but it was not until other astrophysicists used not only that technique, but more importantly,

1:44:40.880 --> 1:44:47.680
 other independent techniques that had their own potential sources of systematic error or whatever,

1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:52.880
 but they all came to the same conclusion and that started giving a much more complete picture of

1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:58.080
 what was going on and a picture in which most astrophysicists quickly gained confidence.

1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:05.680
 That's why that idea caught on so quickly is that there were other physicists and astronomers

1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:12.320
 doing observations completely independent of supernovae that seemed to indicate the same thing.

1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:22.880
 Yeah. That period of your life that work with an incredible team of people that won the Nobel Prize

1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:30.480
 is just fascinating work. Oh gosh. Never in my wildest dreams as a kid did I think that I would be

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:36.960
 involved, much less so heavily involved, in a discovery that's so revolutionary.

1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:41.360
 I mean, as a kid, as a scientist, if you're realistic once you learn a little bit more

1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:45.360
 about how science is done and you're not going to win an Nobel Prize and be the next Newton or

1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:50.880
 Einstein or whatever, you just hope that you'll contribute something to humankind's understanding

1:45:50.880 --> 1:45:56.560
 of how nature works and you'll be satisfied with that. But here I was in the right place at the

1:45:56.560 --> 1:46:03.600
 right time, a lot of luck, a lot of hard work, and there it was. We discovered something that was

1:46:03.600 --> 1:46:11.840
 really amazing, and that was the greatest thrill. I couldn't have asked for anything more than being

1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:17.520
 involved in that discovery. So the couple of teams, the Supernova Cosmology Project and the

1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:22.800
 High Z Supernova Search team, so what was the Nobel Prize given for? It was given for the

1:46:22.800 --> 1:46:27.840
 discovery of the accelerating expansion of the universe, not for the elucidation of what dark

1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:33.760
 energy is or what causes that expansion, that acceleration, be it universes on the outside

1:46:33.760 --> 1:46:38.320
 or whatever. It was only for the observational fact. So first of all, what is the accelerating

1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:45.600
 universe? So the accelerating universe is simply that if we look at the galaxies moving away from

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:52.320
 us right now, we would expect them to be moving away more slowly than they were billions of years

1:46:52.320 --> 1:46:58.080
 ago. And that's because galaxies have visible matter, which is gravitationally attractive and dark

1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:03.520
 matter of an unknown sort that holds galaxies together and holds clusters of galaxies together.

1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:09.280
 And of course, they then pull on one another and they would tend to retard the expansion

1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:15.440
 of the universe, just as when I toss an apple up, even ignoring air resistance,

1:47:15.440 --> 1:47:20.400
 the mutual gravitational attraction between Earth and the apple slows the apple down. And

1:47:20.400 --> 1:47:24.560
 if that attraction is great enough, then the apple will someday stop and even come back.

1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:28.720
 The big crunch, you could call it, or the Gnabagib, which is big bang backwards, right?

1:47:28.720 --> 1:47:33.200
 That's what could have happened to the universe. But even if the universe's original expansion

1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:39.280
 energy was so great that it avoids the big crunch, that's like an apple thrown at Earth's escape

1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:47.440
 speed. It's like the rockets that go to Mars someday, right? With people. Even then, you'd

1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:53.600
 expect the universe to be slowing down with time. But we looked back through the history of the

1:47:53.600 --> 1:48:02.240
 universe by looking at progressively more distant galaxies. And by seeing the evolution

1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:08.400
 of this expansion rate is that in the first nine billion years, yeah, it was slowing down.

1:48:09.040 --> 1:48:15.040
 But in the last five billion years, it's been speeding up. So who asked for that, right?

1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:20.400
 You know, I think it's interesting to talk about a little bit of the human story of the

1:48:20.400 --> 1:48:28.160
 Nobel Prize, which is, I mean, it's a really, first of all, the prize itself. It's kind of

1:48:28.160 --> 1:48:34.480
 fascinating in the psychological level that prizes, I know we kind of think that prizes

1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:39.440
 don't matter, but somehow they kind of focus the mind about some of the most special things we

1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:45.040
 have accomplished. They do. It's the recognition, the funding, you know. And also inspiration for,

1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:51.120
 I mean, like I said, when I was a little kid, they gave me the Nobel Prize. It inspires millions

1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:58.240
 of young scientists. At the same time, there's a sadness to it a little bit that especially

1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:02.640
 in the field, like depending on the field, but experimental fields that involve teams of,

1:49:02.640 --> 1:49:10.560
 I don't know, sometimes hundreds of brilliant people. The Nobel Prize is only given to just a

1:49:10.560 --> 1:49:18.000
 handful. Is it maxed at three? Yeah. Yeah. And it's not even written in Alfred Nobel's will,

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.520
 it turns out. One of our teammates looked into it in a museum in Stockholm when we went there for

1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:30.080
 Nobel week in 2011. The leaders who got the prize formally knew that without the rest of us working

1:49:30.080 --> 1:49:36.560
 hard in the trenches, the result would not have been discovered. So they invited us to participate

1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:41.520
 in Nobel week. And so one of the team members looked in the will and it's not there. It's just

1:49:41.520 --> 1:49:47.680
 tradition. That's it's archaic. That's the way science used to be done. And it's not the way a

1:49:47.680 --> 1:49:54.080
 lot of science is done now. And you look at gravitational wave discovery, which was recognized

1:49:54.080 --> 1:50:03.440
 with the Nobel Prize in 2017. Ray Weiss at MIT got it and Kip Thorne and Barry Bearish at Caltech.

1:50:03.440 --> 1:50:07.920
 And Ron Driever, one of the masterminds, had passed away earlier in the year. So again,

1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:14.400
 one of the rules on Nobel is that it's not given posthumously. Or at least the one exception

1:50:14.400 --> 1:50:18.480
 might be if they've made their decision and they're busy making their press releases

1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:24.000
 right before October, the first week in October or whatever. And then the person passes away.

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:31.040
 I think they don't change their minds then. But yeah, it doesn't square with today's reality

1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:36.160
 that a lot of science is done by big teams. In that case, a team of 1,000 people. In our case,

1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:43.280
 it was two teams consisting of about 50 people. And we used techniques that were arguably developed

1:50:43.280 --> 1:50:49.360
 in part by people who, astrophysicists who weren't even on those two papers. I mean, some of them

1:50:49.360 --> 1:50:54.720
 were, but other papers were written by other people. And so it's like we're standing on the

1:50:54.720 --> 1:51:01.840
 shoulders of giants. And none of those people was officially recognized. And to me, it was okay.

1:51:01.840 --> 1:51:07.200
 Again, it was the thrill of doing the work and ultimately the work, the discovery was recognized

1:51:07.200 --> 1:51:15.040
 with the prize. And we got to participate in Nobel week. And it's okay with me. I've known

1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:21.440
 other physicists whose lives were ruined because they did not get the Nobel Prize and they felt

1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:29.280
 strongly that they should have. Ralph Alpha, the Alpha Beta Gamoff paper predicting the

1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:35.440
 microwave background radiation, he should have gotten it. His advisor, Gamoff, was dead by that

1:51:35.440 --> 1:51:42.480
 point. But, you know, Penzius and Wilson got it for the discovery. And Alpha, apparently from

1:51:42.480 --> 1:51:47.040
 colleagues who knew him while I've talked to them, his life was ruined by this. He just,

1:51:47.040 --> 1:51:54.560
 it just not at his innards so much. It's very possible that in a small handful of people,

1:51:54.560 --> 1:51:59.120
 even three, that you would be one of the Nobel, one of the winners of the Nobel Prize.

1:51:59.120 --> 1:52:02.880
 That doesn't weigh heavy on you. Well, you know, there were the two team leaders,

1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:07.360
 Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt. And usually there's the team leaders that are recognized.

1:52:07.360 --> 1:52:11.440
 And then Adam Reese was my postdoc. First author, I guess.

1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:16.000
 Yeah, first author. I was second author of that paper. Yeah. So I was his direct mentor at the

1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:21.120
 time, although he was one of these people who just runs with things. He was an MIT undergraduate,

1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:27.680
 by the way, Harvard graduate student. And then a postdoc as a so called Miller Fellow

1:52:27.680 --> 1:52:33.280
 for basic research and science at Berkeley, something that I was back in 84 to 86. But

1:52:33.280 --> 1:52:38.160
 you're, you know, you're largely a free agent. But he worked quite closely with me and he came

1:52:38.160 --> 1:52:43.600
 to Berkeley to work with me. And on Schmidt's team, he was charged with analyzing the data.

1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:49.520
 And he measured the brightnesses of these distant supernovae, showing that they're fainter and thus

1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:54.560
 more distant than anticipated. And that led to this conclusion that the universe had to have

1:52:54.560 --> 1:53:00.800
 accelerated in order to push them out to such great distances. And I was shocked when he showed me

1:53:00.800 --> 1:53:05.520
 the data, the results of his calculations and measurements. But it's very, you know,

1:53:05.520 --> 1:53:10.880
 so he deserved it. And on Saul's team, Gerson Goldhaber deserved it. But he died,

1:53:10.880 --> 1:53:15.040
 I think, a year earlier in 2010. But that would have been four. And so,

1:53:16.880 --> 1:53:22.560
 and me, well, I was on both teams. But, you know, was I number four, five, six, seven? I don't know.

1:53:22.560 --> 1:53:28.560
 Well, it's also very, so if I were to, it's possible that you're, I mean, I could make a very

1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:34.720
 good case for you're in the three. And does that cycle? You're kind, you know, but is that

1:53:34.720 --> 1:53:42.160
 psychologically, I mean, listen, it weighs on me a little bit because I, I don't know what to do

1:53:42.160 --> 1:53:50.880
 with that. It, perhaps it should motivate the rethinking like Time Magazine started doing like,

1:53:50.880 --> 1:53:55.280
 you know, person of the year. Yeah. And like, they would, they would start doing like concepts

1:53:55.280 --> 1:54:01.680
 and almost like the black hole gets the Nobel Prize or, or the University gets the Nobel Prize.

1:54:01.680 --> 1:54:09.120
 And here's the list of people. So like, or like the Oscar that you could say. Yeah. Because it's

1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:14.320
 a team effort now. It's a team. It should be redone. And the breakthrough prize in fundamental

1:54:14.320 --> 1:54:18.560
 physics, which was started by Yuri Milner and Zuckerberg is involved in others as well. You

1:54:18.560 --> 1:54:24.880
 know, uh, they recognize the larger team. Yeah, they, they recognize teams. And so in fact,

1:54:24.880 --> 1:54:31.040
 both teams in the accelerating universe were recognized with the breakthrough prize in 2015.

1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:38.160
 Nevertheless, the same three people, Reese, Pearl, Mutter and Schmidt got the red carpet rolled out

1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:44.320
 for them and were at the big ceremony and shared half of the prize money. And the rest of us,

1:54:44.320 --> 1:54:50.000
 roughly 50 shared the other half and didn't get to go to the ceremony. So, but I feel for them.

1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:53.360
 I mean, for the gravitational waves, it was a thousand people. What are they going to do?

1:54:53.360 --> 1:54:59.600
 Invite everyone for the Higgs particle. It was 68,000 physicists and engineers. In fact,

1:54:59.600 --> 1:55:04.960
 because of the whole issue of who gets it, experimentally, that discovery still has not

1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:11.760
 been recognized, right? The theoretical work by Peter Higgs and, uh, Anglère got recognized.

1:55:11.760 --> 1:55:16.960
 But there was a troika of other people who, perhaps, wrote the most complete paper and they

1:55:16.960 --> 1:55:23.440
 were, they were left out. And, um, another guy died, you know, and. It's hard. It's all of

1:55:23.440 --> 1:55:28.000
 its heartbreak. And some people argue that the Nobel Prize has been deluded to because

1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:32.640
 if you look at Roger Penrose, you can make an argument that he should get the prize by himself.

1:55:33.360 --> 1:55:37.680
 Like, it's to separate those, like. Could have and should have. Perhaps he should have

1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:43.600
 perhaps gotten it with Hawking before Hawking's death, right? The problem was Hawking radiation

1:55:43.600 --> 1:55:48.240
 had not been detected, but you could argue that Hawking made enough other fundamental

1:55:48.240 --> 1:55:54.720
 contributions to the theoretical study of black holes and the observed data were already good

1:55:54.720 --> 1:55:59.840
 enough at the time of before Hawking's death. Okay. I mean, the latest results by Reinhard

1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:05.280
 Genzel's group is that they see the time dilation effect of a star that's passing very close to

1:56:05.280 --> 1:56:10.160
 the black hole in the middle of our galaxy. That's cool. But, and it adds additional evidence,

1:56:10.160 --> 1:56:16.240
 but hardly anyone doubted the existence of the supermassive black hole. And Andrea Gez's group,

1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:20.640
 I believe, hadn't yet shown that relativistic effect. And yet she got part of the prize as

1:56:20.640 --> 1:56:26.320
 well. So clearly it was given for the original evidence that was really good. And that evidence

1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:33.360
 is at least a decade old, you know. So one could make the case for Hawking. One could make the case

1:56:33.360 --> 1:56:40.160
 that in 2016, when Mayor and K. Lowe's won the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the first exoplanet,

1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:48.800
 51B Pegasi, well, there was a fellow at Penn State, Alex Walshahn, who in 1992,

1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:56.960
 three years preceding 1995, found a planet orbiting a pulsar, a very weird kind of star,

1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:02.400
 a neutron star, and that wouldn't have been a normal planet. Sure. And so the Nobel committee,

1:57:02.400 --> 1:57:08.240
 you know, they gave it for the discovery of planets around normal, sunlike stars. But,

1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:12.880
 but hell, you know, Walshahn found a planet. So they could have given it to him as the third person

1:57:13.440 --> 1:57:18.480
 instead of to Jim Peebles for the development of what's called physical cosmology. He's at

1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:23.360
 Princeton. He deserved it. But they could have given Nobel for the development of physical

1:57:23.360 --> 1:57:28.560
 cosmology to Peebles. And I would claim some other people were pretty important in that development

1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:33.920
 as well, you know, and they could have given it some other year. So there's there's a lot

1:57:33.920 --> 1:57:38.800
 of controversy. I try not to dwell on it was I number three, probably not, you know, Adam Reese

1:57:38.800 --> 1:57:45.760
 did the work. You know, I helped bounce ideas off of him, but we wouldn't have had the result without

1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:53.200
 him. Yeah. And I was on both teams for reasons. I mean, you know, I the style of the first team,

1:57:53.200 --> 1:57:58.000
 the supernova cosmology project didn't match mine. They came largely from experimental high

1:57:58.000 --> 1:58:02.400
 energy particle physics, physics, where there's these hierarchical teams and stuff. And it's

1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:07.440
 hard for the little guy to to have a say, at least that's what I kind of thought. Whereas

1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:12.320
 the team of astronomers led by Brian Schmidt was first of all, a bunch of my friends. And

1:58:13.040 --> 1:58:18.080
 they grew up as astronomers making contributions on little teams. And we decided to band together.

1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:24.160
 But all of us had our voices heard. So it was sort of a, a culture, a style that I preferred,

1:58:24.160 --> 1:58:32.000
 really. But let me tell you a story at the Nobel banquet. Okay. I'm sitting there between two

1:58:32.000 --> 1:58:36.320
 physicists who are who are members of the committee of the Swedish National Academy of Sciences.

1:58:37.200 --> 1:58:41.760
 You know, and I strategically kept, you know, offering them wine and stuff during this long

1:58:41.760 --> 1:58:48.400
 drawn out Nobel ceremony. Right. And I got them to be pretty talkative. And then in a in a polite

1:58:48.400 --> 1:58:54.720
 diplomatic way, I started asking them pointed questions. And basically, they admitted that if

1:58:54.720 --> 1:59:01.120
 there are four or more people equally deserving, they wait for one of them to die. Or they just

1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:07.280
 don't give the prize at all. When it's unclear who the three are, at least unclear to them. But

1:59:07.280 --> 1:59:14.880
 unclear to them, it's they're not even right. Part of the time. I mean, Jocelyn Bell discovered

1:59:14.880 --> 1:59:22.400
 pulsars with a radio antennas, a set of radio antennas that her advisor, Anthony Hewish,

1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:31.120
 conceived and built. So he deserves some credit. But, but he didn't discover the pulsar. She did.

1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:38.800
 And his initial reaction to the data that she showed him was a condescending rubbish, my dear.

1:59:38.800 --> 1:59:48.480
 Yeah, I'm not kidding. She did not let this destroy her life. She won every other prize

1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:56.880
 under the sun. Okay. Vera Rubin, arguably one of the discoverers of dark matter. Although there,

1:59:56.880 --> 2:00:00.480
 if you look at the history, there were a number of people. That was the issue. I think there were

2:00:00.480 --> 2:00:05.600
 a number of people four or more who had similar data and similar ideas at about the same time.

2:00:05.600 --> 2:00:12.240
 Rubin won every prize under the sun. The new big large scale survey telescope being built in Chile

2:00:12.240 --> 2:00:18.720
 is being renamed the Vera Rubin telescope because she passed away in December of 2015, I think.

2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:26.640
 You know, it'll conduct this survey large scale survey with the Rubin telescope. So she's been

2:00:26.640 --> 2:00:32.320
 recognized, but never with the Nobel Prize. And I would say that to her credit, she did not let

2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:39.120
 that consume her life either. And perhaps it was a bit easier because there had been no

2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:44.480
 Nobel given for the discovery of dark matter. Whereas in the case of pulsars in Jocelyn Bell,

2:00:45.360 --> 2:00:50.240
 there was a prize given for the discovery of the freaking pulsars. And she didn't get it.

2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:59.040
 Well, I mean, what a travesty of justice. So I also think as a fan of fiction, as a fan of stories,

2:00:59.040 --> 2:01:05.120
 that the the the travesty and the tragedy and the unfairness and the tension of it

2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:12.880
 is what makes the prize and similar prizes beautiful. The the decisions of other humans

2:01:12.880 --> 2:01:20.400
 that result in dreams being broken. And, you know, like, that's why we love the Olympics.

2:01:21.040 --> 2:01:26.720
 There's so many, you know, people, athletes give their whole life for this particular moment.

2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:32.400
 And then and then there's referee decisions and like little slips of here and there, like the

2:01:32.400 --> 2:01:40.400
 little misfortunes that destroy entire dreams. And that's it's weird to say, but it feels like

2:01:40.400 --> 2:01:46.240
 that makes the entirety of it even more special. Yeah, if it was perfect, it wouldn't be interesting.

2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:51.360
 Well, humans like competition and they like heroes. And unfortunately, it gives the impression to

2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:58.880
 youngsters today that science is still done by white men with gray beards wearing white lab coats.

2:01:58.880 --> 2:02:04.400
 And I'm very pleased to see that this year, you know, Andrea Gez, the fourth woman in the history

2:02:04.400 --> 2:02:11.200
 of the physics prize to have received it. And then two women, one at Berkeley, one elsewhere,

2:02:11.200 --> 2:02:17.600
 won the Nobel Prize in chemistry without any male co recipient. And so that's sending a message, I

2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:25.520
 think, to girls that they can do science and they have role models. I think the breakthrough prize

2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:32.640
 and other such prizes show that teams get recognized as well. And if you pay attention to

2:02:32.640 --> 2:02:38.480
 the newspapers, you know, most of the good authors like, you know, Dennis Overby of the New York

2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:43.840
 Times and others said that these were teams of people and they emphasize that. And, you know,

2:02:43.840 --> 2:02:49.120
 they all played a role. And, you know, maybe if some grad student hadn't soldered some circuit,

2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:54.240
 maybe the whole thing wouldn't have worked, you know. But still, you know, Ray Weiss,

2:02:55.280 --> 2:03:02.400
 Kip Thorne was the theoretical, you know, impetus for the whole search for gravitational waves.

2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:09.200
 Barry Barish brought the MIT and Caltech teams together to get them to cooperate at a time when

2:03:09.200 --> 2:03:15.760
 the project was nearly dead from what I understand and contributed greatly to the experimental setup

2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:20.320
 as well. He's a great experimental physicist, but he was really good at bringing these two teams

2:03:20.320 --> 2:03:25.200
 together. Instead of having them duke it out and blows and leaving both of them bleeding and dying,

2:03:25.200 --> 2:03:29.520
 you know, the National Science Foundation was going to cut the funding from what I understand,

2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:34.880
 you know. So there's human drama involved in this whole thing. And the Olympics, yeah, you know,

2:03:34.880 --> 2:03:41.600
 a runner or a swimmer, a runner, you know, they slip just at the moment that they were taking

2:03:41.600 --> 2:03:46.640
 off from the first thing and that cost them some fraction of a second. And that's it. They didn't

2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:53.040
 win, you know. And in that case, I mean, the coaches, the families, which I met a lot of

2:03:53.040 --> 2:03:58.400
 Olympic athletes and the coaches and the families of the athletes are really the winners of the

2:03:58.400 --> 2:04:05.840
 medals. But they don't get the medal. And it's, you know, credit assignment is a fascinating

2:04:05.840 --> 2:04:13.360
 thing. I mean, that's the full human story. We have, and outside of prizes, it's fascinating.

2:04:13.360 --> 2:04:17.840
 I mean, just to be in the middle of it for artificial intelligence, there's a field

2:04:17.840 --> 2:04:23.040
 of deep learning that's really exciting. And people have been, there's yet another award,

2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:30.560
 the Turing Award, given for deep learning to three folks who are very much responsible for

2:04:30.560 --> 2:04:40.320
 the field, but so are a lot of others. And there's a few, there's a, there's a fellow by the name

2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:48.640
 of Schmidt Hooper, who sort of symbolizes the forgotten folks in the deep learning community.

2:04:48.640 --> 2:04:55.440
 But, you know, that's the unfortunate sad thing where you remember Isaac Newton,

2:04:55.440 --> 2:05:04.720
 but remember these special figures and the ones that flew close to them, we forget.

2:05:04.720 --> 2:05:08.800
 Well, that's right. And, you know, often the breakthroughs are made based on the body of

2:05:08.800 --> 2:05:15.600
 knowledge that had been assimilated prior to that. But, you know, again, people like to worship heroes.

2:05:15.600 --> 2:05:20.880
 You mentioned the Oscars earlier. And, you know, you look at the direct, I mean, well, I mean,

2:05:21.680 --> 2:05:26.720
 okay, directors and stuff sometimes get awards and stuff. But, you know, you look at even something

2:05:26.720 --> 2:05:31.120
 like, I don't know, songwriters, musicians, Elton John or something, right, Bernie Taupin, right,

2:05:31.920 --> 2:05:39.680
 wrote many of the words or he's not as well known or the Beatles or something like that.

2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:43.120
 I was heartbroken to learn that Elvis didn't write most of the songs.

2:05:43.120 --> 2:05:48.400
 Yeah, Elvis, that's right. There you go. But he was the king, right? And he had such a personality

2:05:48.400 --> 2:05:53.840
 and he was such a performer, right? But it's the unsung heroes in many cases. Yeah.

2:05:55.120 --> 2:06:00.400
 So maybe taking a step back, we talked about the Nobel Prize for the Accelerating Universe, but

2:06:01.120 --> 2:06:11.760
 your work and the ideas around supernova were important in detecting this Accelerating Universe.

2:06:11.760 --> 2:06:17.520
 Can we go to the very basics of what is this beautiful, mysterious object of a supernova?

2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:23.360
 Right. So a supernova is an exploding star. Most stars die a relatively quiet death,

2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:28.080
 our own son. Well, despite the fact that it'll become a red giant and incinerate earth,

2:06:28.080 --> 2:06:33.440
 it'll do that reasonably slowly. But there's a small minority of stars that end their lives

2:06:33.440 --> 2:06:39.440
 in a titanic explosion. And that's not only exciting to watch from afar, but it's critical

2:06:39.440 --> 2:06:45.440
 to our existence because it is in these explosions that the heavy elements synthesize through

2:06:45.440 --> 2:06:51.840
 nuclear reactions during the normal course of the star's evolution and during the explosion itself,

2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:57.920
 get ejected into the cosmos, making them available as raw material for new stars,

2:06:57.920 --> 2:07:03.680
 planets, and ultimately life. And that's just a great story, the best in some ways.

2:07:03.680 --> 2:07:09.920
 So, you know, we like to study these things and our origins, but it turns out these are

2:07:09.920 --> 2:07:16.960
 incredibly useful beacons as well. Because if you know how powerful an exploding star

2:07:16.960 --> 2:07:24.480
 really is by measuring the apparent brightness at its peak in galaxies whose distances we already

2:07:24.480 --> 2:07:30.080
 know through having made other measurements, and you can thus calibrate how powerful the

2:07:30.080 --> 2:07:36.320
 thing really is, and then you find ones that are much more distant, then you can use their

2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:42.800
 observed brightness compared with their true intrinsic power or luminosity to judge their

2:07:42.800 --> 2:07:47.760
 distance and hence the distance of the galaxy in which they're located. So, okay, it's like

2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:53.280
 looking at if you'll let me just give this one analogy, you know, you judge the distance of an

2:07:53.280 --> 2:07:59.440
 oncoming car at night by looking at how bright its headlights appear to be, and you've calibrated

2:07:59.440 --> 2:08:04.560
 how bright the headlights are of a car that's two or three meters away of known distance,

2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:10.320
 and you go, whoa, that's a faint headlight. And so that's pretty far away. You also use the apparent

2:08:10.320 --> 2:08:15.200
 angular separation between the two headlights as a consistency check in your brain. But that's

2:08:15.200 --> 2:08:19.600
 what your brain is doing. So we can do that for cars, we can do that for stars.

2:08:20.400 --> 2:08:25.680
 Nice, I like that. But, you know, with cars, the headlights are all, there's some variation,

2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:31.280
 there's, but they're somewhat similar. So you can make those kinds of conclusions. What,

2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:38.720
 how much variation is there between supernova that you can, can you detect them?

2:08:38.720 --> 2:08:42.480
 Right. So first of all, there are several different ways that stars can explode,

2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:46.400
 and it depends on their mass and whether they're in a binary system and things like that.

2:08:47.200 --> 2:08:52.720
 And the ones that we used for these cosmological purposes, studying the expansion of the history

2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:59.760
 of the universe are the so called type Roman numeral one lowercase a type one a supernovae.

2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:06.400
 They come from a weird type of a star called a white dwarf. Our own son will turn into a white

2:09:06.400 --> 2:09:13.440
 dwarf in about seven billion years. It'll have about half its present mass compressed into a volume,

2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:18.960
 just the size of earth. So that's an inordinate density. Okay, it's incredibly dense. And the

2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:23.920
 matter is what's called by quantum physicists degenerate matter, not because it's morally

2:09:23.920 --> 2:09:28.880
 reprehensible or anything like that. But this is just the main judgments here quantum physicists

2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:34.800
 give to electrons that are squeezed into a very tight space, the electrons take on a motion

2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:39.200
 due to Heisenberg uncertain Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and also due to the

2:09:39.200 --> 2:09:44.080
 Pauli exclusion principle that electrons don't like to be in the same place, they like to avoid

2:09:44.080 --> 2:09:49.040
 each other. So those two things mean that a lot of electrons are moving very rapidly,

2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:54.240
 which gives the star an extra pressure far above the thermal pressure associated with

2:09:54.240 --> 2:10:00.960
 just the random motions of particles inside the star. So it's a weird type of star, but normally

2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:07.680
 it wouldn't explode and our sun won't explode, except that if such a white dwarf is in a pair

2:10:07.680 --> 2:10:14.880
 with another more or less normal star, it can steal material from that normal star until it

2:10:14.880 --> 2:10:22.160
 gets to an unstable limit, roughly one and a half times the mass of our sun, 1.4 or so.

2:10:22.160 --> 2:10:29.040
 This is known as the Chandrasekhar limit after Subramanyan Chandrasekhar, an Indian astrophysicist

2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:34.880
 who figured this out when he was about 20 years old on a voyage from India to England,

2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:40.640
 where he was to be educated. And then he did this. And then 50 years later, he won the Nobel Prize

2:10:40.640 --> 2:10:45.680
 in physics in 1984, largely for this work. Okay, then he did as a youngster who was

2:10:45.680 --> 2:10:52.960
 on his way to be educated. Oh, and his advisor, the great Arthur Eddington in England,

2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:56.800
 who had done a lot of great things and was a great astrophysicist. Nevertheless,

2:10:56.800 --> 2:11:03.760
 he too was human and had his faults. He ridiculed Chandrasekhar's scientific work

2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:08.800
 at a conference in England. And most of us, if we had been Chandrasekhar, would have just

2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:15.840
 given up astrophysics at that time when the great Arthur Eddington ridicules our work.

2:11:16.560 --> 2:11:20.480
 That's another inspirational story for the youngster. Just keep going.

2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:22.720
 I can ignore your advisors.

2:11:22.720 --> 2:11:27.680
 Yeah, no matter what your advisor says, right? Or don't always pay attention to your advisor,

2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:32.960
 right? Don't lose hope if you really think you're onto something. That doesn't mean

2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:37.120
 never listen to your advisor. They may have sage advice as well. But anyway,

2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:44.400
 when a white dwarf grows to a certain mass, it becomes unstable. And one of the ways it

2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:51.840
 can end its life is to go through a thermonuclear runaway. So basically, the carbon nuclei inside

2:11:51.840 --> 2:11:58.480
 the white dwarf start fusing together to form heavier nuclei. And the energy that those fusion

2:11:58.480 --> 2:12:11.520
 reactions emit doesn't go into being dissipated out of the star or whatever, or expanding it the way

2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:16.480
 if you take a blowtorch through the middle of the sun, you heat up its gases, the gases would expand

2:12:16.480 --> 2:12:23.760
 and cool. But this degenerate star can't expand and cool. And so the energy pumped in through

2:12:23.760 --> 2:12:30.240
 these fusion reactions goes into making the nuclei move faster, and that gets more of them

2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:35.760
 sufficiently close together that they can undergo nuclear fusion, thereby releasing more energy that

2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:44.080
 goes into speeding up more nuclei. And thus you have a runaway, a bomb, an uncontrolled fusion

2:12:44.080 --> 2:12:48.800
 reactor, right? Instead of the controlled fusion, which is what our sun does, okay, our sun is a

2:12:48.800 --> 2:12:54.320
 marvelous controlled fusion reactor. This is what we need here on Earth, fusion energy to solve our

2:12:54.320 --> 2:12:59.360
 energy crisis, right? But the sun holds the stuff in, you know, through gravity, and you need a big

2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:06.400
 mass to do that. So this uncontrolled fusion reaction blows up a star that's pretty much the

2:13:06.400 --> 2:13:13.680
 same in all cases. And you measure it to be almost the same in all cases. But the devil is in the

2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:20.160
 details. And in fact, we observe them to not be all the same. And theoretically, they might not

2:13:20.160 --> 2:13:26.480
 be all the same because the rate of the fusion reactions might depend on the amount of trace

2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:31.040
 heavier elements in the white dwarf. And that could depend on how old it is when it was,

2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:34.880
 you know, whether it was born billions of years ago, when there weren't many heavier elements,

2:13:34.880 --> 2:13:40.640
 or whether it's a relatively young white dwarf and all kinds of other things. And part of my

2:13:40.640 --> 2:13:46.640
 work was to show that indeed, not all the type 1a's are the same, you have to be careful when you

2:13:46.640 --> 2:13:54.320
 use them, you have to calibrate them. They're not standard candles. The way it just, if all headlights

2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:59.440
 or all candles were the same lumens or whatever, you'd say they're standard and then it would be

2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:03.040
 relatively... The standard candles is an awesome term, okay. Standard candles is what astronomers

2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:07.760
 like to say, but I don't like that term because there aren't any standard candles, but there are

2:14:07.760 --> 2:14:14.320
 standardizable candles. And by looking at these type 1a, yeah, you calibrateable, standardizable,

2:14:14.320 --> 2:14:19.680
 calibrateable, you look at enough of them in nearby galaxies whose distances you know independently.

2:14:20.240 --> 2:14:24.960
 And what you can tell is that, you know, and this is something that a colleague of mine,

2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:30.080
 Mark Phillips, did who was on Schmidt's team and arguably one of the, was one of the people who

2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:35.200
 deserved the Nobel Prize, but he showed that the intrinsically more powerful type 1a's

2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:43.520
 decline in brightness, and it turns out rise in brightness as well, more slowly than the less

2:14:43.520 --> 2:14:49.760
 luminous 1a's. And so if you calibrate this by measuring a whole bunch of nearby ones,

2:14:49.760 --> 2:14:55.920
 and then you look at a distant one, instead of saying, well, it's a 100 watt type 1a supernova,

2:14:55.920 --> 2:15:02.480
 they're much more powerful than that, by the way, plus or minus 50, you can say, no, it's 112

2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:12.400
 plus or minus 15, or it's 84 plus or minus 17. It tells you where it is in the power scale,

2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:17.440
 and it greatly decreases the uncertainties. And that's what makes these things cosmologically

2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:24.080
 useful. I showed that if you spread the light out into a spectrum, you can tell spectroscopically

2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:30.400
 that these things are different as well. And in 1991, I happened to study two of the

2:15:30.400 --> 2:15:40.400
 extreme peculiar ones, the low luminosity ones and the high luminosity ones, 1991 BG and 1991 T.

2:15:40.400 --> 2:15:46.960
 This showed that not all the 1a's are the same. And indeed, at the time of 1991, I was a little

2:15:46.960 --> 2:15:52.880
 bit skeptical that we could use type 1a's because of this diversity that I was observing.

2:15:52.880 --> 2:16:00.400
 But in 1993, Mark Phillips wrote a paper that showed this correlation between the light curve,

2:16:00.400 --> 2:16:05.600
 the brightness versus time, and the peak luminosity. And once you get enough information to calibrate,

2:16:05.600 --> 2:16:09.840
 yeah, then they become calibratable. And that was a game changer. How many type 1a's are out there

2:16:11.120 --> 2:16:17.200
 to use for data? Now there are thousands of them. But at the time, the high Z team had 16,

2:16:17.200 --> 2:16:25.680
 and the Supernova Cosmology project had 40. But the 16 were better measured than the 40.

2:16:25.680 --> 2:16:30.880
 And so our statistical uncertainties were comparable if you look at the two papers

2:16:30.880 --> 2:16:35.600
 that were published. Does that make you feel that there's these gigantic

2:16:35.600 --> 2:16:41.520
 explosions just sprinkled out there? Well, I certainly don't want one to be very nearby.

2:16:41.520 --> 2:16:46.240
 And it would have to be within something like 10 light years to be an existential threat.

2:16:46.240 --> 2:16:55.600
 So they can happen in our galaxy? In most cases, we'd be okay because our galaxy is 100,000 light

2:16:55.600 --> 2:17:00.720
 years across. And you'd need one of these things to be within about 10 light years to be an

2:17:00.720 --> 2:17:06.880
 existential threat. And it gives birth to a bunch of other stars, I guess.

2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:11.600
 Yeah, it gives birth to expanding gases that are chemically enriched. And those expanding gases

2:17:11.600 --> 2:17:18.560
 mixed with other chemically enriched expanding gases or primordial clouds of hydrogen and helium.

2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:26.320
 I mean, this is, in a sense, the greatest story ever told. I teach this introductory

2:17:26.320 --> 2:17:31.440
 astronomy course at Berkeley. And I tell them there's only five or six things that I want them

2:17:31.440 --> 2:17:35.840
 to really understand and remember. And I'm going to come to their deathbed, and I'm going to ask

2:17:35.840 --> 2:17:40.640
 them about this. And if they get it wrong, I will retroactively fail. And their whole career

2:17:40.640 --> 2:17:45.920
 will have been shot. That they don't know and observe a total solar eclipse. And yet they had

2:17:45.920 --> 2:17:50.880
 the opportunity to do so. I will retroactively fail them. But one of them is, you know, where did

2:17:50.880 --> 2:17:56.240
 we come from? Where did the elements in our DNA come from? The carbon in our cells, the oxygen

2:17:56.240 --> 2:18:02.160
 that we breathe, the calcium in our bones, the iron in our red blood cells, those elements,

2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:08.640
 the phosphorus in our DNA, they all came from stars, from nuclear reactions in stars.

2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:16.160
 And they were ejected into the cosmos. And in some cases like iron made during the explosions.

2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:23.040
 And those gases drifted out, mixed with other clouds, made a new star or a star cluster,

2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:31.600
 some of whose members then evolved and exploded, thus enriching the gases in the galaxy progressively

2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:36.560
 more with time. Until finally, four and a half billion years ago, from one of these

2:18:36.560 --> 2:18:43.360
 chemically enriched clouds, our solar system formed with a rocky earth like planet. And

2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:50.960
 somewhere somehow, these self replicating, evolving molecules, bacteria formed and evolved

2:18:51.520 --> 2:19:00.720
 through paramecia and amoebas and slugs and apes and us. And here we are, sentient beings

2:19:00.720 --> 2:19:07.440
 that can ask these questions about our very origins and with our intellect and with the

2:19:07.440 --> 2:19:16.720
 machines we make, come to a reasonable understanding of our origins. What a beautiful story. I mean,

2:19:17.440 --> 2:19:24.720
 if that does not put you at least in awe, if not in love with science and its power

2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:32.240
 of deduction, I don't know what will, right? It's one of the greatest stories. If not the greatest

2:19:32.240 --> 2:19:37.760
 story, obviously, that's personality dependent and all that. It's a subjective opinion, but

2:19:37.760 --> 2:19:43.440
 it's perhaps the greatest story ever told. I mean, you could link it to the Big Bang and go even

2:19:43.440 --> 2:19:49.760
 farther to make an even more complete story. But as a subset, that's even in some ways a

2:19:49.760 --> 2:19:54.800
 greater story than even the existence of the universe in some ways, because you could end up,

2:19:54.800 --> 2:20:00.400
 you could just imagine some really boring universe that never leads to sentient creatures such as

2:20:00.400 --> 2:20:08.320
 ourselves. And is this supernova usually the introduction to that story? So are they usually

2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:13.840
 the thing that launches the, is there other engines of creation? Well, the supernova is the

2:20:13.840 --> 2:20:19.360
 one, I mean, I touch upon the subject earlier in my course, in fact, right about now in my

2:20:19.360 --> 2:20:25.040
 lectures, because I talk about how our sun right now is fusing hydrogen to form helium nuclei.

2:20:25.040 --> 2:20:31.680
 And later, it'll form carbon and oxygen nuclei. But that's where the process will stop for our sun.

2:20:31.680 --> 2:20:36.080
 It's not massive enough. Some stars that are more massive can go somewhat beyond that.

2:20:36.880 --> 2:20:42.880
 So that's the beginning of this idea of the birth of the heavy elements, since they couldn't have

2:20:42.880 --> 2:20:48.240
 been born at the time of the Big Bang. Conditions of temperature and pressure weren't sufficient to

2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:54.160
 make any significant quantities of the heavier elements. And so that's the beginning. But then

2:20:54.160 --> 2:20:59.600
 you need some of these stars to explode, right? Because if those heavy elements remained forever

2:20:59.600 --> 2:21:07.040
 trapped in the cores of stars, then they would not be available for the production of new stars,

2:21:07.040 --> 2:21:14.160
 planets, and ultimately life. So indeed, the supernova, my main area of interest, plays a

2:21:14.160 --> 2:21:21.680
 leading role in this whole story. I saw that you got a chance to call Richard Feynman a mentor of

2:21:21.680 --> 2:21:28.240
 yours when you were at Caltech. Do you have any fond memories of Feynman, any lessons that stick

2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:35.760
 with you? Oh, yeah. He was quite a character and one of the deepest thinkers of all time, probably.

2:21:35.760 --> 2:21:43.200
 And at least in my life, the physicist who had the single most intuitive understanding of how

2:21:43.200 --> 2:21:51.360
 nature works, of anyone I've met. I learned a number of things from him. He was not my

2:21:51.360 --> 2:21:56.640
 thesis advisor. I worked with Wallace Sargent at Caltech on what are called active galaxies,

2:21:56.640 --> 2:22:01.360
 big black holes in the centers of galaxies that are accreting or swallowing material,

2:22:01.360 --> 2:22:08.240
 a little bit like the stuff of this year's Nobel Prize in Physics 2020. But Feynman I had for

2:22:08.240 --> 2:22:13.840
 two courses. One was general theory of relativity at the graduate level and one was applications

2:22:13.840 --> 2:22:21.760
 of quantum physics to all kinds of interesting things. And he had this very intuitive way

2:22:21.760 --> 2:22:32.560
 of looking at things that he tried to bring to his students. And he felt that if you can't explain

2:22:32.560 --> 2:22:41.200
 something in a reasonably simple way to a non scientist, or at least someone who is versed

2:22:41.200 --> 2:22:46.000
 a little bit with science, but is not a professional scientist, then you probably don't

2:22:46.000 --> 2:22:56.480
 understand it very well yourself, very thoroughly. So that in me made a desire to be able to explain

2:22:56.480 --> 2:23:01.440
 science to the general public. And I've often found that in explaining things, yeah, there's a

2:23:01.440 --> 2:23:05.360
 certain part that I didn't really understand myself. That's one reason I like to teach the

2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:10.560
 introductory courses to the lay public is that I sometimes find that my explanations are lacking

2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:17.360
 in my own mind. So he did that for me. If I could just pause for a second. You said he had one of

2:23:17.360 --> 2:23:23.520
 the most intuitive understandings of nature. What if you could break apart what intuitive means?

2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:30.880
 Like, is it on the philosophical level? No, sort of physical. How do you draw a mental picture

2:23:30.880 --> 2:23:36.400
 or a picture on paper of what's going on? And he's perhaps most famous in this regard for his

2:23:36.400 --> 2:23:42.320
 Feynman diagrams, which in what's called quantum electrodynamics, a quantum field theory of electricity

2:23:42.320 --> 2:23:47.920
 and magnetism, what you have are actually, you know, an exchange of photons between charged

2:23:47.920 --> 2:23:54.400
 particles. And they might even be virtual photons if the particles are at rest relative to one

2:23:54.400 --> 2:24:00.080
 another. And there are ways of doing calculations that are brute force that take pages on pages and

2:24:00.080 --> 2:24:05.920
 pages of calculations. And Julian Schwinger developed some of the mathematics for that and won

2:24:05.920 --> 2:24:11.040
 the Nobel Prize for it. But Feynman had these diagrams that he made. And he had a set of rules

2:24:11.040 --> 2:24:15.280
 of what to do at the vertex. He'd have two particles coming together and then a particle

2:24:15.280 --> 2:24:20.080
 going out and then two particles coming out again. And he'd have these rules associated when there

2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:24.080
 were vertices and when there were particles splitting off from one another and all that.

2:24:24.080 --> 2:24:28.560
 And it looked a little bit like a bunch of a hodgepodge at first. But to those who

2:24:29.280 --> 2:24:34.160
 learned the rules and understood them, he, you know, they saw that you could do these complex

2:24:34.160 --> 2:24:41.120
 calculations in a much simpler way. And indeed, in some ways, Freeman Dyson had an even better

2:24:41.120 --> 2:24:47.120
 knack for explaining really what quantum electrodynamics actually was. But I didn't know

2:24:47.120 --> 2:24:52.080
 Freeman Dyson. I knew Feynman. Maybe he did have a more intuitive view of the world than

2:24:52.080 --> 2:24:57.680
 Feynman did. But of the people I knew Feynman was the most intuitive, most sort of,

2:24:57.680 --> 2:25:04.400
 is there a picture? Is there a simple way you can understand this? And in the path that a

2:25:04.400 --> 2:25:10.080
 particle follows even, you know, you can figure out the, you can get the classical path, at least,

2:25:10.080 --> 2:25:13.760
 you know, for a baseball or something like that by using quantum physics if you want.

2:25:14.400 --> 2:25:20.800
 But, you know, in a sense, the baseball sniffs out all possible paths. It goes out to the Andromeda

2:25:20.800 --> 2:25:25.760
 Galaxy and then goes to the to the batter. But the probability of doing that is very,

2:25:25.760 --> 2:25:32.800
 very small because tiny little paths next door to any given path cancel out that path. And the

2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:39.280
 ones that all add together, they are the ones that are more likely to be followed. And this

2:25:39.280 --> 2:25:46.160
 actually ties in with Fermat's principle of least action and their ideas and optics that

2:25:46.160 --> 2:25:50.720
 go into this as well. And just sort of beautifully brings everything together. But

2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:56.000
 the particle sniffs out all possible paths. What a crazy idea. But if you do the mathematics

2:25:56.000 --> 2:26:02.400
 associated with that, it ends up being actually useful, a useful way of looking at the world.

2:26:02.400 --> 2:26:09.280
 So you're also, I mean, you're widely acknowledged as, I mean, outside of your science work as being

2:26:09.280 --> 2:26:17.760
 one of the greatest educators in the world. And Feynman is famous for, for being that. Is there

2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:22.640
 something about being a teacher that you? Well, it's, it's very, very rewarding when you have

2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:28.320
 students who are really into it. And, you know, going back to Feynman at Caltech, I was taking

2:26:28.320 --> 2:26:34.080
 there were two of us, myself and Jeff Richmond, who's now a professor of physics at University

2:26:34.080 --> 2:26:40.160
 of California, Santa Barbara, who asked lots of questions. And a lot of the Caltech students

2:26:40.160 --> 2:26:45.600
 are nervous about asking questions. They want to save face. They seem to think that if they ask a

2:26:45.600 --> 2:26:51.040
 question, their peers might think it's a stupid question. Well, I didn't really care what people

2:26:51.040 --> 2:26:56.000
 thought and Jeff Richmond didn't either. And we ask all these questions. And in fact, in many cases,

2:26:56.000 --> 2:27:00.080
 they were quite good questions. And Feynman said, well, the rest of you should be having questions

2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:06.560
 like this. And I remember one time in particular, when he said, you know, he said to the rest of

2:27:06.560 --> 2:27:11.360
 the class, why is it always these two? Aren't you aren't the rest of you curious about what I'm

2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:17.200
 saying? Do you really understand it all that well? If so, why aren't you asking the next most logical

2:27:17.200 --> 2:27:23.120
 question? No, you guys are too scared to ask these questions that these two are asking.

2:27:23.120 --> 2:27:29.680
 So he actually invited us to lunch a couple of times where just the three of us sat and had lunch

2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:35.680
 with one of the greatest thinkers of 20th century physics. And so, yeah, he rubbed off on me.

2:27:35.680 --> 2:27:39.280
 And you encourage questions as well. I encourage questions, you know, and

2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:46.880
 yeah, definitely. I mean, you know, I encourage questions. I like it when students ask questions.

2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:52.400
 I tell them that they shouldn't feel shy about asking a question. Probably half the students

2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:57.040
 in the class would have that same question if they even understood the material enough to

2:27:57.040 --> 2:28:04.720
 ask that question. Yeah. Curiosity is the first step of seeing the beauty of something. So,

2:28:04.720 --> 2:28:12.480
 yeah, and the question is the ultimate form of curiosity. Let me ask, what is the meaning of

2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:18.160
 life? The meaning of life, you know, from a cosmologist's perspective or from a human

2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:25.280
 perspective. Or from my personal, you know, life is what you make of it, really, right? Each of

2:28:25.280 --> 2:28:33.360
 us has to have our own meaning. And it doesn't have to be, well, I think that in many cases,

2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:38.880
 meaning is to some degree associated with goals. You set some goals or expectations for yourself,

2:28:38.880 --> 2:28:44.560
 things you want to accomplish, things you want to do, things you want to experience. And to the

2:28:44.560 --> 2:28:51.120
 degree that you experience those and do those things, it can give you meaning. You don't have

2:28:51.120 --> 2:28:57.440
 to change the world the way Newton or Michelangelo or Da Vinci did. I mean, people often say,

2:28:57.440 --> 2:29:02.000
 you changed the world. But look, come on, there's seven and a half, close to eight billion of us

2:29:02.000 --> 2:29:06.000
 now. Most of us are not going to change the world. And does that mean that most of us are

2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:12.320
 leading meaningful lives? No. It just has to be something that gives you meaning,

2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:18.320
 that gives you satisfaction, that gives you a good feeling about what you did. And often,

2:29:19.440 --> 2:29:25.920
 based on human nature, which can be very good and also very bad, but often it's the things that help

2:29:25.920 --> 2:29:33.440
 others that give us meaning and a feeling of satisfaction. You taught someone to read.

2:29:33.440 --> 2:29:39.200
 You cared for someone who was terminally ill. You brought up a nice family. You brought up

2:29:39.200 --> 2:29:46.880
 your kids. You did a good job. You put your heart and soul into it. You read a lot of books,

2:29:46.880 --> 2:29:52.240
 if that's what you wanted to do, had a lot of perspectives on life. You traveled the world,

2:29:52.240 --> 2:29:56.720
 if that's what you wanted to do. But if some of these things are not within reach,

2:29:57.520 --> 2:30:02.080
 you're in a socioeconomic position where you can't travel the world or whatever,

2:30:02.080 --> 2:30:10.080
 or you find other forms of meaning. It doesn't have to be some profound,

2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:16.640
 I'm going to change the world. I'm going to be the one who everyone remembers type thing.

2:30:17.760 --> 2:30:22.000
 In the context of the greatest story ever told, the fact that we came from stars

2:30:25.840 --> 2:30:28.960
 and now we're two apes asking about the meaning of life,

2:30:28.960 --> 2:30:34.240
 how does that fit together? How does that make any sense?

2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:42.480
 It does. This is what I was referring to, that it's a beautiful universe that allows us

2:30:43.440 --> 2:30:51.280
 to come into creation. It's a way that the universe found of knowing, of understanding

2:30:51.280 --> 2:30:57.280
 itself, because I don't think that inanimate rocks and stars and black holes and things

2:30:57.280 --> 2:31:06.800
 have any real capability of abstract thoughts and of learning about the rest of the universe

2:31:06.800 --> 2:31:14.000
 or even their origins. I mean, they're just a pile of atoms that has no conscience,

2:31:14.000 --> 2:31:23.840
 has no ability to think, has no ability to explore. We do. I'm not saying we're the

2:31:23.840 --> 2:31:30.320
 epitome of all life forever, but at least for life on earth so far, the evidence suggests

2:31:30.320 --> 2:31:37.600
 that we are the epitome in terms of the richness of our thoughts, the degree to which we can explore

2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:44.720
 the universe, do experiments, build machines, understand our origins. I just hope that we

2:31:44.720 --> 2:31:50.720
 use science for good, not evil, and that we don't end up destroying ourselves. I mean,

2:31:50.720 --> 2:31:57.440
 the whales and dolphins are plenty intelligent. They don't ask abstract questions. They don't

2:31:57.440 --> 2:32:02.160
 read books, but on the other hand, they're not in any danger of destroying themselves and everything

2:32:02.160 --> 2:32:07.840
 else as well. Maybe that's a better form of intelligence, but at least in terms of our

2:32:07.840 --> 2:32:19.920
 ability to explore and make use of our minds. To me, it's this that gives me the potential

2:32:19.920 --> 2:32:23.920
 for meaning. The fact that I can understand and explore.

2:32:23.920 --> 2:32:27.200
 It's kind of fascinating to think that the universe created us,

2:32:30.240 --> 2:32:35.520
 and eventually we've built telescopes to look back at it, to look back at its origins,

2:32:35.520 --> 2:32:42.480
 and to wonder how the heck the thing works. It's magnificent. Needn't have been that way.

2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:51.360
 This is one of the multiverse sort of things. You can alter the laws of physics or even the

2:32:51.360 --> 2:32:56.640
 constants of nature, seemingly inconsequential things like the mass ratio of the proton and

2:32:56.640 --> 2:33:01.920
 the neutron. Wake me up when it's over. What could be more boring? But it turns out you play

2:33:01.920 --> 2:33:05.600
 with things a little bit like the ratio of the mass of the neutron to the proton,

2:33:05.600 --> 2:33:12.640
 and you generally get boring universes, only hydrogen or only helium or only iron. You don't

2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:20.000
 even get the rich periodic table, let alone bacteria, paramecia, slugs, and humans. I'm not

2:33:20.000 --> 2:33:28.400
 even anthropocentrizing this to the degree that I could. Even a rich periodic table wouldn't be

2:33:28.400 --> 2:33:36.880
 possible if certain constants weren't this way, but they are. That, to me, leads to the idea of

2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:41.760
 a multiverse, that the dice were thrown many, many times, and there's this cosmic archipelago

2:33:41.760 --> 2:33:47.440
 where most of the universes are boring, and some might be more interesting, but we're in the rare

2:33:47.440 --> 2:33:54.320
 breed that's really quite darn interesting. If there were only one, and maybe there is only one,

2:33:54.320 --> 2:33:59.440
 well then that's truly amazing. We're lucky. We're lucky, but I actually think there are

2:33:59.440 --> 2:34:05.600
 lots and lots, just like there are lots of planets. Earth isn't special for any particular reason.

2:34:05.600 --> 2:34:09.520
 There are lots of planets in our solar system, and especially around other stars,

2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:14.560
 and occasionally there are going to be ones that are conducive to the development of complexity,

2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:18.880
 culminating in life as we know it, and that's a beautiful story.

2:34:19.600 --> 2:34:23.600
 I don't think there's a better way to end it. Alex is a huge honor. One of my favorite
