 The following is a conversation with Manolis Kellis, his second time in the podcast.

00:05.120 --> 00:10.640
 He's a professor at MIT and head of the MIT Computational Biology Group. He's one of the

00:10.640 --> 00:16.320
 most brilliant, productive, and kind people I've had the fortune of talking to. A lot of my colleagues

00:16.320 --> 00:23.040
 at MIT and former MIT faculty and students wrote to me after our first conversation with some version

00:23.040 --> 00:30.720
 of, Manolis is awesome, isn't he? I'm glad you guys are now friends. I am too, and I'm happy that

00:30.720 --> 00:36.720
 he makes time in his insanely busy schedule to sit down and have a chat with me. Quick summary

00:36.720 --> 00:43.200

00:49.200 --> 00:55.040
 just got back from talking to Joe Rogan on his podcast my fifth time on there. I also got a chance

00:55.040 --> 01:01.360
 to record a separate conversation with Joe on this podcast. We talked on both quite a bit about his

01:01.360 --> 01:08.000
 journey and his advice for mine. One of the things that I think made his show special is that he just

01:08.000 --> 01:13.920
 had fun and made choices that didn't get in the way of him having fun and loving life. I'm learning

01:13.920 --> 01:20.320
 to do just that. It's tough since I'm naturally full of self doubt and anxiety, but I'm learning to

01:20.320 --> 01:28.720
 let go and have fun. Even if my monotone robotic voice sometimes sounds otherwise. For Joe, that

01:28.720 --> 01:33.840
 involved talking to his friends, comedians, especially ones that brought out the best in him.

01:34.480 --> 01:40.000
 Duncan Trussell in the five hour first episode on Spotify comes to mind is an example of that.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.960
 Duncan has been a guest probably close to if not more than 50 times on Joe's podcast. My hope

01:46.960 --> 01:53.920
 with amazing people like Minolis is to find my Duncan Trussell, my Joey Diaz, and yes, even my

01:53.920 --> 02:00.640
 Eddie Bravo. Obviously Joe and I are very different people, but ultimately both love life when we can

02:00.640 --> 02:07.600
 interact often with people we love and who inspire us. Make us smile, make us think, and make us have

02:07.600 --> 02:13.360
 fun when we get behind the mic of a podcast, whether anyone is listening or not. If you enjoy

03:09.200 --> 03:15.600
 to be just clean, elegant, and beautiful. It goes nicely, at least I think so, with the design of

03:15.600 --> 03:22.480
 Crew Dragon and the recent SpaceX NASA mission that sent two humans into space. To me, very few

03:22.480 --> 03:28.400
 things are as inspiring as us humans reaching out into the unknown, the harsh challenges of space.

03:29.280 --> 03:33.760
 Colonizing Mars may not have obvious near term benefits, but I believe it will challenge

03:33.760 --> 03:39.280
 our scientists and our engineers to create technologies whose impact will be immeasurable

03:39.280 --> 03:45.520
 for us humans here on Earth, or those of us who choose to stay here on Earth. Personally, I'm kind

03:45.520 --> 03:54.720

 these days. So Magic Spoon is a delicious healthy treat on a hard workout day that fits into that

04:15.760 --> 04:23.360
 crazy diet. Also, they're a sponsor of episode 100 with my dad and got my dad to buy the cereal

04:23.360 --> 04:29.600
 and he now loves it. Honestly, just loves it. It's kind of funny, actually, the deep heartfelt

04:29.600 --> 04:36.320
 nature of that conversation and the silliness of the cereal captures my dad perfectly. Much of the

04:36.320 --> 04:42.720
 hardship in his life he dealt with using wit and humor. His favorite flavor happens to be cocoa.

04:42.720 --> 04:49.200
 Mine is too. He hasn't bought the eight sleep mattress yet, though my mom wants to,

04:49.200 --> 04:53.600
 but he's all about this magic spoon cereal. I think it's his actually favorite sponsor of this

04:53.600 --> 05:00.080

 By way of life advice, let me tell you that you need a VPN to protect you from Russians like me.

05:40.720 --> 05:46.560
 In fact, this podcast is a kind of hack of your biological network where I use my monotone,

05:46.560 --> 05:52.240
 low energy voice to convince you to buy a kind of expensive cereal as a way to influence the

05:52.240 --> 05:59.680
 stability of the US economy. I use ExpressVPN on both windows and Linux to protect myself if I

 support this podcast. And now here's my conversation with Manolis Kellis. What is beautiful about the

06:22.320 --> 06:30.480
 human epigenome? Don't get me started. So first of all, as an engineering feat, the human epigenome

06:30.480 --> 06:38.480
 manages the most compact, the most incredible compaction you could imagine. So every single one

06:38.480 --> 06:45.520
 of your cells contains two meters worth of DNA. And this is compacted in a radius which is one

06:45.520 --> 06:51.600
 thousandth of a millimeter. That's six orders of magnitude. To give you a sense of scale,

06:52.240 --> 06:58.880
 it's as if a string as tall as the Burj Al Khalifa, which is about a kilometer tall,

06:59.520 --> 07:02.640
 was compacted into a tiny little ball the size of a millimeter.

07:02.640 --> 07:11.440
 And if you put it all together, if you stretch the trillions of cells that we have, we have about

07:11.440 --> 07:16.080
 30 trillion cells in your body. If you stretch the DNA, the two meters worth of DNA in every

07:16.080 --> 07:21.680
 one of your trillion cells, you would basically reach all the way to Jupiter

07:24.640 --> 07:30.800
 a hundred times. Yeah, it's all curled up in there. It's 30 trillion cells.

07:30.800 --> 07:37.200
 30 trillion cells. Every one of them two meters worth of DNA. So all of that is compacted through

07:37.200 --> 07:44.160
 the epigenome. The epigenome basically has the ability to compact this massive amount of DNA

07:44.160 --> 07:49.520
 from here to Jupiter 10 times into one human body, into just the nuclei of one human body,

07:49.520 --> 07:54.640
 and the vast majority of human bodies not even need these nuclei. And that's sort of the structural

07:54.640 --> 07:59.120
 part. So that's the boring part. That's the structural part. The functional part is way

07:59.120 --> 08:06.080
 more interesting. So functionally, what the human epigenome allows you to do is basically control

08:06.800 --> 08:13.840
 the activity patterns of thousands of genes. So 20,000 genes in your human body, every one of

08:13.840 --> 08:18.400
 your cells only needs a few thousand of those, but a different few thousand of those. And the

08:18.400 --> 08:25.920
 way that your cells remember what their identity is, is basically driven by the epigenome. So the

08:25.920 --> 08:31.280
 epigenome is both structural instead of making this dramatic compaction. And it's also functional

08:31.840 --> 08:36.000
 in being able to actually control the activity patterns of all your cells.

08:36.880 --> 08:42.960
 Now, can we draw a definition distinction between the genome and the epigenome?

08:43.600 --> 08:52.240
 Again, being Greek, epi means on top of. So the genome is the DNA. And the epigenome is

08:52.240 --> 08:57.520
 anything on top of the DNA. And there's, you know, three types of things on top of the DNA.

08:57.520 --> 09:02.800
 The first is chemical modifications on the DNA itself. So we like to think of four bases of

09:02.800 --> 09:10.000
 the DNA, ACGT. C has a methyl form, which is sometimes referred to as the fifth base. So methyl

09:10.000 --> 09:18.240
 C takes a different meaning. So in the same way that you have annotations in an orchestra score

09:18.240 --> 09:22.960
 that basically say whether you should play something softly or loudly or space it out or,

09:22.960 --> 09:30.960
 you know, interpret basically the score, the human epigenome allows you to modify that primary score.

09:30.960 --> 09:37.840
 So a modified C basically says, play this one softly. It's basically a sign of repression

09:37.840 --> 09:45.280
 in a gene regulatory region. I love how you're talking about the function that emerges from the

09:45.280 --> 09:52.560
 epigenome as a musical score. It is in many ways. And every single cell plays a different part of

09:52.560 --> 09:57.920
 that score. It's like having all of human knowledge in 23 volumes, like 23 giant books,

09:57.920 --> 10:03.440
 which are your chromosomes. And every single cell has a different profession, a different role.

10:03.440 --> 10:09.120
 Some cells play the piano, and they're looking at chapters seven from chromosome 23 and chapters

10:09.120 --> 10:16.240
 four from chromosome two and so on and so forth. And each of those pieces are all encoding

10:16.240 --> 10:23.440
 in the same DNA. But what the epigenome allows you to do is effectively conduct the orchestra

10:23.440 --> 10:27.920
 and sort of coordinate the pieces so that every instrument plays only the things that it needs

10:27.920 --> 10:34.080
 to play. One thing that kind of blows my mind, maybe you can tell me your thoughts about it is

10:34.080 --> 10:42.080
 the way evolution works with natural selection is based on the final sort of the entirety of the

10:42.080 --> 10:52.160
 orchestra musical performance, right? And then but there's these incredibly rich structural things,

10:52.160 --> 10:57.360
 like each one of them doing their own little job that somehow work to get like the evolution

10:57.360 --> 11:03.440
 selects based on the final result. And yet all the individual pieces are doing like infinitely

11:03.440 --> 11:09.760
 minuscule specific things. How the heck does that work? It's a very good insight. And you can even

11:09.760 --> 11:14.800
 go beyond that and basically say evolution doesn't select at the level of an organism,

11:14.800 --> 11:19.520
 it actually selects at the level of whole environments, whole ecosystems. So let me

11:19.520 --> 11:26.720
 break this down. So you basically have at the very bottom, every single nucleotide being selected.

11:26.720 --> 11:34.640
 But then that nucleotide function is selected at the level of, you know, each gene. And every,

11:34.640 --> 11:39.680
 not even each gene, each gene regulatory control element. And then those control elements are

11:39.680 --> 11:44.480
 basically converging onto the function of the gene. And many genes are converging onto the

11:44.480 --> 11:50.720
 function of one cell. And many cells are converging into the function of one tissue or organ. And

11:50.720 --> 11:56.480
 all of these organs are converging onto the level of an organism. But now that organism is not in

11:56.480 --> 12:03.360
 isolation. So if you basically think about why is altruism, for example, a thing? Why are people

12:03.360 --> 12:09.120
 being nice to each other? It was probably selected. And it was probably selected because

12:09.920 --> 12:16.080
 those species that were just nasty to each other didn't survive as a species. And now if you think

12:16.080 --> 12:25.920
 about symbiosis of, you know, there's plants, for example, that love CO2. And there's humans that

12:25.920 --> 12:34.960
 love O2. And we're sort of, you know, trading different types of gases to each other. If you

12:34.960 --> 12:44.080
 look at ecosystems, where one organism was just really nasty, that organism actually died. Because

12:44.080 --> 12:52.400
 everyone they were being nasty to was killed off. And then that kind of, you know, universe of life

12:52.400 --> 13:00.400
 is gone. So basically what emerges is selection at so many different layers of benefit,

13:01.440 --> 13:05.040
 including, you know, all of these nucleotides within a body,

13:05.760 --> 13:09.760
 interacting for the emergent functions at the body level.

13:09.760 --> 13:14.240
 Yeah, I wonder if it's possible to break it down into levels that's selection,

13:14.880 --> 13:19.840
 even beyond humans, like you said, environment, but there's environments at all different levels too,

13:19.840 --> 13:24.640
 right? At the minuscule, at the organ level, at the tissue level, like you said,

13:24.640 --> 13:30.560
 maybe at the microscopic level. It'd be fascinating if like, there's a kind of selection going on,

13:30.560 --> 13:38.080
 like both the quantum level and like the galaxy level. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So all different forms.

13:38.080 --> 13:41.280
 Yeah, let's again, sort of break down these different layers. So basically, if you think

13:41.280 --> 13:46.800
 about the environment in which a gene operates, that gene, of course, the first definition of

13:46.800 --> 13:53.040
 environment that we think of is pollution or sunlight or heat or cold and so on and so forth.

13:53.040 --> 13:57.840
 That's the external environment. But every gene also operates at the level of the internal cellular

13:57.840 --> 14:03.040
 environment that it's in. If I take a gene from, say, an African individual, and I put it in a

14:03.040 --> 14:10.400
 European context, will it perform the same way? Probably not, because there's a cellular context

14:10.400 --> 14:16.800
 of thousands of other genes that that gene has co evolved with, you know, in the out of Africa event

14:16.800 --> 14:24.000
 and, you know, all of this sort of human history of evolution. So basically, if you look at neanderthal

14:24.000 --> 14:31.440
 genes, for example, which again happened long after that out of Africa event, there's incompatibilities

14:31.440 --> 14:38.240
 between neanderthal genes and modern human genes that can lead to diseases. So in the context of

14:38.240 --> 14:43.600
 the neanderthal genome, that gene version, that allele was fine. But in the context of the modern

14:43.600 --> 14:49.440
 human genome, that neanderthal gene version is actually detrimental. So it's, you know, that

14:49.440 --> 14:56.240
 cellular environment constitutes the genetics of that gene, but also, of course, all of the epigenomics

14:56.240 --> 15:01.840
 of that gene. It's fascinating that the gene has a history. I mean, we talked about this a little

15:01.840 --> 15:08.480
 bit last time, but just and then some of your research goes into that. But the genes as they are

15:08.480 --> 15:17.600
 today have have a story from the beginning of time. And then sometimes their story was like

15:17.600 --> 15:22.320
 their path was useful for survival for the particular organisms and sometimes not.

15:23.120 --> 15:29.280
 That's fascinating. Let me ask, as a tangent, we kind of started talking offline about neanderthals.

15:29.280 --> 15:35.040
 Do you have something interesting genetically, biologically, in terms of difference between

15:35.920 --> 15:42.560
 neanderthal and like the different branches of human evolution that you find fascinating?

15:42.560 --> 15:47.600
 Neanderthals are only one of about five branches that we are pretty confident about.

15:48.480 --> 15:54.480
 One branch of out of Africa events. So basically, there's neanderthals. There's

15:54.480 --> 16:03.520
 denisovans. What is the evidence for denisovans? One tiny little fragment of one pinky from one cave

16:04.320 --> 16:09.040
 in Siberia. Recent, relatively recently discovered, right? Less than 10 years ago.

16:09.040 --> 16:13.440
 Yeah. And those are like little folks, right? No, no, no, no. That's yet another one,

16:13.440 --> 16:18.000
 though. Homo fluorescence. It had the little folks in sort of Indonesia. But then

16:18.640 --> 16:24.240
 denisovans are basically another branch that we only know about genetically from that one bone

16:24.240 --> 16:28.640
 and eventually we realize that it's one of the three major branches, along with neanderthal,

16:28.640 --> 16:34.560
 modern human, and denisovan. And then that one branch has now resurfaced in many different areas,

16:34.560 --> 16:39.600
 and we kind of know about the gene flow that happened in between them. So when I was reading

16:39.600 --> 16:47.680
 my Greek mythology, it was talking about the age of the heroes, these eras of human like precursors

16:47.680 --> 16:51.440
 that were wiped out by Zeus or by all kinds of wars and so on and so forth,

16:51.440 --> 16:57.760
 like the Titans and the, you know, it's ridiculous to sort of read these stories as a kid because

16:57.760 --> 17:02.960
 you're like, oh yeah, whatever. And then you're growing up and you're like, whoa, layers and layers

17:02.960 --> 17:08.640
 of human like ancestors. And who knows if those stories were inspired by bones that they found

17:08.640 --> 17:13.760
 that kind of looked human like, but were not quite human like? Who knows if stories of dragons

17:13.760 --> 17:18.960
 were inspired by bones of dinosaurs? Basically, this archaeological evidence has been there

17:18.960 --> 17:26.160
 and has probably entered the folk imagination, migrated into their stories, but it's not that far

17:26.160 --> 17:34.320
 removed from what actually happened of massive wars of wiping out neanderthals as modern humans

17:34.320 --> 17:41.280
 are populating Europe. Do you think we'll kill the neanderthals and all those other branches

17:41.280 --> 17:49.440
 is human conflict or is it genetic conflict? So is it us humans being the opposite of altruistic

17:49.440 --> 17:57.840
 towards each other? Or is it some other competition at some other level, like as we're discussing?

17:57.840 --> 18:02.800
 Yeah, so if you look at a lot of human traits today, they're probably not that far removed

18:02.800 --> 18:07.920
 from the human traits that got us where we are now. So, you know, this whole tribalism,

18:07.920 --> 18:16.320
 you know, you're my sports team or you're my political party or you're my tiny little village

18:16.880 --> 18:21.520
 and therefore, you know, if you're from that other village, I hate you, but as soon as we're both

18:22.240 --> 18:27.200
 in the major city, I can't believe we're from the same region, my friend, come here, my family.

18:27.760 --> 18:30.880
 And like two neighboring countries fighting and as soon as they're off in another country,

18:30.880 --> 18:35.840
 you're like, oh, I can't believe that. So it's kind of funny, like this tribalism

18:35.840 --> 18:42.400
 is nonsensical in many ways. It's like cognitive incongruent that basically we like kin and

18:42.960 --> 18:49.120
 selection for sort of liking kin is hugely advantageous genetically.

18:49.120 --> 18:52.400
 Probably across all kinds of organ, across all kinds of life.

18:52.400 --> 19:00.800
 Yeah. So basically, if you now transport that to the sort of humans arriving in Europe and

19:00.800 --> 19:04.240
 Neanderthals are everywhere, what are you going to do? You're going to kill them off.

19:04.240 --> 19:10.000
 You know, there's this battle for territory and this battle for they're not like us. We have to

19:10.000 --> 19:14.960
 get rid of them. So basically, there's a, you know, very interesting mix there. But and yet,

19:14.960 --> 19:19.680
 and yet when you look at the genetics, there's tons of gene flow between them.

19:20.240 --> 19:28.960
 So basically, you know, love romance between, you know, new tribes, but love spans the gap

19:28.960 --> 19:32.880
 between the different tribes. It's Romeo and Juliet across species boundaries.

19:32.880 --> 19:36.320
 Sneaks away from the village to hang out with the geniuses.

19:36.320 --> 19:41.040
 Even before the out of Africa, there's, you know, within Africa selection,

19:41.040 --> 19:48.240
 which was probably massive battles of larger and larger tribes selecting for our social

19:48.240 --> 19:55.440
 networking and savviness and, you know, probably all our conspiracy theory genes are, you know,

19:55.440 --> 20:02.640
 dating back from then. And, you know, so there's a lot of this mischievousness in the history of

20:02.640 --> 20:08.400
 human evolution that unfortunately is still present in, you know, many ugly forms today,

20:09.200 --> 20:14.640
 but probably contributed to our success as a species in wiping out other species.

20:14.640 --> 20:21.680
 It just sucks that we don't have neighboring species that are, you know, intelligent like us,

20:23.120 --> 20:30.960
 that but yet very different than us. So we have like, you know, dogs or wolves, I guess, co evolved.

20:30.960 --> 20:37.840
 They figured out how to neighbor up with humans in a friendly way and collaborate,

20:37.840 --> 20:42.160
 and it developed in time. You're describing this as if the wolves made a choice.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.920
 It's possible that the wolves never had a say that basically humans were just so

20:48.480 --> 20:54.160
 overpowering that they had captive wolves. And then at every generation killed off eight of the

20:54.160 --> 20:59.600
 nine pups and only kept the one that was milder. And it only takes a few generations to then sort

20:59.600 --> 21:04.960
 of have pups that are really mild. And so the Neanderthals weren't useful

21:06.320 --> 21:10.000
 in the same way that wolves were. I don't know if it's a question of useful. They were probably

21:10.000 --> 21:16.960
 super useful. My thinking is that they were scary, that basically something that almost

21:16.960 --> 21:23.840
 resembles you is something that you try to eliminate first. It's too close. Yeah. And speaking of,

21:23.840 --> 21:31.520
 you know, species that are intelligent and sort of what's left of evolution. It is a shame exactly

21:31.520 --> 21:38.240
 like you say that so many different amazing life forms were extinct. And the kind of boring ones

21:38.240 --> 21:45.920
 remained. So if you look at dinosaurs, I mean, the diversity that they had, if you look at sub,

21:45.920 --> 21:53.520
 you know, like, there's just so many different lineages of life that were just abruptly killed.

21:54.160 --> 22:00.160
 And yet out of that death emerged, you know, many new kinds of really awesome lineages.

22:00.160 --> 22:06.480
 Do you think there was in the history of life on earth species that may be still alive today

22:06.480 --> 22:09.360
 that are more intelligent than humans? And we just don't know.

22:09.360 --> 22:13.680
 So there's basically made for dolphins. Like if you look at their brains, if you look at the way

22:13.680 --> 22:18.320
 that they play, if you look at the way that they learn, you know, I mean, they don't have

22:18.320 --> 22:22.000
 a possible thumbs and we do. So, you know, that probably made a big difference.

22:22.000 --> 22:25.840
 It's terrifying to think that like, not terrifying, I don't know how to feel about it,

22:25.840 --> 22:29.360
 that they're more intelligent than us. It's like the hikers got.

22:30.000 --> 22:35.440
 I know. But how do you define intelligence? Basically, like I was saying last time, you know,

22:35.440 --> 22:41.200
 stupid is a stupid does and smart is a smart does. So if the dolphins are basically super

22:41.200 --> 22:45.200
 smart, figure out the meaning of life and just go around playing with water all day,

22:45.200 --> 22:51.360
 which is probably the meaning of life, then we wouldn't know because all they're doing is kicking

22:51.360 --> 22:56.160
 water just like sharks are and sharks are probably pretty stupid. So, so basically,

22:56.160 --> 23:00.640
 it's very difficult to sort of judge a species intelligence unless they kind of go out of the

23:00.640 --> 23:07.760
 way to demonstrate it. Yeah. And that's instructive for our understanding of any kind of life form.

23:07.760 --> 23:13.840
 You know, I've recently talked to Sarah Seeger looking for life out there on other planets.

23:14.560 --> 23:21.840
 It'd be fascinating to think if we discover a habitable planet outside of Earth in one day,

23:21.840 --> 23:27.280
 maybe many centuries away, or be able to travel with like a robot there, how would we actually know

23:28.320 --> 23:33.440
 that this species would probably be able to detect that it's a living being,

23:33.440 --> 23:42.320
 but how would we know if it's an intelligent being? I mean, it's both exciting and terrifying to sort

23:42.320 --> 23:49.920
 of come face to face with a life form that's of another world. Like something that clearly is

23:49.920 --> 23:59.200
 moving in a, how would you say, like a deliberate way and to then like ask, well, how do I ask that

23:59.200 --> 24:06.000
 thing? Whether it's intelligent? No, but the question that you're asking is applicable to

24:06.000 --> 24:12.320
 every species on the Earth now. Yeah. So basically, dolphins are a great example. We know that they're

24:13.280 --> 24:20.800
 clearly capable hardware wise and behavior wise of intelligence. How do we communicate? So basically,

24:20.800 --> 24:23.680
 if your question is about crossing species boundaries of communication,

24:23.680 --> 24:32.880
 the way that I want to put it is that humans have achieved a level of sophistication

24:32.880 --> 24:38.240
 in our behaviors, in our communication, in our language, in our ways of expressing ourselves,

24:39.040 --> 24:44.720
 that I have no doubt that if we encounter the human like form of intelligence,

24:45.360 --> 24:50.400
 we'd figure out their language in a few weeks. Like it'd be just fine. As long as, you know,

24:50.400 --> 24:54.880
 of course, they're both trusting each other and not annihilating each other and not sort of

24:54.880 --> 25:00.400
 fearing each other and attacking each other. What about, let me ask, just out of curiosity,

25:00.400 --> 25:07.200
 into science fiction land a little bit. So clearly, you're one of the top scientists in the world. So

25:07.200 --> 25:14.800
 if we were to discover an alien life form, you would be brought in to study his genetics.

25:14.800 --> 25:21.600
 Do you think the epigenome that we talked about, the genome, the code, the digital code that

25:21.600 --> 25:29.360
 underlies that alien life form would be similar to ours? Like in fundamental ways, maybe not

25:29.360 --> 25:34.240
 exactly, but in fundamental ways of how it's structured? Yeah. So you're getting to the

25:34.240 --> 25:39.600
 very definition of life. You're getting to the very definition of what makes life life and

25:39.600 --> 25:46.880
 how do we decode that life? And it's so easy to think that every life form would basically have to,

25:46.880 --> 25:54.720
 you know, like oxygen, have to like heat from the sun and rely on sort of being the habitable zone

25:54.720 --> 26:01.360
 of, you know, its solar system and so on and so forth. But I think we have to sort of go beyond

26:01.360 --> 26:07.360
 this sort of, oh, life on another planet must be exactly like life is on Earth. Because of course,

26:07.360 --> 26:13.360
 life on Earth happens to rely on the proximity to the sun and benefit from that amount of energy.

26:13.920 --> 26:21.840
 But we're talking at timescales of human life, where we kind of live, I don't know, between,

26:22.400 --> 26:27.360
 and I'm going to be super white here, we're going to live between six Earth months and,

26:27.360 --> 26:34.320
 you know, 200 Earth months or 200 Earth years. So basically, if you look at the timescale

26:34.320 --> 26:39.280
 that we inhabit on Earth, it is very much dictated by the amount of energy that we receive from the

26:39.280 --> 26:46.240
 sun. If you look at, I don't know, Europa, you know, the smallest, the fourth smallest moon of

26:46.240 --> 26:52.000
 Jupiter, the smallest of the Galilean moons and also the smallest in its distance from Jupiter.

26:54.240 --> 27:03.040
 It has an iron core. It has a rock exterior. It has ice all around it. And it has probably

27:03.040 --> 27:11.680
 massive liquid oceans underneath. And the gravitational pull of Jupiter is probably

27:11.680 --> 27:20.000
 creating all kinds of movement under that ice. How did life evolve on Earth? Yes, sure, life now,

27:20.800 --> 27:28.640
 most of life that we above the surface look at, has to do with exploiting the solar energy

27:28.640 --> 27:33.680
 for, you know, our daily behavior. But that's not the case everywhere on the planet.

27:34.320 --> 27:40.160
 If you look at the bottom of the ocean, there are hydrothermal vents. There's both black smokers

27:40.160 --> 27:47.040
 and white smokers. And they are near these volcanic, you know, ducts that basically

27:47.760 --> 27:54.480
 emanate a massive amount of energy from the core of our planet. What does life need? It needs energy.

27:54.480 --> 28:00.720
 Does it need energy from the sun? It couldn't care less. Does it need energy from, you know,

28:00.720 --> 28:07.200
 the Earth itself? Yeah, possibly. It could use that. And if you look at how did life evolve on,

28:07.840 --> 28:12.960
 you know, on Earth, there are many theories. I mean, a kind of silly theory is that it came

28:12.960 --> 28:16.960
 from outer space. That basically, there's a meteorite out there that sort of landed on Earth and

28:16.960 --> 28:21.280
 it brought with it DNA material. I think it's a little silly because it kind of pushes the buck

28:21.280 --> 28:26.720
 down the road. Basically, the next question is how did it evolve over there? Whereas our planet

28:26.720 --> 28:30.240
 has basically all of the right ingredients, why wouldn't evolve here? So basically, let's kind

28:30.240 --> 28:34.560
 of ignore that one. And now that the two other competing hypotheses are from the outside in

28:34.560 --> 28:39.120
 or from the inside out. What's that mean? From the outside in means from the surface to the bottom

28:39.120 --> 28:43.840
 of the ocean. From the inside out means from the bottom of the ocean to the surface.

28:43.840 --> 28:55.680
 So life on the surface is pretty brutal. Life obviously evolved in the water. And then there

28:55.680 --> 29:02.960
 was an out of water event. But basically, before it exited, it was clearly in the water, which is

29:02.960 --> 29:08.960
 a much nicer and shielded environment. So just to be clear, on the surface, are you referring to

29:08.960 --> 29:16.240
 the surface of the sea or the bottom of the sea? Versus the bottom of the ocean. And you're saying

29:16.240 --> 29:26.320
 life on the surface is harsh. Life outside the water is horrible. It takes huge amounts of

29:26.320 --> 29:33.120
 evolutionary innovations to sustain living outside the water. That's so interesting. Why is that?

29:33.120 --> 29:39.760
 So it's easier to, life is easier in the water. Maybe, see, I'm telling you. We are 70% water.

29:39.760 --> 29:45.040
 No, dolphins went back into the water. Really? Because dolphins are mammoths. Of course.

29:45.040 --> 29:49.520
 Interesting. Well, again, they might be smarter. They went back. They're like, screw this.

29:49.520 --> 29:56.880
 So if you basically think about the fact that we are 70% water, we're basically

29:56.880 --> 30:05.680
 transporting the sea with us outside the sea. If we don't have water for about 24 hours,

30:05.680 --> 30:10.880
 we're dry. And if you look at life under the sea, I mean, I don't know if you're a diver,

30:10.880 --> 30:17.200
 but when you go diving, your brain explodes. Again, when I say the boring life forms is

30:17.200 --> 30:23.360
 what we see all the time, like tetrapods. I mean, what a stupid, boring body plan. Seriously.

30:23.360 --> 30:29.360
 Like, just go diving and you'll see that a tiny little minority of the stuff under the sea,

30:29.360 --> 30:36.320
 under the surface of the sea, is actually tetrapods. It's like snails with all kinds of crazy appendages

30:36.320 --> 30:42.640
 and colors and round things and five way symmetric things and eight way symmetric things,

30:42.640 --> 30:49.200
 all kinds of crazy body plans. And only the tetrapod fish managed to get out. And then they

30:49.200 --> 30:56.160
 gave rise to all the boring plans we kind of see today of basically humans with four limbs,

30:56.160 --> 31:03.840
 birds with four limbs, lizards with four limbs. And it's kind of boring. If you look at, by comparison,

31:03.840 --> 31:10.320
 life underwater is teeming with diversity. So now let's roll back the clock and basically say

31:10.320 --> 31:15.280
 where did life in the ocean come from? From the surface or from the bottom? Exactly. Those two

31:15.280 --> 31:21.120
 options you were mentioning. Exactly. So basically, life on the surface is one option. And then the

31:21.120 --> 31:26.880
 idea there is that there's tides with the moon and the sun sort of causing all this movement.

31:26.880 --> 31:32.880
 And this movement is basically causing nutrients to sort of coalesce and bounce around, etc.

31:32.880 --> 31:40.560
 That's one option. The second option, massive amount of energy from the core of our planet

31:40.560 --> 31:48.480
 that basically exploited leading to these basic ingredients of life forms. And what are these

31:48.480 --> 31:54.640
 basic ingredients? Metabolism, being able to take energy from the environment and put it as part

31:54.640 --> 32:02.800
 of yourself. Metabolism, it basically means transformation again in the Greek. It basically

32:02.800 --> 32:09.120
 means taking stuff from, you know, like nutrients or energy source or anything and then making it

32:09.120 --> 32:15.360
 your own. The second one is compartmentalization. If there's no notion of self, there can't be

32:15.360 --> 32:20.320
 evolution. You have to know where your own boundaries end and where the non self boundaries

32:20.320 --> 32:26.960
 begin. And that's basically the lipid bilayer nowadays, which is extremely simple to form.

32:26.960 --> 32:31.040
 It's basically just a bunch of lipids, and then they eventually just self organize into a membrane.

32:31.040 --> 32:39.040
 So that's a very natural way of forming a self. And then the third component is replication.

32:40.560 --> 32:46.480
 Replication doesn't need to be self replication. It could be A helps make more of B, B helps make

32:46.480 --> 32:54.240
 more of C, and C helps make more of A. Any kind of self reinforcement is what you need to ignite

32:54.240 --> 32:59.920
 the process of evolution. After you've ignited that process, you know, I don't want to say all

32:59.920 --> 33:06.240
 hell breaks loose, but all paradise breaks loose. So basically, you then boom, you know, have life

33:06.240 --> 33:12.080
 going. And the moment you have ABC, some kind of thing, looping back onto A, you can make

33:12.080 --> 33:17.920
 modifications, and you can improve. And then you let natural selection work. Is there some

33:17.920 --> 33:24.880
 element of that that's like, like, like some state representation that stores information,

33:24.880 --> 33:28.640
 like, maybe I should say information. Absolutely. Is that a fundamental part of life?

33:28.640 --> 33:36.400
 We like to think of life as the information propagation, which is DNA, the messenger,

33:36.400 --> 33:44.480
 which is RNA, and then the action, which is protein. So basically, DNA, we think is an essential

33:44.480 --> 33:50.320
 part of life. That's where the storage is. And therefore, that early life forms must have had

33:50.320 --> 33:57.840
 some kind of storage medium DNA. If you look at how life actually evolved, DNA was invented much

33:57.840 --> 34:08.080
 later. Proteins were invented later. And RNA was fine by itself. Thank you very much in an RNA world.

34:09.040 --> 34:16.240
 So the early version of life, as we know it today, was in fact, RNA molecules performing

34:16.240 --> 34:24.400
 all of the functions. The RNA molecule itself was the protein actuator by creating three

34:24.400 --> 34:29.760
 dimensional folds through self hybridization. Self what? Self hybridization. So basically,

34:29.760 --> 34:34.000
 the same way that DNA molecules can hybridize with themselves, and basically form this double

34:34.000 --> 34:41.760
 helix. The single stranded RNA molecule can form partial double helices in various places,

34:41.760 --> 34:47.040
 creating structure as if you had a long string with complementary parts, and you could then

34:47.040 --> 34:51.520
 sort of design kind of like origami like structures that will fold onto themselves.

34:51.520 --> 35:00.400
 And then you can make any shape from that. That early RNA world eventually got to replication,

35:01.760 --> 35:11.680
 where enzymes encoded in RNA would replicate RNA itself. And then that process basically kicked

35:11.680 --> 35:18.960
 off evolution. And that process of evolution then led to major innovations. The first innovation

35:18.960 --> 35:25.120
 was translation. So you start with an RNA molecule, and you translate it into another

35:25.120 --> 35:29.120
 kind of form. And that's the first kind of encoding, you're like, well, do you need some kind of code?

35:29.760 --> 35:35.920
 Yeah, but the code was in fact, one thing it was conflated with the actuators.

35:37.040 --> 35:42.160
 The actuators were separated from the code only later on. So you first had the self replicating

35:42.160 --> 35:48.320
 code, which was also the actuator. And then you kind of have a functionalization, partitioning

35:48.320 --> 35:53.200
 of the functionalization, a sub functionalization of the proteins that are now going to be the

35:53.200 --> 36:01.040
 workhorse of life. But they're not self replicating, the code remains the RNA. So the most beautiful

36:01.040 --> 36:08.560
 and most complex RNA machine known to man is the ribosome. The ribosome is this massive factory

36:08.560 --> 36:15.040
 that is able to translate RNA into protein. The ribosome, I mean, if you if you want, I don't

36:15.040 --> 36:19.920
 know, divine intervention in the history of life, the ribosome is it. That's one of the great

36:19.920 --> 36:25.360
 invention in the history of life. Yeah, but again, you can't think of great inventions as one time

36:25.360 --> 36:32.800
 steps. They're basically, you know, the culmination of probably many competing software infrastructures

36:32.800 --> 36:39.520
 for life preservation, that one out. And then when the ribosome was so efficient at making proteins,

36:39.520 --> 36:45.200
 all the other ones basically died out. And then the life forms that we're using the modern ribosome

36:46.000 --> 36:51.200
 were basically the more successful ones because they could make proteins. And now those proteins

36:51.200 --> 36:59.200
 are much more versatile. Because RNA only has four bases, proteins eventually have 20 amino acids,

36:59.200 --> 37:04.960
 not initially, but eventually. And then they can form in much more complex shapes, and they can

37:04.960 --> 37:12.160
 create all kinds of additional machines, one of which is reverse transcriptase. So you basically

37:12.160 --> 37:17.200
 now have RNA. Again, we like to think of transcription as the normal reverse transcription

37:17.200 --> 37:23.200
 as the oddball. Well, RNA preceded DNA. So reverse transcription actually was the first

37:23.200 --> 37:29.600
 invention before transcription itself. So basically, RNA invents proteins, RNA and proteins

37:29.600 --> 37:39.360
 together, invent DNA. So you now have a more stable medium, a more stable backbone with two

37:40.000 --> 37:46.400
 helices instead of one, two strands instead of one, the double helix. And RNA basically says,

37:46.400 --> 37:52.080
 listen, I'm tired. I'm going to delegate all information storage to DNA. And I'm going to

37:52.080 --> 38:01.040
 get delegate most actuation to proteins, proteins. But that's to you is not like a, that's just an

38:01.040 --> 38:06.960
 efficiency thing. It's not a fundamentally new innovation. That's why when you're asking is

38:06.960 --> 38:12.000
 a separate information storage medium, a definition of life, I'm like, no, any kind of

38:12.000 --> 38:18.800
 self preservation, self reinforcement. And it didn't need to be RNA based initially. It didn't

38:18.800 --> 38:24.960
 need to be self replication initially. You just need to have enough RNA molecules randomly arising

38:24.960 --> 38:33.200
 that reinforce each other that ultimately lead to the closing of that loop and the ignition

38:33.200 --> 38:38.000
 of the evolutionary process. Can we just rewind a little bit? Like if you were to bet all your

38:38.000 --> 38:43.600
 money on the two options in terms of where life started? Probably the bottom. At the bottom

38:43.600 --> 38:50.800
 of the ocean. I don't know if this is answerable, but how hard is the first step? Or if there's

38:50.800 --> 38:56.960
 something interesting you can say about that first leap about from not life to life.

38:58.080 --> 39:04.400
 I think it's inevitable on earth or just in the universe. I think it's inevitable.

39:05.120 --> 39:11.520
 If you look at Europa, you know, going back the moon of Jupiter, it's also a really nice song by

39:11.520 --> 39:20.800
 Santana. Europa basically has all the ingredients. It has, you know, the core that can emit energy.

39:21.680 --> 39:27.920
 It has the shielding through the ice sheet, protecting it just like an atmosphere would.

39:27.920 --> 39:35.040
 It even has a layer of oxygen, probably sufficiently dense to sustain life. So my guess

39:35.040 --> 39:44.160
 is that there's probably independently arisen lifeform already teeming in Europa because

39:44.160 --> 39:48.640
 as soon as it today. Is that exciting or terrifying to you?

39:51.360 --> 39:59.280
 It's, I mean, as a scientist, I can't wait to see non DNA based lifeforms. I can't wait because

39:59.280 --> 40:08.880
 we are so born, you know, sort of born as I would say in French, but basically we're sort of,

40:09.680 --> 40:16.640
 you know, we are so narrow minded in our thinking of what life should look like that I can't wait

40:16.640 --> 40:22.320
 for all that to just be blown away by the discovery of life elsewhere. Let me bring you into another

40:22.320 --> 40:31.680
 science fiction, a scenario. So on that point, if we discover life on Europa and you were brought in,

40:33.440 --> 40:40.960
 you seem very excited, but how would you start looking at that life in a way that's

40:41.920 --> 40:49.120
 useful to you as a scientist, but also not going to kill all of us. So like to me, it's a little

40:49.120 --> 40:57.280
 bit scary because not because it's a malevolent life, like it's a dictator petting like a cat,

40:57.280 --> 41:04.560
 it's evil, but just the way life is, it seems to be very good at conquering other life.

41:04.560 --> 41:09.280
 So there's a lot of science fiction movies based on that principle. And that's sort of

41:09.280 --> 41:15.840
 what causes the public to be so scared. But if you think about sort of would Europa life be scared

41:15.840 --> 41:20.960
 of humans coming over and taking over? Chances are no, not even like Earth bacteria, because Earth

41:20.960 --> 41:27.040
 bacteria would be wiped out in an instant in this foreign world because they don't know how to metabolize

41:27.680 --> 41:34.480
 energy that doesn't come from the types of energy sources that are here. The levels of acidity

41:34.480 --> 41:40.160
 may just kill us all off. And at the same way, in the converse way, if you bring life from Europa

41:40.160 --> 41:46.320
 on Earth, it'll die instantly because it's too hot or because it doesn't need to know how to cope with,

41:46.320 --> 41:51.840
 I don't know, the sun's radiation so close to this completely inhabitable zone by their standards.

41:53.440 --> 41:56.880
 So what we call the habitable zone might actually be the inhabitable zone for them.

41:56.880 --> 42:01.440
 Inhabitable for them. So the difference, if the environments are sufficiently different,

42:01.440 --> 42:05.840
 you think we'll just not be able to even attack each other and the basic...

42:05.840 --> 42:13.040
 It'll take massive amounts of engineering to create machines that will go there and sample

42:14.240 --> 42:21.440
 the oceans, basically drill through the layers of ice to basically sample and see

42:21.440 --> 42:28.000
 what life is like there and detecting it will probably be trivial. It definitely won't be

42:28.000 --> 42:33.760
 DNA based. It's not like we're going to send a sequencer, but it'll be some other kind of

42:33.760 --> 42:39.200
 combination of chemicals that will look non random. So if you had to bet, if I took that life form

42:39.200 --> 42:45.520
 we find in Europa and put it on a sandwich that you're eating and eat that sandwich,

42:45.520 --> 42:52.320
 it'll taste just fine. And you'll be... Well, I know about that. Will it taste fine? That's

42:52.320 --> 42:57.600
 interesting. So the other question is, do we have taste receptors for this? So where does

42:57.600 --> 43:01.680
 our taste come from? Well, the chemistry. It's basically adaptations to chemical molecules

43:01.680 --> 43:06.560
 that we are used to seeing. We don't have taste buds for things we don't even know about. So we

43:06.560 --> 43:11.840
 won't be able to know that this chemical tastes funny. But you think it won't be... It's likely not

43:11.840 --> 43:19.280
 to be dangerous. It won't know how to even... Do you think our immune system will even detect

43:19.280 --> 43:24.320
 that something weird is going on? Probably. And it'll be very easy to detect because it'll be

43:24.320 --> 43:28.960
 very different from us. Very weird. But it won't be able to attack. The scene from, I don't know,

43:28.960 --> 43:32.320
 Independence Day where they're communicating with the alien computer and they're like,

43:32.320 --> 43:37.520
 ooh, I'm in. I mean, it's hilarious because Max and PCs have trouble communicating.

43:39.840 --> 43:43.200
 I mean, let alone in alien technology or even alien DNA.

43:43.200 --> 43:49.120
 So, okay. Now I was talking about you being a scientist on Earth, but say you were a scientist

43:49.120 --> 43:54.880
 that were shipped over to Europa to investigate if there's life. What would you look for in terms

43:54.880 --> 44:04.000
 of signs of life? Life is unmistakable, I would say. The way that life transforms a planet surrounding

44:04.000 --> 44:10.240
 it is not the kind of thing that you would expect from the physical laws alone. So it's...

44:11.200 --> 44:18.800
 I would say that as soon as life arises, it creates this compartmentalization. It starts

44:18.800 --> 44:24.720
 pushing things away. It starts sort of keeping things inside that are self. And there's a whole

44:25.840 --> 44:31.040
 signature that you can see from that. So when I was organizing my meaning of life symposium,

44:31.040 --> 44:37.840
 my friend who's an astrophysicist, basically we were deciding on what would be the themes

44:37.840 --> 44:42.400
 for the symposium. And then I said, well, we're going to have biology. We're going to have physics.

44:42.400 --> 44:49.520
 And she's like, oh, come on. Biology is just a small part of physics. Everything's a small

44:49.520 --> 44:55.600
 part of physics. And I mean, in many ways it is. But my immediate answer was no, no, no, no, wait.

44:56.560 --> 45:03.920
 Life challenges physics. It supersedes physics. It sort of fights against physics. And that's

45:03.920 --> 45:09.040
 what I would look for in Europa. I would basically look for this fight against physics for anything

45:09.040 --> 45:14.160
 that sort of signatures of not just entropy at work, not just things diffusing away, not just

45:14.160 --> 45:20.880
 gravitational pools, but clear signatures of... Remember when I was talking earlier about this

45:20.880 --> 45:26.960
 whole selection for environments, selection for biospheres, for ecosystems, for these multi organism

45:28.080 --> 45:32.640
 form of life. And I think that's sort of the first thing that you can look for,

45:33.200 --> 45:38.560
 you know, chemical signatures that are not simply predicted from the reactions you would get randomly.

45:38.560 --> 45:43.680
 Such a beautiful way to look at life. So you're basically leveraging some energy source

45:44.560 --> 45:48.000
 to enable you to resist the physics of the universe.

45:48.000 --> 45:52.640
 Fighting against physics. But that's the first transformation. If you look at humans,

45:52.640 --> 45:53.920
 we're way past that.

45:53.920 --> 45:55.440
 What do you mean by transformation?

45:55.440 --> 46:00.400
 So basically there's layers. I sort of see life, you know,

46:02.160 --> 46:07.600
 when we talk about the meaning of life, life can be construed at many levels. We talked about

46:07.600 --> 46:12.000
 life in the simplest form of sort of the ignition of evolution.

46:12.000 --> 46:15.360
 And that's sort of the basic definition that you can check off. Yes, it's alive.

46:16.240 --> 46:18.560
 But when Alexander the Great was asked,

46:19.760 --> 46:27.280
 to whom do you owe your life to your teachers or to your parents?

46:28.080 --> 46:35.760
 And Alexander the Great answered, I owe to my parents the zine, the life itself.

46:35.760 --> 46:42.480
 And I owe to my teachers the f zine, like euphony. F means good. The opposite of cacophony,

46:42.480 --> 46:53.680
 which means, you know, bad. So f zine in his words was basically living a human life, a proper life.

46:53.680 --> 46:56.880
 So basically we can go from the zine to the f zine.

46:57.680 --> 47:04.240
 And that transformation has taken several additional leaps. So basically, you know,

47:04.240 --> 47:10.400
 life on Europa, I'm pretty sure has gotten to the stage of A makes B makes C makes A again.

47:11.520 --> 47:20.160
 But getting to the f zine is a whole other level. And that level requires cooperation.

47:21.040 --> 47:26.960
 That level requires altruism. That level requires specialization.

47:26.960 --> 47:31.440
 Remember how we're talking about the RNA specializing into DNA for storage,

47:31.440 --> 47:36.400
 proteins, and then compartmentalizations. And if you look at prokaryotic life,

47:37.200 --> 47:44.320
 there's no nucleus. It's all one soup of things intermingling. If you look at eukaryotic life,

47:44.320 --> 47:51.680
 again, you for true good, you know, so a eukaryote basically has a nucleus. And that's where you

47:51.680 --> 47:58.480
 compartmentalize further the organization of the information storage from all of the daily

47:58.480 --> 48:03.840
 activities. If you look at a, you know, human body plan or any animal, you have a compartmentalization

48:03.840 --> 48:09.760
 of the germline. You basically have one lineage that will basically be saved for the future generations.

48:09.760 --> 48:15.600
 And everything outside that lineage is almost superfluous. If you think about it, the rest of

48:15.600 --> 48:21.360
 your body, all it does is ensure that that lineage will make it to the next generation,

48:21.360 --> 48:24.720
 that these germlines will make it to the next generation. The rest is packaging.

48:24.720 --> 48:31.120
 I'm sorry to be so blunt. And if you look at nutrition, you know, we're deuterostomes. What

48:31.120 --> 48:37.360
 does deuterostome mean? Deuterome means second, where this is the second mouth. The first mouth

48:37.360 --> 48:42.560
 is actually down here, it's the esophagus. So deuterostomes have evolved a second layer of

48:42.560 --> 48:48.000
 eating, kind of like alien with the two mouths. So you can think of us as alien where the first

48:48.000 --> 48:52.720
 mouth is up here, and then the second mouth is down there. And of course, is the first mouth

48:52.720 --> 48:58.160
 just the physical manipulation of the food to make it more consumable? Correct. And basically,

48:58.160 --> 49:03.840
 again, if you look at a worm, it's an extremely simple life form. It basically has a mouth,

49:03.840 --> 49:08.720
 it has an anus, and it has just some organs in between that consume the food and just spit

49:08.720 --> 49:15.680
 out poo. Humans are basically a fancy form of that. So you basically have the mouth,

49:15.680 --> 49:19.760
 you have the digestive tract, and then you have limbs to get better at getting food.

49:19.760 --> 49:25.520
 Then you have eyesight, hearing, et cetera, to get better at getting food. And then you have,

49:25.520 --> 49:30.640
 of course, the germline. And all of this food part, it's just auxiliary to the germline.

49:30.640 --> 49:35.600
 So you basically have layers of addition of compartmentalization of specialization

49:36.240 --> 49:39.680
 on top of this zine to get all the way to the earth's zine.

49:39.680 --> 49:45.920
 Yeah. So like the worm is like Windows 95, very few features, very basic. And then us humans are

49:45.920 --> 49:51.520
 like Windows Vista, Windows 10, whatever it is. Well, a few innovations beyond that.

49:51.520 --> 49:56.400
 But yeah, I'm not right. We're Windows 3000, at least that way.

49:56.400 --> 50:01.440
 So okay, that's such a fascinating way to look at life as a set of transformations.

50:01.440 --> 50:06.480
 Exactly. So like, is there some interesting transformations through our history here on

50:06.480 --> 50:11.440
 earth that like appeal to you? Of course. And what are the most brilliant innovations and

50:11.440 --> 50:16.240
 transformations? Yeah. I mean, this is such a fascinating question. Of course, like,

50:16.240 --> 50:20.560
 we're talking about basic, basic life forms, and we're talking about eukaryotic life forms.

50:20.560 --> 50:24.720
 And then the next big transformation is multicellular life forms,

50:24.720 --> 50:30.720
 where the specialization separates the germline from everything else that accompanies it and

50:30.720 --> 50:36.720
 sort of carries it. And then that specialization then sort of has this massive new innovation,

50:36.720 --> 50:42.720
 like above the second mouth, which is this massive brain. And this massive brain is basically

50:43.360 --> 50:48.640
 something that arises much, much later on, basically, you know, not chords, like having

50:48.640 --> 50:54.240
 the first spinal cord, this whole concept that along with these very simple layers,

50:54.240 --> 50:59.600
 you basically now have a coordinating agent. And this coordinated agent is starting to make

50:59.600 --> 51:06.400
 decisions. And remember when we were talking about free will? I mean, you know, as a worm is

51:06.400 --> 51:11.680
 hunting for food, oh, it has plenty of free will, it can choose to, you know, follow chemo taxes to

51:11.680 --> 51:16.080
 the left for chemo taxes to the right. And maybe that's free will because it's unpredictable,

51:16.080 --> 51:25.360
 beyond a certain level. So you basically now have more and more decision making and coordination

51:25.360 --> 51:30.960
 of all of these different body parts and organs by a central parading system, a central machine,

51:30.960 --> 51:36.880
 that basically will control the rest of the body. And the other thing that I love talking about is

51:36.880 --> 51:40.640
 the different timescales at which things happen. You know, we're talking about the human AP genome

51:40.640 --> 51:48.720
 before. The human AP genome is basically able to find what genes should be expressed in response to

51:48.720 --> 51:55.360
 environmental stimuli in the order of minutes, and basically receive a stimulus, transfer all that

51:55.360 --> 52:01.920
 data through this humongously long string of searching, and then sort of find what genes to

52:01.920 --> 52:07.520
 turn on, and then create all that all of that is happening in the timescale of minutes, basically,

52:07.520 --> 52:13.120
 you know, three minutes to an hour to half an hour. That's the expression response. But our daily

52:13.120 --> 52:16.320
 life doesn't happen on the order of three minutes to an hour to half an hour, it happened on the

52:16.320 --> 52:21.120
 order of milliseconds, like a throw a ball at you, you catch it right away. No gene expression

52:21.120 --> 52:26.880
 changes there. You just don't have time to do that. So you basically have a layer of control

52:27.600 --> 52:34.000
 built on a hardware that supports it, but that hardware itself lives in a different timescale

52:34.880 --> 52:39.280
 than the controlling machine on top of that. Is that an accident, by the way? Is that like a feature?

52:39.280 --> 52:46.240
 Is it was it possible for a life to have evolved where the our the daily life with the organism as

52:46.240 --> 52:53.280
 it interacts with its environment was on a timescale similar to the the way our internals work?

52:53.920 --> 52:58.960
 If you look at trees, they look kind of boring and stupid, you're like looking at a tree like

52:58.960 --> 53:04.960
 stupid. If you speed up the movie of a tree from spring until October, you'll be like, oh my god,

53:04.960 --> 53:11.440
 it's intelligent. And the reason for that is that at that timescale, the tree is basically saying, oh,

53:11.440 --> 53:16.000
 I'm looking for a, you know, a thing to catch on to. Oh, I just caught on to that. I'm going to grow

53:16.000 --> 53:20.960
 more here. I'm going to spawn there, etc. Like, I can see the trees in my garden just growing and

53:20.960 --> 53:28.160
 sort of, you know, looping around. And it's all a matter of timescale. And if you look at the human

53:28.160 --> 53:33.600
 timescale, remember, we were talking about neoteny the last time around the whole fact that our young

53:33.600 --> 53:39.920
 are pretty useless until, you know, maybe, you know, a few months of age, if not a few years of age,

53:39.920 --> 53:47.760
 if not, I don't know, getting out of college. And then we basically hold them, enabling their brain

53:47.760 --> 53:54.560
 to continue being malleable and infusing it with knowledge and, you know, thoughts as,

53:54.560 --> 54:00.560
 you know, that period of neoteny increases and expands. If you fast forward, I don't know,

54:00.560 --> 54:06.240
 another million years. So humans have only been around, you know, different from apes for about

54:06.240 --> 54:15.520
 that long. Jumped another unit of that, another human chim divergence. What could happen from an

54:15.520 --> 54:21.120
 evolutionary timescale a lot? One of the things that's happening already is expansion of human

54:21.120 --> 54:27.280
 lifespan. We have longer and longer periods before we mature. And we have longer and longer

54:27.280 --> 54:33.280
 periods before we have babies. So intergenerational distance is, you know, grown from, I don't know,

54:33.280 --> 54:40.400
 16 years to 40 years. You're saying that's in the genetics, like... No, no, not necessarily.

54:40.400 --> 54:48.480
 But it's sort of an environmental tendency that's happening. But as we medically expand human

54:48.480 --> 54:56.880
 lifespan, the generations might actually be pushed instead of 40 years to 60 years to 100 years.

54:56.880 --> 55:03.120
 Like if we look at the long arc of the evolutionary history. Exactly. So as we start thinking about

55:03.120 --> 55:12.480
 intergalactic travel now... Sorry, that's a heck of a transition. Yeah, so let's talk about... No, no,

55:12.480 --> 55:17.920
 no, no. As we, as a species, start thinking about... I'm talking about these transitions that are

55:17.920 --> 55:22.080
 happening, right? That's awesome. So continuing along these transitions, what does the future

55:22.080 --> 55:28.080
 hold in the next million years? So the concept of us going to another planet and that taking

55:28.080 --> 55:35.440
 three human lifetimes might be a joke if the human lifetime starts being 400 years or 800 years.

55:35.440 --> 55:40.960
 So imagine... It's all timescale. It's all timescale. Just different timescales. Yeah.

55:40.960 --> 55:47.680
 You asked me offline whether I would like to live forever. I mean, my answer is absolutely. And

55:47.680 --> 55:55.520
 there's many different types of forever. One forever is, do I want to live today forever? Kind

55:55.520 --> 56:00.640
 of like Groundhog Day. And the answer is absolutely. The stuff that I want to learn today will probably

56:00.640 --> 56:06.960
 take a lifetime just to learn, you know, to clear my dedulis for the day. You mean like relive the

56:06.960 --> 56:11.440
 day? Relive the day. And then pick up different things from the richness of the experiences

56:11.440 --> 56:15.360
 they're all in today. Exactly. There's just so much happening in the world every single day.

56:15.360 --> 56:19.600
 So much knowledge that's happened already that just to catch up on that will probably take me

56:19.600 --> 56:25.760
 around forever. On that point, I would just love to see you in the Groundhog movie just

56:26.960 --> 56:32.480
 because you're so naturally as a scientist, but just the way your mind works beautifully,

56:32.480 --> 56:37.600
 just all the richness of the experiences that you will pick up from that. That's a beautiful

56:37.600 --> 56:42.400
 visual. Try to live each day as if it was Groundhog Day. And basically every single day,

56:42.400 --> 56:46.320
 waking up and saying, all right, how would Bill Murray get out of that one? Well, you know what?

56:46.320 --> 56:56.160
 On a funny tangent, I got a chance to go to a Neuralink demonstration event. I'm not

56:56.160 --> 57:03.120
 usually familiar with Neuralink. And I talked to Elon for a while. And one of the funny things he

57:03.120 --> 57:10.480
 said on this Groundhog Day thing is, you know, it's a beautiful dream to eventually be able to

57:10.480 --> 57:16.880
 replay our memories. So we're kind of these recording machines. Our brain is kind of maybe

57:16.880 --> 57:24.000
 a noisy recording machine of memories. And it'll be beautiful if we can someday in the future,

57:24.000 --> 57:29.680
 maybe far into the future, be able to, like in the Groundhog Day situation, replay that.

57:29.680 --> 57:36.240
 And the funny comment that stuck with me is he said that maybe this, our conversation now,

57:36.240 --> 57:41.440
 is a replay of a memory of a previous memory. And that's stuck with me because

57:42.240 --> 57:47.600
 it would probably be my replay, you know, who the hell am I? I'm just an idiot guy. But like,

57:47.600 --> 57:53.600
 Elon Musk is, you know, probably because of SpaceX and so on is probably going to be remembered as

57:53.600 --> 58:00.240
 a special person, one of our special apes in history. So if I wanted to replay a memory,

58:00.240 --> 58:04.640
 probably be that one, you know, talking to Elon for a while. And that's an interesting

58:04.640 --> 58:12.720
 possibility from a, if we think about time scales, if we think about the richness of the

58:12.720 --> 58:20.560
 experience through time that we humans take, and be able to replay some aspects of that,

58:20.560 --> 58:25.440
 of that biology, that's super interesting. But anyway, sorry for the tangents. Let's,

58:26.160 --> 58:32.640
 you were talking about time scales and the expansion of the human lifetime and

58:32.640 --> 58:37.680
 the idea of intercoactic travel. Yeah. No, but, but you're laughing about it.

58:37.680 --> 58:42.160
 Yeah, no, for sure. That is you're talking about this. You're talking about exploring alien worlds

58:42.160 --> 58:45.920
 and going to other planets. I mean, you know, when Sarah was here, she was talking about sort of

58:45.920 --> 58:52.480
 going to other planets when we find these five. I mean, I'm just very naturally, given the topics

58:52.480 --> 58:56.880
 that we've approached, talking about the time scale at which this will happen. So you think

58:56.880 --> 59:03.520
 eventually we will human or life, life will expand out into the universe.

59:03.520 --> 59:09.200
 The point that I'm trying to make is that in intergalactic species, we'll probably find ways

59:09.200 --> 59:18.160
 to engineer its biology in order to expand the way that we experience time, expand the time

59:18.160 --> 59:22.800
 scale that we experienced. And going back to this whole concept of, you know, would I like to live

59:22.800 --> 59:27.680
 forever? Yes, I'd like to live forever. Even if it was, even if it was stuck on the same day,

59:27.680 --> 59:31.440
 I'd love to live forever because I would finally have time to do all these things that I want to do.

59:32.240 --> 59:38.640
 But if living forever actually comes with a perk of watching the whole world evolve forever,

59:38.640 --> 59:43.520
 I mean, that's a huge perk. And I would, you know, just, it'll never get boring,

59:43.520 --> 59:50.160
 just a never changing world. And then the mind, you know, sort of experiment that I want you to

59:50.160 --> 59:57.760
 do is to also ask, what if I wanted to live forever one day at a time every year or one

59:57.760 --> 1:00:03.280
 day at a time every decade? Would you choose that where you would wake up and the world would be

1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:08.240
 10 years later every single day you wake up? It's the opposite of Groundhog Day, where basically

1:00:08.240 --> 1:00:14.720
 you always wake up and it's always 10 years later. So you're saying that's such a powerful,

1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:22.480
 interesting concept that life is more interesting if you're, of all the life forms on earth,

1:00:22.480 --> 1:00:26.640
 that you're the slowest one. Exactly. Like trees have it right.

1:00:27.760 --> 1:00:31.600
 All the trees, like, you know, they've been there since the Minoan civilization.

1:00:31.600 --> 1:00:35.360
 Yeah. And, you know, that takes us back to the question you asked about sort of the

1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:39.440
 transformations that have happened in humanity. The Minoan civilization is one of them.

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:43.440
 You know, there's this paper that was published just a couple of years ago by one of my friends

1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:53.200
 that basically looked at the genetic makeup of the Minoans and the Mycenaeans in ancient

1:00:53.200 --> 1:00:57.760
 Greek, in ancient Greece and how they relate to modern Greeks. And they found that indeed

1:00:57.760 --> 1:01:06.240
 there was very little gene flow from, you know, the outside. And, you know, it's fantastic to sort

1:01:06.240 --> 1:01:12.880
 of think about these amazing civilizations that transform the way that human thought happens.

1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:19.120
 That basically looked for rules in nature, that looked for principles, that looked for

1:01:19.920 --> 1:01:26.160
 the standard of beauty, not human beauty, but beauty in the natural world. This whole concept

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:31.840
 that the world must be elegant and there must be deeper ways of understanding that world.

1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:38.400
 To me, that's a massive transformation of our species, similar to, you know, the earlier

1:01:38.400 --> 1:01:43.920
 transformation that we're talking about, of even involving a brain, of, you know, learning how

1:01:43.920 --> 1:01:50.480
 to communicate language or the evolution of eyesight. If you look at sort of, you know,

1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:54.720
 we're talking about these worms crawling around and then sensing which direction are the chemicals

1:01:54.720 --> 1:02:01.600
 more abundant, you know, chemotaxis. So eventually they grow a nose, eventually they grow a,

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:05.600
 I mean, when I say nose, I mean, ways of sensing chemicals. That's probably one of the earliest

1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:09.920
 senses. You know, we always talk about how deep rooted it is in your brain. That's one of the

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:14.480
 earliest senses. If you look at hearing, that's a much later sense. If you look at eyesight,

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:18.880
 that's an intermediate sense where you're basically sensing where the light direction comes from.

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:22.880
 That's probably something that life didn't need until it got, you know, into the surface

1:02:22.880 --> 1:02:29.040
 and so on and so forth. So there's a lot of, you know, milestones. And I was talking about the

1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:34.800
 latest milestone, which is LIGO, last time, of being able to detect gravitational waves and

1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:39.040
 sort of being able to sort of have a sense that humans haven't had before.

1:02:39.040 --> 1:02:43.360
 So you see that as a yet another transformation gives us an extra little sense.

1:02:43.360 --> 1:02:48.640
 Of course. And now if you go back to this history of ancient Greece, I mean, this transformation

1:02:48.640 --> 1:02:54.080
 that happened, I mean, of course, the Egyptians had this incredible, you know, civilization for

1:02:54.080 --> 1:02:59.280
 thousands of years. But what happened in Greece was this whole concept of let's break things down

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:03.760
 and understand the natural world. Let's break things down and understand physics. Let's basically

1:03:03.760 --> 1:03:11.840
 build rules around architecture, about around elegance, around, you know, statues and tragedy.

1:03:11.840 --> 1:03:17.280
 I mean, another question that you asked me in passing was this whole concept of embracing

1:03:17.280 --> 1:03:23.600
 the good and the bad, embracing the full range of human emotions. And if you look at Greek tragedy,

1:03:24.240 --> 1:03:29.760
 it's the definition of that. It's, I mean, drama. I mean, again, it's a Greek word.

1:03:29.760 --> 1:03:39.680
 But the whole concept of some problems that are just so vast and large that dying is the easy way

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:46.560
 out. That death, oh, that's the easy solution. You know, so I want to touch a little bit on

1:03:46.560 --> 1:03:58.720
 that point and sort of talk about this concept that life supersedes physics and that the brain

1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:06.640
 supersedes life. That basically we have a brain that can decide to not follow evolution's path.

1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:13.360
 We can decide to not have children. We can decide to not eat. We can decide to suicide.

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:19.840
 We can decide to sort of abolish communication with the outside world. I mean, all the things

1:04:19.840 --> 1:04:26.560
 that make us human, we can basically decide not to do that. And that, that is basically when

1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:32.720
 the brain itself is basically superseding what evolution problem is for.

1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:42.080
 So, okay, so one of the, it's, okay, my mind was already blown at the beautiful formulation of

1:04:42.080 --> 1:04:53.280
 the idea that life is a system that resists physics. And our brain, or perhaps the content of it,

1:04:53.280 --> 1:05:00.800
 or however it may be functionally, our brain is a thing that resists life. Yes, yes.

1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:11.600
 You're so, you're so brilliant. But I want you to see all of that as continuum. Basically,

1:05:11.600 --> 1:05:15.440
 you're sort of talking about the sort of individual transformations, but it's a path

1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:20.240
 that humanity has been taking. It's a transformation. It's a path of transformation.

1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:27.280
 And then I want us to think about what it truly means to become human, like the F zine. And you

1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:32.240
 asked me about what motivated my meaning of life's imposing. What motivated it in part,

1:05:33.040 --> 1:05:39.440
 I mean, of course, it was an inside joke of turning 42. But what motivated it in part was

1:05:39.440 --> 1:05:45.680
 actually a midlife crisis. So the joke that I always like to say is Jesus Papadimitriou,

1:05:45.680 --> 1:05:50.080
 a famous Greek professor who was previously at MIT at Harvard, at Stanford, at Berkeley, everywhere.

1:05:50.080 --> 1:05:56.480
 A brilliant, brilliant person. That's actually Costis's advisor. So Jesus Papadimitriou likes

1:05:56.480 --> 1:06:01.840
 to say that when you're an undergrad, you work like a rat to get into grad school. And when

1:06:01.840 --> 1:06:06.080
 you're a grad student, you work like a rat to get your PhD. And when you're a postdoc, you work like

1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:10.320
 a rat to get your assistant professor. And when you're an assistant professor, you work like a

1:06:10.320 --> 1:06:16.560
 rat to become a full professor. And then when you're a full professor, well, by then you're basically

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:24.080
 a rat. So basically what happened to me is that I arrived at the end of the rat race.

1:06:26.080 --> 1:06:30.080
 Life is a rat race. You constantly have hurdles to jump over. You constantly have tunnels and

1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:35.920
 secret pathways. And I figured it all out. And eventually, as I was turning 42, I looked back

1:06:35.920 --> 1:06:44.000
 and I was like, wow, that was an awesome rat race. But I'm not a rat. I basically got out of the

1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:51.680
 labyrinth and I was like, I'm not a rat turns out. Is that the first moment we saw that you were in

1:06:51.680 --> 1:06:56.640
 a rat race? No, no, no. I've known that I'm in a rat race for a long time. It's so easy to be in a

1:06:56.640 --> 1:07:02.560
 rat race. It's so easy to be an undergrad. But you have problem sets. And we're all smart people.

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:07.440
 Problem set, it has a solution. Somebody made it for you. You can just solve it. Everything was

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:12.400
 made as a test. And you keep passing those tests and tests and tests and tests. And you have tasks

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:18.160
 that are well defined. The PhD is a little different because it's more open ended. But yet

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:24.960
 you have an advisor who's guiding you. And then you become a professor. And tenure is a well said

1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:31.920
 defined set of tasks. And you do all that. And at 42, I basically had bought a house, three kids,

1:07:32.800 --> 1:07:41.040
 beautiful wife, tenure, awesome students, tons of grants. Life was basically laid out for me.

1:07:41.040 --> 1:07:45.680
 And that's when I had my main life crisis. That's when people usually buy a Harley Davidson.

1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:50.720
 And they basically say, oh, I need something new. I need something different and to be young

1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:55.520
 myself, et cetera. But basically, that was my realization that it's not a rat race,

1:07:55.520 --> 1:08:02.960
 that there's no rat race, it's over. That I have to basically think, how do I fully

1:08:02.960 --> 1:08:07.200
 instantiate myself? How do I complete my transformation into an actual human being?

1:08:07.200 --> 1:08:13.120
 Because it's very easy to sort of forget all the intangibles of life. It's very hard to just sort

1:08:13.120 --> 1:08:16.720
 of think about the next task and the next task. And it's all metrics. And what is the number of

1:08:16.720 --> 1:08:20.240
 viewers I have? What is the number of publications I have? What is the number of citations,

1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:24.480
 the number of talks, the number of grants? It's very easy to quantify everything. And then at some

1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:30.000
 point, you're like, this is real life. It's not a test anymore. And that's something that I told

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:36.160
 my wife early on. I was like, no, no, no, our life is not going to be let's put the kids through

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:42.080
 college. And maybe that's when I escaped the rat race. Maybe it continued being a rat race.

1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:45.920
 Maybe the next step would have been, all right, how do I make sure that my kid is first in class?

1:08:45.920 --> 1:08:50.320
 How do I make sure that they're into the greatest colors? And then they're into college,

1:08:51.280 --> 1:09:02.080
 and then you're like 60. So how do you escape? Is there light at the end of the tunnel of a

1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:10.640
 midlife crisis? So you should watch that symposium, because the videos were transformative to me

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:16.960
 and to many others. So basically, the advice that I received from all of my friends was

1:09:16.960 --> 1:09:24.000
 so meaningful. There's some advice that basically says you have to constantly maintain

1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:31.440
 unachievable goals, goals that you can make progress towards, but you can never be fully

1:09:31.440 --> 1:09:36.000
 done with. And I think that's almost playing into the sort of rat race thing, like basically

1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:41.600
 make sure that there's more obstacles for your little rat persona to jump through. So that's

1:09:41.600 --> 1:09:47.520
 one possibility. So first of all, watch. Is it available somewhere? It's on YouTube. Just Google

1:09:48.560 --> 1:09:51.840
 meaning of life symposium. I should have known this. I mean, you should have told me this. This

1:09:51.840 --> 1:10:00.160
 is awesome. Okay. This is great. But and also like, you know, saying rat race is, you know,

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:09.120
 if we look at ratatouille, I mean, that's a beautiful thing of challenges and overcoming

1:10:09.120 --> 1:10:18.400
 challenges. That could be fundamentally the meaning of life is to see life as a set of challenges

1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:25.280
 and to fully engage in the overcoming of those challenges. I would say that that's embracing

1:10:25.280 --> 1:10:31.440
 the rat race view of life. So a joke that we like to have with my wife all the time is we basically

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:37.600
 say we pretend that we're in this all inclusive resort that we've basically hired all these people

1:10:37.600 --> 1:10:42.320
 to go on the Esplanade and play games because we enjoy watching people playing on the Esplanade and

1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:46.400
 we enjoy sort of laying and looking at life and all the people biking and rollerblading and all

1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:51.760
 of that. And then we've paid all these people in this all inclusive resort that we live in.

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:56.320
 And then what are we going to do today? I'm like, Oh, I've signed up for professor activities.

1:10:56.320 --> 1:11:00.960
 It's going to be awesome. They lined up a bunch of super smart MIT students for me to meet with.

1:11:00.960 --> 1:11:04.880
 I'm going to have a grant writing meeting afterwards. It's going to be awesome. And then she

1:11:04.880 --> 1:11:08.160
 signed up for a bunch of consulting activities. It's going to be great. And then in the evening,

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:14.560
 we just get back together and say, Hey, how was your consulting today? So in a way, that's another

1:11:14.560 --> 1:11:19.520
 view of life of basically, wait a minute, if I was a gazillionaire, what would I choose to do?

1:11:19.520 --> 1:11:25.040
 I would probably pay an awesome university to give me an office there and just pay a bunch of super

1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:30.720
 smart people to work with me, even though they don't really want to, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:35.840
 In fact, I would have exactly the life that I have now working my butt off every single day

1:11:37.040 --> 1:11:43.840
 because it's so freaking fulfilling. Well, that's, so let's clarify. It's just a beautiful way.

1:11:43.840 --> 1:11:49.440
 It's a beautiful way. It's almost like a video game view of life that it's a set of, I mean, again,

1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:57.840
 game is not perhaps a positive term, but it is a beautiful term. So do you or do you not like the

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.760
 rat race view of life? No. Because it is fulfilling in some fundamental way.

1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:10.240
 The rat race is about the goal. My view of life is about the path. So again, according to Greece.

1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:14.320
 Those folks have come up with some good stuff.

1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:20.720
 So this Odysseus Elites basically wrote this beautiful poem about sort of going through

1:12:22.080 --> 1:12:28.800
 life saying, as you go through your journey impersonating Ulysses of his voyage,

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:37.280
 he says, wish that the path is long and arduous. Because when you get to Ithaca,

1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:43.040
 you might realize that it was all about the path, not the destination.

1:12:46.720 --> 1:12:50.240
 So the rat race view of life makes it all about the destination. It's like,

1:12:50.240 --> 1:12:56.720
 how do I get through the maze to get there? But the all inclusive resort view of life

1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:04.640
 is about the path. It's about, wow, today, I couldn't wish for a better set of activities,

1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:11.680
 all programmed for me to enjoy having my brain, having my body, having my senses and

1:13:12.880 --> 1:13:17.200
 the life that I have. So it's a very different kind of view. It's focused on the journey,

1:13:17.200 --> 1:13:24.480
 not on the destination. So you mentioned kind of the ups and downs of life and the midlife crisis.

1:13:25.680 --> 1:13:31.440
 And right now you said focusing kind of on the journey. But what the journey involves

1:13:31.440 --> 1:13:43.120
 is ups and downs. Is there advice or any kind of thoughts that you can elucidate about the downs

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:51.120
 in your life, the hard parts of your life and how you got out or maybe not? Or is there,

1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:57.120
 yeah, how do you see the dark parts of life? So I am so glad you're asking this question,

1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:02.000
 because it's something that our society does a terrible job at preparing us for.

1:14:02.720 --> 1:14:09.120
 Every Hollywood movie has to have a happy ending. It is ridiculous. You can count on your 10 fingers,

1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:14.400
 the number of bad ending movies that you've ever watched. And you probably wouldn't need all 10

1:14:14.400 --> 1:14:24.800
 fingers. We strive to tell everyone, yes, you can succeed. Yes, you're a millionaire just temporarily

1:14:24.800 --> 1:14:33.280
 disabled. And yes, you know, the prince will eventually figure out his princess and they will

1:14:33.280 --> 1:14:39.440
 have a happily ever after ending. And yes, the hero will be beaten and beaten and beaten. But

1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:43.440
 you know that at the end of the movie, the good guys will win. We need more movies where the

1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:49.600
 bad guys win. We need more movies where just everybody dies. We're just, you know, MacGyver

1:14:49.600 --> 1:14:54.960
 doesn't figure out how to disable the bomb and just explode. You just need more movies that are

1:14:54.960 --> 1:15:00.960
 more realistic about the fact that life kind of sucks sometimes and it's okay. So again,

1:15:00.960 --> 1:15:10.480
 growing up in Greece, I have been exposed to songs that are not just sad, but they're miserable,

1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:21.120
 miserable. So one of them comes to mind. And it's basically talking about this woman who's

1:15:22.080 --> 1:15:28.960
 lamenting in the early morning about losing the joyful kid, the joyful young man,

1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:39.360
 who basically died in the civil war in the arms of our own fellow citizens. And she's like,

1:15:39.360 --> 1:15:49.280
 if only he had died fighting the foreign forces, if only he had died at the sides of the general,

1:15:50.320 --> 1:15:57.040
 if only he had died with honor, I would be proud to have lost the joyful kid. I mean,

1:15:57.040 --> 1:16:06.160
 it's devastating, right? It's like, he didn't just die. He died without honor. And my friend who

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:10.400
 was with me was listening to the song and she's like, this is depressing. You have to listen to

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:17.360
 another one. It's not a sad. And she's like, what, this one died with honor? So that's one example.

1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:22.960
 It's a kind of a celebration of misery. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. So let me give you a couple

1:16:22.960 --> 1:16:28.400
 more examples and then I'll answer that question. So another example is I picked up this book that

1:16:28.400 --> 1:16:34.000
 I had for my childhood and I started reading stories to my kids. And the first story is about

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:38.560
 these two children. One is really poor living on the street and the other one is really rich,

1:16:38.560 --> 1:16:42.720
 living in the house on the bright light above. And the poor one is wishing, looking at that window

1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:48.000
 and wishing that he could have that house. And the other one is at the window wishing that he was

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:52.800
 free, that he wasn't sick all the time, that he could escape outside. It's only four pages long.

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:58.240
 And at the end, both children die. One of them dies from cold, the other one dies from illness.

1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:03.760
 And you're like, how is that even a children's story? The next story, I'm like, okay, that's

1:17:03.760 --> 1:17:08.000
 fine. Let's keep this one. So I read this to my kids and then I read the next one. And the next

1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:18.240
 one is about this woman whose brother is at war against the Turks and he is going to die.

1:17:18.960 --> 1:17:23.680
 And she prays to the virgin, please don't let him die. And the virgin appears and she's like,

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:30.560
 no problem. Tell me who to kill instead. And she's like, anyone, anyone. No, no, no,

1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:37.120
 choose one. How about this Turk? This one has two kids, a beautiful family waiting for him at home.

1:17:37.760 --> 1:17:41.920
 She's like, no, not this one, choose another one. And then she goes through all the life

1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:46.400
 stories of the others and she's like, no, no, just don't take anyone. She's like, I can't do that.

1:17:46.400 --> 1:17:51.440
 You can choose to bring your brother back and he will be depressed for the rest of his life

1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:57.120
 because he didn't fight at war because he didn't go to that battle and he will live without arms.

1:17:57.120 --> 1:18:01.920
 She's like, and in the end, the woman decides to have her brother killed instead because he dies

1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:07.920
 without, I mean, this is insane. So why am I giving you these examples? It's not a glorification

1:18:07.920 --> 1:18:18.000
 of misery. It's expanding your emotional range. It's teaching you that and when I read these stories,

1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:25.280
 I'm not, I'm not a jerk. I'm crying out loud. I have tears and I like my face becomes red

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:33.360
 from the pain that I'm experiencing through these stories. It's just so deeply touching

1:18:34.080 --> 1:18:43.040
 to embrace the suffering not because of an accident, but because of a choice,

1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:50.400
 the sacrifice to embrace the fact that not everything is cute and rosy and always ending

1:18:50.400 --> 1:18:56.800
 well. And I think that we don't do a good enough job of teaching our kids that just life sucks and

1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:02.400
 life is unfair sometimes. And that's, and that's okay. And sometimes I read a story to my kids.

1:19:02.400 --> 1:19:09.440
 I read a story every night and sometimes the story is horrible and sometimes the story is good

1:19:09.440 --> 1:19:14.720
 and sort of friendly and happy. And my kids always ask, what's the moral of the story?

1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:18.240
 And sometimes there's a moral and it's like, oh, you should be good or you should be nice.

1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:21.360
 You should be helping each other, et cetera. And sometimes there's just no moral.

1:19:22.240 --> 1:19:27.120
 And I tell my kids, you know what, sometimes just life doesn't make sense and it's okay.

1:19:27.760 --> 1:19:33.600
 And you can't comprehend everything. And I think this concept of how do you deal with bad days

1:19:33.600 --> 1:19:37.600
 comes from the fact that we're taught, we're brainwashed into thinking that every day should

1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:46.080
 be a happy day. And we're not ready to cope with misery. And the other thing that crying

1:19:46.080 --> 1:19:52.320
 through these stories teaches you is that you don't have it nearly half as bad as you think.

1:19:54.640 --> 1:20:00.640
 Do you see what I mean? Basically, it tells you that, I mean, my mom would always tell me about

1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:06.000
 how she was transformed as a teenager when she volunteered in the hospital. And she saw all

1:20:06.000 --> 1:20:12.400
 these people at the brink of death, clinging for life and helping them out to best she could and

1:20:12.400 --> 1:20:19.440
 crying her heart out when they were dying. And just sort of how that taught her the

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:24.640
 appreciation for what we have every day. Waking up every morning and saying,

1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:32.480
 my life doesn't suck. My life is not nearly half as bad as it could be.

1:20:32.480 --> 1:20:40.960
 And, and sort of embracing the joy that we have of living where we live in the moment

1:20:40.960 --> 1:20:48.480
 we live. And I'm going to go further. If you look at the arc of human life,

1:20:49.520 --> 1:20:53.840
 you know, human existence through the centuries, there's no better way to be alive than now.

1:20:54.640 --> 1:20:59.760
 I mean, we're complaining about every single little thing. But life expectancy is at an all

1:20:59.760 --> 1:21:08.080
 time high sickness, all time low, poorness, misery, all time low. There's no better time to be alive

1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:14.800
 globally across all of human existence. Number one, number two, here in Boston,

1:21:14.800 --> 1:21:21.360
 there's no better place to be alive. If you think about the amalgamation of science,

1:21:21.360 --> 1:21:26.800
 engineering, technology, the ridiculously awesome people you're bringing every week to your podcast.

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:32.240
 I mean, this is the ancient Greece of modern society. But the weather still sucks.

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:41.280
 No, let me put it this way. The weather gives us a range of emotion. The full range of human

1:21:41.280 --> 1:21:46.240
 weather patterns. That's such a fascinating thing about human psychology. I often reread this book.

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:51.440
 I'm not sure if you're familiar with it. It's Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Franco. And

1:21:51.440 --> 1:22:03.760
 he talks about his living through the Holocaust and the concentration camps. And even there,

1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:14.240
 where there's like human misery, is that it's highest. Even there, he discovers these moments

1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:24.000
 by observing the suffering, by accepting the suffering. He observes moments of true joy of

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:31.440
 how great his life is relative to others at the camp who have it worse.

1:22:31.440 --> 1:22:37.040
 Yeah. So it's a dangerous slippery slope to think that way, because it's basically being

1:22:37.040 --> 1:22:43.040
 better than Jones's. And if the house next door has a giant car, then you want to get a bigger car

1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:48.880
 or something like that. It's not comparative misery. I think the way that I see it is slightly

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:56.320
 different. And it's not even thinking about all the worst possible outcomes that could have happened,

1:22:56.320 --> 1:23:03.520
 but didn't. The example, as you were talking about the concentration camps, one of the most

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:09.520
 horrible moments of human existence, I was thinking about pictures that I was seeing of kids in Syria,

1:23:09.520 --> 1:23:15.760
 in war torn zones. And you're looking at these kids. And again, I cried out loud,

1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:25.680
 imagining my own son in the van after a bomb explosion, watching his, you know,

1:23:25.680 --> 1:23:31.200
 father die or his siblings die or losing his friends. It's something that we are not

1:23:32.480 --> 1:23:37.600
 capable of fathoming. But if you actually put a seven year old in that situation,

1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:46.560
 the look that I saw in these kids eyes basically said, it is what it is. It was, it was, and I've

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:53.440
 experienced that with my own kid. When he gets like my three year old, last like two years ago,

1:23:53.440 --> 1:23:59.360
 who's not my five year old, she was burned really badly with like hot chocolate and coffee that

1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:04.160
 just peeled off her skin. So you could actually see just her fragile skin had just peeled off.

1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:11.600
 And she was the happiest little kid. She was just going along with the punches.

1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:18.800
 It is what it is. She accepted it. So, so it's, it's quite dramatic to sort of realize that

1:24:20.320 --> 1:24:26.800
 children don't say, Oh, I could have it better. They, they sort of

1:24:26.800 --> 1:24:35.040
 embrace the moment, not embrace, but sort of accept the moment. And then they can have moments

1:24:35.040 --> 1:24:43.360
 of pure joy in a horrendous war torn country. And, you know, like so many people from, you know,

1:24:43.360 --> 1:24:48.800
 these war torn countries basically say, Oh, you think you Americans are going to just come and

1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:55.840
 just send us a bunch of aid and food, et cetera. Yeah, sure. That's helpful. But what do we dream

1:24:55.840 --> 1:25:01.600
 of? What do we struggle for? We struggle for love. We struggle for meaning. We struggle for,

1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:06.480
 you know, emotions and friendships. We struggle for the same things you guys struggle for.

1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:10.400
 We're not just like every day waking up and saying, Oh, I wish I had more food.

1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:14.240
 No, that's just a given. I just don't have enough food. But what we struggle with

1:25:14.960 --> 1:25:20.800
 are basically everything else. And that sort of gives you some perspectives on life. It basically

1:25:20.800 --> 1:25:25.840
 says, you know, and another story that my mom told me when I was a kid is this story about sort of

1:25:25.840 --> 1:25:32.640
 this man who's basically, you know, see, he sees the Christ appear in front of him. He says, Oh,

1:25:32.640 --> 1:25:38.400
 Christ, I'm carrying all these problems. I'm carrying this big bag. Can you please take it

1:25:38.400 --> 1:25:44.960
 from me? And he's like, Sure, let me just give you any other bag. And basically,

1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:50.720
 and of course, the person in the end accepts his own bag. So acceptance ultimately,

1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:58.160
 basically, every single other bag is probably worse. It's the evil you don't know versus the

1:25:58.160 --> 1:26:03.440
 evil you know, like we all struggle with our own problems. But if you look at the bigger picture,

1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:10.480
 it's just your path through life. And if you embrace it, the good and the bad, every single day,

1:26:10.480 --> 1:26:23.120
 it's just joy, elation, sadness, misery. If you don't have both, you're not a complete human being.

1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:28.000
 You know, you can't I mean, the last example I'm going to give is the movie

1:26:29.440 --> 1:26:34.640
 Inside Out by Pixar. Beautiful movie. Which one is that the one with the little characters

1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:42.080
 controlling all the emotions? So you basically have joy and sadness and fear and disgust, etc.

1:26:42.080 --> 1:26:47.440
 And the moral of the story, if you remember the movie, the moral of the story is that in the end,

1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:52.800
 joy is basically trying to fix everything to make everything happy. And she's failing miserably.

1:26:52.800 --> 1:26:57.520
 And everything else is like crumbling and falling apart. And the little girl basically becomes

1:26:57.520 --> 1:27:02.240
 emotionless because all she knows how to do is fake happiness. And I think it's a very good

1:27:02.240 --> 1:27:07.440
 analogy for our everyday society where we're always saying, are you happy? Are you happy?

1:27:07.440 --> 1:27:11.600
 My mom calls me and she's like, Manolis, are you happy? I'm like, mom, stop asking this stupid

1:27:11.600 --> 1:27:17.200
 question. No, I'm not happy. What you should be asking is if I'm fulfilled. And that's a very

1:27:17.200 --> 1:27:23.600
 different thing. I don't go around being happy. I would love it if your mom called and said,

1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:27.280
 Manolis, are you suffering beautifully or something like that? It's exactly right. That's

1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:34.160
 what she should be asking. Are you struggling to achieve something great? That's the question

1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:39.520
 that mom should be asking. Here that mom called me about the suffering, not about how good are

1:27:39.520 --> 1:27:44.960
 you doing? So what I tell her is that life is not about maximizing happiness. Life is about

1:27:44.960 --> 1:27:50.000
 accomplishing something meaningful. And accomplishing that meaningful thing cannot come

1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:56.240
 from a series of joyful moments. It comes from a series of struggles, of successes,

1:27:56.240 --> 1:28:02.160
 and failures, of people being nasty to you and people being nice to you and embracing the full

1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:09.040
 thing. And if you supersede that constant need for gratification, if you supersede that constant

1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:17.520
 need for kindness, you suddenly know who you are. And what I like to say to my kid, and my son

1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:21.120
 the other day was telling me, oh, so and so called me such and such. And I'm like, are you such and

1:28:21.120 --> 1:28:27.520
 such? He's like, no. I'm like, ha ha, see, they were wrong. And what I tell him is if you know

1:28:27.520 --> 1:28:37.760
 who you are, what other people say about you only teaches you about them. Yeah. So it has no

1:28:37.760 --> 1:28:44.000
 influence on your self esteem. If you know where you stand, you embrace the good, but you also

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:51.200
 embrace the bad. I have plenty of bad, and I'm embracing it. I'm a procrastinator. How do I

1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:57.760
 deal with that? I trick myself into procrastinating about mindless, stupid little day to day things.

1:28:58.480 --> 1:29:01.280
 And in that procrastination time, doing important things for the future.

1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:08.880
 So accepting who you are, accepting your flaws, accepting the whole of it, accepting the struggle,

1:29:08.880 --> 1:29:16.000
 accepting the sleeplessness, accepting the fact that the journey is what matters, hoping that

1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:21.840
 your path to Ithaca is full of troubles because those troubles are the life you will lead,

1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:29.360
 accepting that life will not start after the next milestone that life has already started

1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:36.240
 a long time ago. And what you're experiencing now is the life. This is it. It's not some kind

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:41.600
 of future thing that you work yourself hard to get to. And then after that you live happily ever

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:46.240
 after. To me, the happily ever after, that's the end of the story. Nothing happens after that.

1:29:47.760 --> 1:29:50.880
 The struggle and the struggle and the struggle is much more interesting story

1:29:51.760 --> 1:29:57.120
 than they live happily ever after. So I think we have to embrace that as a society,

1:29:57.840 --> 1:30:03.520
 that it's not just about the happy ending, that our kids are brainwashed into expecting

1:30:03.520 --> 1:30:08.160
 that things will be happy and rosy and it's okay if they're not. And they should keep

1:30:08.160 --> 1:30:13.200
 struggling because the struggle is the journey and the journey is the meaning of life.

1:30:14.240 --> 1:30:20.560
 It's not the end. It's the journey. What about accepting one of the harder things? We talked

1:30:20.560 --> 1:30:28.640
 a little bit about immortality. What about accepting that life ends? So do you, Manolis,

1:30:28.640 --> 1:30:36.640
 think about your own mortality? How we talked about accepting that there's ups and downs to life.

1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:42.720
 What about the ultimate down which is the finality of it? Do you think about that? Do you fear it?

1:30:42.720 --> 1:30:51.280
 You also ask me if I'm afraid of getting older. Yes. And that's on the path to mortality. So let

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:58.640
 me talk about that first step and then the last step. The last step. Literally the last step. So

1:30:58.640 --> 1:31:06.400
 getting older, what does that mean? When I was 18, when I was 20, my brain I felt was at my maximum.

1:31:06.400 --> 1:31:13.200
 I was like, nothing is impossible. I can't solve anything. I could take any math puzzle, any logic

1:31:13.200 --> 1:31:17.920
 puzzle, any programming puzzle and just solve it in milliseconds. I just saw the answer through

1:31:17.920 --> 1:31:23.360
 problems. I was like feeling invincible. I would show up at lecture with my newspaper, lift up my

1:31:23.360 --> 1:31:28.480
 head every now and then, point to errors, just brat, complete brat. I would raise my hand and

1:31:28.480 --> 1:31:32.880
 correct my professor from the whole classroom. Total brat. I have some of those in my class now

1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:41.520
 and it's awesome. It's like very huge. I used to be you. It teaches you humility. So I felt invincible

1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:47.280
 and I was like, this is it. This is awesome. I'm living the life. 10 years later, my brain

1:31:47.280 --> 1:31:54.160
 didn't work the same way. I wasn't as good at the tiny little puzzles, but it worked in

1:31:54.160 --> 1:32:01.120
 different ways. And right now, 20 years later, it works in yet different ways. And oh gosh,

1:32:01.120 --> 1:32:08.720
 I love the journey. Can you maybe give some hints of the interesting different ways that your brain

1:32:08.720 --> 1:32:17.840
 works as it aged? Yeah. I went from the phase of sheer speed and hardcore quantitative thinking

1:32:18.480 --> 1:32:24.160
 to sort of stepping back, being able to sort of make more connections, being able to sort of say,

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:30.000
 yeah, but let's use that thing sort of a huge new creativity being unleashed. Basically,

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:33.680
 when you're young, you're sort of thinking about that one problem. You can sort of reconfigure

1:32:33.680 --> 1:32:38.400
 all the variables combinatorially in your head and just wipe it all out. When you're,

1:32:38.400 --> 1:32:42.880
 you know, it's a little older, you start getting more creative, you start bringing in things from

1:32:42.880 --> 1:32:47.680
 different fields and different contexts, and sort of stepping outside the box. Basically,

1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:51.680
 it's like being in the right race and saying, there's a ceiling. Why are we trying to get through

1:32:51.680 --> 1:32:58.960
 that? So it's sort of, you know, thinking outside the box. And then at 40, what I'm going through now

1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:04.960
 is this whole sort of embracing the path of life. And when I say life has started already,

1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:09.600
 it's not a test anymore. This is basically embracing the finality,

1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:19.040
 embracing that the journey is what it's at. So what I like to say is live every day,

1:33:19.040 --> 1:33:26.560
 as if it's your last one, and make plans as if you'll never die. I always have the long term

1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:31.840
 that I'm, you know, sort of planning out for that will eventually become the short term.

1:33:31.840 --> 1:33:37.520
 And I always have the sort of short term. And I think this ability to sort of look at life in

1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:44.000
 the back in the past and look at life in the future jointly and sort of embrace the continuity,

1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:49.840
 both of life in the universe and on our planet, as well as life as a human being from the beginning

1:33:49.840 --> 1:33:55.520
 to the end, just as a path as a journey, and just embracing every aspect of that. I mean,

1:33:55.520 --> 1:34:00.560
 I was talking about parenthood the other day and how amazingly fulfilling it is to sort of relive

1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:10.720
 childhood through the eyes of my kids, but with the perspective of a parent. So the sheer,

1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:21.440
 you know, arrogance of youth. Watching this in my kid, I can see myself when I was 18,

1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:26.880
 correcting my professor, I felt so proud. Little did I know that my professor was working on so

1:34:26.880 --> 1:34:30.640
 much more interesting things than the three little things he was putting on the board that day.

1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:36.800
 And I was like, I'm invincible. But in fact, no, just a little brat. And basically right now,

1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:45.600
 I sort of can see the sort of journey with a little more humility. I can sort of look at

1:34:45.600 --> 1:34:51.520
 my own students with their unbelievable abilities, being able to do things that I'm no longer able

1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:58.480
 to do better than I probably was ever able to do, but yet being able to guide them and shape

1:34:58.480 --> 1:35:04.960
 their thinking and blow their minds with new ideas and new directions through my perspective.

1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:10.960
 And I know when something is solvable because I've been there, but I'm not going to even bother.

1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:15.200
 It's not that I can't do it. I'm sure I could if I tried, but just I'm not interested in that

1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:22.560
 anymore. So what I'm embracing this journey of aging is how my brain is changing and how I'm

1:35:22.560 --> 1:35:27.120
 constantly trying to figure out the niches, the evolutionary niches that I'm best adapted for

1:35:28.880 --> 1:35:37.920
 for the tasks that I'm best at while hiring and recruiting both assistants and research scientists

1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:42.880
 and students and postdocs and, you know, that will be the best at those tasks.

1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:47.840
 But someone still has to see the big picture. And I love being in that role.

1:35:47.840 --> 1:35:54.000
 So you're at the time scale of a human lifespan, you're doing the same thing that the worm

1:35:54.880 --> 1:36:00.240
 did at the evolutionary time scale of growing arms. That's the specialization, the carp

1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:05.200
 compartmentalization. You talked about, I mean, it's fascinating to think of what

1:36:05.200 --> 1:36:13.840
 an 80 year old menolus would look back at the man that's sitting here today and laugh at the

1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:15.280
 silliness, at the arrogance.

1:36:15.280 --> 1:36:21.280
 He finally figured out something. I was like, no little thing. You didn't figure out anything.

1:36:21.840 --> 1:36:27.760
 I mean, ultimately, it seems that if you're introspective about life, it leads to a kind of

1:36:27.760 --> 1:36:33.120
 acceptance, a deeper and deeper acceptance of the whole of it.

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:37.680
 There, again, I want to be cautious about acceptance because it almost says that you

1:36:37.680 --> 1:36:43.920
 can't change it. It's sort of embracing the struggle and embracing the journey.

1:36:43.920 --> 1:36:45.040
 This is the way that I would put it.

1:36:45.040 --> 1:36:48.640
 So you, Walter Mayfield, the journey isn't just something that happens to you?

1:36:48.640 --> 1:36:54.240
 Of course. You shape it. Remember how I was saying that Boston is the best place and the best time

1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:59.040
 to live in right now, you know, in the history of humanity? I'm exaggerating a little bit.

1:36:59.040 --> 1:37:05.200
 But the way that I think about this is that if you look at the whole of cosmos,

1:37:06.240 --> 1:37:11.200
 where would you rather be? If you're just a bunch of molecules, roughly your biomass,

1:37:11.200 --> 1:37:14.800
 where would you rather be? Would you rather be a rock on Mars? Probably not.

1:37:14.800 --> 1:37:17.200
 Would you rather be in a black hole? Probably not.

1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:20.640
 Would you rather be in an exploding supernova? Maybe. That might be interesting.

1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:28.640
 But being on Earth is an awesome solar system, an awesome planetary system, an awesome place

1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:34.080
 to be in across all of space time. It's a pretty good place to be in as a bunch of molecules.

1:37:34.960 --> 1:37:41.760
 If you are a bunch of molecules on Earth today, being an animal with, you know, some kind of

1:37:41.760 --> 1:37:48.160
 awareness of the stuff around you is wonderful. Being a human among all animals is amazing

1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:55.200
 because you have all this introspection. And being a human who's young, fit, athletic, smart,

1:37:55.200 --> 1:38:03.120
 et cetera, I mean, you know, you have so much to be happy for. Beyond that, being surrounded by a

1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:07.840
 bunch of awesome people that you interact with all the time. I mean, I feel blessed to interact

1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:11.200
 with the people I know, with the friends I have, the dinners that I have, all of this,

1:38:11.200 --> 1:38:17.040
 the students that I interact with. I'm so blessed. And the last little blip in this

1:38:17.040 --> 1:38:23.920
 awesomeness of local maximum, the last little blip comes from being kind, being grateful,

1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:28.000
 and being kind. I don't know if you remember that little prayer that I described last time

1:38:28.880 --> 1:38:34.960
 of thank you for all the good you've given me and give me strength to give on to others

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:41.440
 with the same love that you've given to me. And the whole point of that is being grateful

1:38:41.440 --> 1:38:48.320
 and being kind. What does that do? From a purely egoistic perspective, it makes the people around

1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:54.720
 you happier. And it takes that little maximum a little bit further, because you'll be surrounded by

1:38:54.720 --> 1:39:00.960
 happy people by being kind. That's the purely egoistic view. And the purely altruistic view,

1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:08.080
 or maybe it's egoistic as well, is that it just, it's good to give. It feels good to give. Like,

1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:13.280
 basically watching somebody who's touched by what you said, watching somebody who's like

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:20.160
 appreciating a rapid response, or a generous offer, or just random acts of kindness is so

1:39:20.160 --> 1:39:26.560
 fulfilling. So evolutionarily, we were selected for that. They're just such a good feeling that

1:39:26.560 --> 1:39:31.440
 comes from that. You know, it's fascinating to think you said Boston is the best place,

1:39:32.240 --> 1:39:38.640
 and talking about kindness, that the very thought that Boston is the best place in the universe

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:50.720
 is almost, it's a kind of a gravitational field. Your thought and your very life in itself is a

1:39:50.720 --> 1:39:58.080
 kind of field that makes that real. So the self fulfilling prophecy, by claiming it's the best,

1:39:58.080 --> 1:40:04.160
 and thinking it's the best, it becomes the best. And you make others, it's not a force that just

1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:10.240
 applies to your own cognition. It applies to the others around you. And then suddenly you live in

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:16.080
 an even better place. Yeah. And it creates the reality, the actual reality that the social

1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:22.000
 reality, then it molds the environment. Exactly. What's one of the coolest things about you,

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:37.440
 I think, is you represent the best of MIT, like the spirit of MIT. I'm so glad that I'm

1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:46.560
 fortunate enough to be able to talk to you, because there's a kind of cynicism about academia in

1:40:46.560 --> 1:40:56.720
 parts that I think is undeserved, and that there's this MIT, of course, but academic institutions

1:40:57.760 --> 1:41:03.920
 is a sacred place where ideas can flourish, and just in the same very way that you're talking about,

1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:12.720
 is both kindness and curiosity, and that weird thing that happens when a bunch of curious

1:41:12.720 --> 1:41:21.040
 descendants of apes get together and just get excited in this ripple effect that happens.

1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:27.680
 I mean, that's the most beautiful aspect of MIT. People might think like competition and grants,

1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:36.960
 and position, like you said, the rat race, but underneath it all is these curious human beings,

1:41:36.960 --> 1:41:43.200
 inspiring younger human beings, and there's this ripple effect that happens, and I'm so glad that

1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:51.040
 I mean, I'm glad that I get a chance to record this, because it inspires so many other students

1:41:51.040 --> 1:41:57.280
 and so many other people to do the same, to embrace the inner curious creature that's not

1:41:57.280 --> 1:42:01.120
 about the race. So let's talk about the negatives. Let's talk about, no, no, no, I'm serious. I'm

1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:04.960
 serious. You know, you have to embrace the good and the bad. So let's talk about the negative.

1:42:04.960 --> 1:42:10.720
 As the Greek comes out. Let's address it. So why do people want positions of power?

1:42:11.360 --> 1:42:15.440
 Why do people want, you know, more money, more power, more this, more that?

1:42:16.080 --> 1:42:20.560
 Remember the part where I was saying, if you know who you are, what other people think about you,

1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:26.720
 it makes no difference to you. It only teaches you about them. Many people feel

1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:37.600
 defined themselves. They feel instantiated through the eyes of others. So being in a position of

1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:43.520
 power makes them feel better about themselves. Who knows what other kind of struggles they might have

1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:48.800
 that creates that need to feel better about themselves. But they have a bunch of struggles,

1:42:48.800 --> 1:42:53.360
 and everybody has a bunch of struggles. And every time I see somebody behaving poorly,

1:42:53.360 --> 1:43:00.880
 I'm basically thinking, well, they're in a tough spot right now. And it's okay. You know, I can,

1:43:00.880 --> 1:43:06.640
 I can kind of see how I would behave badly in other circumstances as well. So I think

1:43:08.240 --> 1:43:13.840
 if you take away that sort of having to prove yourself in the eyes of others,

1:43:15.200 --> 1:43:19.680
 life becomes so much easier. So when I first became a professor at MIT,

1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:27.200
 I started wearing adult clothes. It became a serious person.

1:43:27.200 --> 1:43:31.680
 I basically had, you know, I would always like go around in my rollerblades and my shorts and

1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:36.560
 a t shirt. And eventually I was a professional, like, oh, I bought all these khaki pants and,

1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:42.720
 you know, these nice like, you know, shirts with like, you know, whatever they call it, patterns.

1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:48.320
 And I was like, you know, dressing with my nice belt every day showing up. And then a few months

1:43:48.320 --> 1:43:55.200
 later, I was like, I can't stand it. And I just went back to my rollerblades and my t shirts and my

1:43:55.200 --> 1:44:02.080
 shorts. And it was this struggle of sort of not feeling that I fit in. I was so intimidated by

1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:06.800
 all of my colleagues, like just watching their incredible achievements, like persons next to

1:44:06.800 --> 1:44:13.200
 me and the person, you know, the floor below me, I was like, Oh my God, like, they clearly made a

1:44:13.200 --> 1:44:19.760
 mistake. What the heck am I doing here? How will I ever live up to these people's standards?

1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:30.000
 And eventually you grow up to realize that the way that I grew up to realize that the way that

1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:35.120
 other people perceived my work was very similar to the way that I perceived other people's work

1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:41.920
 as flawless. I knew all of the flaws in my work. I knew the limitations. I knew

1:44:41.920 --> 1:44:47.600
 what I hadn't managed to achieve. And what I saw was maybe a third of the way of what I was trying

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:54.080
 to achieve. And I saw everything as flawed. What they saw, what I had achieved, they didn't see

1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:58.880
 what I hadn't achieved. They only saw the one third down, which was pretty good in their eyes.

1:44:58.880 --> 1:45:05.040
 So they all respected me. And I was feeling miserable about myself. I was like, I'm not worthy.

1:45:05.040 --> 1:45:12.080
 I'm not worthy. And I think that this is a cognitive problem that we have. We kind of,

1:45:13.680 --> 1:45:17.120
 it's kind of like when we're talking about artificial general intelligence, AGI,

1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:21.360
 of sort of, we kind of have this definition that anything that machines can do is not

1:45:21.360 --> 1:45:25.520
 intelligent and anything that they can't do is intelligent. Therefore, we narrow and narrow

1:45:25.520 --> 1:45:29.840
 and narrow the field of what intelligence truly means in terms of machines. It's not

1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:34.080
 intelligent anymore. I feel like I was doing the same thing with myself. As soon as I could solve

1:45:34.080 --> 1:45:38.240
 something, it was the kind of thing that a kid like me could solve. And therefore, it was kind of

1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:45.360
 easy. But to the others, it seemed hard. But to me, it seemed easy. So it was this kind of thing

1:45:45.360 --> 1:45:50.320
 that everything that my colleagues were doing seemed impossible to me. But everything that I

1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:55.680
 was doing seemed impossible to them. So it was that realization that sort of made me mature into

1:45:55.680 --> 1:46:00.080
 sort of a not more confident, but more comfortable human being.

1:46:00.080 --> 1:46:05.040
 Can you actually linger on that a little bit? I mean, you mentioned Minsky. I remember he said

1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:13.360
 something in an interview where he said the secret to his, like the way he approached life was

1:46:14.240 --> 1:46:21.520
 to never be happy with anything he did. So there's something powerful as a motivator

1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:27.280
 to doing exactly what you're saying, which is everything you've achieved to see that as easy

1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:34.560
 and unimpressive. What do you do with that? Because clearly, that's a useful thing.

1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:40.400
 I think I've kind of matured past that. And I think the maturity past that is to sort of accept

1:46:40.960 --> 1:46:49.600
 what it is and accept that it has helped others build onto it. And therefore, advanced human

1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:54.960
 knowledge. So it's very easy to sort of fall into the trap of, oh, everything I've done is crap.

1:46:54.960 --> 1:47:00.560
 What I told you last time is that I always told my students that our best work is ahead of us.

1:47:01.680 --> 1:47:06.000
 And I think that's more of my mindset. That's a beautiful way to put it.

1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:12.480
 Exactly. What we've done is great. It's great for the time. And it'll become obsolete in 30 years.

1:47:13.280 --> 1:47:20.240
 Not we can. We are doing even better. Exactly. So basically, our next work will just strive.

1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:25.680
 And again, you can't let the perfect be the end of the good. At some point, you have to wrap.

1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:31.280
 I was having a meeting with my student yesterday, and it was like, listen, we know this is not

1:47:31.280 --> 1:47:37.360
 perfect, but it's way better than anything that's ever been done before. You know how to improve it.

1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:45.840
 But if you try to, your paper is never going to get published. So there's this balance of

1:47:45.840 --> 1:47:52.560
 we're already at the top of the field. Get it out. And then you work on the next improvement.

1:47:53.360 --> 1:47:56.640
 And in my experience, this has never happened. We've never actually worked on the next

1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:01.680
 improvement. And that's okay. It didn't make a difference because you're basically putting

1:48:01.680 --> 1:48:08.880
 a new stepping stone that others will be able to step on and surpass you. My advisor in grad school

1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:13.920
 would basically tell me, Annalis, let others write the second paper in that field.

1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:19.440
 Just write the first one, move on, move on to the next field. You don't want to be writing the

1:48:19.440 --> 1:48:22.320
 second and the third and the fourth and the fifth paper in the same field. Just,

1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:30.400
 and it's very shocking to a student to hear that because I was like, I was at the top of my game.

1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:35.040
 I was owning that field and I published the first paper. I'm like, I'm ready for two and three and

1:48:35.040 --> 1:48:42.000
 four. He's like, move on, just let it be. And I was like, whoa. And it's so liberating to sort of

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:49.200
 not have to surpass everyone, but just put your little stepping stone out there. And others will

1:48:49.200 --> 1:48:54.160
 step on it and put their own stones further and eventually cross a bigger river than if you try

1:48:54.160 --> 1:48:58.320
 to sort of make a giant leap all at once. So you need both.

1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:06.560
 Beautifully put. So the funny thing is, I believe I closed the previous episode with a Darwin quote

1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:14.240
 about the power of poetry and music and life. I think your quote, and again, I only heard once,

1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:21.120
 was Darwin basically saying, if I were to live life again next time, I would read more poetry

1:49:21.680 --> 1:49:25.680
 and something about art every week or something like that. Yeah. Yeah.

1:49:26.640 --> 1:49:33.120
 It's so interesting for somebody who studied life at a very cold, I would say genetic level to say

1:49:33.120 --> 1:49:42.480
 that, yeah, the highest form of living is the art. But like on that, which made me realize that you

1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:51.760
 write poetry and I forced you or maybe convinced you somehow to maybe share if it's possible,

1:49:51.760 --> 1:49:57.360
 if it's okay, some of the poetry you've written yourself in your life.

1:49:57.360 --> 1:50:05.440
 So again, being Greek, a lot of my poems have been pretty miserable. And I always like to say

1:50:05.440 --> 1:50:10.640
 that it's very hard for me to write a poem without what I'm happy. And I just have to be in a state

1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:19.040
 of deep despair in order to write poems. But the first poem I ever wrote was in English class.

1:50:19.040 --> 1:50:23.040
 I was, I'm Greek, I grew up in Greece, but I was in a French high school and I was taking English

1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:29.280
 as a foreign language. So the English teacher basically asked us to write a poem in English.

1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:35.360
 So this is basically what what I'm going to embarrass myself and read from my 16 year old

1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:39.920
 self many, many years ago. Can you give a little bit more context about who you were in this moment?

1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:46.080
 So here's what's really interesting. In terms of growing up, how do we grow up?

1:50:46.080 --> 1:50:53.680
 It's very difficult to grow up if you're in the same school going from one class to the other,

1:50:53.680 --> 1:50:58.240
 and all your friends know you inside out. It's very difficult to change. It's very difficult to

1:50:58.240 --> 1:51:02.400
 grow up because they have a certain set of expectations for who you are and for how you're

1:51:02.400 --> 1:51:09.040
 going to behave. So in many ways, we kind of tend to get set in our ways and not change very much.

1:51:09.040 --> 1:51:16.480
 I think something that helped me grow up is that when I was 11 years old, I was a kid in Greece

1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:22.240
 in primary school. When I was 12 years old, I was a kid in Greece in a, you know, first year of high

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:31.680
 school. When I was 13, I was in France. So basically moved countries and schools. The next year,

1:51:31.680 --> 1:51:35.680
 I moved schools again because it was a transition in the French educational system from one school

1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:41.120
 to the next. The next year after that, my family moved to New York in a French high school there.

1:51:41.120 --> 1:51:46.960
 And then the next year after that, I'm moving to MIT. So basically between 11 and 19, every

1:51:46.960 --> 1:51:53.760
 single year, I actually had the opportunity to grow. I was not held by people who knew me

1:51:55.040 --> 1:52:00.800
 and I could reinvent myself or reshape myself or reshape my, you know, sort of personality,

1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:05.920
 my emotions, my, you know, as I was growing up, especially in such a transformative time of a

1:52:05.920 --> 1:52:11.280
 kid's life from 11 to 17. Okay, first of all, it's so powerful that you think of it that way. Did

1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:16.640
 you think of it that way at the moment? Because it's kind of a source that you set an opportunity

1:52:16.640 --> 1:52:21.600
 to grow. It's kind of suffering. I mean, you're being torn away from the thing you know into a

1:52:21.600 --> 1:52:29.440
 thing you don't know. So when we moved from South France to New York, I was pissed. I was pissed.

1:52:29.440 --> 1:52:35.600
 I was taking these long bike rides in the countryside, jumping in French swimming pools,

1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:41.680
 and I had all these wonderful friendships going downtown and just staying by the fountains in

1:52:41.680 --> 1:52:48.000
 the dim lit streets of Exxon Provence in the south of France. It was magical. And suddenly,

1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:55.440
 I moved to New York City, a city of cement, of ugliness, like trash in the streets at every

1:52:55.440 --> 1:53:02.000
 corner. It's horrible. Snow everywhere. Having never seen snow or like real snow in my life.

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:06.960
 I moved from Athens to South France to Southern New York. So I was pissed. But

1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:11.840
 whether I saw it as an opportunity for growth, I don't think so. I don't think that I was that

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:18.960
 self reflective. It was just how it happened. I saw it like that probably pretty early on,

1:53:18.960 --> 1:53:23.440
 but not during those transitions. So basically, during those transitions, I was just a kid,

1:53:23.440 --> 1:53:32.240
 being a kid. And maybe the time that I started seeing it that way was maybe when I decided

1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:40.000
 to stay at MIT as a professor after having been there as a student. And I kind of saw the struggle

1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:47.840
 of getting professors to not see you as a kid when they're your peers. And it was very flattered when

1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:53.600
 one of my friends basically told me, oh, I remember you in recitation. When you first asked me a

1:53:53.600 --> 1:54:02.800
 question, I said, wow, this kid, I'll pay attention. One day will be a peer. So it's, you know,

1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:07.360
 certainly my perception was that many of them could not see me as anything but a kid. But

1:54:07.920 --> 1:54:11.600
 it turns out that some of them saw me as something different than a kid even before.

1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:16.400
 I was actually their colleague. So it's kind of an interesting place because what I like to say

1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:22.800
 about MIT is that people treat you as equal no matter what stage. And they respect you for

1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:28.400
 what you say, not for who you are when you're saying it. And if I'm wrong, my students will

1:54:28.400 --> 1:54:35.360
 tell me they will have no reservation to just be bluntly, you know, sorry. I don't agree with that.

1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:42.800
 Yeah, I mean, the beautiful thing about you is, sorry to put it this way is,

1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:48.240
 you know, maybe people who weren't familiar with your work beforehand might think,

1:54:50.160 --> 1:54:55.360
 like, might not realize that you're a world class scientist who leads a large group and so on.

1:54:55.360 --> 1:55:01.440
 They, because there's a youthful nature to you that it's, I mean, you talk like a first, like

1:55:01.440 --> 1:55:07.040
 an undergrad, you know, with the excitement and the fresh eyes and the sort of excitement about

1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:13.040
 the world. And that's, first of all, super contagious and beautiful. You know, it's easy to sort of fall

1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:23.280
 into behaving seriously because then people kind of start putting you on a pedestal more into a

1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:29.520
 position of power. You want to sort of act like you're in a position of power as opposed to allowing

1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:36.160
 yourself to be lost in just the curiosity, the childish view of the world, which is just this

1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:41.360
 open eyed love of knowledge. And that was the transition that I was describing when I decided

1:55:41.360 --> 1:55:48.000
 to go back to my rollerblades and t shirt and baseball cap. Basically, you know, when I met

1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:54.640
 my first postdoc, it was basically, you know, he was interviewing for postdocs at MIT. He already

1:55:54.640 --> 1:56:00.880
 had several first author papers to his name in top journals. And my friend, Julia, basically

1:56:00.880 --> 1:56:05.600
 introduced me to Alex Stark, who basically was interviewing at the time with Rick Young and

1:56:05.600 --> 1:56:10.800
 with Eric Lander, just like these massive names in the field. And I was just a first year faculty

1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:17.760
 person with, you know, zero credibility. And she basically says, Oh, there's this friend of mine,

1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:20.960
 Alex, who's visiting. He's also German. You know, he wanted to meet you. I'm like, Oh,

1:56:20.960 --> 1:56:25.600
 sounds great. I'd love to talk science. I show up. We sit at the amphitheater in Stada.

1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:32.960
 You know, I basically arrive in my rollerblades, you know, jump a few steps, sit down, wearing

1:56:32.960 --> 1:56:37.840
 my blades. We're having this awesome conversation about science and about gene regulation and how

1:56:37.840 --> 1:56:41.680
 the whole thing works. And sort of, you know, my perspective and his perspective, we're just

1:56:41.680 --> 1:56:46.800
 passing ideas for 30 minutes. And then I just dash off to my next meeting. And he basically

1:56:46.800 --> 1:56:50.880
 emails me afterwards. And I was giving him advice about how to interview with Eric Lander,

1:56:50.880 --> 1:56:54.800
 how to interview with Rick Young and how to sort of get a position with them. And then after,

1:56:55.360 --> 1:56:59.680
 after a while, he emails me saying, I would love to become a postdoc in your group. I'm like,

1:56:59.680 --> 1:57:11.120
 what? Are you kidding me? So, so he basically didn't care that I wear rollerblades and t shirt.

1:57:11.120 --> 1:57:18.400
 All he cared about was my ideas and sort of embracing the me with the childhood excitement

1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:24.000
 about science was basically what attracted him. It wasn't the, wow, this guy runs a big lab or

1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:27.680
 this and that. It was just like, I like his ideas. I want to work with him.

1:57:27.680 --> 1:57:33.120
 That, by the way, folks is the best of MIT. That's what MIT stands for. So that's a beautiful,

1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:38.000
 that's a beautiful story. But take me back to the poem and where did this poem come from?

1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:42.960
 So now, where's your mindset? So who is the 17, 16 year old kid, Manolis?

1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:49.440
 So again, I've just seen snow for the first time and I'm in New York.

1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:54.720
 This is New York. So I'm, you know, maybe that's where the sadness in the poem comes from. But

1:57:54.720 --> 1:57:59.600
 anyway, we're asked in class to write an assignment. This is my third language. I'm not very good at it.

1:57:59.600 --> 1:58:07.120
 So pardon me, but here's what I wrote. Children dance now all in row. Children laughing at the

1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:15.760
 snow. But in times endless flow, children sooner or later grow. Men are mortal. We go by. If we

1:58:15.760 --> 1:58:22.800
 know it, we may cry. But I thought a love so sweet was immortal was so deep. There I told you,

1:58:22.800 --> 1:58:29.520
 darling sweet, that forever love would keep. Blossom spring and summer shined. Then blue

1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:36.160
 autumn, winter died. One year passed, but the clouds still remember all our vows.

1:58:37.120 --> 1:58:44.880
 Never faked and never lied. All we did was stare and smile. All alone, sitting down, to the snow

1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:51.280
 we made our vow. But you told me you were right. Birds who love are birds who cry.

1:58:51.280 --> 1:59:01.120
 Now, with laughter, children play, yet the sky is so gray. Even if the snow seems bright,

1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:07.680
 without you have lost their light. Sun that sang and moon that smiled. All the stars have ceased

1:59:07.680 --> 1:59:14.560
 to shine. All of nature drew its grace, found its light within your face. Now you're gone

1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:21.840
 and won't return. Let the snow in my heart burn. There's a Greek. That's beautiful. That's beautiful,

1:59:21.840 --> 1:59:27.120
 by the way. And the rhyming, the musicality. There's a, there's a, both a simplicity.

1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:30.000
 I'm 16. And a musicality too.

1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:36.400
 No, no, no. But like, so I really enjoy like Robert Frost poems. I don't mean simplicity in a bad way

1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:40.960
 and a negative way at all. Again, it's very weird to analyze your own poem, but I think it captures

1:59:40.960 --> 1:59:44.720
 the simplicity of youth and the way that it kind of starts with children dance like only

1:59:44.720 --> 1:59:49.920
 low. It basically, and it kind of shows that snow can be interpreted first in the first verse

1:59:49.920 --> 1:59:57.840
 as a happy thing. And then in the end, you know, now with laughter, children play, I'm like,

1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:02.080
 now I've grown basically. It's, it's this transformation that we're actually talking

2:00:02.080 --> 2:00:05.680
 about. These whole men are mortal. We go by. I'm sort of, you know, you're saying,

2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:11.120
 are you comfortable with growing old? I'm like, duh, I was, I was, since I was 16. Yeah. And

2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:15.840
 what's really interesting is that, you know, again, when I was 12 years old in our summer house in

2:00:15.840 --> 2:00:21.360
 Greece, I remember sort of telling my sister my outlook that I would have as a father for how

2:00:21.360 --> 2:00:25.840
 to bring up my own kids. So it was, it's very weird that I've always sort of seen the full path

2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:32.880
 from, you know, a kid. When you were young. Yeah. I don't know if you'd like this Johnny Mitchell

2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:38.560
 song. I've looked at clouds from both sides now, from up and down and still somehow it's

2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:43.840
 no zillusions I recall. It's clouds illusions I recall. I really don't know clouds at all.

2:00:44.720 --> 2:00:48.160
 So it's, it's really beautiful. So, so I think the Johnny Mitchell song, which again, I heard for

2:00:48.160 --> 2:00:52.880
 the first time much, much after this. And I wouldn't even compare this to that. But what

2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:57.360
 Johnny Mitchell is saying that song is that you can see life from two perspectives.

2:00:57.360 --> 2:01:03.040
 You can see the good or the bad in both, you know, in everything you see. And I think that's the

2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:09.200
 allegory of snow right now. You can see snow as this bright, white, wonderful thing, or you can

2:01:09.200 --> 2:01:15.600
 see snow as this miserable, you know, gray thing. So that sort of, and what I like about the last

2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:20.720
 verse now with laughter children play is that it's a recall to the first one where I was the kid

2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:28.160
 I was the kid enjoying careless life and eventually was making promises that something would be

2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:33.120
 forever. And I think part of that is also the loss of my friendships in France, of being in New

2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:38.720
 York now and sort of everything's gray. And, you know, even though the snow seems bright,

2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:42.880
 without you have lost their light, sun that sang and moon that smiled. So it's this

2:01:42.880 --> 2:01:51.920
 concept that if you lose your love, the same thing can be perceived in a very different way.

2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:55.760
 Let me ask you this, because somebody wrote me this long email.

2:01:57.360 --> 2:02:03.840
 And I think you're the perfect person to ask this. You mentioned love

2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:16.880
 from a genetic perspective. What is it? What do you make of love? Why do we humans fall in love?

2:02:17.600 --> 2:02:24.320
 In your own life, why did you fall in love? You know, the email that was written to me was,

2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:31.920
 you always talk about mortality and fear of mortality, but you don't ask about love.

2:02:31.920 --> 2:02:40.000
 So I don't know if there's some thoughts you could give about the role of love in your own life,

2:02:41.360 --> 2:02:47.040
 or the role of life, the role of love in human life in general.

2:02:47.040 --> 2:02:54.640
 I think love in many ways defines my life. It's basically, I like to say that I'm a human first

2:02:54.640 --> 2:03:03.920
 and a professor second. And I think this passion for life, this passion for everything around us,

2:03:03.920 --> 2:03:13.040
 I mean, the only way to describe that is love. It's basically embracing your emotional self,

2:03:13.040 --> 2:03:27.040
 embracing the, you know, the non brainiac in you, embracing the sort of intangible, the

2:03:28.880 --> 2:03:35.040
 not very well defined. And even in my own research, I'm just very passionate about everything I do.

2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:40.080
 There's a certain passion that comes through. And what, I'm sorry, again, being Greek,

2:03:40.080 --> 2:03:44.560
 the etymology of the word passion, what was passion? Passion is suffering.

2:03:46.400 --> 2:03:49.840
 The etymology, I mean, when we talk about the passion of the Christ, it's a suffering.

2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:59.680
 And in the Greek version of that word, pathos, like pathology, pathos is deep suffering. It's

2:03:59.680 --> 2:04:06.800
 the concept and someone who's sympathetic. Sympathetic means suffering together, experiencing

2:04:06.800 --> 2:04:11.200
 emotions together. So it's funny that you ask me about love and I respond with passion,

2:04:11.200 --> 2:04:16.320
 passion for life, passion for research, passion for my family, for my children, for, you know,

2:04:16.320 --> 2:04:26.160
 so there's, there's a certain passion that defines me and everything else follows rather

2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:30.800
 than the other way around. I'm not first thinking with my brain, what is the most

2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:34.560
 impactful people we could write? And then going after that, I'm thinking with my heart,

2:04:34.560 --> 2:04:38.720
 what am I passionate about? What drives me? What's just like, you know, makes me take.

2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:44.480
 And that's a beautiful way to live. But I love it how the Greek part of you just kind of connects

2:04:44.480 --> 2:04:48.720
 it to the suffering. So if you could remove the suffering, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

2:04:48.720 --> 2:04:54.960
 when I say suffering, I don't mean suffering as in being miserable. I mean suffering as in

2:04:55.600 --> 2:05:00.720
 being emotionally invested in something. Remember, I mean, again, if you, if you look at this

2:05:00.720 --> 2:05:09.440
 poem, what is it saying? It's saying birds who love are birds who cry, right? It's that's the

2:05:09.440 --> 2:05:16.800
 very definition of love, exposing your fragility. If you're not afraid of suffering, you don't fall

2:05:16.800 --> 2:05:24.080
 in love. As soon as you hold back, you protect, you shield your heart. No love can enter.

2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:33.680
 So there's this Simon and Garfunkel song. I am a rock. I am an island. And a rock feels no pain.

2:05:34.560 --> 2:05:41.680
 And an island never cries. So again, there's some aspect of that into this poem. The, you know,

2:05:41.680 --> 2:05:48.000
 the fact that, you know, but you told me, you know, there I told you darling sweet that forever

2:05:48.000 --> 2:05:51.760
 love would keep is this intermediate thing. And then there's a recall, but you told me you were

2:05:51.760 --> 2:05:57.680
 right birds who love or birds who cry. So it basically says that love is the fragility

2:05:58.400 --> 2:06:06.400
 that you're willing to gift another person. It's opening up your vulnerable spots. It's sort of

2:06:06.400 --> 2:06:14.480
 accepting that there's no safety net. You're just giving yourself fully and you're ready to be hurt.

2:06:15.680 --> 2:06:20.000
 So you've already been way too kind with your time, but I'm going to force you to stay here

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:27.040
 just a few minutes longer as we're talking about goodbyes. You have a really nice other poem here

2:06:27.040 --> 2:06:35.440
 about goodbyes. Can I force you to read it as well? Oh, twist my arm, twist my arm. So the next poem

2:06:36.320 --> 2:06:42.560
 was written specifically for our high school yearbook. So another poem written on demand. The

2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:48.960
 rest of them are just so miserable written by pure, you know, sadness and melancholy. But this

2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:55.920
 one was also written on demand. And it was basically saying goodbye, as is appropriate right now,

2:06:55.920 --> 2:07:01.520
 to my friends and sort of again, reflecting this whole journey and transformation through life.

2:07:01.520 --> 2:07:06.960
 And also, I think showing a little bit of introspection about how we kind of had it easy in

2:07:06.960 --> 2:07:12.320
 high school. And we're about to go into rougher waters. So the title is actually the Tide Waters.

2:07:12.320 --> 2:07:22.080
 And it's an analogy on that. So here it goes. All this was another lake where some rest we sail

2:07:22.080 --> 2:07:28.960
 or stake. Waters calm and full of fish. We'll find there what we wish. Some seek fruit and others

2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:36.160
 feast. Some of us just look for peace. Some find freshness. Other love. Some seek both and neither

2:07:36.160 --> 2:07:43.360
 have. We were different when we came. Each his own story and fame. Different people had we been.

2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:49.760
 Different cultures had we seen. Different nature. Different face. Each unlike all in this place.

2:07:50.480 --> 2:07:58.560
 We had faith success, defeat. Then in one lake came to meet. There, the orders that we followed

2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:05.920
 and the pride that we swallowed made us one but not the same. Joined us strangers who there came.

2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:13.840
 Sooner, later, groups were made. Tribes where differences will fade. Some attached, more or

2:08:13.840 --> 2:08:21.440
 less. Others fought and made a mess. But again we have to go. What for? Where to? We don't know.

2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:28.400
 Still we know it. We will try. There to rush. To flee. To fly. There'll be some who wish to stay

2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:34.880
 but they'll carry on away. We'll continue on our journey as we came here, strong yet lonely.

2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:40.640
 From the lake a river flows. From the river many goals. On that river we will race.

2:08:41.200 --> 2:08:48.640
 Each will try to find his pace. In that scene, the sailors face. Their first fear, defeat,

2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:56.640
 disgrace. Here and there comes out a face that the waters soon embrace. Some get lucky,

2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:04.320
 find their way. Others sink beneath the waves. In this race we will part. Some will settle near

2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:11.520
 the start. Some set goals beyond the stars because the river carries far. You should know in what

2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:18.960
 we've done the hard part is still to come. So I'll have to say goodbye. Don't you worry,

2:09:18.960 --> 2:09:25.120
 I won't cry. Neither will they those who try till the end to keep their pride.

2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:30.080
 But please know, dearest friends, who are always there to mend.

2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:34.720
 I will always need your hand. I will miss you till the end.

2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:41.520
 I don't think there's a better way to end it. Manolis, like I said last time you're one of

2:09:41.520 --> 2:09:48.640
 the most special people at MIT, one of the most special people in Boston and whatever mental

2:09:48.640 --> 2:09:54.000
 force field that you're applying in saying that Boston is the best city in the world,

2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:58.240
 MIT the best university in the world, you're actually making it happen. So thank you so much
