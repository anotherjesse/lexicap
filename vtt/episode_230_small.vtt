00:00.000 --> 00:05.200
 The following is a conversation with Kelsey Sharon, Canadian forces veteran, artillery

00:05.200 --> 00:11.960
 gunner who served in Afghanistan at 18 years old and came home with severe PTSD.

00:11.960 --> 00:16.800
 She went on to found Brass and Unity, which creates unique jewelry, large part of the

00:16.800 --> 00:23.160
 proceeds from which go to help rehabilitate the lives, limbs and mental health of veterans

00:23.160 --> 00:25.040
 and first responders.

00:25.040 --> 00:30.160
 She has a big personality, big heart and an intense passion for life.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.400
 So when our paths happened across, I knew we needed to talk.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.480
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.880
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:40.880 --> 00:45.520
 And now, here's my conversation with Kelsey Sharon.

00:45.520 --> 00:49.560
 You mentioned that studying history had a big impact on you and that your grandfather

00:49.560 --> 00:52.120
 was a World War II vet.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.960
 So people that have gone through World War II in my family too, they don't seem to talk

00:55.960 --> 00:56.960
 about it much.

00:56.960 --> 01:00.480
 Like, the worse the tragedy, the less they talk about it.

01:00.480 --> 01:01.480
 I mean, it's understandable.

01:01.480 --> 01:09.000
 I can respect that, but I don't think people fully understood the value in human stories

01:09.000 --> 01:15.400
 over time and sharing that, that certain civilizations don't have written language.

01:15.400 --> 01:21.520
 The value in that being passed down is extraordinary, but we didn't really have that with the World

01:21.520 --> 01:22.520
 War II vets.

01:22.520 --> 01:23.520
 It seems like.

01:23.520 --> 01:25.840
 Well, they kind of want to protect you from the pain.

01:25.840 --> 01:31.920
 Like my grandfather, my grandmother went through Hollywood, which is the Ukrainian starvation

01:31.920 --> 01:39.320
 of millions of people, and then obviously went through World War II with the Nazi occupation

01:39.320 --> 01:46.400
 and same in the grandfather side, who on my dad's side, the grandfather fought in World

01:46.400 --> 01:47.400
 War II.

01:47.400 --> 01:53.280
 They seem to not want to talk about those experiences to protect you from the suffering,

01:53.280 --> 01:59.560
 to protect you from the evil that they've experienced, which is sad because the lessons

01:59.560 --> 02:02.840
 from that history are not then propagated through you.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.320
 And also, there's something about the strength you carry with you knowing that that's in

02:07.320 --> 02:08.320
 your blood.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.920
 Those great heroes are in your blood and that's suffering, overcoming that suffering is in

02:11.920 --> 02:12.920
 your blood.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.160
 I would argue that's exactly correct.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.680
 If you have someone you know that comes from your lineage that has done something super

02:20.680 --> 02:26.160
 gnarly, that's just been a badass in so many different ways, you want to know about that

02:26.160 --> 02:27.160
 person.

02:27.160 --> 02:28.160
 You have that person's blood in you.

02:28.160 --> 02:29.440
 That's important to acknowledge.

02:29.440 --> 02:35.320
 And when that isn't shared, I feel like it's just a detriment to that individual.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.960
 What do you make of World War II in terms of history?

02:37.960 --> 02:45.120
 Do you think about those kinds of wars where two times more civilians died than the number

02:45.120 --> 02:47.680
 of military personnel.

02:47.680 --> 02:54.040
 So most of the war is basically just the death of civilians and the invasion of homes, the

02:54.040 --> 02:57.080
 burning of homes, the bombing of homes, all of that.

02:57.080 --> 03:06.480
 World War II, for me, I find that was the first experience where I became just obsessed

03:06.480 --> 03:08.080
 with history.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.640
 World War II really did it for me.

03:10.640 --> 03:17.880
 I'm not sure if it's because of the dramatization of film and in TV and the way that our generation

03:17.880 --> 03:21.760
 has looked at it, but for me, it was more than that.

03:21.760 --> 03:28.440
 I felt a deep connection to it and I still can't figure out why, like a pull almost.

03:28.440 --> 03:32.480
 People joke around about those past lives and those things or those connections and

03:32.480 --> 03:36.360
 there's something deeper within me that feels a pull towards that.

03:36.360 --> 03:43.520
 And I'm not quite sure if it's because I had family that escaped Hungary once the Soviets

03:43.520 --> 03:45.600
 came in, so thanks for that.

03:45.600 --> 03:51.960
 Or if it was because my grandfather served in it or for whatever reason, I have this

03:51.960 --> 03:52.960
 pull to it.

03:52.960 --> 03:59.840
 And so when you think about the mass casualty of the civilian population, that's very difficult

03:59.840 --> 04:05.280
 for me to wrap my brain around after being in a war and seeing when you have a small

04:05.280 --> 04:10.080
 subset of civilians die, how much of an impact that has on that community right there in

04:10.080 --> 04:12.640
 just a tiny area.

04:12.640 --> 04:17.480
 So to try to wrap my brain around what happened in Europe and all across and all of that,

04:17.480 --> 04:22.680
 I really struggle with that because I don't know that I can comprehend what that would

04:22.680 --> 04:27.960
 truly mean to somebody if I didn't experience it or see it for what it is.

04:27.960 --> 04:28.960
 Does that make sense?

04:28.960 --> 04:29.960
 Yeah.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.280
 But so first of all, you're right.

04:32.280 --> 04:34.960
 A lot of people are drawn to World War II for different reasons.

04:34.960 --> 04:43.280
 The one is Hitler and Stalin trying to understand how it's possible to have that scale of evil

04:43.280 --> 04:46.160
 in a very different flavors of evil.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.200
 It's almost fascinating that human nature can allow for that.

04:49.200 --> 04:54.240
 And then also it's fascinating that so many people can follow leaders like that with the

04:54.240 --> 04:57.320
 pride and with the love of country.

04:57.320 --> 04:58.320
 Yeah.

04:58.320 --> 05:04.520
 And it's almost like this weird experiment is like, wow, I wonder if I'm made from the

05:04.520 --> 05:08.320
 same cloth as those people.

05:08.320 --> 05:15.440
 Would I be a good German if I lived in Germany and was during the time of Hitler?

05:15.440 --> 05:19.240
 Would I believe that Germany has been done wrong?

05:19.240 --> 05:25.800
 I'm Jewish, by the way, which makes me a little bit more comfortable talking about this.

05:25.800 --> 05:32.840
 Would I believe in the dreams sold by a charismatic dictator who says that wrongs have been done

05:32.840 --> 05:35.440
 and we need to correct those wrongs?

05:35.440 --> 05:41.440
 That to me is the compelling thing that draws me to World War II, the human nature question.

05:41.440 --> 05:42.920
 I would agree with you on that.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.400
 I think there's a way to look at people like that.

05:45.400 --> 05:50.960
 And at that time, there was no real, well, there wasn't a full understanding of the psyche

05:50.960 --> 05:56.080
 the way that we're starting to, I mean, we still don't understand any of it.

05:56.080 --> 06:03.000
 But it seems like the time gap back then, there was no real understanding of sociopaths

06:03.000 --> 06:07.320
 and narcissists and psychopaths and really what those traits were.

06:07.320 --> 06:12.600
 And I feel like people will follow blindly if they're given a good enough reason.

06:12.600 --> 06:18.480
 Well, if you have an individual who is ranting and screaming at the top of his lungs in the

06:18.480 --> 06:23.640
 middle of these town squares and he's getting this attention, it's human nature to want

06:23.640 --> 06:27.560
 to understand and be a part of a group mentality.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.440
 It's human nature to want to fit in.

06:29.440 --> 06:35.120
 And so I don't know if it's more of people were at the beginning were just, this is the

06:35.120 --> 06:41.600
 cool thing to do, or if it was, they were genuinely terrified, or if there was an aspect

06:41.600 --> 06:46.360
 that was like, this guy is saying something that resonates with me, there could be a lot

06:46.360 --> 06:47.360
 of different things.

06:47.360 --> 06:54.760
 I think it's unfortunate that we didn't get to or no one got to really examine this individual's

06:54.760 --> 06:59.440
 brain and this person and why they thought the way they thought, because that's always

06:59.440 --> 07:04.280
 been the biggest thing for me is I'm really curious about why people do what they do.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.000
 Like deeply, deeply curious about it.

07:07.000 --> 07:12.040
 I'm not sure who's more interesting, the people that follow Hitler or Hitler himself.

07:12.040 --> 07:17.480
 So I mean, the question that's coupled with that is, would history roll out in similar

07:17.480 --> 07:20.480
 ways even if there wasn't a Hitler?

07:20.480 --> 07:26.320
 It's the people that created a Hitler or did create the events of World War II.

07:26.320 --> 07:29.640
 I think the people would be more interesting in my opinion.

07:29.640 --> 07:35.520
 That seems to be the, that the charismatic leaders are all out there, the failed artists

07:35.520 --> 07:37.760
 in the case of Hitler, they're all out there.

07:37.760 --> 07:43.160
 And it's just, when there's this environment of anger and fear, charismatic leaders can

07:43.160 --> 07:48.560
 take over and it doesn't matter if they're evil or good.

07:48.560 --> 07:54.920
 It's like a roll of the dice in terms of history, what, how evil, how truly insane they are.

07:54.920 --> 08:00.160
 Like I think Stalin was much more cold than calculating.

08:00.160 --> 08:05.880
 He wasn't as insane as Hitler, Hitler was legitimately insane, like especially later

08:05.880 --> 08:10.440
 on in the war where he would do irrational actions, I would say.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.640
 But that, that's like a weird roll of the dice.

08:13.640 --> 08:18.400
 You could have gotten a totally different leader, wanting to take over the entirety

08:18.400 --> 08:21.880
 of Europe and then invading Russia.

08:21.880 --> 08:22.880
 That's like insanity.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.880
 Yeah.

08:23.880 --> 08:27.760
 That just even, just the first part of that wanting to take over Europe.

08:27.760 --> 08:33.520
 If you really think about the scale, if you really sit down and go, this one individual

08:33.520 --> 08:35.480
 was like, I want all of this.

08:35.480 --> 08:39.920
 If you really sat down and you were to sit down and put him in his traits that we know

08:39.920 --> 08:47.880
 of into any sort of document nowadays that, that deems somebody a psychopath or a narcissist,

08:47.880 --> 08:49.720
 this guy would set it on fire.

08:49.720 --> 08:54.560
 There's, you know, he himself was so, I think so damaged.

08:54.560 --> 09:00.200
 And he reminds me a lot of people now who, who struggle to find their way.

09:00.200 --> 09:06.240
 He reminds me a lot of angry individuals who are told no, either by women or by business

09:06.240 --> 09:10.680
 or by whatever the sector they're in.

09:10.680 --> 09:15.280
 He reminds me very much of that, like, what's the word I'm looking for?

09:15.280 --> 09:20.480
 Just that individual who is just like, the world is shit and the world owes me everything.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.360
 And just, it's that mentality.

09:22.360 --> 09:25.640
 He really came from that, it seems like.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.360
 And when you foster that too long, you get that.

09:28.360 --> 09:32.880
 There's a book called, what is it, Man From Underground by Dostoyevsky.

09:32.880 --> 09:37.840
 I might be misnaming the book, but it's about the bitterness of a man.

09:37.840 --> 09:42.040
 It's like, it breeds within his mind and it just grows that bitterness.

09:42.040 --> 09:48.640
 I mean, we all have that sort of resenting of the world when you're younger.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.040
 You have a choice.

09:50.040 --> 09:56.120
 When you fail, do you blame the world or do you hold, it's the jocco thing.

09:56.120 --> 10:01.200
 Do you hold, do you carry the responsibility of that and become a better man or woman because

10:01.200 --> 10:02.200
 of that?

10:02.200 --> 10:03.760
 That's the decision.

10:03.760 --> 10:09.800
 And in some sense, I mean, unfortunately, see, that's because he took responsibility

10:09.800 --> 10:10.800
 and leadership.

10:10.800 --> 10:15.120
 I know you can't, you can't say he wasn't a leader.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.400
 So it's not that he's a failure.

10:17.400 --> 10:22.360
 He's not a person, not a failure, but it's, you can't say he's powerless, did not take

10:22.360 --> 10:23.360
 action.

10:23.360 --> 10:29.640
 I think he's just basically embodiment of the anger and the fear of people at the time.

10:29.640 --> 10:35.200
 But the insanity of obviously many of my relatives, not just murdering them, but putting them

10:35.200 --> 10:37.440
 in camps and torturing them.

10:37.440 --> 10:42.040
 But many of those people, Jewish people, were also some of the best scientists.

10:42.040 --> 10:49.480
 The insanity of murdering some of the best Germans is, it makes no sense.

10:49.480 --> 10:55.760
 And so that's why it's fascinating to kind of look back at that time in history and think,

10:55.760 --> 10:57.800
 are these the same humans?

10:57.800 --> 11:02.000
 And also, are there echoes of that now?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.080
 And are we, is that going to happen again?

11:04.080 --> 11:08.840
 Is there going to be a World War III in some other kind of way?

11:08.840 --> 11:13.800
 Is there going to be some mass scale injustice in some other kind of way, which we're not

11:13.800 --> 11:20.960
 yet, like because of our blindness and maybe not learning the lessons of history will allow

11:20.960 --> 11:23.320
 it to happen again.

11:23.320 --> 11:27.960
 And then obviously it's a very common thing to whatever political leader you don't like

11:27.960 --> 11:28.960
 to call them Hitler.

11:28.960 --> 11:35.600
 Of course, which is, that to me, I got to tell you, when somebody calls somebody Hitler,

11:35.600 --> 11:40.280
 the weight behind that has been completely lost in this generation.

11:40.280 --> 11:45.560
 This generation does not understand what that truly means to call someone Hitler or

11:45.560 --> 11:47.560
 a Nazi.

11:47.560 --> 11:53.960
 Or Stalin, to be honest, the starvation, as I've just been talking to a lot of folks

11:53.960 --> 11:58.040
 recently, especially like North Korea, why you own me Park, starvation.

11:58.040 --> 12:05.320
 And I remember from my grandmother, it wasn't any time and time again, not having food to

12:05.320 --> 12:10.040
 eat is the thing that people say is the worst, everything.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.840
 It's way worse than murder, not having food.

12:13.840 --> 12:19.800
 And the places that takes your mind and the actions that forces you to do, that's terrifying.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.560
 And all of that seems very distant in our history.

12:22.560 --> 12:23.560
 Yeah.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.560
 I love her.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.960
 I watched that interview with her.

12:25.960 --> 12:29.760
 She is, I want to talk to that woman so bad because when she was on Joe and she sat there

12:29.760 --> 12:33.280
 and said, Joe's like, do you, have you done any therapy?

12:33.280 --> 12:34.280
 And she laughed.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.360
 I was like, oh, that's my girl.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.360
 It's such a fascinating.

12:37.360 --> 12:41.840
 I mean, I would love for you to kind of talk to her and explore her mind because we kind

12:41.840 --> 12:47.440
 of explored her story and that's, there's power and the importance of her story.

12:47.440 --> 12:56.280
 But it's so difficult to understand, like how does she become healthier and better even

12:56.280 --> 13:00.680
 more so than she's already, she's, she's recovered quite a bit.

13:00.680 --> 13:05.560
 You know, she's found herself quite a bit, but I wonder is she haunted?

13:05.560 --> 13:10.440
 You're saying questions I want to ask, like that's what I mean because after being in

13:10.440 --> 13:16.040
 a war, there are certain things, there are certain atrocities that you see that it doesn't

13:16.040 --> 13:18.440
 matter the therapy that you do.

13:18.440 --> 13:21.360
 And I don't care what all the special ops guys say, like, I know plenty of them that

13:21.360 --> 13:23.800
 have a light switch and they turn it off and they can function.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.640
 But I also know them when they've been out for 10 years.

13:26.640 --> 13:32.000
 There's things that haunt people differently, but there's no way there's not something going

13:32.000 --> 13:35.720
 on there deeply.

13:35.720 --> 13:43.360
 Yeah, but it's also extra levels of complexity in her case because I mean, this is what just

13:43.360 --> 13:52.640
 looking at history about family is she spent much of her early life loving the dictator.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
 Right?

13:53.640 --> 13:54.640
 Yeah.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.640
 We like the water or something.

13:55.640 --> 13:56.640
 Yeah.

13:56.640 --> 13:59.720
 We like water or we like this because there is no like individual, like when they said

13:59.720 --> 14:01.920
 there was no love or anything.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.680
 But there is a love for the...

14:03.680 --> 14:04.680
 Just that individual.

14:04.680 --> 14:05.680
 For that individual.

14:05.680 --> 14:09.440
 And so, I mean, it's like the ultimate abusive relationship.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.720
 Oh, yeah.

14:10.720 --> 14:15.280
 And but it's still love, the experience, like you don't know the alternative.

14:15.280 --> 14:22.680
 So it's not even, it's complicated because like, I wonder if you truly explored it what

14:22.680 --> 14:28.720
 you would find because the trauma, much of her trauma I think comes from when she was

14:28.720 --> 14:34.040
 escaping North Korea, treatment by China.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.040
 It's like the...

14:35.040 --> 14:39.880
 And her mom and when she had to witness within that and being helpless with that on her own.

14:39.880 --> 14:45.800
 So it's like evil men essentially abusing her, trading her and doing so nonchalantly.

14:45.800 --> 14:52.000
 Like it's part of just the way of life that I wonder if she sees kind of, yeah, it's so

14:52.000 --> 14:54.440
 complicated because childhood...

14:54.440 --> 14:57.240
 It would be normal to her because she didn't know any different.

14:57.240 --> 14:58.240
 Exactly.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.240
 And there's...

14:59.240 --> 15:08.560
 Like I grew up poor, but I never sensed that because everyone else around was too.

15:08.560 --> 15:09.840
 And so you don't notice it.

15:09.840 --> 15:11.720
 I mean, it's a cultural thing.

15:11.720 --> 15:16.520
 So the way you grew up, you only start to notice it when you compare yourself to others,

15:16.520 --> 15:18.320
 when you learn of the alternative.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.600
 That's a dark reality when you're abused.

15:20.600 --> 15:29.360
 You...I wonder...I mean, you truly begin to suffer in some kind of way when you understand

15:29.360 --> 15:32.520
 that you were being abused.

15:32.520 --> 15:38.720
 That's a dark kind of thought that I wonder if you live your whole life just in that abuse.

15:38.720 --> 15:45.760
 If you don't know better, that that's a safer...that's like, what's a better life?

15:45.760 --> 15:51.040
 Suffering and then learning that you are suffering or just suffering until your last days?

15:51.040 --> 15:52.720
 There's two ways to look at this.

15:52.720 --> 15:58.640
 I'd argue on one side that suffering and suffering till you die, you know no different.

15:58.640 --> 16:00.040
 So you can't have hope.

16:00.040 --> 16:03.560
 You can't have this idea that there's better.

16:03.560 --> 16:07.320
 And sometimes that's...keep that in its box.

16:07.320 --> 16:11.960
 But then if you have kind of what you have with Park where she knows now that there's

16:11.960 --> 16:16.240
 different, she knows that there's better, then you run into those, what is the damage

16:16.240 --> 16:17.320
 that has been done?

16:17.320 --> 16:19.720
 What is going to be passed on as intergenerational trauma?

16:19.720 --> 16:20.960
 I know she's a mom.

16:20.960 --> 16:25.100
 So it's like, now you got to look long term a little bit because now she's an influence

16:25.100 --> 16:26.200
 on a child.

16:26.200 --> 16:32.600
 And there's a positive to looking at both, I would say.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.520
 And I know that sounds horrible for the living and trauma your whole life and just not knowing

16:36.520 --> 16:37.920
 any better.

16:37.920 --> 16:45.560
 But there's, I don't know if that saves the brain and the body and just that overall or

16:45.560 --> 16:50.080
 if it actually would be better because there's no way to really find that out.

16:50.080 --> 16:51.080
 I don't think.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.080
 Yeah, I think.

16:52.080 --> 16:57.120
 But the reality is when you give people hope and you make them realize that they're suffering,

16:57.120 --> 17:01.840
 you're putting a burden on them, that's the first step on a long journey.

17:01.840 --> 17:05.440
 And obviously she, now that she knows that the suffering she wants to make people in

17:05.440 --> 17:10.720
 North Korea currently suffer less and that's the admirable goal.

17:10.720 --> 17:16.560
 It's what we do to each other is try to like, when you see suffering in the world, you try

17:16.560 --> 17:23.920
 to make it better and unmask that's probably in the long arc of history going to make for

17:23.920 --> 17:25.080
 a better world.

17:25.080 --> 17:28.440
 I'm hopeful at that idea for North Korea.

17:28.440 --> 17:35.160
 I'm hopeful for that because you never want to leave individual suffering when you know

17:35.160 --> 17:38.280
 that they're actively suffering while you're just living your day to day life in the Western

17:38.280 --> 17:42.000
 world just out grocery shopping and you see all this food and you know in the back of

17:42.000 --> 17:45.680
 your mind, like that interview fucked me up a little but I won't lie, like I had some

17:45.680 --> 17:51.040
 of the girls in my office listen to it, they're just bawling because there's, we're all parents

17:51.040 --> 17:57.400
 and there's this idea that not being able to feed our children, that just the idea of

17:57.400 --> 17:59.080
 that damages the psyche.

17:59.080 --> 18:04.280
 It brings up the pain in the chest, like just the idea of it and so going to the grocery

18:04.280 --> 18:06.320
 store for about a week after that.

18:06.320 --> 18:11.080
 I just remember standing there looking and just going, fuck, what are we doing?

18:11.080 --> 18:16.920
 But then there's that snap reality that comes into play and goes, so how do we fix that?

18:16.920 --> 18:19.760
 You got to take on China.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.960
 That's never going to happen.

18:21.960 --> 18:24.520
 And the reason that's not going to happen, it's happening again.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.640
 So Akani comes down through Afghanistan, Chinese are all through Afghanistan, Iran makes the

18:29.640 --> 18:34.880
 deal with China for the roadway to get the oil, well that's done in the blink of an eye

18:34.880 --> 18:36.560
 without anyone knowing.

18:36.560 --> 18:43.040
 There's no way, there's just so much at play with China, they control such a large aspect

18:43.040 --> 18:50.040
 of our world, unfortunately that to take and free North Korea, a drastic action would have

18:50.040 --> 18:54.240
 to happen and then your people would come in, it would be a mess.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.480
 What do you mean your people?

18:55.480 --> 18:57.000
 What do you mean your people?

18:57.000 --> 18:58.000
 You're Russians.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.560
 Did you hear what she said about Russians?

19:00.560 --> 19:01.560
 Did you hear what she said?

19:01.560 --> 19:02.560
 Russians?

19:02.560 --> 19:03.560
 I love Russians.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.560
 You know what I didn't love?

19:04.560 --> 19:07.720
 The Russian recruiting video that came out, that shit was terrifying.

19:07.720 --> 19:08.720
 Did you watch it?

19:08.720 --> 19:09.720
 No.

19:09.720 --> 19:10.720
 I told you about it and of course you didn't watch it.

19:10.720 --> 19:11.720
 I didn't watch it.

19:11.720 --> 19:12.880
 Oh, shocker.

19:12.880 --> 19:20.120
 The USA put out a recruiting video and then a day or two later Russia put one out and

19:20.120 --> 19:27.960
 the recruiting video in the States was an animation of a female soldier with two moms

19:27.960 --> 19:31.920
 and she was going to go change the world, right?

19:31.920 --> 19:36.040
 Russia came out with one.

19:36.040 --> 19:40.920
 It's the character from Rocky essentially and there are guys in the mud and just in

19:40.920 --> 19:44.680
 the rain just fucking do and push, I'm just pushing it out, they're just like, they see

19:44.680 --> 19:48.920
 their boot, they're just like crushing things and I'm like, and it's all like, and the deep

19:48.920 --> 19:51.800
 Russian voice, I'm like, oh my God.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.360
 Which one is better, would you say?

19:53.360 --> 19:56.000
 Which bothered you more?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.960
 What do you mean by bother, specify?

19:58.960 --> 20:02.600
 So deception is a funny thing because when you're young and you're choosing to go to

20:02.600 --> 20:07.640
 the military or not, it's not like you know, like none of us know what the best trajectory

20:07.640 --> 20:08.640
 for a life is.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.640
 Right.

20:09.640 --> 20:13.520
 For many people go to the military is it really makes them incredible human beings.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.360
 Some of the best people in this world, I know are soldiers.

20:16.360 --> 20:20.360
 So it's, I'm not, I don't mean like it's somehow bad to go to the military.

20:20.360 --> 20:25.800
 I think it's a great choice, but there is something, the honest truth is I just don't

20:25.800 --> 20:28.560
 like marketing people.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.640
 And so this is essentially a marketing effort.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.920
 Yeah, it is a marketing effort.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.800
 And so which one do you like as a marketing effort better?

20:34.800 --> 20:35.800
 Russia.

20:35.800 --> 20:36.800
 Okay.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.800
 Yeah, I do.

20:37.800 --> 20:38.800
 There you go.

20:38.800 --> 20:39.800
 I do.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.520
 Because Canada doesn't, you know what our recruiting videos are?

20:41.520 --> 20:44.200
 It's like, I love it.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.200
 They're the best.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.200
 Sorry, A.

20:46.200 --> 20:47.200
 Yeah.

20:47.200 --> 20:48.200
 Oh, fuck, here we go.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.200
 It's starting.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
 It's started.

20:50.200 --> 20:51.200
 Awesome.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.760
 So Canada does these ones where it's like that'll have a bunch of like soldiers doing

20:55.760 --> 20:58.320
 movements and then they'll like snip it together really quick.

20:58.320 --> 21:02.880
 It'll be like a Navy one and then a guy jumping of a plane and then it'll be like an artillery

21:02.880 --> 21:07.640
 and then like an armored and it'll be like, join the Canadian forces today.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.320
 And like that's like their, their videos.

21:10.320 --> 21:16.040
 So it's like very marketable, very palatable to Canadians who don't really want war and

21:16.040 --> 21:20.000
 who don't really acknowledge their military in the first place and do everything they

21:20.000 --> 21:24.200
 can to make sure that vets don't get any support when they come home.

21:24.200 --> 21:27.680
 So they, I can see why that one is acceptable.

21:27.680 --> 21:33.000
 What Russia did was meant to be more of an intimidation tactic, in my opinion.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.080
 I like that style better though.

21:35.080 --> 21:38.640
 I think we need harder, I think we need people to be harder.

21:38.640 --> 21:43.560
 I think it's acceptable and okay to say that our soldiers need to have a harder mindset,

21:43.560 --> 21:48.200
 a stronger mindset, a better mentality and mental health support going into the service

21:48.200 --> 21:54.240
 and a harder body because I know when you go to the US, I've also encountered plenty

21:54.240 --> 21:57.040
 of soldiers that are 600 pounds.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.360
 What are you going to do?

21:59.360 --> 22:03.200
 So we should say that you, when you joined the military, you were in incredible shape

22:03.200 --> 22:05.720
 or not maybe incredible, but very good shape.

22:05.720 --> 22:06.720
 No, I was in incredible shape.

22:06.720 --> 22:07.720
 It was the best shape in my life.

22:07.720 --> 22:08.720
 Yeah.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.720
 Yeah.

22:09.720 --> 22:10.720
 So.

22:10.720 --> 22:11.720
 I'm okay with that.

22:11.720 --> 22:12.720
 It's okay.

22:12.720 --> 22:13.720
 I, you know what?

22:13.720 --> 22:14.720
 I used to do setups.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.720
 Yeah.

22:15.720 --> 22:18.160
 Like no, I would do setups in the morning when I was little until I could see my, like

22:18.160 --> 22:21.560
 I always had a six pack because all I did was train.

22:21.560 --> 22:26.160
 But like if I couldn't like see it, I would just sit there in morning cartoons and just

22:26.160 --> 22:27.160
 do sit ups.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.200
 And my mom and dad thought that was like normal acceptable behavior.

22:30.200 --> 22:33.640
 So if you had like Instagram back then you'd be a David Goggins, you would be just like

22:33.640 --> 22:34.640
 screaming.

22:34.640 --> 22:35.640
 Without the cursing.

22:35.640 --> 22:36.840
 That cursing started once the military started.

22:36.840 --> 22:37.840
 Okay.

22:37.840 --> 22:38.840
 Got it.

22:38.840 --> 22:42.120
 So I mean, the people should know, is it probably already know that you also competed

22:42.120 --> 22:43.120
 in Taekwondo?

22:43.120 --> 22:44.120
 Yeah.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.120
 Like you were an athlete of all kinds.

22:45.120 --> 22:47.400
 They even saw rugby in there.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.400
 Yeah.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.280
 I was, I was, I was good at rugby.

22:50.280 --> 22:55.920
 I played that for seven, six years, I guess you could say total.

22:55.920 --> 23:00.880
 I think the worst injury I ever ended up having was I tore my right eyelid off.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.680
 We were doing an exhibition game.

23:02.680 --> 23:04.000
 I don't do exhibition games.

23:04.000 --> 23:05.920
 Well, I don't do like for fun.

23:05.920 --> 23:07.920
 Well, I don't do like very competitive.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.920
 No, not me.

23:09.920 --> 23:10.920
 So you're being funny.

23:10.920 --> 23:11.920
 Ah, there it is.

23:11.920 --> 23:12.920
 He gets it.

23:12.920 --> 23:13.920
 You see, he's not.

23:13.920 --> 23:14.920
 He's not.

23:14.920 --> 23:23.960
 What I was saying though to you was that we did an exhibition game and the team ahead

23:23.960 --> 23:24.960
 was winning.

23:24.960 --> 23:28.400
 The team we were playing was winning, which was annoying.

23:28.400 --> 23:33.680
 And so there was an opportunity to take out a girl that was going one end of the field

23:33.680 --> 23:34.680
 to the other.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.840
 And she just kept hitting tries left, right and center.

23:36.840 --> 23:37.840
 She was fast.

23:37.840 --> 23:42.760
 So I figured if I just aimed her up, like she's a target and I just run full force at

23:42.760 --> 23:47.160
 her because she was really, she was a tall individual, but I just, if I do that, I'll

23:47.160 --> 23:48.480
 take her out of the knees.

23:48.480 --> 23:50.760
 So I did that.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.920
 But what that resulted in was she put her tooth through her mouth guard and knocked

23:53.920 --> 23:55.480
 out and didn't just, she just stayed there.

23:55.480 --> 24:00.960
 But when I stood up, I tore the right eyelid off and it was hanging from the inner corner.

24:00.960 --> 24:07.880
 My mom was there because mom was my mom's my biggest fan and she's supportive of everything.

24:07.880 --> 24:08.880
 I shouldn't miss a game.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.880
 She didn't miss anything.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.560
 And I stood up and I kind of turned around and we had already had a girl break her nose

24:14.560 --> 24:15.560
 that day.

24:15.560 --> 24:19.040
 So she was on the sideline with her nose sideways and just bloody.

24:19.040 --> 24:22.760
 My mom was like, I'll take her to the emergency after once the game's over.

24:22.760 --> 24:26.680
 And so I turned around and looked at her and she just, she almost vomited on the spot and

24:26.680 --> 24:27.680
 I was like, what's wrong?

24:27.680 --> 24:29.960
 She's like, don't move your eyelids off.

24:29.960 --> 24:32.720
 I'm like, but I can see like I was trying to blink.

24:32.720 --> 24:36.040
 But like it was just down so I could just constantly see.

24:36.040 --> 24:37.880
 She's like, we're just, we're just going to go to the emergency.

24:37.880 --> 24:39.600
 We're just going to go there now.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
 Was there blood?

24:40.600 --> 24:41.600
 Yeah.

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
 There's lots of it.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.600
 But I didn't, I couldn't really tell.

24:43.600 --> 24:44.600
 Okay.

24:44.600 --> 24:45.600
 Were you okay with blood?

24:45.600 --> 24:46.600
 Yeah.

24:46.600 --> 24:47.600
 That point.

24:47.600 --> 24:48.600
 Yeah.

24:48.600 --> 24:49.600
 I guess you did taekwondo and all that.

24:49.600 --> 24:50.600
 Yeah.

24:50.600 --> 24:51.600
 I didn't get knocked out very often.

24:51.600 --> 24:54.080
 I didn't really, when I was younger in taekwondo, I was really good.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.440
 I only lost a handful of times.

24:56.440 --> 24:59.120
 So when I did lose, that was bad.

24:59.120 --> 25:04.520
 But I never had like a broken nose or a lot of blood on my feet, like nothing like that

25:04.520 --> 25:05.520
 really.

25:05.520 --> 25:07.960
 So nothing freaked me out too much.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.720
 Was there aggression there or just purely competition over skill?

25:11.720 --> 25:14.040
 A mix of both.

25:14.040 --> 25:21.640
 I was, this was right after not too long after my coach went to prison for statutory rape.

25:21.640 --> 25:27.840
 And that was like how you talk about Park talking about how that was like, she knew

25:27.840 --> 25:31.040
 love because of that person.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.480
 That person was like a God to me.

25:33.480 --> 25:36.280
 And so when that happened, I was just an angry individual from that point on.

25:36.280 --> 25:38.720
 So there was competition and aggression mixed in there.

25:38.720 --> 25:45.160
 Oh, like it was betrayal that there's somebody that is, was a symbol of love for you, could

25:45.160 --> 25:46.680
 also be a very bad person.

25:46.680 --> 25:52.040
 I used to eat, sleep and breathe, whatever that man said from four years old on.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.600
 I lived with my coaches at a point.

25:54.600 --> 25:55.760
 So I could train that much.

25:55.760 --> 25:58.200
 I helped look after their daughter.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.280
 I was at the club 24 seven.

26:00.280 --> 26:03.120
 It just the idea that somebody could do something like that.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.120
 Yeah.

26:04.120 --> 26:05.920
 That really messed me up.

26:05.920 --> 26:10.200
 Where were you on 9 11?

26:10.200 --> 26:20.680
 I was 11 and I was in my parents basement in where Ontario, Ontario, Canada.

26:20.680 --> 26:26.760
 What did you think of 9 11 at that age from Canada that have an impact on you in terms

26:26.760 --> 26:35.720
 of changing the, the level of evil you thought is there in the world today?

26:35.720 --> 26:36.720
 Not initially.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.440
 I remember it really vividly.

26:38.440 --> 26:41.520
 I have a decent memory for certain things.

26:41.520 --> 26:44.840
 It seems like stuff like that I'd stick with really well.

26:44.840 --> 26:49.960
 I remember watching and I was sitting in the couch and my mom, my mom called my dad because

26:49.960 --> 26:51.440
 my, my parents are truck drivers.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.440
 My dad was on the road.

26:52.440 --> 26:54.080
 I'm not mistaken.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.560
 And he would go in and out of cities all the time.

26:56.560 --> 26:57.720
 And I think he was on the East coast.

26:57.720 --> 26:59.120
 My mom was like a little panicky.

26:59.120 --> 27:03.960
 So she, she tried to get ahold of him on the, I think she, the time it was like beepers

27:03.960 --> 27:09.560
 and um, yeah, so he would get a beep, he would go to a payphone to call us and he was fine.

27:09.560 --> 27:15.240
 And um, I remember my mom being like really upset and I couldn't quite grasp why she was

27:15.240 --> 27:16.240
 so upset.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.680
 I knew something really bad had happened.

27:18.680 --> 27:24.320
 It's when I then saw the second plane go into the tower and I remember her just like

27:24.320 --> 27:28.640
 the stereotypical like hand over her mouth and she just felt sick and she just was so

27:28.640 --> 27:33.200
 confused and I knew it was bad, but I didn't fully grasp it.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.760
 And we went to school that day and they had talked about it briefly.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.400
 You could hear the teachers kind of reminiscing about it.

27:39.400 --> 27:47.520
 There was a point the, that week that all of a sudden all of the children who were from

27:47.520 --> 27:50.720
 a Middle Eastern family were not the school.

27:50.720 --> 27:54.760
 I just remember them saying like a lot of people aren't coming to school, but it was,

27:54.760 --> 27:59.720
 it was in particular that I think parents were afraid once it got out that it was of

27:59.720 --> 28:03.760
 a certain group, they were afraid for their own kids.

28:03.760 --> 28:07.760
 And fair enough, I mean, you never know, you don't know.

28:07.760 --> 28:13.480
 And I knew it impacted me enough that I did write, I remember I, the school was doing

28:13.480 --> 28:19.640
 a memorial for it and I remember they asked, I wrote a poem and a reporter was there and

28:19.640 --> 28:20.880
 I read it on air.

28:20.880 --> 28:26.280
 That's like, I remember like, it was, it was like, it was a very short one, but I remember

28:26.280 --> 28:30.960
 I wanted to do something, but I didn't know why or for, for what reason, I just, I knew

28:30.960 --> 28:34.680
 I wanted to do something to honor it, but I didn't, I couldn't grasp why.

28:34.680 --> 28:36.920
 You eventually went to Afghanistan.

28:36.920 --> 28:37.920
 Yeah.

28:37.920 --> 28:43.880
 Did that begin to plant the seed of thinking about conflict in the world?

28:43.880 --> 28:45.160
 It's a good question.

28:45.160 --> 28:47.120
 I never thought about it that in depth.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.640
 I mean, I've done 12 years of therapy.

28:48.640 --> 28:51.720
 You think that would have come up, Dr. Passi, but apparently not.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.320
 We'll work on it though.

28:53.320 --> 28:58.920
 I mean, when did like, when did the idea of war start entering your mind?

28:58.920 --> 28:59.920
 Late high school.

28:59.920 --> 29:00.920
 I think it was for me.

29:00.920 --> 29:04.400
 Um, I was, I finished high school at 17.

29:04.400 --> 29:08.720
 I moved away and went to college and went to Algonquin college because I wasn't smart

29:08.720 --> 29:14.480
 enough to get into Ottawa U. So I was like, well, Algonquin, she is, I just wanted to

29:14.480 --> 29:18.280
 play sports and frankly, I wanted away from my small town that I was living in.

29:18.280 --> 29:22.160
 I went through like a bad high school breakup as a kid and you know, that where you think

29:22.160 --> 29:27.040
 that's like the love of your life and you just can't bear to be anywhere near anybody.

29:27.040 --> 29:30.480
 And so I, I moved away as fast as I possibly could.

29:30.480 --> 29:36.640
 And I didn't grasp it still at that point.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.640
 Love and heartbreak.

29:38.640 --> 29:39.640
 Okay.

29:39.640 --> 29:42.640
 Why did you become a soldier?

29:42.640 --> 29:45.280
 Why did you want to become a soldier?

29:45.280 --> 29:48.760
 My parents told me from an early age, they always figured I would either be a cop.

29:48.760 --> 29:53.880
 I would do, they didn't think military, but they thought it would be like a type A personality,

29:53.880 --> 29:57.040
 possibly carry a gun situation.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.400
 And um, I had never hunted before.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.520
 We never had guns in our house.

30:00.520 --> 30:03.920
 I was never exposed to weapons of any kind.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.320
 If anything, it was, it was the opposite.

30:06.320 --> 30:10.440
 We just, all the hunters on the property, like all the deer would come to our property

30:10.440 --> 30:13.880
 and all the hunters would be, no, I'm not, my mom would put salt looks out so that they

30:13.880 --> 30:14.880
 wouldn't get killed.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.640
 Your property was the safe space for the deer.

30:16.640 --> 30:17.640
 Yeah.

30:17.640 --> 30:22.040
 So they had guns of forest and they just, we had two turkeys that used to walk up and

30:22.040 --> 30:23.440
 down the driveway every day.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.280
 We had bears in there and nobody bothered them.

30:26.280 --> 30:30.080
 And so there was no aspect of like, I want to go kill shit.

30:30.080 --> 30:31.080
 That was not like a thing.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.080
 I had no idea.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.800
 I wanted to take anybody off the face of the earth or anything.

30:35.800 --> 30:41.160
 I went to school and because I'm a history person, I, my parents has always, always made

30:41.160 --> 30:46.400
 it really important that remembrance day is the thing in our life.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.480
 So that's veterans day for you.

30:47.480 --> 30:51.760
 So it's November 11th and it's, you go, you honor.

30:51.760 --> 30:55.960
 I don't care if you don't want to go, I don't care if it's raining, you go.

30:55.960 --> 31:01.520
 And so I went to the remembrance day ceremony in Ottawa that year, which was, it's our capital,

31:01.520 --> 31:04.840
 which is, yeah, it's our capital and it's really small.

31:04.840 --> 31:12.280
 And so I went, but I took the bus and I was on the bus back to Algonquin and I met a lady

31:12.280 --> 31:15.800
 who was like a World War II vet, really old lady.

31:15.800 --> 31:19.160
 She had an Air Force uniform on and just like this row of medals.

31:19.160 --> 31:25.560
 And I mean, I think you can tell by our limited to extreme interactions we've had over the

31:25.560 --> 31:26.800
 short period of time.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.200
 I'm curious and I'll just ask you.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.520
 And so I just got up and talked to her and just started talking to her.

31:32.520 --> 31:37.520
 And she didn't say like, I don't remember exactly her words, but she'd served.

31:37.520 --> 31:42.920
 She was one of the first females to fly and, you know, all, all of these kinds of things

31:42.920 --> 31:47.400
 that stuck in my head and we just kind of kept talking and I missed my stop.

31:47.400 --> 31:52.000
 And then I finished talking to her and I got back on the bus and went back to the college

31:52.000 --> 31:58.160
 and walked into my, uh, my small apartment where I had two roommates, these two guys

31:58.160 --> 32:00.960
 I went to high school with one of them I went to high school with one was from out of town

32:00.960 --> 32:03.840
 and I just didn't like what I was.

32:03.840 --> 32:04.840
 I wasn't happy.

32:04.840 --> 32:08.320
 I wasn't doing what I wanted to do.

32:08.320 --> 32:11.400
 And I didn't know what I wanted to do truthfully.

32:11.400 --> 32:14.600
 Something just said, why don't you join the army?

32:14.600 --> 32:17.680
 Like in myself, my, my self talk was like, let's just join the military.

32:17.680 --> 32:18.680
 Let's do it.

32:18.680 --> 32:19.680
 Are you in general?

32:19.680 --> 32:21.680
 Some of me, it just falls the gut.

32:21.680 --> 32:25.280
 Like when your heart tells you something, you go with it.

32:25.280 --> 32:31.160
 For the most part, because I figured out at least now I figured out what parts I could,

32:31.160 --> 32:35.200
 like what feeling I can trust and which one I can't, which ones anxiety versus which ones

32:35.200 --> 32:37.160
 my actual intuition talking.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.720
 So why did you sign up to be an artillery gunner?

32:39.720 --> 32:42.240
 Because they wouldn't let me be infantry.

32:42.240 --> 32:48.640
 I mean, why, why would you want to be infantry?

32:48.640 --> 32:52.480
 I mean, this, you're, you're, you're, you're naming a lot of dangerous activities.

32:52.480 --> 32:53.480
 Yeah.

32:53.480 --> 32:56.520
 But that wasn't a thought in my mind at the time.

32:56.520 --> 32:59.760
 My idea was if I was going to do this and I was going to put myself through the bullshit

32:59.760 --> 33:04.400
 and the training and all of the hell and the pushups and the things I screamed at, I wanted

33:04.400 --> 33:06.720
 to do something that I know was actually going to be affecting something.

33:06.720 --> 33:11.360
 And what I knew was making change or affecting or on the front lines was infantry, artillery

33:11.360 --> 33:12.360
 or armored.

33:12.360 --> 33:14.000
 So I was like, one of those.

33:14.000 --> 33:17.360
 Can you explain the difference, infantry, artillery and armored?

33:17.360 --> 33:20.800
 Do you want like the layman's term or do you want me to actually explain, explain?

33:20.800 --> 33:24.720
 Well, listen to your conversation with Jaco, especially I love how you get into details.

33:24.720 --> 33:25.720
 Okay.

33:25.720 --> 33:26.720
 So let's detail this one.

33:26.720 --> 33:27.720
 Okay.

33:27.720 --> 33:34.280
 So infantry is your frontline door kicking, you know, blasting the door open, running

33:34.280 --> 33:38.000
 and get the fuck on the ground just that they're the guys that, you know, the double tap you

33:38.000 --> 33:41.800
 in the face and they show up in the middle of the night and put a barrel in your head.

33:41.800 --> 33:46.600
 Like those are the guys that are sleeping in the trenches that are eating MREs who are

33:46.600 --> 33:51.760
 being shot at who are being blown up, who are doing the dirty work and not sleeping and

33:51.760 --> 33:56.400
 carrying the hundred pound pack and, and are side by side with your buddies in the trenches.

33:56.400 --> 34:01.000
 I wanted that, that they said it was too small for that.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.720
 You were sorry to interrupt, you were too small under a hundred pounds?

34:05.720 --> 34:10.840
 At the time I was about 103 and I'm, I'm five foot like on a, if you roll my back out like

34:10.840 --> 34:14.640
 I really try, I'm five foot.

34:14.640 --> 34:18.720
 At the time though, I think my, my license said 411.

34:18.720 --> 34:23.120
 So you were too small for infantry?

34:23.120 --> 34:24.120
 Yeah.

34:24.120 --> 34:28.440
 They just like, there was no mandate at which they said, you can't be, but they said, you

34:28.440 --> 34:31.160
 know, we don't want to put you through training that you're going to fail out of and then

34:31.160 --> 34:33.600
 have to recourse you and then find a new job for you.

34:33.600 --> 34:37.320
 And we, they want to try to, if this is what you're going in for, they want to have you

34:37.320 --> 34:39.600
 follow through that path.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.880
 So then there was armored, which are your tanks.

34:42.880 --> 34:48.560
 So that's your movie like fury where your tank battles in, which we don't really do anymore,

34:48.560 --> 34:51.920
 but you're rolling around in tanks, you got guys in the back or you're a driver or you're

34:51.920 --> 34:58.120
 a turret gunner, which I would have enjoyed, but the idea of being in a closed metal box

34:58.120 --> 35:00.440
 or something about it made me panic.

35:00.440 --> 35:02.160
 So I was like, maybe not for me.

35:02.160 --> 35:06.640
 Oh, there's of course power to that kind of big gun.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.760
 Well, that's why I went for the bigger one.

35:08.760 --> 35:09.760
 Okay.

35:09.760 --> 35:12.680
 By the way, I think Russia leads the world in number of tanks.

35:12.680 --> 35:18.600
 They're still, it's very like, what is it, alpha demonstration of like four sick, look,

35:18.600 --> 35:20.640
 we have largest number of tanks.

35:20.640 --> 35:22.040
 You know what takes tanks out though?

35:22.040 --> 35:23.040
 What?

35:23.040 --> 35:24.960
 Some gasoline, some old batteries and a wire.

35:24.960 --> 35:25.960
 Yeah.

35:25.960 --> 35:27.480
 But tanks still look badass.

35:27.480 --> 35:29.360
 They look great, but they don't last.

35:29.360 --> 35:33.240
 But so much of the military, like we said with the recruiting videos, it's a display

35:33.240 --> 35:37.040
 of power versus the actual implementation of power.

35:37.040 --> 35:38.040
 Fair.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.040
 Okay.

35:39.040 --> 35:40.040
 Artillery.

35:40.040 --> 35:41.040
 So I'm doing my best here.

35:41.040 --> 35:42.040
 Yeah.

35:42.040 --> 35:43.040
 I don't even know what double tap means, which you said earlier.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.880
 So it's double tap is like two shots to the face.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.120
 Why two?

35:47.120 --> 35:48.120
 To be sure.

35:48.120 --> 35:49.120
 Okay.

35:49.120 --> 35:50.120
 All right.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.400
 You guys, tax payers pay for the ammo.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.400
 It's fine.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.000
 So, but you don't want to do three because it's wasting the ammo.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.280
 Well, that's now that's a waste.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.280
 Okay.

35:56.280 --> 35:57.280
 Double tap the face.

35:57.280 --> 36:01.600
 There's so much awesome terminology here or gruesome terminology, depending on your

36:01.600 --> 36:02.600
 perspective.

36:02.600 --> 36:03.600
 Okay.

36:03.600 --> 36:04.600
 So artillery.

36:04.600 --> 36:05.600
 Yeah.

36:05.600 --> 36:06.600
 So that's the hand of God.

36:06.600 --> 36:07.600
 Sorry.

36:07.600 --> 36:15.600
 No, I, that's, that's intensely romanticized version, but okay, artillery, the hand of

36:15.600 --> 36:16.600
 God.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.760
 Because it will reach out and touch you from wherever we want.

36:19.760 --> 36:26.920
 It's like, it's like F, F 18 pilots or bombers, they'll, you won't know they're there until

36:26.920 --> 36:28.200
 they're there.

36:28.200 --> 36:33.760
 And so for artillery, I really honestly didn't think artillery would be a fit for me.

36:33.760 --> 36:35.160
 I didn't know much about it.

36:35.160 --> 36:38.320
 They were just like, these are what you couldn't pick from.

36:38.320 --> 36:40.280
 And I was like, I'll go here.

36:40.280 --> 36:43.800
 So in World War II, they used much closer artillery.

36:43.800 --> 36:47.320
 So it's the, we were called the Royal Canadian Horse Artillery because the queen made us

36:47.320 --> 36:50.200
 Royal Canadian artillery.

36:50.200 --> 36:55.080
 And we, we shoot these rounds when you're in training, you shoot smaller, smaller ammunition.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.560
 They're about 40 pounds.

36:56.560 --> 36:57.560
 There they go.

36:57.560 --> 37:04.280
 I'm going to get this wrong, 20 K, 20 kilometers, so whatever that is in your mile things.

37:04.280 --> 37:08.880
 And they have a casing on them and they're much easier.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.360
 They're easier to handle.

37:10.360 --> 37:11.360
 The guns are smaller.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.680
 You need less people for them.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.400
 They're basically what you train on nowadays.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.200
 It's not what we use overseas.

37:16.200 --> 37:19.520
 What we use overseas, now those things are beautiful.

37:19.520 --> 37:25.680
 Those are just a sheer work of the engineering behind them just makes my heart skip a beat.

37:25.680 --> 37:26.680
 Yeah.

37:26.680 --> 37:27.680
 The engineering of modern guns is amazing.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.080
 So are we talking about machine guns here?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.080
 So like fully automatic?

37:30.080 --> 37:31.760
 No, you're talking about artillery guns.

37:31.760 --> 37:37.440
 So what it is, it's a one five five millimeter howitzer that shoots up to up to 40 kilometers

37:37.440 --> 37:43.800
 accurately, 45 unrecorded and it shoots a hundred pound round.

37:43.800 --> 37:47.800
 Oh, okay.

37:47.800 --> 37:50.560
 So that, but there is still precision.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.560
 Accurate as hell.

37:51.560 --> 37:52.560
 Accurate.

37:52.560 --> 37:53.560
 Okay.

37:53.560 --> 38:01.920
 So how, at which stage of the warfare do they come in?

38:01.920 --> 38:03.200
 Are they saving you?

38:03.200 --> 38:09.200
 Like say a bunch of people get rated, a bunch of the infantry get rated and then the artillery

38:09.200 --> 38:14.120
 saves them or are they the first line of attack or where are they, where is the artillery

38:14.120 --> 38:15.120
 going?

38:15.120 --> 38:17.640
 Like the hand of God presumes they're helping.

38:17.640 --> 38:18.640
 Yeah.

38:18.640 --> 38:19.640
 Yeah.

38:19.640 --> 38:20.640
 Well, that's it.

38:20.640 --> 38:24.960
 So depending on the operation or whomever is running it or how they want it done, sometimes

38:24.960 --> 38:29.200
 if they just know there's targets, they'll use us, you know, high value targets.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.720
 So we have this round, it's called the X caliber round.

38:32.720 --> 38:34.680
 It costs about half a million dollars per round.

38:34.680 --> 38:39.840
 It comes in a special tube that is like sealed and locked and you have to get permission

38:39.840 --> 38:43.440
 from Ottawa to shoot it and it's only used for VIP targets.

38:43.440 --> 38:50.280
 So like we have VIP for everyone and it will, it's GPS guided, it's rocker propelled and

38:50.280 --> 38:56.880
 when you fire it, it will, if this is a wall and somebody's standing on this side of it

38:56.880 --> 38:58.120
 will hit you right there.

38:58.120 --> 38:59.120
 We won't touch that wall.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.400
 It will hit you pinpoint.

39:01.400 --> 39:06.480
 It'll go right through whatever concrete, whatever and then it will destroy.

39:06.480 --> 39:12.240
 So it's basically the same thing as being a sniper, but with a much more damaging weapon.

39:12.240 --> 39:13.840
 We don't use that round often.

39:13.840 --> 39:18.440
 I think it's only been used a handful of times max in Afghanistan that I'm aware of.

39:18.440 --> 39:24.640
 And I haven't, I wasn't there from 2009 until 21, but I know people that still deployed

39:24.640 --> 39:28.160
 in that, in those units and I don't know that it was used very often.

39:28.160 --> 39:32.600
 But the regular round, so there's HE, there's loom, so HE is high explosive.

39:32.600 --> 39:37.040
 There's loom, you shoot that, it explodes in the sky, it lights up the sky for the infantry

39:37.040 --> 39:42.040
 below and then there's shrapnel rounds that will explode in the sky and then shrapnel

39:42.040 --> 39:43.680
 just rains down hell on you.

39:43.680 --> 39:51.040
 HE is what you use normally in my, I'm trying to say this right because I know people squawked

39:51.040 --> 39:53.800
 at me about some of the stuff on Jocko, so I'm trying to be very accurate.

39:53.800 --> 39:58.320
 In my experience, we used HE rounds to wipe people off the face of the earth when the

39:58.320 --> 40:00.120
 infantry needed us.

40:00.120 --> 40:05.800
 So we would get a call at any time and there's always two guns together.

40:05.800 --> 40:08.480
 So you never, you never go solo gun ever.

40:08.480 --> 40:12.560
 If you are, it's sketchy and there's bad shits happening.

40:12.560 --> 40:15.240
 Can you explain that so there's two people, two guns?

40:15.240 --> 40:17.480
 No, two guns with each gun troop.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.320
 So each gun troop has five to seven people running a gun at all times.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
 Oh wow, okay.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.480
 It takes a lot of people to run one of those.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.240
 How much electronics is there?

40:24.240 --> 40:28.200
 The GPS, like the computer system that's on it itself, I never ran that much, but it

40:28.200 --> 40:32.640
 is completely technologically, it's GPS guided.

40:32.640 --> 40:38.080
 All you have to do is literally type in the coordinates, then you've got the two big,

40:38.080 --> 40:41.120
 there's a technical word for it, but basically wheels.

40:41.120 --> 40:45.080
 And one does the trajectory, you know, you do your, and you're just kind of doing this

40:45.080 --> 40:46.720
 and you're watching the, watching it.

40:46.720 --> 40:50.200
 And once you hit your target, that's, you know, it'll tell you, that's where you need

40:50.200 --> 40:51.200
 to hit.

40:51.200 --> 40:56.080
 Do you know if there's any like AI stuff, like computer vision, like where there's cameras

40:56.080 --> 41:03.320
 and they help you target using like all different kinds of cameras to see through, like the fog,

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
 all those kinds of things.

41:04.320 --> 41:10.760
 No, we use the FU, which are forward observation officers, which are an artillery individual,

41:10.760 --> 41:13.720
 that is embedded with an infantry unit.

41:13.720 --> 41:14.720
 Oh, wow.

41:14.720 --> 41:15.720
 Okay.

41:15.720 --> 41:19.000
 They call from the front, give us their grid coordinates and basically say, like, don't

41:19.000 --> 41:20.000
 drop this on us.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
 Got it.

41:21.000 --> 41:24.120
 So, well, you know what not to shoot, which parts not to shoot.

41:24.120 --> 41:25.120
 Correct.

41:25.120 --> 41:26.640
 And then there was no one moves.

41:26.640 --> 41:27.640
 Don't move.

41:27.640 --> 41:28.640
 Stay still.

41:28.640 --> 41:30.640
 But you can hear it coming.

41:30.640 --> 41:31.640
 Yeah.

41:31.640 --> 41:32.880
 But you can't hear it until it's too close.

41:32.880 --> 41:35.200
 So like when I went, sorry, go ahead, you were going to say something.

41:35.200 --> 41:38.920
 No, I was going to say, what's the experience on the other?

41:38.920 --> 41:44.640
 Like what does it feel like to be maybe infantry or underneath it underneath the artillery?

41:44.640 --> 41:52.400
 Well, I, I had the rare opportunity to do that and I have a video I'll show you after.

41:52.400 --> 41:57.480
 It's terrifying because I know that people that were shooting it and I know them personally

41:57.480 --> 41:59.120
 and I know what they're like as humans.

41:59.120 --> 42:02.480
 And for the most part, they're dialed, but you get the odd duck where you're like, I've

42:02.480 --> 42:06.760
 seen people have an ND, which is a negligent discharge.

42:06.760 --> 42:09.800
 You basically get charged for it, you get a lot of trouble because you can blow people

42:09.800 --> 42:12.800
 up and it like accidents happen.

42:12.800 --> 42:15.920
 And so I know accidents can happen in stressful situations.

42:15.920 --> 42:20.000
 And when I was with the Brits, we had to call Danger Close Artillery.

42:20.000 --> 42:23.680
 And when it goes over top of you, it sounds like thunder and lightning.

42:23.680 --> 42:28.960
 So you fire it and it's not the stereotype that you hear in World War II where it kind

42:28.960 --> 42:34.120
 of like that, it's more of like a crackle.

42:34.120 --> 42:39.000
 And then you just hear like a whiz and it just goes everywhere.

42:39.000 --> 42:40.000
 It's loud.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.320
 It shakes the ground.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.640
 It shakes you.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.120
 You feel it.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.120
 Okay.

42:45.120 --> 42:46.120
 Okay.

42:46.120 --> 42:50.920
 Is there some more words you can put to like the experience of what it's like to be in

42:50.920 --> 42:53.800
 the heat of, of, of battle there?

42:53.800 --> 42:57.320
 So what is, is there literally, is it hot?

42:57.320 --> 42:59.760
 Is it talking about being under it or shooting it?

42:59.760 --> 43:00.760
 Under it.

43:00.760 --> 43:01.760
 Oh yeah.

43:01.760 --> 43:02.760
 It 55 degree heat.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.840
 You know that you're waiting for it to be called.

43:04.840 --> 43:10.200
 You feel an overwhelming excitement to start because for me, I'd never been under it.

43:10.200 --> 43:12.760
 So I was like, okay, I had my camera ready.

43:12.760 --> 43:16.760
 Like I was a kid at a candy store and I'm like, I want to watch this happen.

43:16.760 --> 43:21.440
 And once you hear the crackle, I got really fearful.

43:21.440 --> 43:24.760
 My anxiety kicked up significantly.

43:24.760 --> 43:28.880
 I got to the point where I got numb.

43:28.880 --> 43:33.080
 Like I was, my nerves were on overdrive so much that like my body would go like numb.

43:33.080 --> 43:36.560
 Like I could move, but like my nerves were numb, if that makes sense.

43:36.560 --> 43:38.200
 What, what were the nerves like?

43:38.200 --> 43:42.400
 And we're talking about fear or is it just anxious, excitement?

43:42.400 --> 43:45.840
 Anxious excitement, hopeful that they wouldn't blow it up on us.

43:45.840 --> 43:52.560
 And there was this, there was this excitement that's hard to describe because you don't

43:52.560 --> 43:57.200
 want to be excited that you're dropping bombs on people, but when you just saw their faces

43:57.200 --> 44:03.200
 and they're shooting at you, there's this overwhelming feeling of got you, motherfucker.

44:03.200 --> 44:04.200
 Yeah.

44:04.200 --> 44:05.200
 Yeah.

44:05.200 --> 44:10.400
 Well, we'll talk about that because that's such a difficult thing about wars.

44:10.400 --> 44:15.680
 You forget that other human beings, because those other human beings are doing really

44:15.680 --> 44:16.960
 bad things to you.

44:16.960 --> 44:25.280
 And so the very basic anger takes over, hate can take over, and then also just the excitement

44:25.280 --> 44:33.160
 of almost like video game like, you know, aspect of war, like sport, it's like sport

44:33.160 --> 44:38.000
 that all of those elements are all baked in and it's, it's hard to be philosophical in

44:38.000 --> 44:39.000
 that situation.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.000
 It seems like

44:40.000 --> 44:43.880
 I've never played video games, so I can't compare it to that, but like from, from like

44:43.880 --> 44:44.880
 a sports perspective.

44:44.880 --> 44:45.880
 Yeah.

44:45.880 --> 44:46.880
 I could, I could argue that.

44:46.880 --> 44:51.760
 Like I felt like we won there for a second and it's, it's not just like a heat from

44:51.760 --> 44:59.840
 outside, it's like this radiation within you that is something I've never felt since.

44:59.840 --> 45:04.280
 You just to take a small step back to the weapons training.

45:04.280 --> 45:06.320
 What kind of guns did you train on?

45:06.320 --> 45:08.160
 Because you also mentioned a rocket launcher.

45:08.160 --> 45:10.480
 I love Carl Grassoff's.

45:10.480 --> 45:11.480
 What are those?

45:11.480 --> 45:12.480
 What are those?

45:12.480 --> 45:13.480
 Carl G.

45:13.480 --> 45:14.480
 Carl G's.

45:14.480 --> 45:15.480
 What's that?

45:15.480 --> 45:16.480
 What's, what's it like?

45:16.480 --> 45:20.640
 My only experience with the rocket launch is from the movie Commando with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

45:20.640 --> 45:21.640
 Oh yeah.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.640
 And we've all discussed.

45:22.640 --> 45:25.080
 I haven't seen that yet and I've heard about it and people have made me tell, yeah, I know.

45:25.080 --> 45:30.560
 I feel like you haven't seen a single movie that's relevant to war military because every

45:30.560 --> 45:33.160
 time anyone brings it up, you haven't seen it.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.240
 I don't have time to watch movies, Lex.

45:35.240 --> 45:36.240
 Platoon.

45:36.240 --> 45:37.760
 You haven't seen platoon, which is.

45:37.760 --> 45:38.760
 You're the scientist.

45:38.760 --> 45:40.280
 How do you have the time?

45:40.280 --> 45:41.280
 I'm not a scientist.

45:41.280 --> 45:43.000
 I just play one on TV.

45:43.000 --> 45:44.000
 Okay.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.000
 Sure.

45:45.000 --> 45:50.080
 So what, can you talk about the rocket launcher and maybe any other.

45:50.080 --> 45:54.120
 Well, both engineering actually, to me, those guns are very interesting from an engineering

45:54.120 --> 45:55.120
 perspective too.

45:55.120 --> 45:56.120
 Well, they should be.

45:56.120 --> 46:00.080
 They're fascinating when you take them apart and you see how small the parts get down to

46:00.080 --> 46:03.880
 and how, how necessary every single little piece is to make that thing run.

46:03.880 --> 46:08.960
 And even without the tiniest little BB smaller than a piece on there and artillery gun might

46:08.960 --> 46:10.240
 not run.

46:10.240 --> 46:17.600
 So we were trained on Carl G's and called M72s, which are disposable rocket launchers

46:17.600 --> 46:18.600
 all back up.

46:18.600 --> 46:23.680
 These are around, I don't know the exact millimeter of the round.

46:23.680 --> 46:24.760
 It's been a while since I shot them.

46:24.760 --> 46:29.800
 We only did those in training, but essentially it takes, most people, one person can fire

46:29.800 --> 46:32.720
 it, you know, effectively hold it and fire it.

46:32.720 --> 46:34.280
 It takes another person to load it.

46:34.280 --> 46:39.680
 So you put it onto your shoulder and in ways I would, I don't know, 30 pounds, 40 pounds.

46:39.680 --> 46:40.680
 Oh wow.

46:40.680 --> 46:41.680
 Can't remember.

46:41.680 --> 46:42.680
 It's been a minute.

46:42.680 --> 46:43.680
 It's been a minute.

46:43.680 --> 46:44.680
 One person can carry it.

46:44.680 --> 46:45.680
 Oh yeah.

46:45.680 --> 46:46.680
 Okay.

46:46.680 --> 46:52.640
 So I don't know, it just seems like a rocket launcher is a pretty intense kind of device

46:52.640 --> 46:53.640
 that just...

46:53.640 --> 46:54.640
 It for sure is.

46:54.640 --> 46:58.760
 I mean, it's the diameter, I can't even tell you the diameter, they're about that big.

46:58.760 --> 46:59.760
 I mean...

46:59.760 --> 47:00.760
 And it goes on your shoulder.

47:00.760 --> 47:04.560
 It goes on your shoulder and then it has a little sight that pops out.

47:04.560 --> 47:07.400
 That's almost like plastic like, which is kind of funny because it reminds me of like

47:07.400 --> 47:11.160
 the little green army men.

47:11.160 --> 47:13.160
 I just felt so flimsy to me.

47:13.160 --> 47:15.240
 I was like, this is hilarious.

47:15.240 --> 47:17.520
 And then another person stands behind you and opens the hatch.

47:17.520 --> 47:23.040
 And so there's this, there's these two levers and you just kind of open it.

47:23.040 --> 47:28.320
 And then the back end, which is flared, so it's just a tube and then it's flared.

47:28.320 --> 47:32.240
 That will open it and drop down and you load around into that and then you load it back

47:32.240 --> 47:33.240
 up.

47:33.240 --> 47:34.240
 Got it.

47:34.240 --> 47:38.040
 And you're never supposed to stand behind it because the blast behind it will kill you.

47:38.040 --> 47:39.040
 It's...

47:39.040 --> 47:40.040
 Yeah.

47:40.040 --> 47:46.200
 But in my case, when I fired it, it was me and another individual, I want to say, it

47:46.200 --> 47:50.640
 wasn't Sarah Pellegrine, but it was another girl that was smaller and the person is supposed

47:50.640 --> 47:54.080
 to wrap around your waist and tuck low and hold your stability.

47:54.080 --> 47:58.360
 And we were just aiming at tanks that day and they were just concrete heads.

47:58.360 --> 48:02.480
 So they would just either, they would hit and bounce off or whatever.

48:02.480 --> 48:07.400
 And so when my sergeant saw that, he just kind of looked at both of us and was like,

48:07.400 --> 48:13.240
 no, I'm just going to... and he got real low and just like wrapped both of us.

48:13.240 --> 48:18.080
 And then we'd fire it and it feels like you're getting punched in the side of the head on

48:18.080 --> 48:20.080
 repeat by Jocko.

48:20.080 --> 48:21.080
 Yeah.

48:21.080 --> 48:27.000
 You lose all your hearing, you just like, it's not comes out of your nose and you're

48:27.000 --> 48:29.720
 just kind of discombobulated for a minute.

48:29.720 --> 48:32.960
 It's a real mind fuck.

48:32.960 --> 48:39.760
 Is there any other kind of guns that at that time, because you were new to this, you haven't

48:39.760 --> 48:44.520
 shot guns when you were younger that were really impressive to you in the training process?

48:44.520 --> 48:46.760
 All of them because I've never fired a weapon.

48:46.760 --> 48:52.600
 So we had the C7s, which are like your M16s, I believe, the long barrel.

48:52.600 --> 48:57.320
 The cute thing about those is when I have that slung, my barrel drags on the ground.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.280
 So that's fun.

48:59.280 --> 49:02.680
 And they shoot, you know, your 7, 6, 2 or your 5, 5, 6 round.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.680
 I loved that.

49:03.680 --> 49:08.960
 I preferred the C8, which was a short barrel, which is what the SF guys use.

49:08.960 --> 49:13.320
 Not because it's cooler looking, which it obviously is, but because it was functional

49:13.320 --> 49:16.880
 for my body height and it didn't drag on the ground when I ran.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.960
 I loved those, they're your personal weapon.

49:19.960 --> 49:22.840
 Being an artillery gunner, if you're not an officer, at least in our unit, you didn't

49:22.840 --> 49:24.840
 get a side piece.

49:24.840 --> 49:27.720
 I didn't have a slide piece, Lex.

49:27.720 --> 49:30.840
 So I never had a handgun of any type.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.040
 I fired those in training.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.400
 You can't get over that side piece comment.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.400
 Look at you.

49:34.400 --> 49:36.960
 I was going to say, I know what a side piece is.

49:36.960 --> 49:37.960
 You don't have to explain to me.

49:37.960 --> 49:38.960
 But you're single.

49:38.960 --> 49:41.760
 So how do you even have a side piece if you don't have a main piece?

49:41.760 --> 49:46.280
 The joke would be the fact that we have a total misunderstanding with side pieces.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.280
 Okay, great.

49:47.280 --> 49:48.920
 You didn't have a side piece as a non officer.

49:48.920 --> 49:49.920
 Right.

49:49.920 --> 49:51.240
 So I never fired those much.

49:51.240 --> 49:52.760
 We did grenades in training.

49:52.760 --> 49:53.760
 Oh, cool.

49:53.760 --> 49:54.760
 Yeah, grenades are fun.

49:54.760 --> 49:55.760
 I love grenades.

49:55.760 --> 49:56.920
 I have a massive one tattooed on me.

49:56.920 --> 49:58.440
 I have them all over my office.

49:58.440 --> 50:00.560
 How does a grenade work?

50:00.560 --> 50:02.360
 There's the spoon and the pin.

50:02.360 --> 50:04.880
 So the pin holds the spoon in place.

50:04.880 --> 50:11.320
 When you pull that pin, the firing mechanism inside, as long as that the spoon is up against

50:11.320 --> 50:12.320
 it, it won't fire.

50:12.320 --> 50:17.160
 As soon as that spoon goes, I believe it causes a reaction on the inside and you've got about

50:17.160 --> 50:18.560
 five seconds to check it.

50:18.560 --> 50:21.000
 You'd be better to ask that question too.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.560
 I don't want me to get those off go on.

50:22.560 --> 50:23.560
 No, you're not.

50:23.560 --> 50:30.480
 But there's something about a grenade because you're essentially committing suicide unless

50:30.480 --> 50:32.480
 you get rid of the thing.

50:32.480 --> 50:33.480
 There's something like...

50:33.480 --> 50:37.320
 Or if you're unlucky and it just goes off when you pull the pin, which has happened to tons

50:37.320 --> 50:38.320
 of people.

50:38.320 --> 50:44.480
 So it just feels like a very kind of, it's a dangerous leap into the abyss every time

50:44.480 --> 50:49.720
 you use the thing because when you shoot a gun, the gun is much less likely to malfunction

50:49.720 --> 50:52.480
 in terms of all the possible ways to go wrong.

50:52.480 --> 50:55.360
 It just seems like grenade is like...

50:55.360 --> 50:56.360
 Primitive almost.

50:56.360 --> 50:57.360
 Yeah, it's primitive.

50:57.360 --> 51:02.720
 It's also real in the way that a bar fight is being punched in the face is real.

51:02.720 --> 51:08.160
 It's like, you're here with a weapon of destruction, it's just you and the thing and you have to

51:08.160 --> 51:09.160
 get rid of it.

51:09.160 --> 51:10.160
 I don't know.

51:10.160 --> 51:11.560
 Is that terrifying to use?

51:11.560 --> 51:13.840
 Do people still use grenades in warfare?

51:13.840 --> 51:14.840
 Oh yeah.

51:14.840 --> 51:16.080
 Yeah, those are fantastic.

51:16.080 --> 51:20.120
 The Taliban were throwing them over the wall at the airport in Kabul.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.680
 People use them all the time because when you're in Afghanistan, if you're in a rural

51:22.680 --> 51:27.200
 area, you're going from village to village and they're mud hut walls.

51:27.200 --> 51:31.080
 You're tall, but you're walking through corridors and stuff, all you got to lob one of those.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.800
 It's going to take the whole unit out that just walked by.

51:33.800 --> 51:39.760
 They're accurate if you're close enough and they're effective if you're close enough.

51:39.760 --> 51:41.640
 I love them though.

51:41.640 --> 51:47.880
 I think they're fascinating to me because there's such a tiny little thing with such

51:47.880 --> 51:48.880
 devastation.

51:48.880 --> 51:49.880
 Yeah.

51:49.880 --> 51:50.880
 They just can cause such devastation.

51:50.880 --> 51:55.560
 But for me, when I had them, some of the Canadians would make fun of me because when

51:55.560 --> 51:59.640
 I did go outside the way with the British, I had two right here.

51:59.640 --> 52:04.560
 I remember I put a piece of tape over the spoons because in my mind, I could picture

52:04.560 --> 52:09.000
 myself searching someone and grabbing me and pulling that.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.000
 That would be me.

52:10.000 --> 52:14.560
 That would have been like, yep, if anyone that was going to happen to, it was her for

52:14.560 --> 52:15.560
 sure.

52:15.560 --> 52:21.680
 So you were deployed to Afghanistan in 2009.

52:21.680 --> 52:26.000
 Like we said, you were in great, no, perfect physical shape.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.520
 Fucking epic shape.

52:27.520 --> 52:31.400
 Epic shape six back or I mean, yeah, okay.

52:31.400 --> 52:37.840
 So you could do pull a lot of pull ups and push ups and yeah, okay.

52:37.840 --> 52:43.560
 And well trained, would you say where you're already what like, no, no, no, I'll argue

52:43.560 --> 52:45.760
 that point till I'm blue in the face.

52:45.760 --> 52:47.920
 I spoke to recently, I actually spoke to my surgeon.

52:47.920 --> 52:51.640
 He's not a surgeon anymore, but Sergeant Mark LeBlanc, he's in Africa right now in a deployment

52:51.640 --> 52:56.160
 he gave me a call the other day and I remember talking to him about this and it's frustrating

52:56.160 --> 52:58.760
 because we were at an active war.

52:58.760 --> 53:04.160
 We were involved in an active war where we, the units that I were in were tagged red,

53:04.160 --> 53:07.400
 which meant they needed people.

53:07.400 --> 53:11.120
 So when you need people, things go quick.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.120
 Whether or not that's right.

53:12.120 --> 53:15.920
 I mean, you could argue that's the similar thing to what's happening in the world right

53:15.920 --> 53:16.920
 now.

53:16.920 --> 53:18.080
 We needed a vaccine.

53:18.080 --> 53:19.880
 We got a vaccine.

53:19.880 --> 53:21.600
 Is it the best it could be?

53:21.600 --> 53:22.880
 Could it be better?

53:22.880 --> 53:23.880
 Could it do more things?

53:23.880 --> 53:29.320
 Sure, probably, but with the time that we had, we did the best that we could.

53:29.320 --> 53:31.040
 That's my logic on that.

53:31.040 --> 53:35.440
 For me, I joined the military in November of 2007.

53:35.440 --> 53:38.840
 I was in basic training in January of 2008.

53:38.840 --> 53:45.960
 I was graduated basic SQ, which is all your weapons training, your DP one, which is your

53:45.960 --> 53:47.480
 trade specific training.

53:47.480 --> 53:51.680
 So whatever trade you're going to go into, whether it's infantry, armored, artillery,

53:51.680 --> 53:54.160
 medic, whatever, that's your DP one.

53:54.160 --> 53:56.480
 It's called different things in different units.

53:56.480 --> 54:00.360
 And then I got posted to my unit in September.

54:00.360 --> 54:05.760
 So January to September, I had done all my training and I'm an English speaking individual.

54:05.760 --> 54:12.400
 I got posted to a French unit that only speaks French and had to learn all of the weapon systems.

54:12.400 --> 54:15.720
 Everything again that I just learned in that short timeframe in French.

54:15.720 --> 54:22.560
 This part of your story that you're telling this to Jaco, one way to say it is very impressive

54:22.560 --> 54:24.880
 that you had to learn all of this in French.

54:24.880 --> 54:29.000
 So there's also the camaraderie, the social aspect of it, which is difficult probably.

54:29.000 --> 54:30.000
 It didn't have any.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.360
 Yeah, it didn't have any.

54:32.360 --> 54:37.440
 But it also would make you a more effective soldier to be socially for that cohesion

54:37.440 --> 54:39.280
 to be there, right?

54:39.280 --> 54:43.440
 But also just understanding the basic terminology.

54:43.440 --> 54:44.440
 Correct.

54:44.440 --> 54:48.040
 The right way to say something on the radio, the right way to run a gun, the right way

54:48.040 --> 54:49.040
 to...

54:49.040 --> 54:50.040
 Because you got to move with those guns.

54:50.040 --> 54:54.840
 If you've got seven people, it's really magical.

54:54.840 --> 54:56.200
 I'll send you a video.

54:56.200 --> 55:00.360
 When we did some live fire in workup training in Texas before we left, we did a competition

55:00.360 --> 55:05.680
 between the other gun to see who could fire 10 rounds faster.

55:05.680 --> 55:13.000
 It is truly beautiful to watch an artillery unit fire a gun because it's like a symphony.

55:13.000 --> 55:16.760
 And has their parts and everyone knows and everyone's yelling, but they know why they're

55:16.760 --> 55:21.360
 yelling and everyone, this guy's got to do this in order for this guy to load the round.

55:21.360 --> 55:22.840
 It's just, it's beautiful.

55:22.840 --> 55:23.840
 It really is.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.120
 It is gorgeous to watch.

55:25.120 --> 55:26.640
 I miss it deeply.

55:26.640 --> 55:33.320
 Is there, by the way, for a gun, is there like one person responsible for the aim or like

55:33.320 --> 55:36.840
 the specification of the location and somebody else that pulls it?

55:36.840 --> 55:37.840
 A lanyard?

55:37.840 --> 55:39.840
 Is that the lanyard?

55:39.840 --> 55:40.840
 Is there a button?

55:40.840 --> 55:42.120
 It's better than a button.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.120
 You'll like it.

55:43.120 --> 55:45.280
 I'll tell you in a second.

55:45.280 --> 55:51.160
 There's your sergeant in charge and then they have their two IC and so the comms come in

55:51.160 --> 55:56.840
 to the sergeant and the sergeant is the, or your master bombardier, Bombardier chef.

55:56.840 --> 55:58.840
 Sorry, what?

55:58.840 --> 55:59.840
 Bombardier chef?

55:59.840 --> 56:00.840
 Bombardier chef.

56:00.840 --> 56:01.840
 Bombardier chef.

56:01.840 --> 56:02.840
 Bombardier chef.

56:02.840 --> 56:05.040
 Oh, that's a French.

56:05.040 --> 56:06.040
 Master bombardier.

56:06.040 --> 56:07.040
 Yeah.

56:07.040 --> 56:11.120
 So it goes like private, in the north, like in an infantry or in a regular unit, it's like

56:11.120 --> 56:15.320
 private corporal, master corporal sergeant.

56:15.320 --> 56:22.680
 In artillery, it goes gunner, bombardier, master bombardier, sergeant, and off like that.

56:22.680 --> 56:27.840
 So you have two people, but the serge is like, you don't move till he says move, you don't

56:27.840 --> 56:31.120
 fire till he says fire, like he's your guy, he'll give you the coordinates, he'll feed

56:31.120 --> 56:36.120
 him to the guy that's doing the GPS, that portion, I really never did it much.

56:36.120 --> 56:38.280
 I wasn't tall enough to see it.

56:38.280 --> 56:41.800
 Like legitimately, the way, how high it is up on the gun, like it was, I couldn't see

56:41.800 --> 56:44.480
 clearly enough, it was not good.

56:44.480 --> 56:48.000
 So obviously you have a big personality, you're a strong person.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.560
 You don't say.

56:49.560 --> 56:51.800
 And you have a big hat currently.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.760
 I always wear a hat, Lex.

56:53.760 --> 56:54.760
 Okay.

56:54.760 --> 56:57.600
 It seems like your height and your size was a factor.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.600
 Oh, for sure.

56:58.600 --> 57:04.560
 How were you able to step up in all those moments and how difficult was it?

57:04.560 --> 57:07.600
 I don't know that I'd realize it was difficult while I was doing it because that's just the

57:07.600 --> 57:08.600
 way it's been.

57:08.600 --> 57:10.000
 I've always been the short person.

57:10.000 --> 57:12.580
 That's life, nothing I can do to fix that.

57:12.580 --> 57:15.200
 So there was no point, when am I going to whine about it, I'm going to break my femurs

57:15.200 --> 57:20.360
 and insert things to make me grow a little bit, maybe, maybe since you're in robotics,

57:20.360 --> 57:22.560
 you can figure that out.

57:22.560 --> 57:24.440
 That's your task now.

57:24.440 --> 57:28.640
 Make me be five foot three, that'd be great.

57:28.640 --> 57:33.520
 For artillery, really what it came down to was the unit, when I got there, there was

57:33.520 --> 57:38.960
 only a couple people who spoke any sort of English and my sergeant was not one of them.

57:38.960 --> 57:44.280
 But once he started to get to know me a little bit, the best that he could, he started to

57:44.280 --> 57:50.680
 put effort into making sure I could lift the rounds, make sure my capacity to do my job

57:50.680 --> 57:51.840
 was there.

57:51.840 --> 57:54.320
 And so he took me under his wing in that aspect.

57:54.320 --> 58:01.120
 So he would take me to the gym with him and he would show me exercises that would specifically

58:01.120 --> 58:03.800
 help me load the rounds.

58:03.800 --> 58:07.880
 So pick the round up from the ground, pick it up like a trick to put your knee under

58:07.880 --> 58:12.360
 it, use your legs, instead of just pick it up, use your back, pull your back out.

58:12.360 --> 58:13.840
 He would work on that.

58:13.840 --> 58:18.840
 And then depending on the position I was running the gun in, if I was running the side that

58:18.840 --> 58:22.120
 had the charge bags, I'll explain that in a second.

58:22.120 --> 58:29.000
 But if I was running the side that had the charge bags, I could step up onto the gun.

58:29.000 --> 58:34.640
 And if I leaned inward enough with my right hand with the charge and I kind of kicked

58:34.640 --> 58:40.360
 off, I could kind of jump and shove it up the tube.

58:40.360 --> 58:41.880
 Got it.

58:41.880 --> 58:42.880
 Almost enough.

58:42.880 --> 58:43.880
 Yeah.

58:43.880 --> 58:47.380
 If I was running the lanyard, which is the thing that makes it go boom, it's really easy.

58:47.380 --> 58:49.160
 It's a long rope.

58:49.160 --> 58:53.600
 You hook it on and you put it, your right hand on your hip and on your left and you hold

58:53.600 --> 58:57.400
 it there and you just stare at your sergeant like this and you just wait for him to yell

58:57.400 --> 58:58.600
 fire.

58:58.600 --> 58:59.960
 And he points at you when he does it.

58:59.960 --> 59:03.640
 And when you do it, you turn your whole body with it.

59:03.640 --> 59:09.560
 And when you do that, it alleviates a misfire, essentially, because if you just pull it sometimes

59:09.560 --> 59:10.560
 that's not enough.

59:10.560 --> 59:12.760
 You got to really give it your whole body into it.

59:12.760 --> 59:18.800
 And so he would train me on how to do things differently so that I could do them effectively.

59:18.800 --> 59:20.800
 And I wasn't a ship pump.

59:20.800 --> 59:22.160
 A what?

59:22.160 --> 59:26.040
 So ship pump is a term that we use in Canada to call somebody useless.

59:26.040 --> 59:32.120
 A ship pump is a useless soldier who is just, you're there and that's the ship pump.

59:32.120 --> 59:35.960
 And so we all just deal with it, but somehow they're still there.

59:35.960 --> 59:36.960
 Yeah.

59:36.960 --> 59:37.960
 What were we talking about?

59:37.960 --> 59:38.960
 The lanyard?

59:38.960 --> 59:39.960
 Okay.

59:39.960 --> 59:40.960
 Yeah.

59:40.960 --> 59:41.960
 We were talking about the artillery guns.

59:41.960 --> 59:48.160
 So those things though, what you would find fascinating is just how they break down when

59:48.160 --> 59:49.560
 you have to take one of those apart.

59:49.560 --> 59:55.400
 I think your mind would really find it fascinating how a breach comes apart all the way down

59:55.400 --> 59:58.200
 to ball bearing size.

59:58.200 --> 1:00:02.560
 And there's a way to just make that gun complete ineffective and all you have to do when you're

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:08.560
 on the charge side, there's a magazine that's a long linear magazine and it holds like 15

1:00:08.560 --> 1:00:09.560
 little rounds.

1:00:09.560 --> 1:00:13.080
 If you just take that thing out, nothing's not firing.

1:00:13.080 --> 1:00:14.960
 How many people does it take to move that?

1:00:14.960 --> 1:00:16.280
 How easy is it just to move that thing?

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:18.520
 To move a triple seven?

1:00:18.520 --> 1:00:19.520
 Triple seven.

1:00:19.520 --> 1:00:20.520
 I like it.

1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:21.520
 That's what they're called.

1:00:21.520 --> 1:00:22.520
 M triple seven.

1:00:22.520 --> 1:00:25.320
 Is a lot of the terminology crossover the same in English and French?

1:00:25.320 --> 1:00:26.320
 Okay.

1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:30.400
 I mean, M triple seven does because it's an obvious, how it's, sir, I'm sure has a separate

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:33.520
 word, but like if you're running it, you're running it in French.

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:40.200
 So like when I'd be running the, when I'm doing the charge bags and I'm doing, I'm doing,

1:00:40.200 --> 1:00:43.920
 you know, I'm loading everything and I'm getting that ready and that's my position that day.

1:00:43.920 --> 1:00:46.760
 I'm also controlling the breach.

1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:50.320
 So like how it opens, how it closes when it locks.

1:00:50.320 --> 1:00:52.840
 And so, but you have to yell that as you do it.

1:00:52.840 --> 1:00:57.480
 So you're yelling like, My Lib, Kolas, Orvet, like you have to yell all these things.

1:00:57.480 --> 1:00:59.120
 You have to learn them though.

1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:03.680
 And so for a long time it's, it's, it's, it was a little frustrating.

1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:04.680
 I won't lie.

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:05.680
 It was really exciting.

1:01:05.680 --> 1:01:10.080
 I took a lot of French, but I forgot all of it, but I think it's a beautiful, romantic

1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:11.080
 language.

1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:12.080
 It's a good language.

1:01:12.080 --> 1:01:13.080
 If it's from Quebec, it's a.

1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:14.080
 Yeah.

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:15.080
 That's true.

1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:16.320
 It's a good language to fall in love with.

1:01:16.320 --> 1:01:21.080
 Not as good as Russian, but I mean, English is, all right.

1:01:21.080 --> 1:01:24.320
 I mean, Russian, really, is that like a love language?

1:01:24.320 --> 1:01:25.320
 It is to me.

1:01:25.320 --> 1:01:29.680
 I mean, because you're Russian, but like if somebody walked up to me was like, Hey, Kelsey,

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:30.680
 I like you.

1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:33.120
 I'd be like, Oh God, he's going to put me in a camp.

1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:35.200
 That's because you don't understand love at Kelsey.

1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:36.200
 I don't.

1:01:36.200 --> 1:01:37.200
 We'll talk about that.

1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:38.200
 Okay.

1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:40.160
 How many people does it take to move them triple seven?

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:41.160
 It depends.

1:01:41.160 --> 1:01:43.680
 If you're moving it by ground, you're moving it on a truck and when you're moving it on

1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:48.120
 a truck, you're hooking the back of it onto, you're hooking the front of the barrel onto

1:01:48.120 --> 1:01:53.080
 one of those big transport looking trucks that has those cargo tents that's got soldiers

1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:54.080
 in it.

1:01:54.080 --> 1:01:57.400
 You don't want to ever move an M triple seven by that way if you don't have to the barrels

1:01:57.400 --> 1:01:58.960
 worth a million dollars.

1:01:58.960 --> 1:01:59.960
 Wow.

1:01:59.960 --> 1:02:00.960
 Okay.

1:02:00.960 --> 1:02:02.040
 So this is like a serious piece of equipment.

1:02:02.040 --> 1:02:03.120
 You don't want to move them.

1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:04.120
 Okay.

1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:07.800
 When we got to Kandahar, we were there for a couple of days.

1:02:07.800 --> 1:02:12.120
 We got flown out to the fall we were going to be at for an observation base.

1:02:12.120 --> 1:02:16.840
 Kandahar is the safe space or was the major base in Afghanistan that we were at.

1:02:16.840 --> 1:02:19.160
 There's things like Tim Hortons there.

1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.960
 There's Canada house, there's a British side, an American side, a Canadian side and that's

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:26.960
 where you see all the different countries in the world kind of come together.

1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:30.480
 You would see Italians, you would see Germans, you would see French, you would see all these

1:02:30.480 --> 1:02:33.600
 different uniforms and you never know who to salute because you don't know what each

1:02:33.600 --> 1:02:34.600
 thing means.

1:02:34.600 --> 1:02:36.640
 It doesn't feel like a war zone.

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:37.640
 No.

1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:38.640
 Oh God, no.

1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:39.640
 There's a boardwalk.

1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:41.840
 There's hockey there like floor hockey because Canada had to have that.

1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:46.880
 There's a Tim Hortons a subway, a Pizza Hut, a PX.

1:02:46.880 --> 1:02:51.400
 I think there's a restaurant there somewhere, but I never, I didn't get to go, you know,

1:02:51.400 --> 1:02:52.400
 stuff like that.

1:02:52.400 --> 1:02:53.400
 There's gyms.

1:02:53.400 --> 1:02:54.400
 You can run around it.

1:02:54.400 --> 1:02:55.400
 You feel fairly safe.

1:02:55.400 --> 1:02:57.400
 You always have a weapon on you, but you can, you know, live your life.

1:02:57.400 --> 1:03:01.640
 When you get out to the fob, the guns are already there.

1:03:01.640 --> 1:03:04.040
 So those M777s get lifted by a Chinook.

1:03:04.040 --> 1:03:07.760
 Normally, if they're going by air, they go by Chinook because they're heavy as hell.

1:03:07.760 --> 1:03:12.160
 And Chinooks can hook them under the bottom and they fly them and then they'll drop them

1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:13.160
 down.

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:18.240
 They have wheels on them, but you don't need them if you're going to leave it in place.

1:03:18.240 --> 1:03:19.240
 Got it.

1:03:19.240 --> 1:03:21.680
 And you're getting information about IEDs.

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:24.560
 You're getting a land, a lay of the land as to what's been going on in the country for

1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:26.360
 the past six months.

1:03:26.360 --> 1:03:30.040
 And this, you know, nothing, you're just like, this is your first time you're getting deployed.

1:03:30.040 --> 1:03:31.440
 So what was your deployment like?

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:36.840
 Can you tell the story of your deployment to Afghanistan?

1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:39.120
 Like the whole deployment?

1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:42.160
 Getting like actual deploying, not the deployment itself.

1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:43.560
 What's the difference between the two?

1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:46.480
 Well, actually getting ready to deploy is a little different.

1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:54.360
 So I mean, the emotional buildup to it and some of the memorable things that kind of,

1:03:54.360 --> 1:03:59.320
 you remember from that experience, both on the excitement, I get to see battle, I get

1:03:59.320 --> 1:04:04.680
 to be part of this and the fear and also like being surprised like with the Tim Hortons

1:04:04.680 --> 1:04:05.680
 and all those kinds of things.

1:04:05.680 --> 1:04:08.200
 So like the lead up before everything hit the fan.

1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:09.200
 Okay.

1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:10.200
 Cool.

1:04:10.200 --> 1:04:14.520
 So you're such a fascinating person, but yes, something like that.

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:19.000
 I've been called many things that start with the letter F.

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.000
 Yeah.

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:21.000
 No, I don't know.

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:22.400
 I don't know many words with the F. Okay.

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:27.640
 So with the buildup, so the deployment, so for the buildup for the deployment, I was

1:04:27.640 --> 1:04:30.760
 in Quebec and my unit was deploying from Quebec.

1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:33.920
 And at that time, you kind of get your marching orders.

1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:34.920
 You know, you're deploying.

1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:38.600
 I knew I was deploying before I even graduated.

1:04:38.600 --> 1:04:39.960
 That's how much they needed people.

1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:45.240
 So once I did all that training on graduation parade day, a couple men from Quebec in uniforms

1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:48.960
 came over and said, you, you, you and you are all being posted to back yet today and

1:04:48.960 --> 1:04:51.080
 you're going to deploy with us in April.

1:04:51.080 --> 1:04:52.080
 So that's how I found it.

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:53.080
 I was deploying.

1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:56.400
 Why was there such a need for troops in August then is that, is that was a well known thing

1:04:56.400 --> 1:05:01.680
 that there's a scaling up of troops and 2007 on Canada really started taking a combat

1:05:01.680 --> 1:05:06.040
 role before it was very much more a UN type deal where we're doing what we normally do

1:05:06.040 --> 1:05:10.800
 in most wars where we just, we wear blue and we don't shoot anyone.

1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:13.200
 And so we're there to help.

1:05:13.200 --> 1:05:15.960
 And so they were really, they were scaling up.

1:05:15.960 --> 1:05:19.760
 And there wasn't a lot of people in those trades initially, I think when the war kind

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:20.760
 of started.

1:05:20.760 --> 1:05:22.720
 So Canada really started to scale.

1:05:22.720 --> 1:05:27.000
 And so when I got to Quebec, we've kind of found, oh yeah, we're deploying.

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:31.280
 And it was a weird situation because I've never actually been at a unit on a non deployable

1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:32.280
 unit.

1:05:32.280 --> 1:05:33.720
 So I don't know what they do day to day.

1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:34.720
 That's different from what I did.

1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:36.640
 I just know what I did.

1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:40.800
 So we would do things like in the morning, we would get up and we would meet for PT at

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:41.800
 5am.

1:05:41.800 --> 1:05:48.200
 And that would include going for a 10k run or playing ball hockey for a few hours in

1:05:48.200 --> 1:05:52.680
 the gym or lifting weights together or, you know, just going on a Rock March, a long Rock

1:05:52.680 --> 1:05:54.480
 March should just stuff like that.

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:59.840
 You would have a shower, you would meet, and then you would just sit around the regiment.

1:05:59.840 --> 1:06:04.560
 And you would, if there was busy work, you'd mop the floors, you would clean weapons.

1:06:04.560 --> 1:06:08.120
 There wasn't a whole lot until there was a whole lot to do.

1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:10.440
 We did a lot for a while.

1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:14.920
 And then we went away on workup training to Texas for a week.

1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:21.400
 We came down here and we did live fire with our other troop that was going to be with

1:06:21.400 --> 1:06:22.400
 us.

1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:27.320
 So Alpha had two guns and two guns has two groups of people.

1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:32.600
 And so we all would go down to Texas and we did live fire here for a week and I ended

1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:35.080
 up getting gastro, which was awesome.

1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:36.680
 So thanks for that.

1:06:36.680 --> 1:06:40.400
 Apparently there was, there were having water problems and sanitary problems.

1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:43.200
 So everyone was getting it on the base.

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:44.200
 Okay.

1:06:44.200 --> 1:06:46.240
 So it just makes your life way harder.

1:06:46.240 --> 1:06:48.480
 I didn't get it towards the end till towards the end.

1:06:48.480 --> 1:06:49.800
 So that was fortunate.

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:51.640
 So we would fire live fire.

1:06:51.640 --> 1:06:53.600
 We would go out to the middle of nowhere.

1:06:53.600 --> 1:06:55.080
 The guns would be there.

1:06:55.080 --> 1:07:00.240
 And we would get, offload a truck of rounds and we would do live fire and we would practice,

1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:01.520
 just constant practice.

1:07:01.520 --> 1:07:02.520
 What's that saying?

1:07:02.520 --> 1:07:04.040
 Perfect practice makes perfect.

1:07:04.040 --> 1:07:05.040
 Yeah.

1:07:05.040 --> 1:07:09.360
 So this is a sensory, like a shooting range for artillery.

1:07:09.360 --> 1:07:10.680
 For long range.

1:07:10.680 --> 1:07:12.800
 So what does practice look like?

1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:18.440
 So you roll up in your trucks and you're, you know, you've got each group of people.

1:07:18.440 --> 1:07:21.920
 You've got two trucks and then you've got like a medic vehicle and then you've got like

1:07:21.920 --> 1:07:22.920
 an officer.

1:07:22.920 --> 1:07:26.840
 Then you've got like a medic vehicle and then you've got like an officer vehicle and a comms

1:07:26.840 --> 1:07:31.600
 vehicle and you, you go to your perspective guns and then you offload your ammo and then

1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:37.000
 you basically wait for them to send you like a, a fire mission.

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:38.000
 Wow.

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:39.000
 Get that together.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:40.320
 They would call, they would say, and miss yall sit.

1:07:40.320 --> 1:07:41.600
 So it'd be a fire mission.

1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:42.600
 So we'd wait for that.

1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:46.400
 And once we got that, then you all run like a bunch of scattered rats to the gun.

1:07:46.400 --> 1:07:49.400
 Like it's like the greatest thing you've ever seen.

1:07:49.400 --> 1:07:52.800
 And then you just wait, you wait for the call for the sergeants to say, and then you'll

1:07:52.800 --> 1:07:53.800
 hear it.

1:07:53.800 --> 1:07:54.880
 Cause it's not headphones.

1:07:54.880 --> 1:07:59.120
 You can hear it on a speaker and it'd be like, I'm not going to do in French.

1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:00.120
 Don't ask.

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:08.560
 It'd be like, um, uh, so and so 10 rounds, um, fire when ready and then you would get

1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:11.600
 your rounds ready and everyone would have them ready and would be in their perspective,

1:08:11.600 --> 1:08:16.560
 um, respective positions and then you would wait and then they would say fire when ready

1:08:16.560 --> 1:08:20.560
 and as soon as they say fire when ready, that means just start going, just start.

1:08:20.560 --> 1:08:22.200
 And then that's when the magic starts.

1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:25.360
 You go like the loop, like you shoot one or whatever.

1:08:25.360 --> 1:08:26.360
 There's a reloading process.

1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:27.360
 Yeah.

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:28.360
 There's a loop.

1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:30.440
 So what you would do, you get the fire mission and you would find out the rounds.

1:08:30.440 --> 1:08:34.040
 The two I see would be standing by the rounds and it was his job to make sure the amount

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:37.720
 of rounds that was told would be the only rounds that would go down range.

1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:42.720
 And so he'd stand there and on each round, depending on the type of round is a fuse,

1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:45.240
 which gets screwed on to the top of the round.

1:08:45.240 --> 1:08:49.040
 So they're about that big and it's just a point.

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:53.240
 And then you would have to put it on, give it a spin.

1:08:53.240 --> 1:08:58.080
 And depending if it was a time release, you had a little, um, what do you call it?

1:08:58.080 --> 1:09:00.200
 You get those at Ikea when you have to build everything.

1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:01.200
 Alan Allen.

1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:02.200
 Yeah.

1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:03.200
 Yeah.

1:09:03.200 --> 1:09:04.200
 You know what I'm talking about.

1:09:04.200 --> 1:09:05.200
 Yeah.

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:06.200
 But like a big one or something?

1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:07.200
 No, just a little one because it's a tiny little hole and you just got to click it to

1:09:07.200 --> 1:09:08.800
 where it's supposed to go.

1:09:08.800 --> 1:09:12.200
 And it depended on what the call was for and it was a timer.

1:09:12.200 --> 1:09:16.280
 When you said like wheel, you mean like a little thing then is that, is that what we're

1:09:16.280 --> 1:09:17.280
 talking about?

1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:18.280
 No, I'm talking about the round itself.

1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:20.480
 So you would put a fuse on top of the round.

1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:25.200
 So you would unload the ammo and then you would put fuses on them and the fuses are

1:09:25.200 --> 1:09:29.320
 on the top and they're like a little like a ice cream topper kind of thing.

1:09:29.320 --> 1:09:30.960
 And you would spin those on.

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:31.960
 Oh, okay.

1:09:31.960 --> 1:09:35.240
 And then once they're on, depending if it's a time release or not, you would take this

1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:38.960
 little thing and you would move it the top and that would, it's almost like a little

1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:39.960
 timer.

1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:40.960
 Cool.

1:09:40.960 --> 1:09:41.960
 Yeah.

1:09:41.960 --> 1:09:42.960
 Depended.

1:09:42.960 --> 1:09:43.960
 So you're assembling a bullet?

1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:44.960
 Essentially.

1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:46.800
 A very big one that goes up to my waist.

1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:47.800
 Cool.

1:09:47.800 --> 1:09:48.800
 Yeah.

1:09:48.800 --> 1:09:49.800
 This is very cool.

1:09:49.800 --> 1:09:50.800
 And you're a fascinating person.

1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:51.800
 Okay.

1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:55.720
 So just that you still, even years later, have all this in your memory in some way.

1:09:55.720 --> 1:10:00.200
 It's not all perfectly accurate and that's what irritates me though is because it bothers

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:04.920
 me when I can't remember things accurately, but I have a lot of, I've had a lot of memory

1:10:04.920 --> 1:10:08.960
 issues and problems after like having too many hits to the head and.

1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:11.280
 This is from earlier in childhood or later?

1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:12.280
 Both.

1:10:12.280 --> 1:10:13.280
 Okay.

1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:14.280
 Both.

1:10:14.280 --> 1:10:15.280
 The military did not help it.

1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:17.800
 Where was the hits in the head in the military?

1:10:17.800 --> 1:10:21.720
 Well, when you have a car, it'll go stuff beside your face like this and it shoots around.

1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:23.480
 It gives you a concussive blast.

1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:25.400
 Also there's new research being done.

1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:28.720
 I'll find out exactly what it is, but there's new research that's being done that shows

1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:33.480
 that if you're an artillery gunner and you stand within a certain range of that gun,

1:10:33.480 --> 1:10:37.160
 you get the same amount of concussive blasts and there's a range.

1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:40.200
 I had no idea, but you feel it when it goes off.

1:10:40.200 --> 1:10:43.800
 Like it hurt, your whole body feels it.

1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:47.200
 Your mind is fascinating because it's like literally the opposite of mine.

1:10:47.200 --> 1:10:51.440
 One you're able to speak very quickly, very clearly, very sharply.

1:10:51.440 --> 1:10:52.440
 No, what?

1:10:52.440 --> 1:10:54.720
 I talk too fast and I'm really loud because of my hearing.

1:10:54.720 --> 1:10:55.720
 No, that's perfect.

1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:56.720
 I mean, I admire that very much.

1:10:56.720 --> 1:10:58.160
 I can't do any of that.

1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:02.560
 And you listen extremely well and you're extremely attentive and you have a good memory.

1:11:02.560 --> 1:11:08.400
 So anyway, it's just fun, fun to watch you at, I can tell you were a great soldier and

1:11:08.400 --> 1:11:10.160
 just all different aspects of it.

1:11:10.160 --> 1:11:11.160
 Thank you.

1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:12.160
 I appreciate it.

1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:13.840
 But what the heck were we talking about?

1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:15.000
 Build up to the deployment.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.440
 How did we get to Texas?

1:11:16.440 --> 1:11:18.320
 Because that was part of the build up to my deployment.

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:20.680
 And Lifi, you got to, did I feel good?

1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:21.680
 Oh, yeah.

1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:26.440
 It's so good.

1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:33.400
 What's the best part about shooting artillery?

1:11:33.400 --> 1:11:35.360
 What's the thing that feels good?

1:11:35.360 --> 1:11:36.360
 Which part?

1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:37.360
 Power.

1:11:37.360 --> 1:11:38.680
 Well, the feeling of power.

1:11:38.680 --> 1:11:43.680
 Gun is the best moment of, the highest moment of the feeling of power.

1:11:43.680 --> 1:11:48.640
 Is it the whole process that you love or is there like when you actually shoot it?

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:49.640
 It's symbiotic.

1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:50.880
 It's a beautiful thing to watch.

1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:56.520
 To know that a gun can fire and it takes kind of a dance to make it work.

1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.960
 There's something about that to me that just got my heart racing.

1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:06.280
 When you actually shoot the round and you see it go and you hear it, it's unlike you

1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:07.280
 can't describe.

1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:09.800
 You know, I've never felt another feeling.

1:12:09.800 --> 1:12:15.120
 I've also never been in like an F18 or an F16 or like any, I've never been in anything

1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:16.120
 like that.

1:12:16.120 --> 1:12:20.520
 And I've, you know, I've never, trying to think of something else that'd be comparable.

1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:22.440
 I've never been in like a Formula One car.

1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:29.200
 Those are the only things I can picture being that much for me because to shoot one of those

1:12:29.200 --> 1:12:34.600
 and to know that you've done your job right means that you've helped.

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:37.840
 And that to me was really what it did it for me.

1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:42.880
 When you hear your sergeant say, mission accomplished, target hit, tired, acquired,

1:12:42.880 --> 1:12:45.680
 then you're like, that's a good feeling.

1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:47.040
 That's the stuff.

1:12:47.040 --> 1:12:48.040
 Quick pause.

1:12:48.040 --> 1:12:49.880
 Take a break, Lex.

1:12:49.880 --> 1:12:51.040
 Okay.

1:12:51.040 --> 1:12:54.320
 So live fire in Texas, we're in Texas by the way.

1:12:54.320 --> 1:12:56.600
 Fort Worth or Fort Hood, one of them.

1:12:56.600 --> 1:12:57.600
 Okay.

1:12:57.600 --> 1:13:00.080
 So like it's, what is that close to a big major city?

1:13:00.080 --> 1:13:02.040
 Do you remember visiting a city?

1:13:02.040 --> 1:13:03.040
 Oh God, no.

1:13:03.040 --> 1:13:07.360
 We fly right into the tarmac and they're like, don't touch the snakes.

1:13:07.360 --> 1:13:09.840
 And then they send you out to the field.

1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:10.840
 Got it.

1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:11.840
 Those are the only instructions.

1:13:11.840 --> 1:13:12.840
 No, really.

1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:15.880
 We went into a classroom and they're like, these are the animals that are in the wildlife

1:13:15.880 --> 1:13:16.880
 in Texas.

1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:19.960
 If you see any of them, do not approach, do not go pee outside.

1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:20.960
 Do not squat down.

1:13:20.960 --> 1:13:22.200
 It is snake season people.

1:13:22.200 --> 1:13:25.840
 And I was like pee and squat down.

1:13:25.840 --> 1:13:31.520
 Why Texas and from like Canada, is it a simulation of Afghanistan?

1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:32.520
 Yes.

1:13:32.520 --> 1:13:33.520
 Okay.

1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:34.520
 So that's, okay.

1:13:34.520 --> 1:13:38.400
 So you're getting, and that's the way the live fire was seen in artillery is like you're

1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.920
 trying to simulate certain aspects of what you might actually see in Afghanistan.

1:13:42.920 --> 1:13:43.920
 I would think so.

1:13:43.920 --> 1:13:50.360
 I mean, we, it looks like it's hot like it, you're out in the middle of nowhere.

1:13:50.360 --> 1:13:51.840
 Very similar terrain.

1:13:51.840 --> 1:13:55.840
 That's the first time we started to get to wear our tan boots and our tan, like our

1:13:55.840 --> 1:13:58.360
 combat tan stuff before you couldn't wear that.

1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:01.760
 So it gave us an opportunity to kind of break in, break in how we were going to be doing

1:14:01.760 --> 1:14:05.000
 this, what it was going to look like, how the guns were going to work and all of those

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.000
 lovely things.

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.200
 How do you go from there to being deployed?

1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:12.280
 What was the next part of the journey?

1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:17.360
 So then we go to Wainwright, Alberta, often called or referenced as Waincock, because

1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:19.680
 it sucks so bad.

1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:25.520
 It is a massive open space in Alberta, which most of Alberta is, and it's outside of a

1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:27.280
 small town called Wainwright.

1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:32.800
 And it is a field X training area for all of the Canadian military.

1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:38.120
 And it's where you do live fire, but you also do workup training.

1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:40.480
 So you go out there for a month or two, I think it is.

1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:44.040
 I don't remember the exact time we were there because it was just, you sleep in a tent, you're

1:14:44.040 --> 1:14:47.920
 in your cot, you're in like full mission mode.

1:14:47.920 --> 1:14:53.920
 And you go outside and we did this operation called Operation Maple Leaf, I think it was.

1:14:53.920 --> 1:15:01.040
 And you put on these little suits, they have haptic, you can feel when you're shot.

1:15:01.040 --> 1:15:05.880
 And then there's a little camera, sorry, screen in the front of it, and it's got button options.

1:15:05.880 --> 1:15:10.760
 And so it's to mimic if you get shot, it'll say gunshot wound, and then you have to choose,

1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:12.400
 okay, do I do this or do I do this?

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:15.520
 And depending on your response, person dies or lives.

1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:19.840
 And they have other people who aren't on a rotation for deployment come and act as the

1:15:19.840 --> 1:15:25.960
 Taliban and attack you in the middle of the night.

1:15:25.960 --> 1:15:31.400
 Is there a good understanding of the tactics that the Taliban used to attack?

1:15:31.400 --> 1:15:38.560
 I mean, this may be fast forwards to our conversation a little bit, but is there predictable strategies

1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:42.320
 on the other side that are being used in Afghanistan?

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:43.320
 By the Taliban?

1:15:43.320 --> 1:15:44.320
 By the Taliban?

1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:45.320
 Oh, 100%.

1:15:45.320 --> 1:15:55.200
 Like suicide bombers, vehicle born IEDs, their standard way to hit people really was IEDs

1:15:55.200 --> 1:16:00.760
 and vehicle born IEDs, suicide bombers, they'd put like backpacks full of an IED and then

1:16:00.760 --> 1:16:06.160
 put like toys around it and then just be like, so they will conceal it certain ways and probably

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:07.160
 use civilians.

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:08.160
 Oh, 100%.

1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:09.160
 Yeah.

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:13.280
 And women were a great way to get close to the soldiers because women seem nonthreatening.

1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:16.880
 When you see a burqa walk up to you, you're not expecting an AK47 to roll out of that

1:16:16.880 --> 1:16:21.360
 and then, or, you know, but there are great ways to get close.

1:16:21.360 --> 1:16:22.360
 Okay.

1:16:22.360 --> 1:16:24.360
 So, Wayne something?

1:16:24.360 --> 1:16:25.360
 Waincock?

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:29.080
 No, that's not how, Wayne Wright, let's go to Alberta.

1:16:29.080 --> 1:16:30.080
 Okay.

1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:32.320
 I mean, we don't have to go to Alberta, no one wants to.

1:16:32.320 --> 1:16:38.920
 No, let's, in our minds, in our imagination, so, okay, so that's getting you closer to

1:16:38.920 --> 1:16:39.920
 Afghanistan.

1:16:39.920 --> 1:16:40.920
 Right.

1:16:40.920 --> 1:16:41.920
 What was that like?

1:16:41.920 --> 1:16:44.040
 I mean, are you getting anxious at this point?

1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:45.040
 Is there a buildup?

1:16:45.040 --> 1:16:46.040
 What are you thinking?

1:16:46.040 --> 1:16:47.920
 Or is this just all part of the training?

1:16:47.920 --> 1:16:49.800
 For me, it was more part of the training.

1:16:49.800 --> 1:16:54.680
 I was excited to go because I did know that we were going to do some live fire.

1:16:54.680 --> 1:17:00.320
 I did know that we were going to be doing more of the military type job I thought we

1:17:00.320 --> 1:17:03.880
 were going to be doing because up until that point, I had just done training.

1:17:03.880 --> 1:17:07.240
 So I was learning how to march and salute and who to salute and not salute.

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:10.600
 Like that was the focus of, that was my experience of the military.

1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:14.840
 And then the next experience was sitting in a regiment, just working out a lot and going

1:17:14.840 --> 1:17:16.360
 for breakfast a lot and drinking.

1:17:16.360 --> 1:17:18.760
 Like that was, I was like, this is the army.

1:17:18.760 --> 1:17:23.640
 So when I actually got to go to Wainwright, I got my first full taste of, okay, well,

1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:24.720
 there's fire picket duty.

1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:28.520
 So one person gets picked every night to, you know, do sentry.

1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:30.200
 There's a little less sleep.

1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:32.560
 You're eating out of a canteen now.

1:17:32.560 --> 1:17:33.560
 You're drinking a canteen.

1:17:33.560 --> 1:17:35.640
 You're when you're kit more, you're in your deployable kit.

1:17:35.640 --> 1:17:40.240
 Now you're in your, you know, you're wearing your tack vest.

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:42.200
 You're getting ready to practice having plates on.

1:17:42.200 --> 1:17:44.320
 You're having ammunition on you.

1:17:44.320 --> 1:17:46.000
 You've got your weapon with you all the time.

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:51.560
 When you're on base and that kids say in Quebec, you're, you're just like an everyday job.

1:17:51.560 --> 1:17:54.120
 Maybe you can paint a clear picture to me.

1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:56.520
 When was there an understanding that you're actually getting deployed?

1:17:56.520 --> 1:18:00.760
 Was it just a sense that you're getting deployed or was this officially told to you?

1:18:00.760 --> 1:18:04.440
 I was officially told on graduation day, you're deploying in April with that kids.

1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:05.440
 Oh, there was.

1:18:05.440 --> 1:18:06.440
 Okay.

1:18:06.440 --> 1:18:07.440
 There's a date.

1:18:07.440 --> 1:18:08.440
 Like they knew.

1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:12.560
 What happened is the reason that Vecchia unit needed more people.

1:18:12.560 --> 1:18:14.600
 So they came to that and they picked five people.

1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:16.960
 There was five English speaking people that went to Vecchia.

1:18:16.960 --> 1:18:17.960
 It wasn't just myself.

1:18:17.960 --> 1:18:21.360
 There was a couple other people I knew that were English speaking that got put on other

1:18:21.360 --> 1:18:23.320
 guns within the regiment.

1:18:23.320 --> 1:18:24.880
 I wasn't with any of them.

1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:26.960
 We all kind of got split up.

1:18:26.960 --> 1:18:33.840
 And so there was an understanding that we were going to always be deploying that next

1:18:33.840 --> 1:18:34.840
 year.

1:18:34.840 --> 1:18:36.120
 It was like 2009 and you're deploying.

1:18:36.120 --> 1:18:41.320
 Whether you left in May or April, we were deploying because that was the rotation time.

1:18:41.320 --> 1:18:44.440
 So each Canadian unit did between six and nine months.

1:18:44.440 --> 1:18:49.360
 And then you knew right around that point, another base of individuals would then deploy.

1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:51.320
 So you would go on these rotations.

1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:56.440
 And so even when I was on my deployment then I was slated to go again the following year

1:18:56.440 --> 1:18:58.280
 but towards the end of the year.

1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:00.000
 So there was always a rotation.

1:19:00.000 --> 1:19:03.520
 If you were in a combat arms unit and you were in one that was a deployable unit.

1:19:03.520 --> 1:19:09.640
 So if you were from Edmonton, a PPCLI, which were the Princess Patricia's, which were their

1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:10.880
 infantry unit.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:16.360
 If you were RCR out of Petawawa, Ontario, you knew you were deploying.

1:19:16.360 --> 1:19:19.040
 If you were at Vecchia, you knew you were deploying.

1:19:19.040 --> 1:19:22.000
 There's combat arms bases and then there's like naval bases.

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:23.480
 I didn't know their deployment structure.

1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:25.240
 I didn't know how they worked.

1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:26.240
 I'm on the ground.

1:19:26.240 --> 1:19:27.440
 I don't worry about the boats.

1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:29.280
 So I didn't know how the Air Force deployed.

1:19:29.280 --> 1:19:36.040
 I knew Vecchia was deploying in April, you were going, get ready.

1:19:36.040 --> 1:19:37.040
 That was that.

1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:39.040
 So you show up to Afghanistan.

1:19:39.040 --> 1:19:43.320
 What is a combat arms unit looks like?

1:19:43.320 --> 1:19:45.200
 What's the situation look like?

1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:47.640
 How much chaos is there?

1:19:47.640 --> 1:19:50.440
 How much clarity about mission is there?

1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:52.320
 What are your feelings about the whole thing?

1:19:52.320 --> 1:19:57.600
 So when you leave, the day you leave, we left Quebec, we got driven to the airport and then

1:19:57.600 --> 1:20:01.840
 we walked on to the tarmac and we load our own bags and we got on a plane and it's just

1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:02.840
 empty.

1:20:02.840 --> 1:20:04.320
 It's just, it's our plane, right?

1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:06.200
 And you don't go right to Afghanistan.

1:20:06.200 --> 1:20:10.040
 You go to a stopover point, which I don't know if I'm allowed to say where that is,

1:20:10.040 --> 1:20:11.040
 frankly.

1:20:11.040 --> 1:20:15.440
 So I just say it's somewhere overseas and you go there and you go there for a couple

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:16.440
 of days.

1:20:16.440 --> 1:20:18.760
 I think it's like a day or two and that's where you get like your kit.

1:20:18.760 --> 1:20:21.360
 That's where you get your bulletproof plates for the first time and realize how heavy those

1:20:21.360 --> 1:20:22.360
 fucking things are.

1:20:22.360 --> 1:20:26.560
 It's where you get your weapon and your ammunition, your first few mags.

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:31.320
 It's where you get your helmet and your vests and you get everything that you need.

1:20:31.320 --> 1:20:34.160
 While you're there, it's pretty nonchalant.

1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:35.160
 It's hot as hell.

1:20:35.160 --> 1:20:36.960
 It's your first time being in that kind of heat.

1:20:36.960 --> 1:20:38.880
 So you just never stop sweating.

1:20:38.880 --> 1:20:42.220
 The place we were in, it's just the second you got out of the shower, you were still

1:20:42.220 --> 1:20:43.440
 wet after you got out.

1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:44.560
 What the hell is happening?

1:20:44.560 --> 1:20:45.560
 It's so humid.

1:20:45.560 --> 1:20:47.560
 And I'm like, is this going to be like this in Afghanistan?

1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:49.400
 I'm like, no, it's not humid there at all.

1:20:49.400 --> 1:20:51.240
 I'm like, why is this so bad here?

1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:52.560
 Like, it'll be fine.

1:20:52.560 --> 1:20:53.960
 Don't worry about it.

1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:58.560
 So and where we were there, it was kind of cute.

1:20:58.560 --> 1:21:04.440
 We were like in a base, within a base and they had like turf and we had like ice cream

1:21:04.440 --> 1:21:07.920
 and fruit and you could go get on a computer.

1:21:07.920 --> 1:21:08.920
 You could go make calls.

1:21:08.920 --> 1:21:09.920
 You had showers.

1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:10.920
 You had a real bed.

1:21:10.920 --> 1:21:14.560
 It was very kind of okay for that point.

1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:17.520
 And then you got all your stuff and then okay, we're rolling out, which is about a five hour

1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:18.520
 flight.

1:21:18.520 --> 1:21:23.400
 Again, my experience with helicopters is mostly from another Arnold Schwarzenegger movie,

1:21:23.400 --> 1:21:24.400
 The Predator.

1:21:24.400 --> 1:21:25.400
 Hi.

1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:29.720
 I'm not, do you want me to say I've never seen it?

1:21:29.720 --> 1:21:30.720
 I've never seen it, Lex.

1:21:30.720 --> 1:21:31.880
 You feel better about yourself?

1:21:31.880 --> 1:21:37.600
 You want to tell the audience the, all the excellent shows that you mentioned me offline

1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:39.960
 that you watch instead, instead of platoon.

1:21:39.960 --> 1:21:40.960
 Listen.

1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:41.960
 Yeah.

1:21:41.960 --> 1:21:43.720
 This nine is Sex and the City.

1:21:43.720 --> 1:21:44.920
 Was that more important than platoon?

1:21:44.920 --> 1:21:46.720
 Oh no, I've never seen that.

1:21:46.720 --> 1:21:47.720
 Don't put me in that category.

1:21:47.720 --> 1:21:49.600
 Did you just put me in a box?

1:21:49.600 --> 1:21:50.600
 I did.

1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:51.600
 I watched like Homeland.

1:21:51.600 --> 1:21:53.160
 I watched, no, I watched like.

1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:55.040
 I watched a lot of documentaries.

1:21:55.040 --> 1:22:00.840
 I watched, I like to watch real, real things more than, than, than just film.

1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:05.360
 I did a little bit of film stuff when I got back into Canada.

1:22:05.360 --> 1:22:08.880
 And I was like, once you're, once you've seen how it's made, I'm like, I don't want to do

1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:09.880
 it.

1:22:09.880 --> 1:22:10.880
 Yeah.

1:22:10.880 --> 1:22:11.880
 I mean, I'm the same way as superhero movies.

1:22:11.880 --> 1:22:17.360
 It doesn't, I want, I want, I want something closer to reality, but then movies like platoon

1:22:17.360 --> 1:22:21.120
 reveal some deep aspect of reality without it.

1:22:21.120 --> 1:22:23.360
 I did Superman, Man of Steel.

1:22:23.360 --> 1:22:24.360
 Wait, you, sorry.

1:22:24.360 --> 1:22:25.920
 You, you were, what do you mean you did?

1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:30.560
 I was not a military expert, but I was a stunt expert.

1:22:30.560 --> 1:22:33.280
 Even though I didn't actually have to do any stunts, it's just because I had previous

1:22:33.280 --> 1:22:36.560
 military experience and they were going to have me as an extra, as a military person.

1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:39.520
 But if you have previous experience, they have to make it as like a stunt role, like

1:22:39.520 --> 1:22:40.520
 so you get paid more.

1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:41.520
 Got it.

1:22:41.520 --> 1:22:45.680
 So I got to sit at a desk and I was in that, I was in that like, you see me like for like

1:22:45.680 --> 1:22:46.680
 two seconds.

1:22:46.680 --> 1:22:50.200
 So what you're saying is you were the mastermind behind that movie?

1:22:50.200 --> 1:22:51.840
 For the entire thing.

1:22:51.840 --> 1:22:52.840
 You're so accurate.

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:53.840
 Okay.

1:22:53.840 --> 1:22:54.840
 Great.

1:22:54.840 --> 1:22:56.400
 Your representation of me is just fantastic.

1:22:56.400 --> 1:23:04.040
 The combat arms unit in Afghanistan, the ice cream machine, what, like when you actually

1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:08.040
 get closer and closer to the mission, what, when does that happen?

1:23:08.040 --> 1:23:11.600
 When I, you know, got to where we were before we were leaving to get on the plane.

1:23:11.600 --> 1:23:15.880
 I don't really, really, I don't think I realized what the hell I was doing, truthfully.

1:23:15.880 --> 1:23:18.400
 Like you're asking me all these like, what did you feel?

1:23:18.400 --> 1:23:22.400
 How do you just like, when I really think about it, if I sit there and really think

1:23:22.400 --> 1:23:26.720
 about it, I was deploying, I was aware, I knew what I was going to do.

1:23:26.720 --> 1:23:32.720
 I knew my job, but once we actually stepped onto that herk to leave to get into the Afghan

1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.920
 airspace, I think that's when it hit me.

1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:35.920
 Yeah.

1:23:35.920 --> 1:23:38.240
 I think it's smacked me in the face so hard.

1:23:38.240 --> 1:23:48.240
 And that's when the overwhelming just reality was that, oh fuck, oh, oh, oh.

1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:54.000
 So, when they said, make weapons ready, put the barrels of the ground, put your helmets

1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:58.120
 on, that's when they start flying tactically, which means they're going between the mountains.

1:23:58.120 --> 1:23:59.640
 That means we're going to land soon.

1:23:59.640 --> 1:24:04.480
 Which means if you're flying like this, it's because RPGs can hit you.

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:08.840
 So that was my first moment of, oh, I could like just be shot down right now.

1:24:08.840 --> 1:24:11.640
 Like I couldn't, I didn't grasp it.

1:24:11.640 --> 1:24:13.640
 I was, how old was I?

1:24:13.640 --> 1:24:14.640
 19.

1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:15.640
 19.

1:24:15.640 --> 1:24:16.640
 Yeah.

1:24:16.640 --> 1:24:17.640
 Wow.

1:24:17.640 --> 1:24:20.720
 That's why I feel bad when I'm trying to explain to you because it's hard because I don't know

1:24:20.720 --> 1:24:26.040
 that I actually did grasp it until I was in the air getting ready to land in Kandahar.

1:24:26.040 --> 1:24:33.040
 What was the first time you heard bullets, enemy bullets or enemy explosions?

1:24:33.040 --> 1:24:38.840
 Well, when you're in Kandahar, when you're at calf, you're fairly insulated away from

1:24:38.840 --> 1:24:39.840
 the main walls.

1:24:39.840 --> 1:24:43.880
 You would hear stuff go off or you would hear the rocket sirens would go off.

1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:48.360
 So you would hear them and everyone just kind of just got down on the ground and just waited

1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:50.800
 for the all clear and then got back up.

1:24:50.800 --> 1:24:58.160
 I didn't hear any actual live fire until I got to the fob.

1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:00.320
 It was more just a lot of noise.

1:25:00.320 --> 1:25:04.240
 You would hear a lot of helicopters, a lot of planes going in and out of the base.

1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:07.360
 So there was that sense you could feel the ground shake when they took off, but there

1:25:07.360 --> 1:25:10.280
 was that sense, you know, things were going around, things were happening.

1:25:10.280 --> 1:25:17.640
 You just weren't far enough, you were not close enough to the edges of calf to see it.

1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:18.640
 What's the fob?

1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:23.440
 The fob is a forward observation base, which is a small little base out in the middle of

1:25:23.440 --> 1:25:25.120
 wherever.

1:25:25.120 --> 1:25:32.200
 And that's specific to artillery that's in general just an observation base from which

1:25:32.200 --> 1:25:33.200
 combat.

1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:36.560
 For infantry to go in and out of, for armor to go in and out of, special ops go in and

1:25:36.560 --> 1:25:37.560
 out of them.

1:25:37.560 --> 1:25:38.560
 They fly.

1:25:38.560 --> 1:25:39.560
 They'll stop there.

1:25:39.560 --> 1:25:41.120
 They'll go out of whatever, then they'll go out.

1:25:41.120 --> 1:25:45.920
 So it's a forward observation base is used essentially to have eyes in that area without

1:25:45.920 --> 1:25:48.240
 having to be doing patrols every five seconds.

1:25:48.240 --> 1:25:51.040
 But there's not, is it like, is there like medics there, is it stopped?

1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:52.040
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:25:52.040 --> 1:25:53.040
 So it was actual base?

1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:54.040
 Yeah.

1:25:54.040 --> 1:25:55.800
 I was, it's a, I don't call it an actual base.

1:25:55.800 --> 1:26:01.560
 These sleep intents and cots and it is the walls are this mesh material that are filled

1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:05.440
 with gravel and that's the walls.

1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:06.840
 And then you have towers.

1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:10.840
 You had five, I think we had five towers because the Americans ran four and we ran one.

1:26:10.840 --> 1:26:12.360
 And so it was an American fob.

1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:14.720
 It's called fob ramrod.

1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:20.360
 And there was a, whether I'm Marines, no, I think they were the hundred and first.

1:26:20.360 --> 1:26:24.600
 They read of their, this is where I get dicey because I was moved a lot.

1:26:24.600 --> 1:26:25.960
 So when people are like, who are you with?

1:26:25.960 --> 1:26:29.160
 I'm like, I know what their patches looked like.

1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:30.920
 I don't know the full ins and outs.

1:26:30.920 --> 1:26:34.120
 So I'm working on getting that back so that I can tell it accurately because I believe

1:26:34.120 --> 1:26:38.680
 it deserves that type of respect, but that being said, I'm still trying to wrap my brain

1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:40.280
 around all of this.

1:26:40.280 --> 1:26:41.280
 Yeah.

1:26:41.280 --> 1:26:46.720
 You almost have to go back and do like research to understand the full details of all the

1:26:46.720 --> 1:26:47.960
 things you were experiencing.

1:26:47.960 --> 1:26:50.800
 And so I reached out to actually a bunch of people even before I wrote the book and I

1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:51.800
 didn't get a lot of answers.

1:26:51.800 --> 1:26:55.360
 Well, once I did Jocko, all the people have reached out to me and were like, Hey, now

1:26:55.360 --> 1:26:56.720
 I'm like, called you.

1:26:56.720 --> 1:26:57.720
 So now I'm worried.

1:26:57.720 --> 1:27:02.760
 That's why I'm doing the rewrite is I'm working on making sure that things are exact.

1:27:02.760 --> 1:27:05.960
 And so there was infantry units going in and out of that fob.

1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:08.360
 And it was a really tiny fob.

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:10.880
 It was run by the Americans.

1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:15.960
 And then there was a tiny little corner that was the Canadian artillery unit.

1:27:15.960 --> 1:27:19.720
 And the Americans, normally it's Americans shooting for Americans, Canadians shooting

1:27:19.720 --> 1:27:20.880
 for Canadians.

1:27:20.880 --> 1:27:22.280
 The rest of the regiment that deployed.

1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:27.360
 So Bravo and Charlie, they were at Canadian fobs, Massumgaard and another one.

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:29.200
 And these were huge fobs.

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:34.280
 Where's was this tiny, like three kilometer around place?

1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:36.480
 And we had this tiny little subsection of it.

1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:40.280
 And the rest was so it was like this and then all American here.

1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:44.320
 And when we got there, we landed, the guns were already there.

1:27:44.320 --> 1:27:46.120
 So you ripped out the unit before you.

1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:50.880
 So those guys were just leaving and we were just replacing them so that we knew the guns,

1:27:50.880 --> 1:27:51.880
 they were Canadian guns.

1:27:51.880 --> 1:27:55.120
 We understood, you know, how to run those, that was fine.

1:27:55.120 --> 1:28:01.760
 When we got there, though, we had come in on Chinook and Chinooks are super loud.

1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:03.120
 And they're like, we're hearing protection.

1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:07.080
 They don't, you know, no, this is not reality.

1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:08.560
 Like this is why I'm partially deaf now.

1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:09.560
 Like this is not reality.

1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:15.880
 So sorry to take a tangent, but do you usually wear ear protection in any aspects of warfare

1:28:15.880 --> 1:28:17.480
 of this whole process?

1:28:17.480 --> 1:28:23.040
 You wear comms, like you have a calm on like and a radio if you're outside the wire.

1:28:23.040 --> 1:28:25.280
 So comms, is that like a Bluetooth headset?

1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:26.840
 Yes, it's a Bluetooth headset.

1:28:26.840 --> 1:28:27.840
 Okay.

1:28:27.840 --> 1:28:30.520
 No, like from Nike or like I bought a pod.

1:28:30.520 --> 1:28:31.520
 Okay.

1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:33.520
 Maybe Apple was involved at some point.

1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:34.520
 I don't know.

1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:36.000
 This equipment looked like it was from World War II.

1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.960
 So it's comms, but is that having ear protection?

1:28:38.960 --> 1:28:42.040
 Like, no, no, and I didn't wear them.

1:28:42.040 --> 1:28:43.680
 That's just what some people wore.

1:28:43.680 --> 1:28:46.840
 People when you were as low as me, like we weren't privy to conversation.

1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:48.960
 Like we were just told what to do and you do it.

1:28:48.960 --> 1:28:53.160
 So when you're doing like on the OP tower, you have a radio you pick up and you call

1:28:53.160 --> 1:28:54.400
 in and then you put the radio down.

1:28:54.400 --> 1:28:59.560
 But for hearing protection, I mean, I would put in earplugs, but those things are so violently

1:28:59.560 --> 1:29:02.600
 loud that earplugs, they don't do it justice.

1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:09.520
 I feel like when you go shooting, there's certain kinds of earplugs that you, it blocks

1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:14.400
 out the gun, like certain kinds of sounds associated with guns and you can still hear

1:29:14.400 --> 1:29:16.040
 other types of stuff.

1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:20.720
 So the ones they issued us were these big things that had like a headpiece like here,

1:29:20.720 --> 1:29:22.920
 but you have to wear your helmet when you're firing.

1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:23.920
 Right.

1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:25.320
 So you can't have both on.

1:29:25.320 --> 1:29:26.320
 Okay.

1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:29.240
 So how much are you aware of the logistics of the whole thing?

1:29:29.240 --> 1:29:31.880
 That's always fascinating with warfare.

1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:37.000
 Like in terms of setting up, you mentioned gravel and the fobs, like setting all those

1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:38.000
 bases up.

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:41.880
 Were you seeing any of this or again, it's a 19 year old kind of just.

1:29:41.880 --> 1:29:43.320
 Well, it's not that I was oblivious.

1:29:43.320 --> 1:29:44.920
 That's the one thing I would say I wasn't.

1:29:44.920 --> 1:29:47.120
 I was, I'm very aware of my surroundings.

1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:50.480
 That's something that's always been taught to me from a very early age because I travel

1:29:50.480 --> 1:29:52.120
 a lot with my dad in the truck.

1:29:52.120 --> 1:29:54.640
 And so my dad would be like, you're going to go into that bathroom and I'm going to

1:29:54.640 --> 1:29:58.960
 watch you come out and you're going to watch everyone around you because people get kidnapped.

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:00.680
 Like that's just the reality.

1:30:00.680 --> 1:30:03.280
 I was always very paranoid.

1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:07.040
 So, so you're paying attention to surroundings.

1:30:07.040 --> 1:30:09.600
 But the Bob was already built up when we got there.

1:30:09.600 --> 1:30:13.200
 This is already like well established bases already like there's, there's established

1:30:13.200 --> 1:30:14.200
 enough.

1:30:14.200 --> 1:30:19.960
 And that is one of the first times you've heard actual fire.

1:30:19.960 --> 1:30:20.960
 Yeah.

1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:24.280
 That was like the, I mean, I'd heard it on the, when we, when we shoot and when we,

1:30:24.280 --> 1:30:28.200
 you know, zero in weapons and we do all that stuff, but I had never heard it, heard it

1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:29.960
 like that before.

1:30:29.960 --> 1:30:33.800
 And then you would see the, the guys, the Americans would roll out every day and go

1:30:33.800 --> 1:30:36.040
 on patrol and come back, go back, back.

1:30:36.040 --> 1:30:39.840
 And so you would see them, you would hear them, they would tell the stories, those

1:30:39.840 --> 1:30:41.080
 types of things.

1:30:41.080 --> 1:30:45.640
 But I never experienced it because we never, we never got attacked like our base never

1:30:45.640 --> 1:30:46.640
 got hit.

1:30:46.640 --> 1:30:48.720
 We were really lucky that way.

1:30:48.720 --> 1:30:51.480
 There were other ones around us that were getting hit, but we weren't, we weren't getting

1:30:51.480 --> 1:30:52.480
 hit.

1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:54.760
 So we were very fortunate.

1:30:54.760 --> 1:30:56.320
 At least we didn't get hit when I was there.

1:30:56.320 --> 1:31:00.560
 I believe the entry got, there was an attempt.

1:31:00.560 --> 1:31:05.080
 There was an attempt at some point in a past, but I, I wasn't privy to that.

1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:06.320
 But we were in the OP towers.

1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:10.400
 So we had to do our own security, but because we were such a small subset of Canadians and

1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:14.760
 we always had to have people running the guns and ready to run the guns at all times.

1:31:14.760 --> 1:31:16.560
 We only had to man one tower.

1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:20.840
 So you would do four hour shifts with a fire team partner in the tower, depending on whatever,

1:31:20.840 --> 1:31:22.240
 but you would do it every day.

1:31:22.240 --> 1:31:26.920
 So I would look out into the, the rest of Afghanistan at that opportunity.

1:31:26.920 --> 1:31:28.320
 Otherwise it was just like your walls.

1:31:28.320 --> 1:31:29.720
 What do they look like?

1:31:29.720 --> 1:31:31.120
 Is it beautiful?

1:31:31.120 --> 1:31:33.040
 Just the full landscape?

1:31:33.040 --> 1:31:34.040
 Or is it?

1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:39.560
 Where I was, there was mountains in the distance, it was just very sandy, very flat.

1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:41.920
 And there was a couple of small compounds on the outside.

1:31:41.920 --> 1:31:43.760
 It wasn't a lot to look at.

1:31:43.760 --> 1:31:47.160
 There was a long road that you knew that got hit all the time.

1:31:47.160 --> 1:31:49.880
 There wasn't a lot to look at.

1:31:49.880 --> 1:31:56.000
 Such a strange place to be the center of superpowers over the decades.

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.000
 It really is.

1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:02.840
 Like, and, and the fact that the populace, the civilians are almost completely clueless

1:32:02.840 --> 1:32:07.880
 to the full history of things in terms of globally, the geopolitics of it all.

1:32:07.880 --> 1:32:12.240
 Yeah, well, if you look at the location of it, right, on a map, it makes more sense.

1:32:12.240 --> 1:32:13.240
 Right.

1:32:13.240 --> 1:32:15.440
 You can wrap your brain around it.

1:32:15.440 --> 1:32:18.400
 But I met plenty of people who had never even seen a picture of themselves when I was

1:32:18.400 --> 1:32:19.400
 in that country.

1:32:19.400 --> 1:32:22.440
 So, I mean, how much more are they going to understand if they don't know what even

1:32:22.440 --> 1:32:24.720
 exists outside?

1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:31.400
 You tell a small story of taking a picture of a girl and showing it to her, an Afghani

1:32:31.400 --> 1:32:32.400
 girl.

1:32:32.400 --> 1:32:33.400
 Yeah.

1:32:33.400 --> 1:32:37.720
 We were, I was with the British at that time, and we were on that operation that gets

1:32:37.720 --> 1:32:39.560
 highlighted quite a bit.

1:32:39.560 --> 1:32:44.120
 And we had stopped and we, the icon radios were pinging, and icon radios are a radio

1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:51.440
 that we have an interpreter on that the Taliban, basically we can hear what they're saying.

1:32:51.440 --> 1:32:52.440
 It's their comms.

1:32:52.440 --> 1:32:53.680
 It's us tapped in.

1:32:53.680 --> 1:32:56.160
 When it's really clear, they're close.

1:32:56.160 --> 1:32:59.600
 When it's scatty and it's, they're far enough away.

1:32:59.600 --> 1:33:04.160
 Normally, you know, they're not planning an attack, although you never know, really.

1:33:04.160 --> 1:33:09.360
 And we, we were going door to door, kind of like what they're doing now.

1:33:09.360 --> 1:33:12.800
 And we were pulling people out of their houses and we knew there were, there was people in

1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:15.400
 there that were active Taliban and we knew the icons were pinging.

1:33:15.400 --> 1:33:18.920
 When we got in there, they had hidden all the women and kids and locked them inside

1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:24.640
 the house because often nowadays women, the women, they would hide things on them that

1:33:24.640 --> 1:33:28.040
 they shouldn't have because no one would be ever there to search them because there isn't

1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:32.600
 a lot of women on the front lines, but I got borrowed to go specifically search women and

1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:33.600
 children.

1:33:33.600 --> 1:33:38.520
 So they had me and one of the little girls kind of snuck out and was kind of sitting

1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:41.000
 near me and I was eating something.

1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.640
 And I had like these little, these little candies that are called little sweeties.

1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:46.080
 The British have them in the ration packs.

1:33:46.080 --> 1:33:47.080
 I don't know.

1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:48.080
 They're good though.

1:33:48.080 --> 1:33:49.080
 And she saw me eating them.

1:33:49.080 --> 1:33:52.560
 And so I gave them to her and then her brother came over and slapped her upside the head

1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:53.560
 and took them from her.

1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:56.720
 So then I just went over and slapped him upside the head and just pointed my gun at her while

1:33:56.720 --> 1:34:01.080
 she ate them all because I was like, no, like you can have these.

1:34:01.080 --> 1:34:03.960
 I mean, I'm going to stand here and make sure you do.

1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:06.800
 And I remember asking, can I take a picture with her?

1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:07.800
 I asked the trip.

1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:08.800
 Can you ask her?

1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:10.640
 Can I take a picture with her?

1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:14.560
 And she was very confused and when you look at the photo, you see her face, she's very

1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:15.560
 stunned.

1:34:15.560 --> 1:34:16.560
 She's very stunned.

1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:17.560
 And it wasn't my camera.

1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:18.560
 It was my officer's camera.

1:34:18.560 --> 1:34:22.240
 It was a hot pink, like fluorescent pink camera.

1:34:22.240 --> 1:34:27.400
 So I pulled this like huge pink thing and I'm like, let's take a picture.

1:34:27.400 --> 1:34:30.600
 And so she stood there and took a picture, but then she grabbed the camera because I flipped

1:34:30.600 --> 1:34:36.120
 it and showed it to her and her eyes got huge and she grabbed it and she ran inside.

1:34:36.120 --> 1:34:37.760
 And they're like, oh, that's gone forever.

1:34:37.760 --> 1:34:40.120
 Like that's, that's over for you.

1:34:40.120 --> 1:34:44.840
 And then she came out and she kind of snuck out and I went in and grabbed it and the mom

1:34:44.840 --> 1:34:50.360
 lifted up her burqa and was showing me that she like shaped her legs to be more Western.

1:34:50.360 --> 1:35:00.280
 And I was just, at that moment, I don't know that I could have realized how much that moment

1:35:00.280 --> 1:35:07.640
 affected me, how much, how much that moment would affect me later on in my life until

1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:09.520
 it's been later on in my life.

1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:10.520
 Yeah.

1:35:10.520 --> 1:35:16.880
 There's little like glimmers like that in, in parts of the world that are basically you're

1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:21.800
 taking away everything from the populace, like freedoms and so on.

1:35:21.800 --> 1:35:29.280
 And when they, when you see that glimmer of humanity, like, yeah, shaved legs or, or like

1:35:29.280 --> 1:35:34.480
 using technology for the first time, it's magic or like food and being presented with

1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:36.640
 certain kinds of foods that you've never tried.

1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:46.320
 I mean, you want to see true like joy of discovery is you bring basically the American supermarket,

1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:49.040
 anything from it to most parts of the world.

1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:55.240
 And they, I just, I mean, I remember even, I mean, we weren't like in poverty in Russia,

1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:58.400
 just poor, but just the supermarket was full of joy.

1:35:58.400 --> 1:36:02.960
 I, I thought I could just die happy in an American supermarket when I first saw it.

1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:04.720
 And how old were you when you came here?

1:36:04.720 --> 1:36:05.720
 13.

1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:06.720
 Did you speak English?

1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:11.400
 Yeah, not, well, I thought I was, I never was good at languages.

1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:16.400
 So I, it was very much like, why would I need to learn another language?

1:36:16.400 --> 1:36:17.400
 Okay.

1:36:17.400 --> 1:36:24.640
 It was that attitude is very like, doesn't, I don't, well, no, I think culturally in,

1:36:24.640 --> 1:36:30.440
 not in America, but everywhere else in the world, it's constantly kind of seen, it's

1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:35.480
 a good thing to do to learn other languages, because especially English, because it's like,

1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:37.640
 that's the language of the world.

1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:43.120
 And I just thought like, I don't need English to discover the beauty of the world.

1:36:43.120 --> 1:36:45.160
 Like what, it just doesn't like, I enjoy life.

1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:46.160
 I enjoy soccer.

1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:52.200
 I enjoy, I don't remember what else I enjoyed in life, but math, like, why do I need English

1:36:52.200 --> 1:36:56.680
 for this, so that kind of attitude got me in a lot of trouble when I came here, because

1:36:56.680 --> 1:36:57.680
 I couldn't.

1:36:57.680 --> 1:36:58.680
 You were reluctant?

1:36:58.680 --> 1:37:01.280
 Yeah, but also just couldn't speak well.

1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:06.680
 And when you move 13 years old, middle school, you get made fun of a lot, you get bullied

1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:11.560
 and all those kinds of things, which in retrospect is a very positive thing, because it makes

1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:12.560
 you harder.

1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:16.280
 I thought being Russian would make, be like hard enough.

1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:17.280
 No.

1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:18.680
 Well, me, everyone is different.

1:37:18.680 --> 1:37:23.440
 I mean, the part of the Russian thing is, is kind of, you know, I'm joking, because

1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:27.800
 if you know me, I admire being hard.

1:37:27.800 --> 1:37:33.760
 I admire fighting and these kinds of things, right, these, what would you call them?

1:37:33.760 --> 1:37:37.040
 Struggle in all of its forms, martial arts, wrestling, all those kinds of things.

1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:41.680
 But I'm all, ultimately, like I'm so much about love, like I'm clearly sensitive to

1:37:41.680 --> 1:37:48.160
 the world in some weird genetic way, that it was important for me to harden up when

1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:52.480
 I, when I came here and I was in love with people and it's like, and everybody's being

1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:53.480
 mean to me.

1:37:53.480 --> 1:38:00.640
 And it's like, what, that, it's like, it's a little like, like slap, like, okay, like,

1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:03.000
 it's not, like life is not often fair.

1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:07.560
 And then that's one for me personally, everybody has, has different journeys of hardship that

1:38:07.560 --> 1:38:09.000
 are much, much more difficult.

1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:14.600
 Like your story is much more difficult is, you know, I started to read a lot.

1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:18.200
 It's like, something happens, some kind of challenge where you start to think about the

1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:21.200
 world, start to think about yourself.

1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:24.720
 That can ultimately create really interesting minds.

1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:28.720
 It can break some people, it can create interesting minds and it's ultimately your choice.

1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:30.880
 But those people are weak and then they just need to be weeded out.

1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:34.240
 I thought we talked about this, you know, the strong will survive, the weak will die

1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:35.240
 off.

1:38:35.240 --> 1:38:36.240
 Yeah.

1:38:36.240 --> 1:38:38.640
 Now, now you're talking Russian to me.

1:38:38.640 --> 1:38:39.880
 I'm not speaking Russian.

1:38:39.880 --> 1:38:43.360
 I'm just giving solid life advice.

1:38:43.360 --> 1:38:46.080
 Just be harder and then everyone will be fine.

1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:47.080
 Yeah.

1:38:47.080 --> 1:38:50.240
 That's your inner David Goggins coming out real quick here.

1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:51.240
 Okay.

1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:52.240
 The fob.

1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:53.240
 Yeah.

1:38:53.240 --> 1:38:57.280
 And then I was just explaining to you that the way it is run, you're going to love this.

1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:01.680
 When we walked up to those tents for the first time, the people that were there before

1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:05.120
 us left us a noose.

1:39:05.120 --> 1:39:07.040
 I have a photo of it.

1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:11.840
 Like hanging from the tent, like at the front of the tent, like welcome.

1:39:11.840 --> 1:39:17.040
 I feel like you were also mentioning like the dark humor that is a basically a funny

1:39:17.040 --> 1:39:18.040
 joke.

1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:19.040
 Correct.

1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:20.040
 Yeah.

1:39:20.040 --> 1:39:21.040
 It was funny at first.

1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:22.040
 That's pretty funny.

1:39:22.040 --> 1:39:23.040
 It was funny during the time.

1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:26.600
 Now when I look back at it, I was like, come on.

1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:28.120
 That was a poof.

1:39:28.120 --> 1:39:32.160
 I mean, I get it because they had already been there and like so afterwards I can see how

1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:34.480
 it's funny.

1:39:34.480 --> 1:39:39.120
 Now with like the suicide epidemic in the veteran community now, I'm like, I don't post

1:39:39.120 --> 1:39:40.120
 that photo.

1:39:40.120 --> 1:39:41.120
 Really?

1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:42.120
 Yeah.

1:39:42.120 --> 1:39:45.520
 Doesn't that dark humor still somehow help even when you're considering suicide?

1:39:45.520 --> 1:39:47.040
 Doesn't that some of it somehow?

1:39:47.040 --> 1:39:48.360
 Makes it copable.

1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:49.360
 Somehow.

1:39:49.360 --> 1:39:50.360
 Yeah.

1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:52.880
 It's like you're not hiding it.

1:39:52.880 --> 1:40:00.000
 It's like humor is one of the way to reveal the reality of abuse, of suffering.

1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:04.040
 If you look at, there's this photo that generates around right around suicide prevention month,

1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:05.920
 which is September.

1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:10.160
 And it's always like a photo of like Robin Williams and Bourdain and all of these other

1:40:10.160 --> 1:40:15.600
 individuals who were comedians who all took their lives and they're all smiling.

1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:19.120
 And they're like, this is the face of depression.

1:40:19.120 --> 1:40:26.480
 There's a way our brains work where humor is a necessary part of survival, whether it's

1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:31.800
 used for joyous things or it's used for ways to cope through life.

1:40:31.800 --> 1:40:35.240
 For me and the military, humor was one of the things that helped get me through.

1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:43.560
 And it still does to this day, frankly, because humor, humor makes some of the horrific things

1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:47.120
 I say not seem so horrific.

1:40:47.120 --> 1:40:52.960
 And people can digest it rather than being like, you need to be locked up somewhere.

1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:53.960
 Yeah.

1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:58.840
 And that's why I mean, one of the aspects of Russian humor, there's a darkness to it

1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:06.360
 because through it reverberates all the millions of people who died.

1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:07.360
 Right.

1:41:07.360 --> 1:41:10.360
 And it seems like the only way to make sense of it is to joke about it.

1:41:10.360 --> 1:41:11.360
 I still love it.

1:41:11.360 --> 1:41:13.760
 Because if you don't, it'll break you.

1:41:13.760 --> 1:41:14.760
 Something like that.

1:41:14.760 --> 1:41:22.080
 Also, humor just seems to be the highest form of us humans and the human experience.

1:41:22.080 --> 1:41:28.600
 It just seems to somehow accumulate the full thing, the absurdity of it, the unfairness

1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:35.040
 of it, because ultimately all of the suffering is like it's all just apes fighting for power

1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:39.960
 and love and somehow torturing each other in the process.

1:41:39.960 --> 1:41:42.680
 Hello podcast listener, Lex here.

1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:46.640
 Quick intermission to say that some of the names in the following story have been silenced

1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:49.920
 out to protect their privacy.

1:41:49.920 --> 1:42:01.680
 The story of witnessing, I think you're first, somebody you met, somebody you saw, somebody

1:42:01.680 --> 1:42:09.400
 you began to be close with, his life, him dying.

1:42:09.400 --> 1:42:11.400
 Can you tell the story of it?

1:42:11.400 --> 1:42:12.400
 Sure.

1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:14.520
 That's no problem.

1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:20.920
 I will tell you that I am going to leave some of the names out of the people because they

1:42:20.920 --> 1:42:24.000
 have reached out and asked that I do such.

1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:28.360
 I've also been informed of other things I forgot that happened during the thing that

1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:30.160
 were way worse than I thought.

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:34.680
 So I'll try to add those in because that's new information to me because my brain has

1:42:34.680 --> 1:42:35.680
 blocked it out.

1:42:35.680 --> 1:42:39.720
 But I've been told, which is good because it's better detail.

1:42:39.720 --> 1:42:47.000
 So we were doing a movement that morning and we were going from compound to compound.

1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:49.720
 I was never told what we were doing.

1:42:49.720 --> 1:42:51.160
 I knew what my job was.

1:42:51.160 --> 1:42:53.800
 I didn't know the operational overview.

1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:56.840
 I didn't know who we were looking for.

1:42:56.840 --> 1:42:58.040
 I wasn't there for that.

1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:03.680
 My job was specifically to look after the women and children and to provide support if need

1:43:03.680 --> 1:43:05.000
 be.

1:43:05.000 --> 1:43:11.480
 And when you have certain people, i.e. the bomb dog handler and the bomb dog, and then

1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:16.960
 you have the medics and then you have a female searcher, there's only one of those in each

1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:20.000
 unit or if there's even one in each unit.

1:43:20.000 --> 1:43:26.120
 I got passed between units so that they could have access to me for both.

1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:30.440
 And we were kind of sitting and we were waiting for the all clear to move.

1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:37.720
 And at that time, the compound wall I was leaning up against, I had my back up against.

1:43:37.720 --> 1:43:42.160
 I wasn't facing the direction where it actually blew up.

1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:46.920
 I had my back to it and I had happened to turn and look to the left.

1:43:46.920 --> 1:43:52.040
 And on the right hand side, across the road of where we were leaned up against, was another

1:43:52.040 --> 1:43:59.680
 compound two stories high, people inside a sniper on the roof and a spotter.

1:43:59.680 --> 1:44:07.880
 There was a handful of us on this wall and in front of me, there was a road, the road

1:44:07.880 --> 1:44:12.440
 went straight, that compound's here, there's another road here on the right hand side in

1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:13.440
 front of it.

1:44:13.440 --> 1:44:20.120
 And then this road went along here and this was a wide open space, just a huge...

1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:21.160
 We hate those.

1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:23.760
 You hate those because it's too much space.

1:44:23.760 --> 1:44:24.760
 It's too easy.

1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:26.400
 It's like fishing a barrel.

1:44:26.400 --> 1:44:32.040
 You don't want to be in that field because there's too much line of sight.

1:44:32.040 --> 1:44:36.080
 Line of sight could be IEDs, it could be anything.

1:44:36.080 --> 1:44:45.840
 And so when I was leaning up against the wall, we had sent a couple of people ahead to go

1:44:45.840 --> 1:44:50.400
 and clear the road so that we could all go along it and then clear the grape up off to

1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:52.400
 the left hand side.

1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:57.320
 We were doing that because they used those locations to put IEDs so that when you're

1:44:57.320 --> 1:45:03.120
 going to search it, it's a better chance of you blowing into a million pieces, essentially

1:45:03.120 --> 1:45:04.600
 why they love that.

1:45:04.600 --> 1:45:08.760
 Put bombs in small places, send people into small places, small places go boom, they

1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:10.520
 paid the walls.

1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:16.560
 So we were just kind of sitting and waiting and then I happened to turn and I was looking

1:45:16.560 --> 1:45:20.920
 in that direction and I heard the ground shake before I even realized what I was seeing with

1:45:20.920 --> 1:45:30.360
 my own eyes, the ground shook and I saw a big piece of a body.

1:45:30.360 --> 1:45:37.760
 I think it was the torso just kind of fly through the air and land into the field.

1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:40.840
 And as soon as that happened, all hell broke loose.

1:45:40.840 --> 1:45:44.920
 It was like the, they were sitting and watching and waiting and they do that.

1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:48.200
 And I say they, I mean the Taliban, they do that, they love that because then they can

1:45:48.200 --> 1:45:52.400
 record it for propaganda and they can use it against us and they just love being able

1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:55.240
 to take our people out.

1:45:55.240 --> 1:46:00.160
 And we had the interpreter sitting beside me and he had the icon radio on and as soon

1:46:00.160 --> 1:46:08.280
 as the blast went off, I heard just the scream of, I heard it and I knew what that meant

1:46:08.280 --> 1:46:13.960
 but I couldn't, I didn't understand what was about to happen.

1:46:13.960 --> 1:46:20.760
 I couldn't, I couldn't wrap my brain around what was about to happen because I had never

1:46:20.760 --> 1:46:24.000
 been outside the wire.

1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:29.240
 And people are like, people say to me now, they're like, no, no, there's no way that

1:46:29.240 --> 1:46:30.240
 shit's true.

1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:33.400
 There's no way that she was involved in that and then that and then in that and then in

1:46:33.400 --> 1:46:34.400
 that.

1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:35.560
 Well, let me explain.

1:46:35.560 --> 1:46:37.760
 I was one person.

1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:42.240
 I was being passed around to units.

1:46:42.240 --> 1:46:46.120
 I was with a ton of different people.

1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:52.720
 I had no comms and I was just being told where to go.

1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:57.920
 And I just happened to be like a shit hit the fan magnet, it felt like.

1:46:57.920 --> 1:47:02.280
 And then I found out later, it was not just me, it was all of us were getting it.

1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:05.840
 So that made me feel better because then I was like, well, I have a lot of survivor's

1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:06.840
 guilt.

1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:08.360
 That's like a thing that's still stuck with me.

1:47:08.360 --> 1:47:13.120
 I've worked through a lot of shit, but survivor's guilt, that's a big one for me.

1:47:13.120 --> 1:47:15.200
 Certain food is a big one for me.

1:47:15.200 --> 1:47:17.200
 Certain food.

1:47:17.200 --> 1:47:18.200
 Yeah.

1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:21.240
 Skin on food.

1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:23.800
 So like chicken with skin on it.

1:47:23.800 --> 1:47:27.280
 Oh, just because of the biology of death.

1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:32.000
 Well, when you hold people's bodies in your hands with no gloves on, you know what that

1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:33.000
 feels like.

1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:37.200
 Well, when you touch raw meat again, it's the same thing.

1:47:37.200 --> 1:47:40.600
 That's what that feels like when it's a dying or dead body.

1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:45.640
 Well, my friend was blown into a million pieces, so I just had pieces of him.

1:47:45.640 --> 1:47:54.480
 So there was no, there was no differentiator of like, this was his thigh or this was his

1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:58.560
 torso or there was like, there was none of that.

1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:06.080
 There was only one instance with the boot, but what I, at that point, we had been in

1:48:06.080 --> 1:48:07.560
 some firefights.

1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:13.840
 We had been taking some rounds, but it was more like, take a round, you know, get hit

1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:17.240
 and then we duck into a compound and we would set up and then we'd be firing.

1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:21.640
 I wasn't, I wasn't really involved in a lot of the firefights until after this.

1:48:21.640 --> 1:48:25.840
 After that, the rest of the week, I was like, I was angry and I wanted them all to go and

1:48:25.840 --> 1:48:28.600
 I wanted to be in every position to take them out myself.

1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:30.680
 So I put myself in every position.

1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:31.960
 So I made sure I was on the roof.

1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:33.040
 I made sure I was there.

1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:34.480
 I made sure, hey, you need something.

1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:35.480
 I'll fucking run it.

1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:39.440
 I don't know if I die anymore because as soon as that happened, my light switch went off.

1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:40.880
 It didn't matter anymore to me.

1:48:40.880 --> 1:48:42.560
 Can you go through what happens?

1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:43.560
 Yeah.

1:48:43.560 --> 1:48:46.560
 So are you hearing these screams?

1:48:46.560 --> 1:48:47.560
 Yeah.

1:48:47.560 --> 1:48:54.520
 So the ID went off and what had happened was they put an ID inside of a grape hut and the

1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:59.400
 grape hut has rectangular wall, rectangular holes in the wall and there's just like one

1:48:59.400 --> 1:49:05.000
 door and it's this tall mud hut with just all these like holes in it.

1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:11.480
 And they had put an ID underneath a pile of sticks and had a metal detector.

1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:12.480
 Brits carry them.

1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:15.960
 I've never seen, I think other countries have them, but I've only ever seen them use it.

1:49:15.960 --> 1:49:19.160
 And that's how we were kind of detecting if there was an ID.

1:49:19.160 --> 1:49:22.680
 We must have hit it, the sticks or something and set it off.

1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:24.560
 And it just, it was over.

1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:25.560
 There's no way he felt anything.

1:49:25.560 --> 1:49:30.840
 And then there was another guy at the door bent down on one knee and he was facing and

1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:35.880
 kind of watching for and then the blasted him on this side.

1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:38.520
 And so it took him out and pulled his kid off, pulled his helmet off, pulled everything

1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:40.720
 off, fucked him all up.

1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:41.720
 Big time.

1:49:41.720 --> 1:49:43.480
 This is one IED.

1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:44.480
 Yeah.

1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:50.160
 But it was in a contained area and he was in the doorway up and out.

1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:54.240
 Can you explain what an IED is and how does it work?

1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:55.680
 I can do my best.

1:49:55.680 --> 1:49:57.400
 They're improvised explosive devices.

1:49:57.400 --> 1:50:00.760
 They can be used pretty much out of anything to make anything.

1:50:00.760 --> 1:50:05.800
 So garbage, when we got to Afghanistan, they did the IED meeting with us.

1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:09.360
 They're like, these are what we're finding that they would show us diffused IEDs.

1:50:09.360 --> 1:50:14.240
 So they would see those big blue drums filled with gasoline buried in the ground.

1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:15.520
 You would see a wire.

1:50:15.520 --> 1:50:17.000
 It would go to a pressure plate.

1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:18.120
 You hit the pressure plate.

1:50:18.120 --> 1:50:20.640
 That would hit that and it would go.

1:50:20.640 --> 1:50:23.560
 You would see IEDs, some of them were ridiculous.

1:50:23.560 --> 1:50:29.680
 The engineering that went into some of these was hilarious because they were thinking.

1:50:29.680 --> 1:50:31.960
 They were thinking to use everything they could.

1:50:31.960 --> 1:50:34.720
 There was a cigarette pack they had used.

1:50:34.720 --> 1:50:38.640
 They lined the inside with tinfoil and when you stepped on the tinfoil, it had a piece

1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:42.560
 of wire and it was enough of a spark to set off a line of batteries that we had thrown

1:50:42.560 --> 1:50:43.880
 out that were all dead.

1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:47.240
 When you fuse them all together, there was enough juice to make it go.

1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:52.120
 Then they would attach that to like phosphorus or gasoline or whatever they could that would

1:50:52.120 --> 1:50:54.000
 make a big boom.

1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:57.880
 They would use, yeah, that's why you never kick garbage on the ground.

1:50:57.880 --> 1:50:59.920
 You'll never see me kick something on the ground.

1:50:59.920 --> 1:51:01.440
 You'll see me walk around it always.

1:51:01.440 --> 1:51:05.760
 If I ever see a pile of rocks or something that looks like it shouldn't be there, I

1:51:05.760 --> 1:51:11.240
 won't walk near it even now because they use that pile of rocks to remind people there's

1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:12.240
 something there.

1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:14.880
 We don't know what that means, but we know that something's there.

1:51:14.880 --> 1:51:24.240
 Very often, they would use anything, garbage, wires, we had to burn everything for a reason.

1:51:24.240 --> 1:51:32.960
 It's so terrifying for the source of death to be like little parts of the environment

1:51:32.960 --> 1:51:40.400
 and then people that don't look like they're not dressed as soldiers, like civilians and

1:51:40.400 --> 1:51:46.600
 like regular because then when you have to come back or even there, you're just surrounded

1:51:46.600 --> 1:51:50.520
 by danger and then you distrust everything essentially.

1:51:50.520 --> 1:51:54.760
 That's the problem and that's why you have such PTSD issues with the soldiers we have

1:51:54.760 --> 1:52:01.320
 now because you're in the environment in which it's very similar.

1:52:01.320 --> 1:52:03.800
 So there's this one IED.

1:52:03.800 --> 1:52:12.440
 So this one IED, I still don't know what it was, went off, body flew, the guy at the door,

1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:13.440
 he kicked out.

1:52:13.440 --> 1:52:19.400
 He was all broken and bleeding and a mess.

1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:22.360
 At that point, the radio started going crazy.

1:52:22.360 --> 1:52:25.640
 I could hear the guys yelling and screaming, trying to figure it out and then you could

1:52:25.640 --> 1:52:29.640
 hear the numbers being called, KAA, number, number, number, number.

1:52:29.640 --> 1:52:31.200
 I don't know anybody's service number.

1:52:31.200 --> 1:52:33.800
 I don't know what's going on.

1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:39.080
 Next thing you know, mortar rounds start coming down and live fire starts happening and I'm

1:52:39.080 --> 1:52:42.560
 like, holy fuck, things are popping off.

1:52:42.560 --> 1:52:48.440
 I remember just looking at it and being like, we need to go now and I just got this.

1:52:48.440 --> 1:52:53.920
 I was like, we're going and they're like hold on burns and I'm like, we're fucking going.

1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:58.480
 I wasn't dealing with it well and they're like, all right, all right, go, go, go, go.

1:52:58.480 --> 1:53:08.040
 So we went and I helped out with that to other individual, kind of held him down, started

1:53:08.040 --> 1:53:13.840
 doing medic work on him and he just kept saying, where's, where's, where's, he was in such

1:53:13.840 --> 1:53:14.840
 a state of shock.

1:53:14.840 --> 1:53:16.720
 I've never seen somebody's eyeball so big in my life.

1:53:16.720 --> 1:53:21.560
 He's like, where's, where's, where's, he's good, buddy, he's good, he's good.

1:53:21.560 --> 1:53:26.360
 Picture like a super thick Scottish accent though, because these guys were just, oh,

1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:29.160
 and when they talk fast, it's even worse.

1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:33.320
 And then so I ran over and we jumped down into the ditch along the side of the road

1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:39.960
 because the road hadn't been cleared and we're running through these tall, they look like

1:53:39.960 --> 1:53:44.920
 cannabis plants, but they're not, but it just, it's just very thick bush.

1:53:44.920 --> 1:53:47.440
 And I felt like I was running in slow motion.

1:53:47.440 --> 1:53:50.960
 So if you picture one of your video games where like the tunnel vision and you're just,

1:53:50.960 --> 1:53:56.240
 you can hear your breathing is like that and you're running and you can't move fast enough

1:53:56.240 --> 1:54:00.440
 and you're like trying to get there.

1:54:00.440 --> 1:54:05.520
 And we hit the road and the rounds are coming down and mortars are coming down and they're

1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:06.760
 like, okay, on three run.

1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:11.960
 So we run on three and we run into the compound, I mean, into the great putt and I remember

1:54:11.960 --> 1:54:17.440
 looking around and very seriously going, where is he?

1:54:17.440 --> 1:54:23.800
 Just genuinely asking, I think it was been messaging me and he's been incredible.

1:54:23.800 --> 1:54:26.960
 He's one of the best soldiers I've ever served with.

1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:30.000
 He was a higher up, so he was running part of this.

1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:33.960
 He's messaged me and he was giving me some information and he's like, I was in there

1:54:33.960 --> 1:54:34.960
 with you.

1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:38.640
 And he goes, I remember because you handed me the boot and because I walked over and

1:54:38.640 --> 1:54:42.920
 I, all the rounds were like, we were being shot at mortars were coming down, but it was

1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:50.840
 this slow motion and I remember walking over to the hole in the ground and seeing his boot

1:54:50.840 --> 1:54:57.920
 in the ground, but it was, his leg was still hanging like, but just below his knee was

1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:03.840
 still in it, but the boot was perfectly laced up, like the boot was fine.

1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:09.220
 And I just, I held it and I turned and I looked at the guys and I was like, we could reuse

1:55:09.220 --> 1:55:10.720
 the boot.

1:55:10.720 --> 1:55:18.960
 Now, that wasn't even, what is that?

1:55:18.960 --> 1:55:26.480
 Was that actually an intelligent attempt at humor or was it some kind of deeply lost,

1:55:26.480 --> 1:55:27.920
 like you were completely just lost?

1:55:27.920 --> 1:55:29.920
 I think my brain broke.

1:55:29.920 --> 1:55:35.160
 I think my, that's the moment I call my life switch went off.

1:55:35.160 --> 1:55:37.680
 Did you understand that he was dead at that point?

1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:45.160
 Like intellectually, you were just something that just broke.

1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:46.160
 No emotion.

1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:52.600
 Like, it just broke, it just shattered.

1:55:52.600 --> 1:55:53.600
 It shattered.

1:55:53.600 --> 1:56:08.520
 I felt it happen, felt, I didn't feel, I didn't feel anything, it just broke.

1:56:08.520 --> 1:56:14.280
 And at that moment, because later there's some anger almost at that moment, none of

1:56:14.280 --> 1:56:15.280
 that.

1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:17.240
 I couldn't comprehend what happened.

1:56:17.240 --> 1:56:23.000
 I knew he wasn't there anymore because they looked at me and said, what's here is here?

1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.440
 We're grabbing pieces we need to fucking move.

1:56:26.440 --> 1:56:32.760
 And so I handed the boot over, they took it, and then I started just grabbing anything

1:56:32.760 --> 1:56:38.680
 out of the walls, because those little rectanglers just had flesh hanging from it.

1:56:38.680 --> 1:56:42.800
 And I didn't have my gloves on, because I only used them to search.

1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:50.480
 And so you want to bring everything back like this is what even if they're dead, do

1:56:50.480 --> 1:56:55.200
 you want to save those you served with?

1:56:55.200 --> 1:56:57.200
 Yeah, because they deserve that.

1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:00.360
 They don't deserve to have a piece of them drug behind a truck for propaganda.

1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:02.240
 It's not, it's not fair.

1:57:02.240 --> 1:57:07.200
 What are the others, I mean, was there just a focus on mission or was there a panic?

1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:08.960
 No panic with these guys.

1:57:08.960 --> 1:57:13.680
 These guys were the most switched on motherfuckers I've ever seen in my life.

1:57:13.680 --> 1:57:19.840
 We started grabbing and remind me, he said, you know, you, that's not, he goes, when people

1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:20.840
 say that's the worst part of your day.

1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:21.840
 That wasn't even the worst part of your day.

1:57:21.840 --> 1:57:25.840
 Do you remember when you handed me the bag of intestines?

1:57:25.840 --> 1:57:27.840
 No.

1:57:27.840 --> 1:57:36.320
 Now I do, though, thank you for that.

1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:43.000
 So there's parts you don't even, they're just not, they don't register, because I had some

1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:45.760
 people contact me and be like, you didn't tell it, right?

1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:51.680
 And war is subjective and war is from your perspective and war is messy and horrific

1:57:51.680 --> 1:58:03.360
 and war is graphic and violent and painful.

1:58:03.360 --> 1:58:07.320
 Your brain remembers what it wants to remember and your brain allows you to remember what

1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:08.320
 it allows you to remember.

1:58:08.320 --> 1:58:12.680
 And there's reasons that you don't remember everything.

1:58:12.680 --> 1:58:19.880
 And so we were getting, we were really getting hit, we were getting, it was bad.

1:58:19.880 --> 1:58:23.360
 And some of the guys, machine gunners that come up to do cover fire.

1:58:23.360 --> 1:58:30.360
 And I know we were calling in for air support to come pick up the guys because they had

1:58:30.360 --> 1:58:38.800
 to go and we, we just collected everything we could, but I did remember screaming like,

1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:39.800
 we didn't get them all.

1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:40.800
 We didn't get them all.

1:58:40.800 --> 1:58:41.800
 There's no way we got them all.

1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.880
 And I remember one of the guys looking at me and be like, we got him, we got him.

1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:46.000
 I'm like, we didn't fucking get him.

1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:47.000
 We didn't get him.

1:58:47.000 --> 1:58:48.000
 We're like, no, we got him.

1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:50.800
 And I couldn't say it enough.

1:58:50.800 --> 1:58:54.200
 And so I grabbed as much as I could.

1:58:54.200 --> 1:58:59.120
 I, I, I slung one of their weapons and it was just a twisted heap.

1:58:59.120 --> 1:59:03.520
 And I had his helmet, someone else's helmet in my arm.

1:59:03.520 --> 1:59:10.000
 And then I had my weapon in front of me and I was carrying it.

1:59:10.000 --> 1:59:13.720
 And then we, we piled everything we had onto a stretcher.

1:59:13.720 --> 1:59:16.720
 Those things are super fucking flimsy anyway.

1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:19.960
 And there was a couple of guys in front of us and there was a couple behind me and I

1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:22.560
 was kind of in the middle.

1:59:22.560 --> 1:59:24.560
 And we, we said, okay, we're just going to have to run.

1:59:24.560 --> 1:59:25.560
 We're going to have to fucking run the road.

1:59:25.560 --> 1:59:26.560
 We're going to have to run it.

1:59:26.560 --> 1:59:27.560
 There's a chance it.

1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:28.560
 So we ran it.

1:59:28.560 --> 1:59:32.600
 And that was the closest, well, that was, I guess not the closest, but it felt like

1:59:32.600 --> 1:59:39.040
 it was the closest I could hear the, the whiz of the rounds going by me.

1:59:39.040 --> 1:59:41.880
 It was a weird noise when they're coming at you than when you're leap.

1:59:41.880 --> 1:59:44.000
 They're leaving you.

1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:47.920
 And so they, that slowed everything down for me.

1:59:47.920 --> 1:59:51.440
 And then one of the guys accidentally dropped the edge of the stretcher and everything fell

1:59:51.440 --> 1:59:53.040
 off into the ditch.

1:59:53.040 --> 1:59:56.400
 And then we had to go back down and get it back up.

1:59:56.400 --> 2:00:00.880
 And so we kept running and we finally got back into the compound that that sniper was

2:00:00.880 --> 2:00:05.240
 sitting off on the right hand side and we got all in there.

2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:09.080
 And I know the, I think said there was two flights.

2:00:09.080 --> 2:00:12.680
 I only thought there was one, but apparently there was two flights.

2:00:12.680 --> 2:00:15.400
 So went on one, his body went on one.

2:00:15.400 --> 2:00:19.120
 And then I think, I think he said went on the other.

2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:25.020
 And then they took off and then when they leave though, they rain hell down on anything

2:00:25.020 --> 2:00:26.160
 they can see on the ground.

2:00:26.160 --> 2:00:30.400
 And that is a beautiful sight because they had mortar rounds coming down and it just,

2:00:30.400 --> 2:00:33.080
 it was getting really, really bad.

2:00:33.080 --> 2:00:41.240
 And then as soon as the Black Oaks took off, all of a sudden it just stopped and went quiet.

2:00:41.240 --> 2:00:44.800
 Like deafening quiet.

2:00:44.800 --> 2:00:48.520
 And we were sitting inside the compound and I, one of the medics looked at me and you

2:00:48.520 --> 2:00:52.440
 could see, and I still do it now and I, I'm working on not doing it, but I do it when

2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:56.720
 I get really overwhelmed because I didn't have any gloves on.

2:00:56.720 --> 2:01:00.600
 I had blood over my hands and just like body and stuff.

2:01:00.600 --> 2:01:05.360
 So he came over and he just gave me like sanitizer and I started rubbing.

2:01:05.360 --> 2:01:11.200
 And so I rub, I do this when I'm stressed, I'll rub my hands.

2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:17.960
 And I still can't, I still can't do, I still can't eat food with skin on it.

2:01:17.960 --> 2:01:22.880
 And I can't like, like salmon and stuff, like I can't, I can't touch it.

2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:27.680
 And like if I'm making meat at home, like for my husband and my son, like I have like

2:01:27.680 --> 2:01:31.760
 meat gloves and then I have like a fork and a knife and I'm like cutting it, like I never

2:01:31.760 --> 2:01:32.760
 touch it.

2:01:32.760 --> 2:01:34.760
 I can't touch it.

2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:43.560
 So there's something almost like the texture of the biology of a human flesh that just,

2:01:43.560 --> 2:01:47.240
 that's at the level of, that's the level of your trauma.

2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:48.240
 Yeah.

2:01:48.240 --> 2:01:51.480
 And it's been, I mean, it's 2021, this was an O9.

2:01:51.480 --> 2:01:57.280
 And I've worked on this like, and I mean, I've been in like treatment religiously just to

2:01:57.280 --> 2:02:00.480
 be able to keep me alive for this, this decade.

2:02:00.480 --> 2:02:04.080
 And so it's not like, it's like, oh, I've never, you never even tried to get better.

2:02:04.080 --> 2:02:06.480
 It's like, I never used to leave my house.

2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:10.320
 I used to call people that looked like that horrific names in public.

2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:13.680
 I used to want to kill people on a regular basis.

2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:16.440
 I'm a fairly happy individual now.

2:02:16.440 --> 2:02:25.400
 What about, you're talking about sort of skin and parts and, but there's also just the fact

2:02:25.400 --> 2:02:31.200
 that we're mortal and there's somebody close to you who dies.

2:02:31.200 --> 2:02:34.320
 So you watch, walk up and then never come back out again?

2:02:34.320 --> 2:02:35.320
 Yeah.

2:02:35.320 --> 2:02:38.760
 It's like you're facing mortality in a very real way.

2:02:38.760 --> 2:02:45.720
 And in a way that's not the same as somebody dying from cancer in a hospital, although

2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:51.400
 it has echoes of that because that's also absurd and like, it doesn't feel like there's

2:02:51.400 --> 2:02:53.480
 justice to it in any kind of way.

2:02:53.480 --> 2:03:02.840
 But it's so sudden, like, have you been able to make sense of that, of your feelings about

2:03:02.840 --> 2:03:03.840
 it?

2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:05.360
 Like how do you feel about it?

2:03:05.360 --> 2:03:14.120
 Or is everything just shrouded in this like trauma that you're not able to just feel for

2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:19.720
 the loss of a human being, like mourn the loss of a human being?

2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:31.120
 I think I had, when I realized he wasn't there, when I realized that he, that was what was

2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:37.200
 left of him, I found out afterwards there was other parts that were outside and went

2:03:37.200 --> 2:03:38.200
 back.

2:03:38.200 --> 2:03:43.160
 I think he said went back and they got, they ended up getting the rest of him.

2:03:43.160 --> 2:03:47.040
 So that made me happy because I just found this out this week.

2:03:47.040 --> 2:03:57.840
 So that means you have a feeling like you still feel like parts of him were left behind.

2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:07.880
 On the ramp ceremony, when I lost my mind, literally, I lost my mind and I was screaming

2:04:07.880 --> 2:04:10.240
 that he wasn't all in there.

2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:18.040
 I'm happy now knowing that he was, but I held on to that for 10 years.

2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:28.360
 Yeah this, yeah, the sandbags, like it's the bulk of the weight, it's not from human

2:04:28.360 --> 2:04:29.360
 flesh.

2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:30.360
 Yeah.

2:04:30.360 --> 2:04:33.360
 He was a young kid too.

2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:38.120
 It was, I think it was his first deployment as well, like he was a young kid.

2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:44.200
 And he was just, just going to clear the road for the rest of us, right?

2:04:44.200 --> 2:04:48.560
 Like not, like, you know you're in war and you know that you're outside the wire and

2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:50.840
 you know things could happen.

2:04:50.840 --> 2:04:56.640
 You understand that to the extent you can understand that.

2:04:56.640 --> 2:04:59.680
 When it's happening, it's something very different.

2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:06.680
 Also maybe you can correct me, but there's something much more like brutal about an IED.

2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:09.000
 It's proficient.

2:05:09.000 --> 2:05:11.200
 Versus like a bullet.

2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:17.160
 Because a bullet, you still, watching somebody close to you die from a bullet, you still

2:05:17.160 --> 2:05:21.480
 get the basic humanity.

2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:27.000
 So IED basically converted a human being into sort of parts, biological parts.

2:05:27.000 --> 2:05:28.000
 Achievement.

2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:29.000
 Yeah.

2:05:29.000 --> 2:05:35.560
 Yeah, I mean I don't, that's tough.

2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:43.640
 It's tough because it's like, because it's hard for you to remember them as a human.

2:05:43.640 --> 2:05:46.000
 You remember them as parts.

2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:48.440
 For me, that's how I remember him.

2:05:48.440 --> 2:05:52.800
 I would like to, I have a picture that I post every year about him.

2:05:52.800 --> 2:06:01.600
 I see that, but I don't put two and two to get, does that make sense?

2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:03.240
 Yeah, no it does.

2:06:03.240 --> 2:06:08.680
 So I even, I listened to your story and, you know, thank you for sharing it first of all.

2:06:08.680 --> 2:06:09.680
 It's fine.

2:06:09.680 --> 2:06:14.720
 It's not my, it's, well, I'm just the one to tell it, I was just involved.

2:06:14.720 --> 2:06:20.960
 One set of eyes on this particular human being, but even I get angry.

2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:24.120
 I can't tell if it's exhaustion or anger.

2:06:24.120 --> 2:06:26.240
 I'm sorry, I look always exhausted.

2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:30.720
 Oh, that's okay, you're into robotics, isn't that like your guy's this thing?

2:06:30.720 --> 2:06:32.240
 You guys are just always working on tech?

2:06:32.240 --> 2:06:37.720
 I think because I feel so much for the world, I just don't do, we were talking about resting

2:06:37.720 --> 2:06:39.480
 bitch face earlier.

2:06:39.480 --> 2:06:45.240
 I just don't feel the need to maintain all the effort of the musculature for presenting

2:06:45.240 --> 2:06:46.880
 myself to you visually.

2:06:46.880 --> 2:06:47.880
 It's exhausting.

2:06:47.880 --> 2:06:48.880
 It's exhausting.

2:06:48.880 --> 2:06:52.440
 So I just focus on the feeling and then let the face show whatever the hell it shows.

2:06:52.440 --> 2:06:53.440
 Fair enough.

2:06:53.440 --> 2:06:55.040
 Okay.

2:06:55.040 --> 2:06:56.320
 Was there anger?

2:06:56.320 --> 2:06:57.560
 Was there hate?

2:06:57.560 --> 2:06:58.560
 Yeah.

2:06:58.560 --> 2:06:59.560
 Oh.

2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:03.120
 Can you just talk through your feelings of what you remember?

2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:04.120
 Yeah.

2:07:04.120 --> 2:07:11.400
 So after that operation with the British, I went back to the Canadians and I didn't go

2:07:11.400 --> 2:07:16.520
 back as even remotely close to who I was when I left.

2:07:16.520 --> 2:07:22.160
 And that was really troublesome for a lot of people around me because the level of anger

2:07:22.160 --> 2:07:28.600
 and hate that came out of me was palpable when I just walked by.

2:07:28.600 --> 2:07:31.680
 I got shockingly quiet.

2:07:31.680 --> 2:07:33.760
 You understand how you're learning.

2:07:33.760 --> 2:07:36.960
 That'd be terrified if you were quiet.

2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:41.760
 And I don't know if hate and anger do that justice.

2:07:41.760 --> 2:07:47.800
 I don't know another word, but I don't think those two words do it justice to the extent

2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:50.280
 that I was feeling.

2:07:50.280 --> 2:07:56.040
 I got to a point when I got attacked by a woman with some scissors, the idea crossed

2:07:56.040 --> 2:08:00.040
 my mind, I could bootstomp her to death and not feel anything about it in front of her,

2:08:00.040 --> 2:08:01.880
 all of her family and her kids.

2:08:01.880 --> 2:08:06.840
 Was it more like just not recognizing the basic humanity or was it legit hatred?

2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:07.840
 No.

2:08:07.840 --> 2:08:13.400
 It was legit hatred, but also I no longer saw those people as humans.

2:08:13.400 --> 2:08:18.160
 It took one event and when that happened, the rest of the operation, that was echoed

2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:22.480
 in the way I was to those people.

2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:27.000
 And to what level can you see those people as human?

2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:34.800
 So this is where, well, like this is where Jaco shut down.

2:08:34.800 --> 2:08:37.320
 I still think I'm right.

2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:45.640
 There's a dire straight song called Brothers in Arms and actually, anyway, we're fools

2:08:45.640 --> 2:08:48.640
 to make war on our brothers in arms.

2:08:48.640 --> 2:08:55.840
 And I brought that up to Jaco because it's humans on both sides.

2:08:55.840 --> 2:09:01.360
 But he said, not in Iraq.

2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:04.600
 To him, he's like, no, that's the enemy.

2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:07.720
 These are people who use the civilians.

2:09:07.720 --> 2:09:14.040
 They rape, they torture, they'll do anything and they put evil onto the world.

2:09:14.040 --> 2:09:21.360
 And then it's like, so they're stood on at that moment, like these two were humans and

2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:26.640
 it's politicians waging war and it's kids on both sides.

2:09:26.640 --> 2:09:28.880
 But then Jaco was like, no.

2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:31.280
 He's not wrong.

2:09:31.280 --> 2:09:36.280
 So can you carry both things with you as a soldier?

2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:40.360
 I think when I was a soldier, I could only carry one thing with me.

2:09:40.360 --> 2:09:48.080
 I think my perspective has changed drastically, but not because I've lost the reality that

2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:54.080
 they are the enemy, but I've gained my humanity back again.

2:09:54.080 --> 2:09:56.000
 And that's what I lost when I was there.

2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:57.200
 I lost all humanity.

2:09:57.200 --> 2:09:59.600
 I lost all hope for humanity.

2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:01.280
 He's not wrong.

2:10:01.280 --> 2:10:08.440
 When he says the Taliban or like when he was in Iraq, but for me, the Taliban are evil.

2:10:08.440 --> 2:10:15.200
 I still hold a spot of hatred for them that could set this building on fire.

2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:18.560
 You don't, I don't know that anybody can fully understand that.

2:10:18.560 --> 2:10:26.960
 When you watch what they do to women and to kids and they do it in the name of God, they

2:10:26.960 --> 2:10:28.080
 are the enemy.

2:10:28.080 --> 2:10:32.240
 They are less than they don't exist.

2:10:32.240 --> 2:10:36.320
 They're barely worth the bullets we put into them.

2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:45.400
 But then because they use civilians, so like then everybody becomes the enemy and how are

2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:47.400
 you supposed to make sense of that?

2:10:47.400 --> 2:10:48.400
 Like what?

2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:50.120
 You can't, but here, Lex, you can't make sense of it.

2:10:50.120 --> 2:10:54.360
 This is why they've done a really good job of blending into the civilian population.

2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:55.440
 They've done it intentionally.

2:10:55.440 --> 2:10:57.760
 They've done it on purpose.

2:10:57.760 --> 2:10:59.440
 So they're brilliant.

2:10:59.440 --> 2:11:01.040
 This is why you guys couldn't beat them.

2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:03.400
 This is why we couldn't fucking beat them.

2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:07.360
 They use their people so effectively.

2:11:07.360 --> 2:11:08.800
 They have no shame in that.

2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:10.240
 They have no issue with that.

2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:15.440
 They take no qualms with wiping a kid off the face of the earth if it means they can

2:11:15.440 --> 2:11:20.240
 get close enough to a soldier to throw a fucking bomb into their tank.

2:11:20.240 --> 2:11:22.120
 This is why they're affected.

2:11:22.120 --> 2:11:23.800
 How do you beat them then?

2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:30.160
 Is this, there's no winning that you just basically do policeman type work or you do

2:11:30.160 --> 2:11:31.160
 your best?

2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:33.280
 I mean, that's one way.

2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:38.640
 So the other is, you come from an artillery background.

2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:42.520
 A fucking hellfire missile, you get the whole place off the face there.

2:11:42.520 --> 2:11:45.240
 You can't beat radicalism like that right now.

2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:48.840
 The problem is, is we've let it go unchecked.

2:11:48.840 --> 2:11:52.320
 We had it kind of in check for 20 years.

2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:56.840
 We just shot ourselves in the foot, the chest and the face.

2:11:56.840 --> 2:12:06.480
 So the problem with force is it creates long term hate because young kids in propaganda

2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:09.160
 and like propaganda works.

2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:14.360
 So you see your father, your brother die because of a bomb.

2:12:14.360 --> 2:12:19.440
 It's very easy to convince that person that they died because of evil Americans and tell

2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:22.200
 whatever story you want about America or Canada, Russia.

2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:23.400
 That's the biggest problem.

2:12:23.400 --> 2:12:30.040
 So it seems like there got to be better solutions because, I mean, I talk about love, but it's

2:12:30.040 --> 2:12:37.320
 honestly basically figuring out sneaky ways of empowering women, of educating people of

2:12:37.320 --> 2:12:45.400
 like, and like, and not in a, not a cheesy way, but not like, like in the same level

2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:49.400
 of like mass warfare, but with love.

2:12:49.400 --> 2:12:55.880
 So you're talking about DARPA budgets, DOD budgets, but like do that where you educate

2:12:55.880 --> 2:13:01.120
 and empower women by force, you know, they want to learn, right?

2:13:01.120 --> 2:13:05.080
 I mean, you're not like forcing anybody, you're setting them free.

2:13:05.080 --> 2:13:06.080
 That's exactly it.

2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:10.800
 Like combat flip flops does this, they do this, they give literacy, they teach girls

2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:16.960
 to read nothing else to read, because as soon as you can read, you know what that happened.

2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:18.240
 You know what happens then.

2:13:18.240 --> 2:13:19.240
 What's combat flip flops?

2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:23.400
 That's the scarf right there that's made in Afghanistan.

2:13:23.400 --> 2:13:28.280
 So when you buy something from them, the proceeds go to literacy in Afghanistan for girls.

2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:30.680
 They've given literacy to 800 girls over there.

2:13:30.680 --> 2:13:31.680
 Yeah.

2:13:31.680 --> 2:13:32.680
 They're really cool.

2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:33.680
 Griff owns the one.

2:13:33.680 --> 2:13:37.040
 He was an Army Ranger and his buddy, but Lee, I think is his name.

2:13:37.040 --> 2:13:41.560
 They were on Shark Tank a long time ago, but they, they do shoes and I think they're called

2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:42.560
 Shmongs.

2:13:42.560 --> 2:13:43.560
 Shmongs.

2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:44.560
 I don't know how to say it properly.

2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:45.560
 Built in Afghanistan.

2:13:45.560 --> 2:13:46.560
 Yes.

2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:48.360
 And then the proceeds go back there.

2:13:48.360 --> 2:13:54.000
 They do great work for literacy and you know, as well as anyone, if you can teach someone

2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:55.000
 to read.

2:13:55.000 --> 2:13:57.000
 Good color.

2:13:57.000 --> 2:14:01.040
 Dark like your soul acts on the inside.

2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:02.040
 Just on the inside.

2:14:02.040 --> 2:14:03.040
 All right.

2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:06.440
 The outside is just the, it's just the suit.

2:14:06.440 --> 2:14:10.960
 I feel like you think that's your suit of armor, but I feel like it's, it's there.

2:14:10.960 --> 2:14:11.960
 I'm sorry.

2:14:11.960 --> 2:14:12.960
 What were you saying?

2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:13.960
 Sorry.

2:14:13.960 --> 2:14:14.960
 What were you saying?

2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:15.960
 I was saying.

2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:16.960
 Go on.

2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:17.960
 I will allow this.

2:14:17.960 --> 2:14:18.960
 Go to your room.

2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:24.800
 If you teach education, the problem is we've taken a massive step backwards.

2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:31.160
 I know that the Taliban have just instituted this week, honor killings will be back, stonings

2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:35.200
 are back and dismemberment as well.

2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:37.920
 Holly McKay is the reporter that's been reporting that from the ground.

2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:39.320
 She's still there.

2:14:39.320 --> 2:14:45.200
 The way to pull people, in my opinion, out of something like that is through education.

2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:51.760
 But we just took all of that away, which is pretty horrific in my opinion because you've

2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:55.560
 taught over 20 years, you're perfectly right, Lex.

2:14:55.560 --> 2:15:01.560
 When you say that hate and violence won't work, it won't because you see dad get killed

2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:02.560
 on the battlefields.

2:15:02.560 --> 2:15:06.320
 Well, that 14 year old little boy is going to pick up an AK47 and go avenge dad's death.

2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:07.440
 That's just the way it's going to be.

2:15:07.440 --> 2:15:08.600
 Well, we think about it.

2:15:08.600 --> 2:15:10.360
 You were there for 20 years.

2:15:10.360 --> 2:15:11.840
 There's a couple of generations in there.

2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:16.400
 There's another generation that's either grown up in this or is seen enough of this.

2:15:16.400 --> 2:15:22.040
 So they're always going to be a subset that think that we're the enemy and fair.

2:15:22.040 --> 2:15:24.400
 We haven't done always the greatest things.

2:15:24.400 --> 2:15:28.840
 But the one thing that we have done that I did participate in was giving literacy, giving

2:15:28.840 --> 2:15:33.840
 girls an opportunity, letting them know that you aren't second class citizens.

2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:35.720
 You can do things too.

2:15:35.720 --> 2:15:40.680
 And that's why we have to look at war differently.

2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:44.960
 There's times for violence, oh, there is time for violence.

2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:51.600
 And there is time for missiles and there is time for detainees and there's times for

2:15:51.600 --> 2:15:54.160
 bag and tags and double tops of the fucking face.

2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:59.480
 There's times for all of that, but there needs to be more time to educate.

2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:04.400
 The problem is you can't educate if you're in a country where the culture doesn't believe

2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:05.400
 in that.

2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:08.680
 You're fighting so many different things that you eat.

2:16:08.680 --> 2:16:12.720
 It's in almost an impossible situation.

2:16:12.720 --> 2:16:17.320
 When you look at the 20 years in Afghanistan and we just pulled out, there's a sudden pull

2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:21.800
 out of troops, what do you think about those 20 years?

2:16:21.800 --> 2:16:31.200
 Let me ask a hard question, which is, was it worth it going into Afghanistan?

2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:41.480
 When you're one person, you have experienced a specific set of extremely difficult things.

2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:44.000
 You've met a lot of humans.

2:16:44.000 --> 2:16:48.120
 You understand certain aspects of the way this war is carried out, but if you zoomed

2:16:48.120 --> 2:16:52.440
 out at the big story, you like history too.

2:16:52.440 --> 2:16:59.360
 When you think of the history, 100 years from now, we look at the invasion of Afghanistan.

2:16:59.360 --> 2:17:06.320
 I don't even think you need to go far that back to know that we went in on false pretenses.

2:17:06.320 --> 2:17:07.320
 We did.

2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:10.440
 That's not a good start.

2:17:10.440 --> 2:17:11.640
 What's that saying?

2:17:11.640 --> 2:17:19.440
 Future behavior is a good indicator of future behavior.

2:17:19.440 --> 2:17:27.840
 I struggle with that because when I first found out that the pullout was going to happen,

2:17:27.840 --> 2:17:33.880
 I got really angry because my government skated the whole situation because he's having a

2:17:33.880 --> 2:17:34.880
 snap.

2:17:34.880 --> 2:17:35.880
 Canada's having a snap election.

2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:38.840
 It's happening on the 20th.

2:17:38.840 --> 2:17:47.600
 That was beautifully planned by my government to hold no accountability, zero accountability.

2:17:47.600 --> 2:17:49.120
 The media won't talk about it.

2:17:49.120 --> 2:17:51.840
 They reached out to me to do an interview about Afghanistan and then I told them what

2:17:51.840 --> 2:17:55.480
 was going on after I talked to my people that were on the ground and then they canceled

2:17:55.480 --> 2:17:56.480
 the interview.

2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:00.960
 When you say my government, is America any better at this?

2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:02.600
 It feels like there's no accountability.

2:18:02.600 --> 2:18:03.600
 No.

2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:09.560
 The American government is a dumpster fire.

2:18:09.560 --> 2:18:18.080
 I'm not saying that, but what I am saying is at least they sent people to pull people

2:18:18.080 --> 2:18:20.320
 or pull some people.

2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:24.480
 We sent no one to pull anyone.

2:18:24.480 --> 2:18:28.440
 I know for a fact, because I helped move a family, I was fortunate enough to be given

2:18:28.440 --> 2:18:33.640
 an opportunity to help move a high value nine person family out of that country that worked

2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:38.960
 in the government, that worked in prosecuting the Taliban, that were on the top of the list.

2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:43.000
 I learned really quickly the ins and outs of things and I'm really disgusted by it.

2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:48.720
 I learned that Canada had the one email address that all Canadian, Afghani, or visa holders

2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:54.040
 were supposed to email, Ottawa put two people on that email address.

2:18:54.040 --> 2:18:56.120
 That's confirmed.

2:18:56.120 --> 2:18:59.880
 Canada put no more than 70 people on the ground for that pullout and they were not allowed

2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:02.400
 to leave the airport and they left well before the pullout date.

2:19:02.400 --> 2:19:07.360
 They left on the Thursday before the Tuesday that was the 31st.

2:19:07.360 --> 2:19:11.360
 There were high value Canadian visa holders that are still in that country that are on

2:19:11.360 --> 2:19:12.880
 the top of the kill list.

2:19:12.880 --> 2:19:17.080
 Canada's not doing anything about it.

2:19:17.080 --> 2:19:21.800
 I'm disgusted in the way my government is acted because number one, there's an active

2:19:21.800 --> 2:19:27.560
 lawsuit with veterans against the Supreme Court of Canada right now.

2:19:27.560 --> 2:19:33.440
 We are leaving our vets and our Canadians stranded over there and we are leaving the

2:19:33.440 --> 2:19:38.040
 vets that have been maimed by this war in Canada.

2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:39.040
 They're turned down for everything.

2:19:39.040 --> 2:19:40.360
 I've been turned down for hearing loss.

2:19:40.360 --> 2:19:42.840
 They're saying it's not military related.

2:19:42.840 --> 2:19:45.240
 They have PIs follow me.

2:19:45.240 --> 2:19:47.520
 This is normal behavior.

2:19:47.520 --> 2:19:52.920
 There's a veteran named Brock who was told by Trudeau in a meeting that after he lost

2:19:52.920 --> 2:19:57.160
 his leg, he was just trying to get a new prosthetic because it was just killing him.

2:19:57.160 --> 2:20:00.680
 Trudeau stood up in a meeting and said, you're just asking for too much.

2:20:00.680 --> 2:20:05.440
 Less than six months later, he gave $10.4 million to an Afghan terrorist that was in

2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:07.560
 the Canadian prison system.

2:20:07.560 --> 2:20:12.000
 He won and got $10.4 of our million taxpayer dollars.

2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:17.000
 I don't know that American government is any better, but what I do know is that the absolute

2:20:17.000 --> 2:20:21.640
 fucking machines of human beings that stepped outside of the chain of command to pull my

2:20:21.640 --> 2:20:25.280
 family out for me, I know they were there.

2:20:25.280 --> 2:20:30.640
 The British that stayed on the ground that I contacted to literally confirm my biometric

2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:33.760
 data and passports to get that family moved, they weren't there.

2:20:33.760 --> 2:20:35.760
 That family would still be there.

2:20:35.760 --> 2:20:38.560
 That three year old that got the shit kicked out of him by the Taliban that I was trying

2:20:38.560 --> 2:20:44.160
 to ex fill, Canada left him.

2:20:44.160 --> 2:20:52.160
 What is it about politicians and governments not willing to do their job?

2:20:52.160 --> 2:21:03.320
 Well, not willing to do that big part of the job, which is you send people to war.

2:21:03.320 --> 2:21:12.920
 These are heroes, and then you should spend most of the time repaying the debts to those.

2:21:12.920 --> 2:21:15.760
 What is it about, why can't we?

2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:20.160
 Because we're disposable numbers, and we hire them out of high school when they're stupid

2:21:20.160 --> 2:21:25.320
 enough to not understand what they're going to get themselves into, and then we blame

2:21:25.320 --> 2:21:28.240
 it on themselves for making that decision by volunteering.

2:21:28.240 --> 2:21:32.080
 Yeah, but I mean, that doesn't, this still doesn't make sense to me.

2:21:32.080 --> 2:21:33.080
 Oh, it's a cop out.

2:21:33.080 --> 2:21:39.560
 I mean, Trudeau, I feel like he is a good human being that wants to do good for, I mean,

2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:45.800
 I tend to, I want to believe that leaders want to do good by the heroes of this world,

2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:53.520
 and it doesn't, like, I don't understand the system of delusion you have to live in to

2:21:53.520 --> 2:21:55.360
 not understand who the heroes are.

2:21:55.360 --> 2:21:58.080
 Like I refuse to believe Trudeau is somehow a bad person.

2:21:58.080 --> 2:21:59.480
 You haven't met him, though, have you?

2:21:59.480 --> 2:22:05.320
 I don't, actually, I'm speaking about Trudeau without knowing, but I mean, in general, think

2:22:05.320 --> 2:22:06.600
 that way about leaders.

2:22:06.600 --> 2:22:12.400
 I just think they surround themselves by people who delude them, who like, they're yes people.

2:22:12.400 --> 2:22:18.800
 Yes people that lead them into a kind of reality that becomes detached from actual reality.

2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:21.880
 And so they misunderstand the priorities of this world.

2:22:21.880 --> 2:22:28.840
 They think maybe some kind of special interests, they focus on that versus like the humans.

2:22:28.840 --> 2:22:34.240
 If you look back, was there a way we could have done something better in Afghanistan,

2:22:34.240 --> 2:22:43.320
 assuming we'd do the invasion, so is it ultimately about taking care of the veterans, like investing

2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:53.560
 more money in the education of women and liberating people who are suffering injustice in those

2:22:53.560 --> 2:22:54.560
 parts of the world?

2:22:54.560 --> 2:22:56.080
 Like, what's the better way to do it?

2:22:56.080 --> 2:23:02.960
 And one other aspect is on the US side, paid over $6 trillion for the wars in the Middle

2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:06.240
 East since 9 11, so the financial side as well.

2:23:06.240 --> 2:23:11.880
 Is there something you can comment on things we could have done better?

2:23:11.880 --> 2:23:16.600
 That's a loaded question because you're talking to someone who had no hand in what happened

2:23:16.600 --> 2:23:18.480
 other than do this and do that.

2:23:18.480 --> 2:23:22.680
 So I can go from my perspective, which is there was probably plenty of things that we

2:23:22.680 --> 2:23:24.880
 could have been doing better.

2:23:24.880 --> 2:23:27.600
 I think there was a lack of leadership from the get go.

2:23:27.600 --> 2:23:34.560
 I think the preparation that the Canadian military gave me was nowhere sufficient for

2:23:34.560 --> 2:23:37.120
 a deployment of that level.

2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:38.880
 Mind you, things happened.

2:23:38.880 --> 2:23:45.200
 They didn't realize things would happen, but yet they happen with little to absolutely

2:23:45.200 --> 2:23:50.440
 no cultural idea was that I was walking into.

2:23:50.440 --> 2:23:54.760
 Like when the man, one male and the family grabbed the back of my vest because my hair

2:23:54.760 --> 2:23:57.160
 was tucked in and he thought I was a man going into a room with a bunch of women.

2:23:57.160 --> 2:24:00.280
 I couldn't understand why he was attacking me.

2:24:00.280 --> 2:24:04.480
 There was no real breakdown of this is what you're going into.

2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:05.480
 This is the culture.

2:24:05.480 --> 2:24:06.800
 This is why they do what they do.

2:24:06.800 --> 2:24:09.080
 This is how they do it.

2:24:09.080 --> 2:24:11.240
 This is how you should handle a situation like that.

2:24:11.240 --> 2:24:15.480
 There was none of that and something I speak about frequently and I think it's important

2:24:15.480 --> 2:24:20.080
 to acknowledge is when you're doing any of that training, we are giving none of our soldiers

2:24:20.080 --> 2:24:26.480
 proper mental health training tools in that fucking toolbox or ways or things to look

2:24:26.480 --> 2:24:33.280
 for on their buddy because we've created a system and a problem where if you say that

2:24:33.280 --> 2:24:36.960
 you're ill or that you're struggling with PTSD, you're done.

2:24:36.960 --> 2:24:38.160
 No one's going to say that.

2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:39.960
 They're going to keep struggling with it.

2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:43.920
 That's when you get loose cannons, when you get problems happen, so you get fractures

2:24:43.920 --> 2:24:51.080
 start to happen in leadership and that's being seen and has been seen now for a while.

2:24:51.080 --> 2:24:59.960
 In terms of what we could have done, say for a better way to go into the country, a better

2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:07.600
 way to help the country, I can't speak to that as much as I wish I could because I don't

2:25:07.600 --> 2:25:10.200
 know that I would have all the answers.

2:25:10.200 --> 2:25:11.200
 What about withdrawal?

2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:14.200
 Oh my God.

2:25:14.200 --> 2:25:15.760
 That's a cold.

2:25:15.760 --> 2:25:24.280
 Do you think more gradual, you think it's better to maintain presence there for indefinitely?

2:25:24.280 --> 2:25:31.080
 I don't know about that, but I do know we have bases, I say weeks, I serve with them.

2:25:31.080 --> 2:25:36.400
 Americans have bases in Japan, Americans have bases in Korea, Americans have bases in Germany.

2:25:36.400 --> 2:25:38.480
 There's reasons there's bases everywhere.

2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:42.440
 There's a smart, there's an intellectual way to look at this.

2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:47.520
 You want to be able to have eyes and ears, can't have eyes and ears when you do things

2:25:47.520 --> 2:25:49.200
 like you just did.

2:25:49.200 --> 2:25:53.560
 The way that we pulled out of that country, sorry, the way that I hate saying American

2:25:53.560 --> 2:25:55.000
 British because it puts like a blame on them.

2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:58.960
 I say we because I'm a soldier, I'm a NATO soldier.

2:25:58.960 --> 2:26:03.920
 The way we pulled out of that country, my five year old could have done it better.

2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:07.720
 He could have said, mommy, why are we not keeping that bottom base?

2:26:07.720 --> 2:26:12.600
 Mommy, why are we not keeping that base just until we get everyone else that we need?

2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:16.320
 Why are we going to a civilian airport that we don't control, that we don't understand?

2:26:16.320 --> 2:26:20.760
 Mommy, why are we doing this when there's only one road to it?

2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:24.680
 My five year old would have that conversation with me.

2:26:24.680 --> 2:26:30.920
 It was so poorly done, it was so poorly executed and no fault of the soldiers on the ground

2:26:30.920 --> 2:26:31.920
 on their own.

2:26:31.920 --> 2:26:36.880
 My God, I can tell you there's operators, I just call them A, I don't say who he is

2:26:36.880 --> 2:26:38.480
 because he's told me not to.

2:26:38.480 --> 2:26:42.760
 There's a guy named A and there's another guy named R and there's a few other named

2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:52.280
 D and these guys gave everything to try to pull my family when no one else would pull

2:26:52.280 --> 2:26:54.600
 my family for me.

2:26:54.600 --> 2:26:56.760
 They just got me on the phone and said, I don't know who the fuck you're talking to.

2:26:56.760 --> 2:26:59.440
 I don't know how many people you're trying to get a hold of here, but you've got everyone

2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:00.440
 looking for your family.

2:27:00.440 --> 2:27:02.640
 Sixth, I've gone to everyone I know.

2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:06.120
 I've done stuff on Instagram, I've got a contact, the contact called me.

2:27:06.120 --> 2:27:07.640
 I called them.

2:27:07.640 --> 2:27:12.840
 I was handling this family and when they call you and say, we can't go back to the gate,

2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:17.720
 my three year old just got beat up by the Taliban and they say, what do we do now?

2:27:17.720 --> 2:27:20.520
 I'm in Vancouver.

2:27:20.520 --> 2:27:23.320
 Why am I being left to deal with this?

2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:27.760
 Why is the civilian and ex military population being left to deal with this?

2:27:27.760 --> 2:27:29.600
 Why was this not thought out?

2:27:29.600 --> 2:27:31.920
 We knew this was coming.

2:27:31.920 --> 2:27:33.400
 We knew the timeframe.

2:27:33.400 --> 2:27:41.920
 Yeah, I ultimately blame, it almost starts at the top, sorry, this is the civilian leadership.

2:27:41.920 --> 2:27:46.440
 I think probably the generals know the right thing to do here.

2:27:46.440 --> 2:27:51.400
 Even if there are sometimes overzealous in terms of being wanting to increase, I think

2:27:51.400 --> 2:27:55.360
 the great generals understand what's needed and then it takes great leadership on the

2:27:55.360 --> 2:28:00.640
 civilian side to listen to the generals and understand that war is not just about like

2:28:00.640 --> 2:28:01.640
...

2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:02.640
 It's not binary.

2:28:02.640 --> 2:28:07.600
 Yeah, and it's not about the invasion and saying mission accomplished.

2:28:07.600 --> 2:28:13.040
 It's not about the PR, it's about the full complexity of geopolitics.

2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:14.040
 Can I ask you this?

2:28:14.040 --> 2:28:16.320
 Can you ask me whatever you want?

2:28:16.320 --> 2:28:18.640
 I'm looking at a book that you gave me, Do the Fucking Work.

2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:19.640
 It's very motivating.

2:28:19.640 --> 2:28:20.640
 Good fucking design advice.

2:28:20.640 --> 2:28:24.000
 That's their company called Good Fucking Design Advice.

2:28:24.000 --> 2:28:25.400
 That's great.

2:28:25.400 --> 2:28:26.400
 I know, they're great.

2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:27.400
 What's the website because...

2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:28.400
 Good GFDA.

2:28:28.400 --> 2:28:32.360
 Okay, so the F is for friendship.

2:28:32.360 --> 2:28:33.360
 Something like that.

2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:35.400
 They are a design company.

2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:38.400
 They've worked with Apple and Nike and this is their book, it's been published by Harper

2:28:38.400 --> 2:28:44.880
 Collins and it is really just... It's an incredible... They're an incredible company.

2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:49.600
 They're artistically... They're a design company, so you can see that.

2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:50.720
 You can see it's a design company.

2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:53.080
 Oh yeah, they signed it for you.

2:28:53.080 --> 2:28:58.800
 The pages are beautiful, but they have a saying and then a paragraph about each saying.

2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:04.280
 Good fucking started, obstacles are fucking opportunities, fail, fail, and fucking fail

2:29:04.280 --> 2:29:05.280
 again.

2:29:05.280 --> 2:29:11.840
 Ask for fucking help, show some fucking passion, finish the fucking job.

2:29:11.840 --> 2:29:12.840
 That's right.

2:29:12.840 --> 2:29:13.840
 We should send that to Biden.

2:29:13.840 --> 2:29:15.840
 She said it.

2:29:15.840 --> 2:29:16.840
 I didn't say it.

2:29:16.840 --> 2:29:17.840
 Lex said it.

2:29:17.840 --> 2:29:18.840
 I didn't say it.

2:29:18.840 --> 2:29:19.840
 Lex said it.

2:29:19.840 --> 2:29:20.840
 It's fine.

2:29:20.840 --> 2:29:21.840
 I'll say it.

2:29:21.840 --> 2:29:22.840
 I should also send it to Trudeau as well.

2:29:22.840 --> 2:29:24.000
 He probably wouldn't know how to read it.

2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:26.200
 He just taught drama instead.

2:29:26.200 --> 2:29:29.360
 I'll send it to the previous four presidents.

2:29:29.360 --> 2:29:30.360
 How about that?

2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:31.360
 That's fine.

2:29:31.360 --> 2:29:33.720
 We can also send it to them too because they're all just as much at fault.

2:29:33.720 --> 2:29:38.760
 They most of them have all the same last names, but okay.

2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:42.080
 Let me tell you about them quickly because we did a mug with them and I was really excited

2:29:42.080 --> 2:29:43.080
 about it.

2:29:43.080 --> 2:29:44.080
 Not because it was a mug.

2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:48.440
 I'm a mug person, but I'm obsessive about my mugs.

2:29:48.440 --> 2:29:50.280
 What's your favorite mug?

2:29:50.280 --> 2:29:54.560
 Currently it's mine right now, the one that I have with them, the GMDM mug.

2:29:54.560 --> 2:29:55.560
 What does it say Anna?

2:29:55.560 --> 2:29:56.560
 Can I?

2:29:56.560 --> 2:29:57.560
 Do you want me to read what it says?

2:29:57.560 --> 2:29:58.560
 Yeah, please.

2:29:58.560 --> 2:29:59.560
 Okay.

2:29:59.560 --> 2:30:04.640
 Because I'm really happy about it because we created this with them with GFDA.

2:30:04.640 --> 2:30:10.000
 I found out about them because my husband's office, Atlas Neckbrace, he had his very first

2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:11.000
 office.

2:30:11.000 --> 2:30:16.080
 He had one of their prints done and it was their original, like do the fucking work.

2:30:16.080 --> 2:30:21.320
 I was really excited about them once I found out because I'm like, well, fuck is my middle

2:30:21.320 --> 2:30:28.560
 name and I want to make sure that I am going to whoever I work with, I want to make sure

2:30:28.560 --> 2:30:34.600
 that I'm working with people that I believe in, that I believe what they stand for and

2:30:34.600 --> 2:30:36.360
 I just think they're brilliant.

2:30:36.360 --> 2:30:42.040
 So I got on the phone with them and I said, hi, I would like you to sponsor my podcast.

2:30:42.040 --> 2:30:44.360
 And they said, cool, what's your podcast?

2:30:44.360 --> 2:30:49.560
 And I was like, it's called Brass and Unity podcast and I want to work with you guys somewhere.

2:30:49.560 --> 2:30:52.320
 And they're like, okay, so like, what are you thinking?

2:30:52.320 --> 2:30:56.960
 And I said, you know, I'm looking to do, I would love one day to do something with you.

2:30:56.960 --> 2:31:00.440
 I don't know what it would be, but I would like it to be something.

2:31:00.440 --> 2:31:03.760
 And they said, you know, we do like, we have this book, but we also have like shirts and

2:31:03.760 --> 2:31:06.320
 mugs with our sayings on them and prints.

2:31:06.320 --> 2:31:11.160
 And so I was thinking to myself, I was like, well, if I just did like a mug with them,

2:31:11.160 --> 2:31:15.280
 well then I could, you know, that could work for what my company does, which is it's a

2:31:15.280 --> 2:31:19.720
 jewelry company and sunglass company, but it could be like an add on kind of deal.

2:31:19.720 --> 2:31:22.160
 It's guessing really good designers that can tell.

2:31:22.160 --> 2:31:23.920
 Yeah, I knew you would like this.

2:31:23.920 --> 2:31:24.920
 Why I brought it.

2:31:24.920 --> 2:31:27.160
 So I'm like, certain people would appreciate this.

2:31:27.160 --> 2:31:33.920
 And so my whole thing, my, my like hashtag is work hard, help harder.

2:31:33.920 --> 2:31:35.800
 And that's the whole concept of what I do now.

2:31:35.800 --> 2:31:38.880
 And so we did a mug and it's called fucking help somebody.

2:31:38.880 --> 2:31:40.360
 That's their like first tag.

2:31:40.360 --> 2:31:47.440
 And then the rest is kindness is a wealth that increases as it is given away.

2:31:47.440 --> 2:31:51.160
 What you get in return isn't passed between hands, but felt between hearts.

2:31:51.160 --> 2:31:55.480
 It's precisely because you've been at the bottom that you can raise others up.

2:31:55.480 --> 2:31:58.960
 It's because you've, sorry, I'm reading a photo here.

2:31:58.960 --> 2:32:00.240
 You've been lost in the dark.

2:32:00.240 --> 2:32:02.480
 You can lead others to the light.

2:32:02.480 --> 2:32:07.880
 It's because you've fought with yourself that you can bring peace to someone else.

2:32:07.880 --> 2:32:13.040
 You now have the strength because you've once struggled the best you have to come, the best

2:32:13.040 --> 2:32:16.920
 you have to come from the fucking worst you've had to take.

2:32:16.920 --> 2:32:20.040
 So it's, this is the mug there and we're sold out of them.

2:32:20.040 --> 2:32:21.040
 We just got a bunch.

2:32:21.040 --> 2:32:22.040
 What does it say?

2:32:22.040 --> 2:32:23.040
 Fucking help.

2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:24.040
 Fucking help somebody.

2:32:24.040 --> 2:32:25.040
 Fucking help somebody.

2:32:25.040 --> 2:32:29.920
 And so we did, they were so gracious enough to sit with me and be like, what do you want

2:32:29.920 --> 2:32:30.920
 the copy to be like?

2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:33.160
 And I said, what do you think I want it to be?

2:32:33.160 --> 2:32:35.840
 Like, what would you, if you could write one for me, what it'd be and they're like, it's

2:32:35.840 --> 2:32:39.040
 going to be around lifting people up and I was like, okay, cool.

2:32:39.040 --> 2:32:40.400
 And they're like, do you want to fuck in the title?

2:32:40.400 --> 2:32:43.440
 And I was like, every other word, if we can have it.

2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:44.440
 And they said, we'll just do once.

2:32:44.440 --> 2:32:46.560
 And I was like, okay, I compromise.

2:32:46.560 --> 2:32:49.920
 And so we came up with that copy and we put it on a mug and we're going to be doing a

2:32:49.920 --> 2:32:50.920
 shirt with them.

2:32:50.920 --> 2:32:58.600
 But the whole thing to me was that that embodied what I stand for now and the healing I've

2:32:58.600 --> 2:33:04.800
 gotten to now and the point I've gotten to now in my life because that fucking sand pit

2:33:04.800 --> 2:33:11.040
 almost broke me like off the face of the earth broke me.

2:33:11.040 --> 2:33:17.400
 First of all, can we go through the full journey of that in terms of your psychological development?

2:33:17.400 --> 2:33:19.800
 Who were you before?

2:33:19.800 --> 2:33:20.960
 Who were you after?

2:33:20.960 --> 2:33:22.560
 Can you think about that?

2:33:22.560 --> 2:33:28.720
 Like what was your, if you had put a brain on the table before and after and tried to

2:33:28.720 --> 2:33:29.720
 analyze it.

2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:31.120
 Well, they both have CTE.

2:33:31.120 --> 2:33:38.680
 So we know that they're both bruised and gray matters, a little dicey on them.

2:33:38.680 --> 2:33:40.840
 And it may sound the same and it's not.

2:33:40.840 --> 2:33:42.720
 So I'll try to explain it to you.

2:33:42.720 --> 2:33:47.280
 Before that, don't you laugh because I know it's coming.

2:33:47.280 --> 2:33:52.520
 I was even louder, even more obnoxious, even more outgoing.

2:33:52.520 --> 2:33:54.120
 I know it's hard to believe.

2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:57.560
 This is you humble and quiet right now.

2:33:57.560 --> 2:33:59.920
 This is you like.

2:33:59.920 --> 2:34:01.200
 This is normal me now.

2:34:01.200 --> 2:34:02.200
 This is who I am now.

2:34:02.200 --> 2:34:03.200
 And I love that.

2:34:03.200 --> 2:34:12.480
 But who I was before was, you know, motocross, taekwondo, tomboy.

2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:14.880
 I didn't know how to dress.

2:34:14.880 --> 2:34:18.000
 I thought that if you just wore like the same jeans and T shirt all the time, that was like

2:34:18.000 --> 2:34:20.360
 acceptable behavior as a woman.

2:34:20.360 --> 2:34:21.960
 I wore skate shoes.

2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:25.600
 I went to a Catholic school that I refused to wear skirt at.

2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:26.600
 I wore pants.

2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:27.840
 I played hacky sack.

2:34:27.840 --> 2:34:32.560
 I was so into sports, I cut and split wood with my dad on weekends.

2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:34.400
 We heated our house that way.

2:34:34.400 --> 2:34:37.200
 I would go in the transport.

2:34:37.200 --> 2:34:42.040
 I stayed out of trouble for the most part.

2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:43.240
 I think I was a fairly good kid.

2:34:43.240 --> 2:34:46.720
 I was pretty angry though for most of my teenage life after my coach.

2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:49.680
 I lost my way a little bit there.

2:34:49.680 --> 2:34:52.640
 I was just crazier.

2:34:52.640 --> 2:34:53.640
 But happy.

2:34:53.640 --> 2:34:55.520
 I don't know if I was happy.

2:34:55.520 --> 2:34:56.920
 I'm realizing that now.

2:34:56.920 --> 2:35:01.560
 I think I was, I think anger overtook who I was, and I think that's why I was such

2:35:01.560 --> 2:35:04.560
 an angry individual towards my parents when I was in high school.

2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:08.840
 So parents was a little rough relationship with parents?

2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:09.840
 I mean, yeah.

2:35:09.840 --> 2:35:12.600
 I mean, my dad was gone a couple of weeks at a time.

2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:16.080
 So my mom stayed home, mom had to handle me and my brother.

2:35:16.080 --> 2:35:19.600
 We're both competitive athletes at the time by herself.

2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:23.280
 And when you come home and you have a daughter that just calls you like a bitch to your face

2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:29.160
 because she can't, she's being bullied so bad that she can't understand why, but also

2:35:29.160 --> 2:35:35.000
 doesn't know how to fix it, but has no other outlet anymore to kind of get rid of it.

2:35:35.000 --> 2:35:36.000
 I was not nice.

2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:37.280
 I was a really mean person.

2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:38.280
 I broke my mom.

2:35:38.280 --> 2:35:40.280
 I remember the day she stopped yelling.

2:35:40.280 --> 2:35:41.280
 That's the day I know I broke her.

2:35:41.280 --> 2:35:42.280
 I broke her.

2:35:42.280 --> 2:35:44.880
 Did you have a source of discipline in your life?

2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:51.640
 Like maybe like we are dad, somebody who says you're being a bitch, like who would call

2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:52.640
 me like that?

2:35:52.640 --> 2:35:53.640
 Oh, no, no, no, no.

2:35:53.640 --> 2:35:54.640
 My parents were incredible.

2:35:54.640 --> 2:35:58.520
 And my dad came from like a family of like a bajillion kids who lived in a farm with

2:35:58.520 --> 2:36:03.640
 no running water with like super, my dad was brash and abrupt.

2:36:03.640 --> 2:36:05.520
 So like I've caught myself doing that once in a while.

2:36:05.520 --> 2:36:11.480
 So like if I did one thing wrong, if he was just in a mood, I would know it.

2:36:11.480 --> 2:36:13.520
 So we, you weren't, okay.

2:36:13.520 --> 2:36:15.760
 So that, that anger just took different forms.

2:36:15.760 --> 2:36:19.800
 It took different forms, but it mostly would be directed at my mom because I know she would

2:36:19.800 --> 2:36:24.400
 take it and that was who I had and I feel bad about it to the day.

2:36:24.400 --> 2:36:28.840
 Like I still, she listened to the Jocko podcast and so did my dad and my mom promised me she

2:36:28.840 --> 2:36:30.680
 would never read my book because there's certain parts.

2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:35.320
 I just, my dad on my deployment when I called him and told him some of the stuff, he started

2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:36.320
 crying.

2:36:36.320 --> 2:36:37.320
 My dad doesn't cry.

2:36:37.320 --> 2:36:40.520
 And he just said, please never tell your mother this.

2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:41.640
 Don't do that to your mom.

2:36:41.640 --> 2:36:44.520
 My mom, like my grandfather came from Hungary.

2:36:44.520 --> 2:36:49.400
 He escaped when the Nazis left, when the Soviets came in.

2:36:49.400 --> 2:36:53.280
 He wasn't great as a dad.

2:36:53.280 --> 2:36:59.840
 My mom went through a lot as a kid and that was because her dad was in the war.

2:36:59.840 --> 2:37:06.480
 That was because her dad didn't know any better and she knew she couldn't be like that.

2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:10.280
 So her way would be yelling.

2:37:10.280 --> 2:37:14.520
 And then I hit about 16 and I wore her down and I broke her.

2:37:14.520 --> 2:37:20.120
 I shattered her ability to think that she could have any sort of relationship with me.

2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:22.520
 You wouldn't want to have had a relationship with me.

2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:26.520
 But the funny thing is you've rediscovered that now.

2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:29.120
 So is she, are you guys close now?

2:37:29.120 --> 2:37:30.120
 Yeah.

2:37:30.120 --> 2:37:31.800
 She's, she's so funny.

2:37:31.800 --> 2:37:33.360
 She's coming out to help out again.

2:37:33.360 --> 2:37:39.160
 She comes out to help out with Jack all the time and my dad, they're still, they're still

2:37:39.160 --> 2:37:40.160
 truck drivers.

2:37:40.160 --> 2:37:41.160
 They're still on the road.

2:37:41.160 --> 2:37:42.160
 They team drive.

2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:46.000
 They take their dogs and they go and they do their thing and I've had that relationship

2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:47.000
 now.

2:37:47.000 --> 2:37:48.600
 It's, it's still strenuous.

2:37:48.600 --> 2:37:52.600
 Like I still, when I'm having a hard time, she'll be the person I'll take it out on because

2:37:52.600 --> 2:37:54.000
 I know she can take it.

2:37:54.000 --> 2:38:00.560
 Even though I know I shouldn't, it's like she's my safe space to be like, blah, about everything.

2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:01.920
 And she'll just be like, well, that's not nice.

2:38:01.920 --> 2:38:05.480
 I'm like, well, you're not fucking like, I, and I'll take it out on, she knows I don't

2:38:05.480 --> 2:38:11.880
 mean it and I try, but for whatever reason, she just, she takes it.

2:38:11.880 --> 2:38:13.520
 And it brings it out of you.

2:38:13.520 --> 2:38:14.520
 Yeah.

2:38:14.520 --> 2:38:20.840
 Can you describe sort of the various characteristics, the, the shape of your PTSD, the, the trauma,

2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:27.640
 how the anger and hate took shape in you in the, in the seconds, minutes, hours, months,

2:38:27.640 --> 2:38:33.520
 years after, and after the full trauma of all the things you've experienced, you know,

2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:34.520
 goodness that.

2:38:34.520 --> 2:38:37.640
 So it's funny because Jocko asked me something and it made me, it's made me, I've really

2:38:37.640 --> 2:38:39.240
 been thinking a lot about it.

2:38:39.240 --> 2:38:45.200
 And he's like, do you think if somebody of a leadership would have just sat you down

2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:52.120
 and said, Hey, Burns, what you're feeling is okay, what you're feeling is normal, what

2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:57.320
 you're feeling is what happens when you're in something like this, do you think you would

2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:58.320
 be where you are?

2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:02.320
 And they said, well, I thought about it and I'm like, you know, I don't think I would

2:39:02.320 --> 2:39:05.680
 be because I wouldn't have been medicated out of my mind.

2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:10.240
 I wasn't able to process anything because I was just given medication right from the

2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:11.240
 get.

2:39:11.240 --> 2:39:17.040
 So for me, what happened was once that light switch was off, I was sent back to Kandahar

2:39:17.040 --> 2:39:22.440
 to, once the operation was over, we flew back to Kandahar like with the Brits.

2:39:22.440 --> 2:39:26.920
 And then because there was deaths and we lost people on that operation, I had to go to the

2:39:26.920 --> 2:39:33.120
 British side for the next, I think three or four days and recant word for word why, what

2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:37.760
 happened to a British MP who handwrote statements, but we had to do that on repeat to make sure

2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:39.040
 we all had the same story.

2:39:39.040 --> 2:39:42.440
 There's nobody shot anybody in the back.

2:39:42.440 --> 2:39:47.720
 And so that I don't think is a great way to do that after an after action, after action

2:39:47.720 --> 2:39:52.840
 reports happen, but I don't think beating a dead horse and having somebody repeat, repeat,

2:39:52.840 --> 2:39:55.440
 repeat and then just imprint more and more and more.

2:39:55.440 --> 2:39:59.240
 I don't know that that is a great way of doing that.

2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:04.600
 And especially from a perspective of what are they liability, almost like legal that

2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:08.640
 kind of that perspective as opposed to the full perspective.

2:40:08.640 --> 2:40:18.320
 I mean, so for people who don't know, one is the over medication that you had to undergo.

2:40:18.320 --> 2:40:25.040
 And then the other is the social isolation in terms of, I mean, more than what Jaco,

2:40:25.040 --> 2:40:32.520
 you just mentioned, you also kind of mentioned that just being with other soldiers you're

2:40:32.520 --> 2:40:39.640
 close with, just sitting there in silence and just sitting in that shared understanding.

2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:45.520
 Even that in itself communicates like these feelings are normal.

2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:51.240
 Like you don't have to talk and you were robbed of that as well, essentially.

2:40:51.240 --> 2:40:52.240
 Yeah.

2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:56.080
 Because I was, because I was borrowed, I think Jaco had a name for us when we get borrowed.

2:40:56.080 --> 2:40:59.280
 It was like, there was like a, I don't know what they call us, but it's like when you

2:40:59.280 --> 2:41:01.640
 take a person and you put them in another unit, there's a name for it.

2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:03.160
 I don't remember what it was.

2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:05.360
 You never see those people again.

2:41:05.360 --> 2:41:10.040
 But because I was in Kandahar, the doctors gave me the medication because I, I think

2:41:10.040 --> 2:41:12.120
 I was the one who said, I don't, this isn't right.

2:41:12.120 --> 2:41:13.120
 I don't feel right.

2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:14.120
 This is wrong.

2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:17.320
 Cause when I got back that night, there was supposed to be somebody there to pick me up

2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:20.280
 to take me the other side of the base and no one showed.

2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:26.640
 So I, I humped on my kit back to the Canada house and I remember getting in the shower

2:41:26.640 --> 2:41:30.600
 and the rule was quick fucking showers.

2:41:30.600 --> 2:41:32.640
 No water.

2:41:32.640 --> 2:41:37.960
 I must have sat on that floor of that shower for half an hour, 45 minutes.

2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:40.240
 I just held myself and cried.

2:41:40.240 --> 2:41:41.440
 I didn't even know I was crying.

2:41:41.440 --> 2:41:48.440
 I just knew I needed to cry and I still this day, I, I, and when they sent me back to Canada,

2:41:48.440 --> 2:41:54.120
 when they sent me back to the fall, they sent me back with all this medication after spending

2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:57.920
 that time with the Brits.

2:41:57.920 --> 2:42:01.360
 And they put me back on the guns, medicated out of my fucking tree.

2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:07.080
 I almost shot someone, but they didn't tell my staff that was on meds.

2:42:07.080 --> 2:42:11.320
 So when the artillery gun was going off and I didn't run to the gun and I was still asleep

2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:16.920
 inside the tent with the gun beside my head, they didn't know I was just drugged.

2:42:16.920 --> 2:42:20.160
 They just thought I was fucking off somewhere hanging out with some Americans.

2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:24.080
 They just thought I wasn't doing any of what I should be doing.

2:42:24.080 --> 2:42:28.760
 And then I remember the moment my sergeant, we did a night shoot and he, he's so funny

2:42:28.760 --> 2:42:32.960
 because he called me and he goes, ah, I fucked Bernzac, go Alice, I remember this, yes, you

2:42:32.960 --> 2:42:37.560
 were standing there with me and I look at you and go, Hey, Burns, are you okay?

2:42:37.560 --> 2:42:40.720
 Cause your eyes are all fucked.

2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:46.760
 And I, I looked at the sergeant Leblanc and I just remember going, yeah, I'm good.

2:42:46.760 --> 2:42:51.080
 He's like, I still remember that.

2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:55.840
 And I'm like, I know because they never tell me anything fuck Burns, I did not know the

2:42:55.840 --> 2:42:56.840
 drugs you were on.

2:42:56.840 --> 2:43:02.560
 And as I was on all of them, he goes, I know I walk in, you show me the bottles, fuck Burns,

2:43:02.560 --> 2:43:05.320
 you should not been there.

2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:07.320
 I guarantee he sounds just like that.

2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:09.760
 He's brilliant.

2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:10.760
 He's brilliant.

2:43:10.760 --> 2:43:11.760
 Yeah.

2:43:11.760 --> 2:43:20.680
 I mean, I suppose this is a lazy way of dealing with trauma and it's for the military in some

2:43:20.680 --> 2:43:21.680
 sense.

2:43:21.680 --> 2:43:25.560
 If you don't have a good program in place, this makes sense, but you should have a good

2:43:25.560 --> 2:43:26.560
 program in place.

2:43:26.560 --> 2:43:32.520
 Just as you said, on the prep, on the mental prep side, like, just any prep, like training

2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:38.640
 people, training people on the, I suppose to, I guess train the fact that you're going

2:43:38.640 --> 2:43:45.000
 to have somebody close to you blow up, like you have to probably visualize that.

2:43:45.000 --> 2:43:46.000
 You have to think through that.

2:43:46.000 --> 2:43:50.560
 You have to have a process of how to deal with something like that with that kind of

2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:51.560
 trauma.

2:43:51.560 --> 2:43:52.560
 And then that's it.

2:43:52.560 --> 2:43:54.520
 So it's in the toolbox of what the doctors call it.

2:43:54.520 --> 2:43:55.520
 Exactly.

2:43:55.520 --> 2:43:58.080
 I mean, and it's not like weakness, it's actually strength.

2:43:58.080 --> 2:44:04.000
 It's like, you have to be mentally strong enough to process that.

2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:09.440
 That probably takes a lot of training, but it's a great training, right?

2:44:09.440 --> 2:44:12.920
 Well worth it to, to protect your investment training.

2:44:12.920 --> 2:44:13.920
 Right.

2:44:13.920 --> 2:44:16.640
 That's a very cold, but correct way to put it.

2:44:16.640 --> 2:44:17.640
 I mean, it's cold.

2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:22.200
 I thought you would appreciate the coldness of the way I articulated that.

2:44:22.200 --> 2:44:23.200
 Well, yeah.

2:44:23.200 --> 2:44:25.520
 I mean, I'm off two minds on this.

2:44:25.520 --> 2:44:32.440
 I don't sometimes wonder like what I would be like as a soldier, actually.

2:44:32.440 --> 2:44:36.920
 I don't know, because I love country and I love all the things you're mentioning.

2:44:36.920 --> 2:44:42.040
 Like I could see myself probably dying for my country and also enjoying the skill of

2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:43.040
 it.

2:44:43.040 --> 2:44:48.080
 The, the, the, the very like OCD, like very proficient.

2:44:48.080 --> 2:44:49.080
 Yeah.

2:44:49.080 --> 2:44:53.360
 But then also the human side, I fall in love with people.

2:44:53.360 --> 2:44:54.560
 I fall in love with everything.

2:44:54.560 --> 2:44:56.160
 So I don't know.

2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:00.440
 I don't, I suppose you have to shut off the part of your brain when you're executing a

2:45:00.440 --> 2:45:07.960
 mission that cares about the, about other humans, uh, outside your close knit group.

2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:11.920
 But like there's no time for philosophical thinking.

2:45:11.920 --> 2:45:12.920
 I don't know.

2:45:12.920 --> 2:45:15.400
 I, I suppose that's why it's better to be young.

2:45:15.400 --> 2:45:17.680
 Young and dumb.

2:45:17.680 --> 2:45:19.280
 You're not necessarily dumb.

2:45:19.280 --> 2:45:26.600
 It's just like you were over that energy of excitement, of proficiency and excellence

2:45:26.600 --> 2:45:30.320
 is, is just higher than it is later in life.

2:45:30.320 --> 2:45:32.680
 You're, you're not dumb.

2:45:32.680 --> 2:45:46.520
 I was not dumb, but I was naive, uneducated, not well trained and had an arrogance because

2:45:46.520 --> 2:45:49.440
 we were told we were the fucking shit.

2:45:49.440 --> 2:45:50.440
 Yeah.

2:45:50.440 --> 2:45:51.440
 You're amazing.

2:45:51.440 --> 2:45:52.440
 Okay.

2:45:52.440 --> 2:45:53.440
 I'm amazing.

2:45:53.440 --> 2:45:57.560
 So I wonder, do they think if we do mental training, that makes you weak?

2:45:57.560 --> 2:46:00.160
 Do you think they, the military thinks that makes you weak?

2:46:00.160 --> 2:46:01.160
 Well, yes.

2:46:01.160 --> 2:46:04.760
 And the reason I can say that is because it's, it's obvious in the way that they handle

2:46:04.760 --> 2:46:05.760
 it now.

2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:09.600
 So like if a soldier says, Hey, I'm really struggling with that last op we were on, man.

2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:13.680
 It's just really, it's getting to me and I'm having a hard time sleeping.

2:46:13.680 --> 2:46:19.760
 They're going to go, okay, well, how, how hard of a time sleeping are you having?

2:46:19.760 --> 2:46:22.800
 And then you get that re and you go, Oh no, I'm not, it's not that bad.

2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:24.600
 I'm not, I don't need anything for it.

2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:26.320
 Like I'm just like once in a while I'm losing some sleep.

2:46:26.320 --> 2:46:31.080
 Okay, cause you know that pen moves, it's all getting written down and then you're

2:46:31.080 --> 2:46:34.080
 tagged red, you're tagged red, which means you're not deploying again.

2:46:34.080 --> 2:46:36.640
 And then you're not able to do the thing you love the most with the people you love the

2:46:36.640 --> 2:46:37.640
 most.

2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:38.640
 Right.

2:46:38.640 --> 2:46:44.120
 I mean, but also this is really difficult and I'd love to talk to you about PTSD, but

2:46:44.120 --> 2:46:45.120
 like,

2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:46.120
 Sorry.

2:46:46.120 --> 2:46:47.120
 Yes.

2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:48.120
 I keep going on.

2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:49.120
 No, please.

2:46:49.120 --> 2:47:01.000
 So I'm, I'm hoping to like launch a company, you know, in the engineering space and the

2:47:01.000 --> 2:47:09.080
 and I currently leave, I've led a few people and it's always this kind of like how much

2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:14.400
 are you supposed to push people because people are, everyone is weak and lazy.

2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:17.400
 Are you quoting her text messages from early?

2:47:17.400 --> 2:47:18.400
 Yeah, exactly.

2:47:18.400 --> 2:47:19.600
 I'm quoting this.

2:47:19.600 --> 2:47:21.200
 All I have is just quotes from you.

2:47:21.200 --> 2:47:22.200
 It's okay.

2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:26.520
 Tells me how much we've spoken in the past week, your soul.

2:47:26.520 --> 2:47:31.560
 I just, I don't know what to do because sometimes people are really struggling, like really

2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:36.240
 struggling in a way they're being, they're like, it's the dig, it's the Goggins thing

2:47:36.240 --> 2:47:41.920
 is like, where's the line to where you're actually breaking the human being versus

2:47:41.920 --> 2:47:47.800
 where you're breaking them at the places where they will grow back stronger.

2:47:47.800 --> 2:47:52.280
 Like in that line is tricky to truly understand.

2:47:52.280 --> 2:47:58.440
 I think the military errors on the side of like, they, you know, like push them beyond

2:47:58.440 --> 2:48:03.040
 all limits, physical limits, physical, but mental, they don't, they need to respect

2:48:03.040 --> 2:48:04.040
 the mental more.

2:48:04.040 --> 2:48:06.080
 Uh, they fuck with the brain a little bit.

2:48:06.080 --> 2:48:09.440
 I mean, in basic training, they like screaming your face and to see who's going to crack

2:48:09.440 --> 2:48:13.720
 and they, they put you on sleep deprivation to see who's weak enough that they can't handle

2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:14.720
 sleep depth.

2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:19.560
 They do stuff to you, like, I know if you're a downed pilot, you have to go and you have

2:48:19.560 --> 2:48:22.280
 to do this training and like it's, you'll get captured.

2:48:22.280 --> 2:48:27.880
 It's like this whole thing and they fuck with your brain, but there's a line.

2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:29.640
 There's a line.

2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:37.520
 My issue is go to the line, cross the line, give them the tools to come back from the

2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:38.520
 line.

2:48:38.520 --> 2:48:39.520
 Right.

2:48:39.520 --> 2:48:40.520
 Yeah.

2:48:40.520 --> 2:48:41.520
 We don't do that.

2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:42.520
 We don't.

2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:43.520
 We, we know there's PTSD.

2:48:43.520 --> 2:48:44.960
 We know there's a such a thing.

2:48:44.960 --> 2:48:46.560
 We understand there's anxiety and depression.

2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:48.160
 We understand there's major depressive disorder.

2:48:48.160 --> 2:48:51.120
 We understand that there are precursors.

2:48:51.120 --> 2:48:52.400
 There are signs and symptoms.

2:48:52.400 --> 2:48:54.360
 We understand that.

2:48:54.360 --> 2:48:59.000
 So why are we not building enough of a toolkit?

2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:00.880
 Whether that be, I'm not talking medication.

2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:06.280
 I'm talking, it sounds woo woo, but fucking trust me, it works.

2:49:06.280 --> 2:49:08.280
 I'm talking meditation.

2:49:08.280 --> 2:49:09.840
 I'm talking yoga.

2:49:09.840 --> 2:49:11.960
 I'm talking about peer group support.

2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:16.800
 I'm talking about if you go to your doctor and report this, there's, you're not automatically

2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:18.960
 going to be losing your job.

2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:22.360
 Why aren't we giving the proper tools and the education needed?

2:49:22.360 --> 2:49:24.740
 These things are not difficult to teach.

2:49:24.740 --> 2:49:26.080
 They don't take a lot of time.

2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:27.560
 They don't take a lot of money.

2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:30.440
 The only time it takes a lot of money is when you want to medicate.

2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:32.520
 We don't need to medicate you yet.

2:49:32.520 --> 2:49:35.480
 You only need to be medicated if you're a danger to someone else or yourself.

2:49:35.480 --> 2:49:39.440
 And most of the time, because of the way the system is set, you'll lie about it through

2:49:39.440 --> 2:49:42.640
 your fucking teeth just so that no one touches you.

2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:47.520
 So from the perspective of the military, do you think you can still be a bad motherfucker

2:49:47.520 --> 2:49:49.920
 and do all the mental work?

2:49:49.920 --> 2:49:50.920
 Yes.

2:49:50.920 --> 2:49:55.720
 Some of the baddest dudes I've ever known are like, I got to go to yoga.

2:49:55.720 --> 2:49:57.760
 I got to go meditate.

2:49:57.760 --> 2:49:59.520
 I go do Aya with those guys.

2:49:59.520 --> 2:50:00.520
 Why?

2:50:00.520 --> 2:50:04.920
 Because they know that that's not okay to be like that in your life.

2:50:04.920 --> 2:50:10.160
 Can you answer the ridiculously big question of what is PTSD?

2:50:10.160 --> 2:50:13.840
 Do you understand the basic characteristics of it?

2:50:13.840 --> 2:50:20.480
 Is there universal characteristics from your own unique experience, from what you've understood

2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:21.480
 about it?

2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:22.480
 Yeah.

2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:23.480
 Of course there are.

2:50:23.480 --> 2:50:27.440
 So there's the basic things that a doctor looks for when they're diagnosing PTSD.

2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:28.440
 I'm not a doctor.

2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:30.080
 Let me make that fucking clear.

2:50:30.080 --> 2:50:32.320
 But there are things that you look for.

2:50:32.320 --> 2:50:34.080
 You look for insomnia.

2:50:34.080 --> 2:50:36.080
 You look for anger and aggression.

2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:38.240
 You look for people to fly off the handle.

2:50:38.240 --> 2:50:40.680
 You look for avoidance.

2:50:40.680 --> 2:50:45.160
 You can tell in somebody's body, people who can't sleep, if you can't sleep, you know

2:50:45.160 --> 2:50:49.960
 that after a certain amount of time, they're just going to deteriorate.

2:50:49.960 --> 2:50:50.960
 Sleeplessness triggers.

2:50:50.960 --> 2:50:54.560
 When you say avoidance, do you mean avoidance?

2:50:54.560 --> 2:50:59.000
 So like when I first got back to Canada, I avoided everybody that was Middle Eastern

2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:03.320
 at all costs, no matter how much of a difference it made in my day.

2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:07.080
 If I had to not go somewhere from one of the greatest events of my life, I wouldn't have

2:51:07.080 --> 2:51:08.080
 went.

2:51:08.080 --> 2:51:11.520
 But isn't there some aspect that are combined with the triggers?

2:51:11.520 --> 2:51:16.080
 Maybe it's wise to avoid triggers even for your own personal health, well being.

2:51:16.080 --> 2:51:17.080
 Well, that's it.

2:51:17.080 --> 2:51:19.080
 For me, that was one of my triggers.

2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:20.720
 So you have triggers.

2:51:20.720 --> 2:51:24.520
 And then you also deal with things like sounds and smells.

2:51:24.520 --> 2:51:25.520
 You can tell.

2:51:25.520 --> 2:51:26.680
 You can tell when someone's triggered.

2:51:26.680 --> 2:51:28.240
 A lot of vets don't like fireworks.

2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:31.640
 It's like, okay, well, remove yourself from the situation.

2:51:31.640 --> 2:51:39.600
 So there's other things within PTSD that kind of rear its head that with PTSD kind of attach

2:51:39.600 --> 2:51:40.600
 other things.

2:51:40.600 --> 2:51:43.520
 So like when I was diagnosed with PTSD, I think it was like four years later, I was

2:51:43.520 --> 2:51:46.200
 diagnosed with major depressive disorder.

2:51:46.200 --> 2:51:50.800
 And that was kind of a compilation of things that was just like a shit show there.

2:51:50.800 --> 2:51:52.120
 What is major depressive disorder?

2:51:52.120 --> 2:51:53.120
 Good question.

2:51:53.120 --> 2:51:55.960
 Is there an answer?

2:51:55.960 --> 2:51:56.960
 I don't have one.

2:51:56.960 --> 2:51:58.840
 I was told I had it.

2:51:58.840 --> 2:52:05.200
 Okay, so I mean, what does your mind go through?

2:52:05.200 --> 2:52:08.080
 Where are the places that my mind goes?

2:52:08.080 --> 2:52:12.200
 Your mind goes like the dark places when I get triggered and when it was like really

2:52:12.200 --> 2:52:13.200
 bad.

2:52:13.200 --> 2:52:14.200
 Yeah.

2:52:14.200 --> 2:52:15.200
 Okay.

2:52:15.200 --> 2:52:16.200
 Yeah.

2:52:16.200 --> 2:52:20.160
 So you thought about suicide every minute of every day.

2:52:20.160 --> 2:52:22.960
 What are the pros of suicide in your mind at that time?

2:52:22.960 --> 2:52:24.520
 What at that time?

2:52:24.520 --> 2:52:28.840
 The pros were no one has to deal with this anymore.

2:52:28.840 --> 2:52:31.120
 I don't have to feel this way anymore.

2:52:31.120 --> 2:52:33.080
 I'm a burden to my family.

2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:35.800
 I'm a burden to the military system.

2:52:35.800 --> 2:52:37.520
 I'm weak.

2:52:37.520 --> 2:52:39.120
 I'm a bad soldier.

2:52:39.120 --> 2:52:40.920
 I didn't do my job.

2:52:40.920 --> 2:52:42.280
 I don't deserve to be alive.

2:52:42.280 --> 2:52:45.160
 I don't deserve veterans affairs support.

2:52:45.160 --> 2:52:49.320
 I don't deserve my, my parents don't deserve to watch me go through this.

2:52:49.320 --> 2:52:54.160
 The guy I was dating didn't deserve to put up with the bullshit I put him through.

2:52:54.160 --> 2:52:59.680
 The people who drive with me in cars didn't deserve to almost hit medians because I swerved

2:52:59.680 --> 2:53:03.000
 because of a piece of garbage.

2:53:03.000 --> 2:53:05.200
 People didn't deserve my racist outburst.

2:53:05.200 --> 2:53:10.280
 People didn't deserve, people didn't, I did not deserve to be breathing anymore.

2:53:10.280 --> 2:53:15.080
 I should have died there and I wished I died there.

2:53:15.080 --> 2:53:17.160
 So self hate there too.

2:53:17.160 --> 2:53:23.360
 Oh, so that's not even a big deal though, right?

2:53:23.360 --> 2:53:27.480
 That's at the core of it.

2:53:27.480 --> 2:53:30.400
 So how do you escape from that place?

2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:39.400
 How do you overcome that depression essentially at the core of the desire to kill yourself?

2:53:39.400 --> 2:53:44.880
 What basic principles, I mean we could talk about ayahuasca, but basic principles of like

2:53:44.880 --> 2:53:48.280
 literally like how do you escape that moment?

2:53:48.280 --> 2:53:50.320
 Yeah, previous to any of that.

2:53:50.320 --> 2:53:52.200
 I did from 2009.

2:53:52.200 --> 2:53:58.400
 I got out, so I was medically, I was 3B Medical Honorable Discharge in 2011, May 23rd, 2011.

2:53:58.400 --> 2:54:00.080
 So I left the military then.

2:54:00.080 --> 2:54:04.480
 And so it's been 10 years, just over 10 years, oh my God, it's 10 and a half years.

2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:06.480
 I just realized I don't know, oh my God.

2:54:06.480 --> 2:54:07.480
 Happy anniversary.

2:54:07.480 --> 2:54:08.480
 Thanks, man.

2:54:08.480 --> 2:54:09.480
 Awesome.

2:54:09.480 --> 2:54:14.960
 So I've been out for 10 years and I would say the reason I didn't kill myself for the

2:54:14.960 --> 2:54:20.440
 longest time was the individual I was dating, that was straight across the board, that was

2:54:20.440 --> 2:54:21.440
 it.

2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:31.320
 And for me, there was no relief for about six years of the thought of just kill yourself,

2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:32.320
 kill yourself, kill yourself.

2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:33.320
 So it's easier if you just do it.

2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:36.760
 Like that voice was so strong for that long, there was really no relief.

2:54:36.760 --> 2:54:44.280
 What there was though, was implementation of different medications, realizing they weren't

2:54:44.280 --> 2:54:49.520
 working, trying different things, getting myself to a point where I could leave my house

2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:54.960
 comfortably ish again, and it wasn't triggered, which then allowed me to travel, which then

2:54:54.960 --> 2:54:59.880
 allowed me to slowly try to go back to school, which by the way, it was a very bad idea.

2:54:59.880 --> 2:55:02.720
 That was a bad idea, that was bad.

2:55:02.720 --> 2:55:08.160
 I went too early, they started practicing active shooter drills in our school.

2:55:08.160 --> 2:55:11.680
 It was bad, my professors understood.

2:55:11.680 --> 2:55:14.080
 Schools full of triggers, it turns out.

2:55:14.080 --> 2:55:16.960
 It is when you live in Vancouver.

2:55:16.960 --> 2:55:20.880
 Here's the theme to this conversation about your love for Canada.

2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:21.880
 Look at me.

2:55:21.880 --> 2:55:24.160
 I love my fucking country.

2:55:24.160 --> 2:55:26.720
 I am one of the most patriotic people you will meet in it.

2:55:26.720 --> 2:55:31.720
 I think Canada is one of the greatest fucking places on the earth.

2:55:31.720 --> 2:55:38.880
 I think in the past two years or three years, I have seen what I loved so deeply, so proudly

2:55:38.880 --> 2:55:56.840
 preached about so... I'm so proud of what I did there, and I'm so proud of the country

2:55:56.840 --> 2:56:04.280
 I got to represent because I was good at my job.

2:56:04.280 --> 2:56:08.840
 Being great at your job for a country you love, you just don't like some of the politicians

2:56:08.840 --> 2:56:09.840
 some of the time.

2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:14.600
 It's not even the politicians anymore, it's the state of the country.

2:56:14.600 --> 2:56:17.720
 I'm a second class citizen in my own country right now.

2:56:17.720 --> 2:56:21.160
 I can't travel to see my parents within my own country.

2:56:21.160 --> 2:56:24.680
 I'm not allowed to step foot in my son's school.

2:56:24.680 --> 2:56:29.040
 I am not allowed to go to a restaurant with my family.

2:56:29.040 --> 2:56:34.400
 I'm not allowed to leave Canada without... I told you all the stuff I have to do to get

2:56:34.400 --> 2:56:35.400
 here.

2:56:35.400 --> 2:56:38.240
 To even get home, I have to do the same.

2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:40.680
 I'm watched by the RCMP.

2:56:40.680 --> 2:56:44.880
 I'm neighbors rat you out.

2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:47.280
 So for somebody who fought for their country.

2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:48.280
 I hate it.

2:56:48.280 --> 2:56:50.040
 It makes me so sad.

2:56:50.040 --> 2:56:56.000
 To go through this process of what many consider to be power overreach by government in the

2:56:56.000 --> 2:56:59.160
 face of this particular pandemic.

2:56:59.160 --> 2:57:00.160
 Yeah.

2:57:00.160 --> 2:57:03.520
 I always knew I had a hard time with... I loved Canada.

2:57:03.520 --> 2:57:06.720
 The day I got spit on when I got home was not ideal, but...

2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:07.720
 Yeah, spit on.

2:57:07.720 --> 2:57:08.720
 Yeah.

2:57:08.720 --> 2:57:17.280
 But the thing was, I knew long enough that if I just put one foot in front of the other

2:57:17.280 --> 2:57:23.560
 and kept going to treatment and kept doing what my doctor told me to do, that I could

2:57:23.560 --> 2:57:26.960
 pull out of this if I tried.

2:57:26.960 --> 2:57:29.800
 I was told that I could do anything in my life.

2:57:29.800 --> 2:57:32.960
 It didn't matter as long as I tried.

2:57:32.960 --> 2:57:36.080
 Was trying really hard?

2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:41.680
 Trying was harder than breathing.

2:57:41.680 --> 2:57:46.680
 It was exhausting.

2:57:46.680 --> 2:57:50.920
 I would be awake for like half a day and every minute of that day, I'd just stare at the

2:57:50.920 --> 2:57:53.200
 wall and just want to kill myself.

2:57:53.200 --> 2:57:54.200
 Yeah.

2:57:54.200 --> 2:58:00.200
 That's what I've had people close to me who suffer from depression and it was like, it's

2:58:00.200 --> 2:58:06.600
 unclear how to escape, but it's clear that you need to try something and they didn't

2:58:06.600 --> 2:58:07.800
 want to even try.

2:58:07.800 --> 2:58:09.840
 Because you have no try in you.

2:58:09.840 --> 2:58:10.840
 Yeah.

2:58:10.840 --> 2:58:18.400
 I'm watching a person who has no energy essentially to do any of it and it's so hopeless, but

2:58:18.400 --> 2:58:19.680
 you have to try.

2:58:19.680 --> 2:58:24.400
 I think some of that has to do with all the different physical feats you have to do.

2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:27.400
 When you have nothing left, you still keep going.

2:58:27.400 --> 2:58:33.600
 That same weird drive when you're empty, you still keep going.

2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:34.600
 I wanted to give up.

2:58:34.600 --> 2:58:36.720
 I tried.

2:58:36.720 --> 2:58:37.720
 I did.

2:58:37.720 --> 2:58:44.240
 I'm really lucky because it really was the one person that I'd wake up to every day and

2:58:44.240 --> 2:58:48.960
 he'd be like, hey, so that new drug you're on, fun fact, if you don't go to sleep right

2:58:48.960 --> 2:58:49.960
 away, you talk.

2:58:49.960 --> 2:58:55.400
 When you talk, you just don't fucking stop and you go off about everything that's horrible.

2:58:55.400 --> 2:58:57.680
 And I'm like, what are you talking about?

2:58:57.680 --> 2:58:58.680
 No last night.

2:58:58.680 --> 2:58:59.680
 Yeah, you took that pill.

2:58:59.680 --> 2:59:00.680
 Guess what?

2:59:00.680 --> 2:59:01.680
 You just, you didn't stop.

2:59:01.680 --> 2:59:02.680
 I'm like, I have no recollection.

2:59:02.680 --> 2:59:08.640
 I'd get up in the middle of the night, I would cook food like on a stove and it would

2:59:08.640 --> 2:59:14.800
 be hopefully we don't die because I would have no recollection because of the drugs.

2:59:14.800 --> 2:59:21.080
 The idea that when people say, well, just put yourself out of depression, I'm a highly

2:59:21.080 --> 2:59:32.600
 motivated individual, the idea of lifting my head up to turnover was daunting.

2:59:32.600 --> 2:59:33.600
 It's terrifying.

2:59:33.600 --> 2:59:39.320
 It's like for somebody so as driven as you to completely lose all of that for moments

2:59:39.320 --> 2:59:49.120
 of time, for stretches of time, fuck, the mind isn't motherfucking, this is, I can't,

2:59:49.120 --> 2:59:54.520
 for somebody like, I can't, I can't, I'm so, I'm so grateful for people like you to be

2:59:54.520 --> 2:59:56.520
 able to pull out of that.

2:59:56.520 --> 2:59:58.920
 I've been always the opposite.

2:59:58.920 --> 3:00:06.440
 Like, I've been very fortunate to just always find joy, meaning in everything, even the

3:00:06.440 --> 3:00:07.440
 stupidest shit.

3:00:07.440 --> 3:00:08.680
 Can I ask you something?

3:00:08.680 --> 3:00:09.680
 Yeah.

3:00:09.680 --> 3:00:14.840
 Do you think that's because you, how you were raised, where you came from?

3:00:14.840 --> 3:00:19.000
 No, no, it was my own person.

3:00:19.000 --> 3:00:27.480
 I honestly think it's the biology, this, because I had, my parents, I'm very cognizant of

3:00:27.480 --> 3:00:30.680
 had nothing to do with that.

3:00:30.680 --> 3:00:33.840
 They never understood this little engine I had.

3:00:33.840 --> 3:00:37.960
 I always liked just sitting, looking at people and just enjoying how amazing they are and

3:00:37.960 --> 3:00:43.400
 just looking at, I think it's straight up just biology, whatever the neurochemistry

3:00:43.400 --> 3:00:44.400
 is.

3:00:44.400 --> 3:00:46.200
 I'm just getting a good drug.

3:00:46.200 --> 3:00:47.800
 You're just getting hit.

3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:48.800
 Yeah, I'm getting hit.

3:00:48.800 --> 3:00:49.800
 I'm getting hit.

3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:50.800
 All the time from stupid shit.

3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:51.800
 I love that.

3:00:51.800 --> 3:00:58.560
 And it doesn't, and yeah, so that's why I can be, sometimes I'll talk very self critically

3:00:58.560 --> 3:01:03.960
 about myself because that's almost makes me, it makes life more fun and challenges stuff.

3:01:03.960 --> 3:01:08.240
 It makes you more productive, but ultimately it's because I'm getting that like, I'm getting

3:01:08.240 --> 3:01:10.160
 the good stuff all the time.

3:01:10.160 --> 3:01:11.160
 I wondered about that.

3:01:11.160 --> 3:01:14.320
 I was thinking about that when I listened to you for the first time on, I think when

3:01:14.320 --> 3:01:18.160
 you're on Rogan for the first time, water shouldn't do that.

3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:19.160
 Oh, it's not water.

3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:20.160
 You shouldn't trust.

3:01:20.160 --> 3:01:21.160
 See, this is the thing with the Russians.

3:01:21.160 --> 3:01:22.160
 It's not by Coca Cola.

3:01:22.160 --> 3:01:26.160
 Well, no, I had to resealed.

3:01:26.160 --> 3:01:31.000
 I mean, I didn't go that far, but now I'm really starting to question what's in this,

3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:32.000
 but that's okay.

3:01:32.000 --> 3:01:34.480
 If I offered you tea, you should really be worried.

3:01:34.480 --> 3:01:35.480
 But yeah.

3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:36.480
 Why?

3:01:36.480 --> 3:01:41.120
 I mean, that's the, no, that's the, the, like the more famous way that Russians usually

3:01:41.120 --> 3:01:46.680
 assassinate, they put poison in the tea because a lot of Russians drink tea and, you know.

3:01:46.680 --> 3:01:47.680
 All right.

3:01:47.680 --> 3:01:50.080
 I mean, there is a blade right there.

3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:51.080
 So,

3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:54.560
 Wait, that was somebody, um, Andrew Huberman gave that to me.

3:01:54.560 --> 3:01:55.560
 He's also good.

3:01:55.560 --> 3:01:57.040
 You, I don't know if you know him, but he's a cool.

3:01:57.040 --> 3:01:58.840
 I don't know all the people you know I'm new.

3:01:58.840 --> 3:01:59.840
 Okay.

3:01:59.840 --> 3:02:00.840
 I'm new here, Lex.

3:02:00.840 --> 3:02:01.840
 You're gonna have to.

3:02:01.840 --> 3:02:02.840
 I'll send instructions.

3:02:02.840 --> 3:02:03.840
 Yeah.

3:02:03.840 --> 3:02:04.840
 You're gonna have to send, what is, what does my friend say?

3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:08.120
 He says, uh, an ex operator and he'll message me once in a while and ask me something and

3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:09.120
 I'll answer back.

3:02:09.120 --> 3:02:14.000
 If I answer in the correct way, he'll go, candidate meets expectations.

3:02:14.000 --> 3:02:16.560
 Like, fuck you, I'm not a candidate of anything.

3:02:16.560 --> 3:02:17.560
 Yeah.

3:02:17.560 --> 3:02:18.560
 Yeah.

3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:19.560
 But yeah, it's essentially it.

3:02:19.560 --> 3:02:24.320
 Well, Andrew Huberman is kind of a celebrity, Andrew, you should check her out, uh, you're

3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:25.920
 an interesting person, you guys should connect.

3:02:25.920 --> 3:02:31.520
 He's, uh, Stanford neuroscientist was, uh, I think the number one podcast in the world

3:02:31.520 --> 3:02:32.520
 in health.

3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:33.520
 Uh, he's a.

3:02:33.520 --> 3:02:37.440
 Is he the one, the beard, does he feel like a, a beard thing going?

3:02:37.440 --> 3:02:38.440
 Uh, yeah.

3:02:38.440 --> 3:02:40.800
 I'm, I'm, I'm knocking him down to it.

3:02:40.800 --> 3:02:42.360
 Like, does he have a beard?

3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:45.240
 I don't, I don't look, I don't look at people's visual appearance, man.

3:02:45.240 --> 3:02:46.240
 You're full of shit.

3:02:46.240 --> 3:02:47.600
 I don't, uh, does he have a beard?

3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:48.600
 I think he has a beard.

3:02:48.600 --> 3:02:49.600
 Yeah.

3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:50.600
 He is.

3:02:50.600 --> 3:02:51.600
 I think I know who you're talking about.

3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:54.000
 He's a very handsome gentleman.

3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:56.600
 I think I know who you're talking about because I think I was looking at his stuff this morning.

3:02:56.600 --> 3:02:57.600
 Yeah, exactly.

3:02:57.600 --> 3:02:58.600
 No, seriously, on Instagram.

3:02:58.600 --> 3:02:59.600
 No, no, no.

3:02:59.600 --> 3:03:00.600
 Okay.

3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:01.600
 You probably know him.

3:03:01.600 --> 3:03:02.600
 Yeah.

3:03:02.600 --> 3:03:03.600
 That's, I mean, I don't know him.

3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:04.600
 But it's very, very humble, very intelligent.

3:03:04.600 --> 3:03:05.600
 Yeah.

3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:06.600
 Probably would understand.

3:03:06.600 --> 3:03:09.160
 Like, I'm very kind of poetic and so on.

3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:16.560
 He's, he's probably the most like rigorous, um, reference machine of science.

3:03:16.560 --> 3:03:17.960
 Like, he's a legit scientist.

3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:22.080
 Like, he knows every paper and everything has to do with the mind and your science.

3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:23.080
 Like, performance.

3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:24.080
 Yeah.

3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:25.080
 Yeah.

3:03:25.080 --> 3:03:31.720
 He's much more, he's, he's, he's much more actually, and the focus is always on, um,

3:03:31.720 --> 3:03:35.320
 how to help, how that helps people select protocols.

3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:38.680
 Like, like, here's what you need to do to get better sleep.

3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:39.680
 Yes.

3:03:39.680 --> 3:03:40.680
 Yes.

3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:41.680
 I know who it is.

3:03:41.680 --> 3:03:42.680
 He cares like a thousand papers.

3:03:42.680 --> 3:03:43.680
 Yeah.

3:03:43.680 --> 3:03:44.680
 And he just goes like, hammer's nonstop.

3:03:44.680 --> 3:03:51.720
 I mean, he, um, he spent a week in Austin, he's coming back and spending, uh, a couple

3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:52.720
 of weeks in Austin.

3:03:52.720 --> 3:03:53.720
 We just hang out.

3:03:53.720 --> 3:03:56.920
 And it's like, you think that was like a teleprompter or something.

3:03:56.920 --> 3:03:58.360
 Like the way he does his podcast.

3:03:58.360 --> 3:03:59.360
 He does.

3:03:59.360 --> 3:04:00.360
 Yeah.

3:04:00.360 --> 3:04:01.360
 But like in person, he's the same.

3:04:01.360 --> 3:04:02.360
 Like, all right.

3:04:02.360 --> 3:04:05.360
 This is, this is intense, but I like it.

3:04:05.360 --> 3:04:06.360
 I like that.

3:04:06.360 --> 3:04:07.360
 Anyway.

3:04:07.360 --> 3:04:08.840
 You know, why do we bring him up?

3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:09.840
 I don't know.

3:04:09.840 --> 3:04:11.240
 We brought up knives we were talking about.

3:04:11.240 --> 3:04:12.240
 He gave it to me.

3:04:12.240 --> 3:04:13.240
 That's right.

3:04:13.240 --> 3:04:14.240
 PTSD.

3:04:14.240 --> 3:04:15.240
 Yeah.

3:04:15.240 --> 3:04:16.240
 And then you talked about poisoning and how you were poisoning me.

3:04:16.240 --> 3:04:17.240
 And I said knives.

3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:18.240
 We're talking about Russians.

3:04:18.240 --> 3:04:20.840
 And then we were kind of talking about the brain and PTSD.

3:04:20.840 --> 3:04:21.840
 Yeah.

3:04:21.840 --> 3:04:27.480
 And I think for, for most people though, the biggest thing when they see somebody who's

3:04:27.480 --> 3:04:31.960
 struggling with PTSD, their, their first, you know, reaction is, how do I help them?

3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:36.880
 Well, often just saying, Hey, I'm here when you're ready to talk and you're going through

3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:39.760
 something, whether you want to talk about it right now or not, I'm here.

3:04:39.760 --> 3:04:42.640
 And then keeping a close eye on behaviors.

3:04:42.640 --> 3:04:49.400
 When you start to see somebody having, you know, four, five, six beers at night, ask

3:04:49.400 --> 3:04:52.360
 why when you see somebody, you can tell they're not sleeping.

3:04:52.360 --> 3:04:53.360
 Hey, buddy, are you sleeping?

3:04:53.360 --> 3:04:55.880
 I just am not sleeping.

3:04:55.880 --> 3:04:57.800
 Instead of just going, Oh, that sucks.

3:04:57.800 --> 3:05:00.360
 Hey, why aren't you sleeping?

3:05:00.360 --> 3:05:01.360
 You having nightmares?

3:05:01.360 --> 3:05:03.880
 Are you, you just have an insomnia?

3:05:03.880 --> 3:05:05.760
 Are you just eating sugar before bed?

3:05:05.760 --> 3:05:11.120
 You just care enough about your people to just ask one follow up question because often

3:05:11.120 --> 3:05:15.160
 that's really all it takes because then somebody goes, somebody cares enough to ask.

3:05:15.160 --> 3:05:19.520
 And then they'll just, yeah, just showing that you care.

3:05:19.520 --> 3:05:24.480
 It honestly grocery store lineup, I'll say, Oh, I like your dress.

3:05:24.480 --> 3:05:25.480
 Oh, thank you.

3:05:25.480 --> 3:05:27.280
 And then I'll go, how's your day going?

3:05:27.280 --> 3:05:30.360
 They're like, actually, it's going all right.

3:05:30.360 --> 3:05:33.400
 It's not as great as I thought it would be today, but I'm doing okay, but like they'll

3:05:33.400 --> 3:05:37.280
 give you a, instead of good you, instead of just giving you this fake, false reaction.

3:05:37.280 --> 3:05:44.080
 If you just show any effort in somebody that you care at all about someone's well being,

3:05:44.080 --> 3:05:46.640
 you'd be amazed, amazed.

3:05:46.640 --> 3:05:47.640
 Yeah.

3:05:47.640 --> 3:05:49.120
 And some of it is just energy.

3:05:49.120 --> 3:05:54.520
 The reason honestly I moved to Austin is some lady at a Walmart said, honey, you look

3:05:54.520 --> 3:06:00.400
 handsome in that suit, but the care that she put in that, she just looked at me.

3:06:00.400 --> 3:06:02.440
 It wasn't like hitting at me or something.

3:06:02.440 --> 3:06:04.120
 She was like, the love, just love.

3:06:04.120 --> 3:06:05.120
 Yeah.

3:06:05.120 --> 3:06:07.600
 And I was like, okay, I'm moving here, I guess.

3:06:07.600 --> 3:06:10.720
 There was a, that's so funny you said that because I told my, I told my husband this

3:06:10.720 --> 3:06:13.720
 happened and it was, it threw me off.

3:06:13.720 --> 3:06:18.760
 There was an older lady at a store and this was right after we, we got a brief period of

3:06:18.760 --> 3:06:22.480
 no masks in Canada, like just like a brief like five minutes.

3:06:22.480 --> 3:06:23.480
 Oh yeah.

3:06:23.480 --> 3:06:24.480
 It was not even that.

3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:26.760
 And I, I had come from like an interview or something.

3:06:26.760 --> 3:06:30.160
 So I had actually had makeup on that day and I had my hat and I was, you know, just at

3:06:30.160 --> 3:06:31.160
 the grocery store.

3:06:31.160 --> 3:06:34.360
 And she walked up to me and she got real close and I didn't know what was happening and she

3:06:34.360 --> 3:06:37.840
 got closer and then she just grabbed my arm like this.

3:06:37.840 --> 3:06:40.560
 She goes, I love that hat on you.

3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:43.840
 And I looked at her and I was like, she touched me during a pandemic and she's old.

3:06:43.840 --> 3:06:44.840
 Oh my God.

3:06:44.840 --> 3:06:45.840
 I love you too.

3:06:45.840 --> 3:06:46.840
 Thank you so much.

3:06:46.840 --> 3:06:47.840
 I said, you're so amazing.

3:06:47.840 --> 3:06:48.840
 I just, and I just sparked a conversation.

3:06:48.840 --> 3:06:49.840
 Yeah.

3:06:49.840 --> 3:06:50.840
 Yeah.

3:06:50.840 --> 3:06:51.840
 That's amazing.

3:06:51.840 --> 3:06:52.840
 It doesn't take much.

3:06:52.840 --> 3:06:53.840
 Yeah.

3:06:53.840 --> 3:06:54.840
 That little moment of genuine care.

3:06:54.840 --> 3:06:59.520
 I mean, maybe you can tell me actually the, the journey you took with ayahuasca.

3:06:59.520 --> 3:07:00.520
 Sure.

3:07:00.520 --> 3:07:03.040
 So that's such a fascinating journey.

3:07:03.040 --> 3:07:08.040
 So like letting your mind go to different places in order to rediscover itself.

3:07:08.040 --> 3:07:10.080
 Like, like, what is it?

3:07:10.080 --> 3:07:13.640
 Like a rocket ship to somewhere else so you can land in a better place.

3:07:13.640 --> 3:07:14.640
 Here.

3:07:14.640 --> 3:07:16.640
 How about I show you something that'll help your brain?

3:07:16.640 --> 3:07:17.640
 Okay.

3:07:17.640 --> 3:07:18.640
 Yes.

3:07:18.640 --> 3:07:21.280
 This is not for you to lift up either and show on the camera because there's leaves in

3:07:21.280 --> 3:07:22.280
 it.

3:07:22.280 --> 3:07:23.280
 Like there's leaves in some pages.

3:07:23.280 --> 3:07:25.920
 So just don't dump it out because it'll go all fucking everywhere.

3:07:25.920 --> 3:07:26.920
 Got it.

3:07:26.920 --> 3:07:27.920
 Got it.

3:07:27.920 --> 3:07:28.920
 Instructions.

3:07:28.920 --> 3:07:29.920
 I like this.

3:07:29.920 --> 3:07:39.040
 Um, ayahuasca is a beautiful psychedelic that we have been so blessed to have on this

3:07:39.040 --> 3:07:46.080
 earth that we have so underutilized and could be saving humanity, but just, you ever hear

3:07:46.080 --> 3:07:49.080
 that saying, if you could just give everyone mushrooms one time, the world would be a better

3:07:49.080 --> 3:07:50.080
 place.

3:07:50.080 --> 3:07:51.080
 Okay.

3:07:51.080 --> 3:07:57.560
 So psilocybin is I use for micro dosing for depression.

3:07:57.560 --> 3:08:00.560
 I did ayahuasca in January of this year.

3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:06.400
 Um, and I've at that point, that was the last time I was on a pharmaceutical drug.

3:08:06.400 --> 3:08:09.960
 I've been off everything ever since 10 different ones.

3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:14.560
 So if you backtrack a little bit just to, so you'll understand my doctor gave me the

3:08:14.560 --> 3:08:17.760
 opportunity Dr. Greg Passi.

3:08:17.760 --> 3:08:21.600
 He is a veteran himself served in Bosnia and Rwanda is a medic.

3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:22.600
 He's a colonel.

3:08:22.600 --> 3:08:23.600
 I think colonel lieutenant.

3:08:23.600 --> 3:08:25.280
 He's gonna punch me right in the face for that.

3:08:25.280 --> 3:08:28.160
 He's high up officer.

3:08:28.160 --> 3:08:29.160
 He is one of my saviors.

3:08:29.160 --> 3:08:31.240
 He's like my old, I call him my old man.

3:08:31.240 --> 3:08:35.360
 He's my favorite and rides a Harley like that kind of guy.

3:08:35.360 --> 3:08:36.360
 Nice.

3:08:36.360 --> 3:08:37.360
 Yeah.

3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:41.280
 And, um, he said, you know, Kels, this is, I just don't, I was hitting a wall.

3:08:41.280 --> 3:08:42.280
 I wasn't getting any better.

3:08:42.280 --> 3:08:45.000
 And he goes, what, how do you feel about cannabis?

3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:51.360
 And I was like, I don't feel good about it because family histories or my parents always

3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:54.160
 told me if I smoked weed, you know, it's just this, this perception.

3:08:54.160 --> 3:08:56.720
 Because I just want you to try it.

3:08:56.720 --> 3:08:58.360
 Just what would you be willing to try?

3:08:58.360 --> 3:08:59.520
 So I was like, okay.

3:08:59.520 --> 3:09:01.640
 So I was willing to try it.

3:09:01.640 --> 3:09:06.480
 Then I started going to these groups called women grow and, um, learning about it.

3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:12.680
 And then I realized, oh, I'm starting to sleep a little bit.

3:09:12.680 --> 3:09:14.840
 I don't feel groggy in the morning.

3:09:14.840 --> 3:09:16.680
 I don't feel like a bag of shit.

3:09:16.680 --> 3:09:21.120
 And I also want to have a baby one day and I can't have all this stuff in my system.

3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:27.200
 So I started using cannabis and then I started using it as a main medication.

3:09:27.200 --> 3:09:39.000
 And I'd been using it now since 2000 and 14 got married, 15, 2015, I started using it.

3:09:39.000 --> 3:09:41.120
 And then I've been using it ever since.

3:09:41.120 --> 3:09:46.600
 And that was the way I got off of all the pharmaceutical drugs was keeping cannabis,

3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:51.720
 the constant, finding the right strains for me, and then slowly with the doctor's advice

3:09:51.720 --> 3:09:56.400
 and under supervision, going off of those medications.

3:09:56.400 --> 3:10:01.920
 Cut to January of 2021, I had hit a really bad spell last year.

3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:04.680
 Um, and the year before was a really big struggle.

3:10:04.680 --> 3:10:09.400
 Uh, I almost lost my company last year due to COVID, just like many, many millions of

3:10:09.400 --> 3:10:10.600
 people did.

3:10:10.600 --> 3:10:15.040
 Um, and instead of me just laying down and taking it.

3:10:15.040 --> 3:10:19.480
 I pivoted really quickly and called the factory and said, do you guys make masks?

3:10:19.480 --> 3:10:21.120
 They're like, yeah, we're making masks.

3:10:21.120 --> 3:10:24.000
 I was like, I'm going to call the Canadian government.

3:10:24.000 --> 3:10:27.640
 I'm going to get my medical license and I'm going to try to sell the masks and see if

3:10:27.640 --> 3:10:28.640
 we can do that.

3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:29.640
 And so we did that.

3:10:29.640 --> 3:10:37.880
 And so we did 200,000 masks for Ontario hospitals, um, which ironically went to my entire community

3:10:37.880 --> 3:10:39.880
 I was born and raised in.

3:10:39.880 --> 3:10:41.760
 So it was really weird.

3:10:41.760 --> 3:10:43.600
 And that kept us afloat long enough.

3:10:43.600 --> 3:10:49.240
 Um, we lost 200 retail locations that I all single handedly spent five years going like

3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:50.800
 door to door getting myself.

3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:57.200
 Um, and we should say this is brass and unity, uh, jewelry, the jewelry and sunglass company.

3:10:57.200 --> 3:11:04.640
 And I started speaking to which looks like a serial killer, I mean, you do look good

3:11:04.640 --> 3:11:05.640
 in them.

3:11:05.640 --> 3:11:06.640
 I won't lie.

3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:07.640
 Thank you.

3:11:07.640 --> 3:11:08.640
 Well, okay.

3:11:08.640 --> 3:11:09.640
 We'll call them the Lex.

3:11:09.640 --> 3:11:10.640
 That's those are now called the Lex.

3:11:10.640 --> 3:11:11.640
 Fuck the gun or the Lex.

3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:12.640
 I like it.

3:11:12.640 --> 3:11:13.640
 You know, bear with me.

3:11:13.640 --> 3:11:17.200
 I, I started, my doctor suggested art therapy, Dr. Passi did.

3:11:17.200 --> 3:11:19.120
 And that's really how the company started.

3:11:19.120 --> 3:11:23.120
 I bought beads and a pipe cutter and a hammer and a drill and I fucked up our kitchen table

3:11:23.120 --> 3:11:26.840
 and I taught myself how to pull jewelry because my husband was like, you can do it.

3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:27.840
 Go for it.

3:11:27.840 --> 3:11:31.000
 So I was like, okay, he says I can believe in me, so I guess I can do it.

3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:32.960
 No idea what I'm doing.

3:11:32.960 --> 3:11:38.360
 And then I got to this point, um, you know, when COVID hit and people lost companies and

3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:40.880
 we pivoted and we did what we could.

3:11:40.880 --> 3:11:45.400
 And then I really started to go downhill psychologically.

3:11:45.400 --> 3:11:49.000
 I've found purpose again with this company.

3:11:49.000 --> 3:11:51.240
 I found a way to help again.

3:11:51.240 --> 3:11:54.680
 I found myself again.

3:11:54.680 --> 3:11:58.560
 And then that was in danger of being gone again.

3:11:58.560 --> 3:12:01.160
 So the company is 2015.

3:12:01.160 --> 3:12:06.080
 We started, I started, um, building jewelry in 2015 under like a, just, it was called

3:12:06.080 --> 3:12:11.440
 her wearables and it was really small and it was just, I was just trying to make stuff.

3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:13.200
 It wasn't supposed to be a company.

3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:17.880
 And you were on a ton of medication throughout the whole process.

3:12:17.880 --> 3:12:23.320
 And my mom being the tenacious truck driver she is, she was driving for Kevin Hart's

3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:25.080
 what now to her.

3:12:25.080 --> 3:12:29.320
 And so she got, she just harassed them was like, you need to meet my daughter.

3:12:29.320 --> 3:12:30.320
 Yeah.

3:12:30.320 --> 3:12:31.320
 So you find them.

3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:32.320
 I saw the picture of you and Kevin Hart.

3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:33.320
 That's cool.

3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:34.320
 But he just gave me a good piece of advice.

3:12:34.320 --> 3:12:36.040
 Hey, if you're going to make this something, you can't really.

3:12:36.040 --> 3:12:38.440
 If you want it to be for everyone, you can't call it her wearables.

3:12:38.440 --> 3:12:39.920
 I was like, cool.

3:12:39.920 --> 3:12:44.200
 And then we drove home that night and then he tweeted it out to people, to 24 million

3:12:44.200 --> 3:12:45.200
 people.

3:12:45.200 --> 3:12:47.960
 This was before he was like, who is now?

3:12:47.960 --> 3:12:49.600
 And that was a giant deal.

3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:52.440
 And then my husband kind of looked at me and being, he's so fucking brilliant.

3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:55.000
 He looked at me and goes, all right, yeah, we got to come up with a rename.

3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:56.000
 Let me start thinking.

3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:57.000
 Let me start brainstorming.

3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:58.320
 Like, let's make, you want to make this real?

3:12:58.320 --> 3:12:59.640
 Let's make this real.

3:12:59.640 --> 3:13:01.200
 And so we did.

3:13:01.200 --> 3:13:04.560
 And he was like, what do you think about like we were doing like brass, collective Co brass

3:13:04.560 --> 3:13:05.560
 this.

3:13:05.560 --> 3:13:07.400
 I knew I want to brass in the name.

3:13:07.400 --> 3:13:08.560
 And then he's like, what about brass and unity?

3:13:08.560 --> 3:13:09.920
 You're trying to like unify people.

3:13:09.920 --> 3:13:10.920
 Like why wouldn't you do it?

3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:11.920
 I'm like, what's the name?

3:13:11.920 --> 3:13:14.120
 Of course you can name up with it like everything else.

3:13:14.120 --> 3:13:15.120
 That's a great name.

3:13:15.120 --> 3:13:16.400
 Well, he's a brilliant person.

3:13:16.400 --> 3:13:17.400
 It's annoying.

3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:18.400
 Yeah.

3:13:18.400 --> 3:13:22.240
 So the idea of losing this thing that we had just built and just got me kind of functioning

3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:24.860
 with was devastating.

3:13:24.860 --> 3:13:29.680
 So I got this opportunity given to me by Griff, Combat Flipbops.

3:13:29.680 --> 3:13:34.320
 Again, Brady, my husband was like, hey, you should get sponsors for your podcast.

3:13:34.320 --> 3:13:36.800
 Hey, have you heard of this company, Combat Flipbops?

3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:38.920
 Remember, we watched them on Shark Tank.

3:13:38.920 --> 3:13:40.400
 And then I reached out.

3:13:40.400 --> 3:13:41.400
 He emailed me back.

3:13:41.400 --> 3:13:43.880
 He's like, yeah, we go together like peanut butter and jelly or companies.

3:13:43.880 --> 3:13:45.480
 That sounds great.

3:13:45.480 --> 3:13:49.720
 And then I was like, hey, also like, do you think one of your owners would want to come

3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:50.840
 on the podcast?

3:13:50.840 --> 3:13:54.360
 Just like tossing it out there kind of like I did with you.

3:13:54.360 --> 3:13:56.480
 And he was like, yeah, I'd love to come on.

3:13:56.480 --> 3:13:59.120
 And I was like, oh my God.

3:13:59.120 --> 3:14:01.200
 And he came on the podcast and it went great.

3:14:01.200 --> 3:14:04.240
 And then at the end of it, we stopped recording and he just kind of did this thing.

3:14:04.240 --> 3:14:05.240
 He does this.

3:14:05.240 --> 3:14:10.240
 He just like leans in real close, just looks into your soul and goes, how are you doing?

3:14:10.240 --> 3:14:12.240
 And they're like, great.

3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:16.240
 He's like, how are you really doing?

3:14:16.240 --> 3:14:17.240
 Everything.

3:14:17.240 --> 3:14:23.280
 Just this whole, just like waterworks happen and he goes, listen, have you ever heard of

3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:24.280
 ayahuasca?

3:14:24.280 --> 3:14:29.360
 And I was like, yeah, like in movies and like psychedelics in the 70s, you know, and he's

3:14:29.360 --> 3:14:31.440
 like, no, no, no, no, let's like have a talk.

3:14:31.440 --> 3:14:34.040
 And he goes, I've got an opportunity for a spot.

3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:37.160
 I'm going with this charity called Heroic Hearts.

3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:41.720
 They have spaces in the UK, Canada and the United States.

3:14:41.720 --> 3:14:45.520
 They're owned by an army ranger named Jesse Gould.

3:14:45.520 --> 3:14:47.920
 You know, they're really trying to help vets.

3:14:47.920 --> 3:14:48.920
 And this has worked.

3:14:48.920 --> 3:14:49.920
 Would you want to come?

3:14:49.920 --> 3:14:53.800
 And before he even said, like, would you, before I even got like an invite, I was like,

3:14:53.800 --> 3:14:54.800
 can I come?

3:14:54.800 --> 3:14:57.920
 When can I, when, when do we, when do we go?

3:14:57.920 --> 3:14:59.960
 And he's like, oh, it's in like three weeks.

3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:02.480
 You can't be on any SSRIs.

3:15:02.480 --> 3:15:04.200
 If you're on any, you're going to have to wean off.

3:15:04.200 --> 3:15:08.880
 And at the time I was on my last one, and so I was like, I called my doctor and I was

3:15:08.880 --> 3:15:10.360
 like, listen.

3:15:10.360 --> 3:15:11.360
 And he was like, what?

3:15:11.360 --> 3:15:13.720
 And I was like, guess what I'm about to do.

3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:16.320
 And he's like, am I going to go do ayahuasca?

3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:18.920
 And he goes, you could, he does the same.

3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:23.400
 He just goes, all right.

3:15:23.400 --> 3:15:24.840
 Because he knows he's not going to win.

3:15:24.840 --> 3:15:26.280
 He knows I'll just fight him on it.

3:15:26.280 --> 3:15:28.680
 That's just called that like the, the Jaco reset.

3:15:28.680 --> 3:15:29.680
 Yeah.

3:15:29.680 --> 3:15:31.360
 Because he does a pretty much.

3:15:31.360 --> 3:15:32.360
 Yeah.

3:15:32.360 --> 3:15:33.360
 Exactly.

3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:35.280
 And he goes, I said, but here's the kicker.

3:15:35.280 --> 3:15:36.800
 I have to go off of this medication.

3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:40.600
 And he goes, well, you know, we're supposed to do that in the summer months when the depression

3:15:40.600 --> 3:15:42.960
 is not going to bring, you know, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, listen.

3:15:42.960 --> 3:15:47.080
 I hear you, but I'm doing it whether you want me to or not.

3:15:47.080 --> 3:15:50.040
 So I'm letting you know, hey, this is going to happen.

3:15:50.040 --> 3:15:51.960
 And he's like, okay, just try to do it properly.

3:15:51.960 --> 3:15:52.960
 I was like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3:15:52.960 --> 3:15:53.960
 I know the drill.

3:15:53.960 --> 3:15:54.960
 I know the drill, whatever, whatever.

3:15:54.960 --> 3:15:55.960
 It went to school to be a paramedic.

3:15:55.960 --> 3:15:56.960
 I know the drill.

3:15:56.960 --> 3:15:57.960
 Go off of it properly.

3:15:57.960 --> 3:16:02.880
 I dropped that within a week that stuff was, I was done taking it and I was going through

3:16:02.880 --> 3:16:06.280
 like the world's worst just withdrawals.

3:16:06.280 --> 3:16:10.880
 It was like you were at a rock concert and your head was banging up and down, but you

3:16:10.880 --> 3:16:13.200
 were sitting perfectly still.

3:16:13.200 --> 3:16:15.120
 It was horrible.

3:16:15.120 --> 3:16:17.760
 But you had like a thing to look forward to with the sidewalk.

3:16:17.760 --> 3:16:22.960
 I had a light at the end of the tunnel and I knew if I got to the light was the worst

3:16:22.960 --> 3:16:23.960
 that's going to happen.

3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:24.960
 Just get to the light.

3:16:24.960 --> 3:16:29.760
 But at that point, again, I had a son, I had a husband, I had a great company, I have a

3:16:29.760 --> 3:16:33.480
 great house, I have a nice car, I have everything.

3:16:33.480 --> 3:16:36.760
 Why did I want to die every minute of the day?

3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:38.840
 I was at that point again.

3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:39.840
 And I'm like, this has got it.

3:16:39.840 --> 3:16:41.360
 Something's got to give.

3:16:41.360 --> 3:17:02.560
 And so I went and I got there and she is the most intense, beautiful, divine deity or entity

3:17:02.560 --> 3:17:11.600
 or visualization, whatever you want to deem ayahuasca as, mama ayah is real.

3:17:11.600 --> 3:17:15.080
 And she takes no prisoners.

3:17:15.080 --> 3:17:23.520
 She shows you exactly what you need to see to help yourself, but she does not discriminate

3:17:23.520 --> 3:17:26.360
 against whether you're ready or not.

3:17:26.360 --> 3:17:30.640
 If you've ingested it, she's coming for you.

3:17:30.640 --> 3:17:34.600
 She's going to be either gentle or she's going to beat your ass.

3:17:34.600 --> 3:17:43.240
 And sometimes that's what you need, but she does it in a way that is profound.

3:17:43.240 --> 3:17:46.920
 So what were some memorable, profound moments for you?

3:17:46.920 --> 3:17:50.440
 What were the places it took you?

3:17:50.440 --> 3:17:52.160
 People had you meet?

3:17:52.160 --> 3:17:58.200
 For the first time, I got to be in a group of people who didn't judge me or question

3:17:58.200 --> 3:18:01.400
 my service, they just respect me.

3:18:01.400 --> 3:18:03.040
 That was number one.

3:18:03.040 --> 3:18:09.240
 So that group I lost, I just found again.

3:18:09.240 --> 3:18:10.240
 Big shocker.

3:18:10.240 --> 3:18:16.000
 I was the only woman there again seems to be the thing for me.

3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:19.840
 And so I was surrounded by all these special operators like these aren't like normal soldiers.

3:18:19.840 --> 3:18:28.240
 Like these guys that I'm with are like bronze star, fucking purple heart, just the coolest

3:18:28.240 --> 3:18:32.240
 people, people I've always wanted to be like, that's my buddy.

3:18:32.240 --> 3:18:34.200
 Now I can be like, those are my buddies.

3:18:34.200 --> 3:18:36.680
 Like those motherfuckers will go to bat for me.

3:18:36.680 --> 3:18:38.200
 They will bend over backwards.

3:18:38.200 --> 3:18:40.100
 They will X fill me out of anywhere.

3:18:40.100 --> 3:18:42.720
 They will take a bullet for me.

3:18:42.720 --> 3:18:45.920
 And these guys welcomed me in in a way I didn't, I didn't expect.

3:18:45.920 --> 3:18:48.200
 So that hit me weird right off the get.

3:18:48.200 --> 3:18:52.200
 I was nervous and now I was just felt that home for a minute.

3:18:52.200 --> 3:18:59.640
 And then when I stepped into ceremony, the first night because you do, you do three nights

3:18:59.640 --> 3:19:06.600
 over like, over like Friday, Saturday, Sunday, the first night, I was so nervous and so anxious

3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:11.560
 because you go up in ceremony and you're, the shamans come in and they, they cleanse

3:19:11.560 --> 3:19:18.000
 themselves and then you get served the IA individually, you go up, they give it to you.

3:19:18.000 --> 3:19:21.480
 You can take your time and pray, you can do whatever you want and then you drink it.

3:19:21.480 --> 3:19:29.200
 I was so just like, I got back to my mat and I sat there and I was like trying to keep

3:19:29.200 --> 3:19:34.040
 it in, but I could feel that like heat come from my toes all the way up and you're like,

3:19:34.040 --> 3:19:35.040
 your mouth starts to water.

3:19:35.040 --> 3:19:38.560
 I'm going to throw up, I'm going to throw up and I looked over to griff and I looked

3:19:38.560 --> 3:19:47.640
 at Bishop and I was like, swallow it and I was like, okay, and you can't talk or anything.

3:19:47.640 --> 3:19:52.280
 So I like, my buddy, we call him the Viking, a soul Viking.

3:19:52.280 --> 3:19:58.840
 He looks like a Viking, his head's tattooed, he's, he's been on the show, he's so cool.

3:19:58.840 --> 3:20:01.720
 He's sitting directly across like you and I and he can see him and he's looking at me

3:20:01.720 --> 3:20:08.720
 and I'm throwing up and I do it about three times and then the last time he just saw me

3:20:08.720 --> 3:20:14.600
 and I couldn't do it and I just, I threw it up and so I like to think that was her way

3:20:14.600 --> 3:20:20.120
 of easing me in so I didn't get like a full punch to the face, but I gotta, let me take

3:20:20.120 --> 3:20:22.480
 your hand and show you what I'm going to show you.

3:20:22.480 --> 3:20:23.480
 We're going to make you better.

3:20:23.480 --> 3:20:24.720
 We're going to take the pain away.

3:20:24.720 --> 3:20:27.760
 Aren't you supposed to eventually throw up no matter what?

3:20:27.760 --> 3:20:28.760
 It's not supposed to.

3:20:28.760 --> 3:20:29.760
 Some people don't.

3:20:29.760 --> 3:20:30.760
 You purge.

3:20:30.760 --> 3:20:31.760
 Yeah.

3:20:31.760 --> 3:20:32.760
 If something's happening, you're going through something.

3:20:32.760 --> 3:20:34.880
 Yeah, you purge, but it doesn't have to happen.

3:20:34.880 --> 3:20:39.080
 But this, I mean, within like the first 20 minutes, no, this takes like, you got to sit

3:20:39.080 --> 3:20:44.400
 and meditate for, or sit still basically and meditate in the pitch block for about 45 minutes

3:20:44.400 --> 3:20:48.280
 before the effects even, before you even feel her.

3:20:48.280 --> 3:20:50.120
 So it's very.

3:20:50.120 --> 3:20:52.600
 So here she figured out the right dose you need.

3:20:52.600 --> 3:20:55.000
 Well, because I did the same dose as everyone else.

3:20:55.000 --> 3:21:00.760
 I think it was 20 mils, which doesn't seem like a lot, but when you've never done I had

3:21:00.760 --> 3:21:09.240
 it as, so I felt like such a bitch, God, I felt like such a bitch.

3:21:09.240 --> 3:21:10.240
 Okay.

3:21:10.240 --> 3:21:11.480
 That was the thought going through your mind.

3:21:11.480 --> 3:21:13.160
 Oh, you just fucked it all up.

3:21:13.160 --> 3:21:14.160
 You ruined it.

3:21:14.160 --> 3:21:15.160
 You ruined this again.

3:21:15.160 --> 3:21:16.400
 You couldn't do this, right?

3:21:16.400 --> 3:21:17.400
 Yeah.

3:21:17.400 --> 3:21:24.320
 And so at that point, we went through the meditation part in the shamans where they

3:21:24.320 --> 3:21:26.600
 literally sing for like six hours straight.

3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:30.720
 So you said that you take it and then there's just what you're quietly listening to the

3:21:30.720 --> 3:21:35.600
 meditate and you wait, and you wait, and you're in pitch black, like can't see this

3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:37.600
 far in front of your face.

3:21:37.600 --> 3:21:41.720
 And you have a little puke bucket and then you have a little light that has a red filter

3:21:41.720 --> 3:21:42.720
 on it.

3:21:42.720 --> 3:21:44.960
 If you have to get up to go to the bathroom to get out of the year, you use that so you

3:21:44.960 --> 3:21:47.320
 don't turn lights on.

3:21:47.320 --> 3:21:49.560
 And me, I brought like what?

3:21:49.560 --> 3:21:55.120
 No, it's just a cool visual of just a puke bucket and a little light for the, like I

3:21:55.120 --> 3:21:58.720
 can imagine these like little lights go never once in a while and then the rest is just

3:21:58.720 --> 3:22:03.560
 in darkness meditating with this, with this singing.

3:22:03.560 --> 3:22:04.560
 It's so beautiful.

3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:05.560
 It's cool.

3:22:05.560 --> 3:22:10.840
 I'll take you sometime because trust me, I wouldn't offer if it wasn't the group I would

3:22:10.840 --> 3:22:11.840
 trust.

3:22:11.840 --> 3:22:12.840
 Yeah.

3:22:12.840 --> 3:22:14.360
 You had a very interesting group.

3:22:14.360 --> 3:22:16.640
 So it's the Heroic Hearts people.

3:22:16.640 --> 3:22:17.640
 Yeah.

3:22:17.640 --> 3:22:18.640
 Heroic Hearts.

3:22:18.640 --> 3:22:20.520
 So yeah, this is my, Jesse gave us all these journals.

3:22:20.520 --> 3:22:22.360
 They're like, you're going to want these.

3:22:22.360 --> 3:22:26.920
 So he gave us all these journals and now this is like my Bible, like my work, my everything

3:22:26.920 --> 3:22:28.840
 goes in this with me everywhere.

3:22:28.840 --> 3:22:31.400
 It's just this like silent reminder for me.

3:22:31.400 --> 3:22:34.680
 And so Heroic Hearts does fantastic work.

3:22:34.680 --> 3:22:37.080
 I'll get into them after it.

3:22:37.080 --> 3:22:44.360
 The thing with this group is there's such care.

3:22:44.360 --> 3:22:46.680
 It's not like go do Aya and like you're done.

3:22:46.680 --> 3:22:50.200
 There's like integration coaches and there's like doctors and there's like people to make

3:22:50.200 --> 3:22:55.360
 sure that you're doing the work because Aya is just the, is just the gate.

3:22:55.360 --> 3:22:59.800
 Now you have to take it and you have to implement it into your life.

3:22:59.800 --> 3:23:00.800
 People don't do that though.

3:23:00.800 --> 3:23:02.760
 Did you do like integration?

3:23:02.760 --> 3:23:04.480
 Did you do conversations with somebody?

3:23:04.480 --> 3:23:09.520
 Did you talk to your like, is there a process to, because I've a similar with psilocybin

3:23:09.520 --> 3:23:14.880
 you mentioned, I've, as I understand, it's exceptionally beneficial for when you also

3:23:14.880 --> 3:23:20.040
 do like talk therapy, like you couple that with the integration in some form where you

3:23:20.040 --> 3:23:23.680
 talk through your experience and you talk through different things like that.

3:23:23.680 --> 3:23:25.320
 That seems to be a really, you know, I know.

3:23:25.320 --> 3:23:30.040
 I need to do that more with basically every substance I take, like if I get what you have

3:23:30.040 --> 3:23:36.080
 been every once in a while known to do a bit of vodka or whiskey or whatever, like do integration

3:23:36.080 --> 3:23:37.080
 the next day.

3:23:37.080 --> 3:23:38.560
 Well, what did you learn?

3:23:38.560 --> 3:23:39.560
 What did you get from that?

3:23:39.560 --> 3:23:40.560
 What did you get?

3:23:40.560 --> 3:23:43.400
 Because you learn a lot, but you sometimes kind of just move on and you celebrate that

3:23:43.400 --> 3:23:46.240
 that happened, but like really kind of think through it.

3:23:46.240 --> 3:23:47.240
 Write it down.

3:23:47.240 --> 3:23:48.240
 Yeah.

3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:50.080
 It's important because that's what this was.

3:23:50.080 --> 3:23:55.200
 So the first night, I'll give like a very cause, trust me, we could spend a whole podcast

3:23:55.200 --> 3:23:58.920
 on both of the, all three of those nights, but the first night, the biggest thing that

3:23:58.920 --> 3:24:04.000
 happened for me is I got to see my daughter, which was my first baby.

3:24:04.000 --> 3:24:08.240
 And so people say, well, you know, blah, blah, blah, fuck you.

3:24:08.240 --> 3:24:09.240
 That was my daughter.

3:24:09.240 --> 3:24:10.240
 And I'm very where it was.

3:24:10.240 --> 3:24:12.880
 I'm very conscious that it was.

3:24:12.880 --> 3:24:19.160
 And at that point, she just eased me in enough to let me know and showed me enough that this

3:24:19.160 --> 3:24:20.600
 wasn't it.

3:24:20.600 --> 3:24:26.760
 This wasn't the end all be all where you are right now on this plane, on this dimension

3:24:26.760 --> 3:24:27.760
 in this life.

3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:34.720
 This is, this is a blip and it is, it is so minuscule to the big picture.

3:24:34.720 --> 3:24:40.280
 And so she really did that by, she showed me just a black and then like a crack.

3:24:40.280 --> 3:24:44.120
 And then these vibrant colors that I can't describe because there aren't words.

3:24:44.120 --> 3:24:49.680
 Alex Gray does really great art and that is like been the closest thing I've been able

3:24:49.680 --> 3:24:51.520
 to find colors.

3:24:51.520 --> 3:24:56.760
 He's a famous guy who does ayahuasca and he's an artist.

3:24:56.760 --> 3:25:04.200
 I think he's got stuff in New York as well, but she just, she eased me in and gave me

3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:10.320
 some relief and showed me enough that I could go, I could wake up the next day and not want

3:25:10.320 --> 3:25:12.960
 to die the next day.

3:25:12.960 --> 3:25:17.200
 And so what Heroic Heart said because it gave us all these journals, they're like, you know,

3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:23.760
 the next day you kind of wake up and you, you do a meet, like a meeting, you do like

3:25:23.760 --> 3:25:28.000
 a circle, all of us sit in a room and talk about what just happened the night before.

3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:32.720
 People are crying and people are quiet and you just listen and that's what you do.

3:25:32.720 --> 3:25:35.120
 And then you write on your free time.

3:25:35.120 --> 3:25:37.360
 So after that, it's like up to you what you want to do.

3:25:37.360 --> 3:25:39.120
 Do you want to just go walk in the woods?

3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:43.440
 Well I chose to go find a fence post and lie on it for an hour.

3:25:43.440 --> 3:25:44.440
 I'm not kidding.

3:25:44.440 --> 3:25:48.200
 I lied there and stared up at these two eagles that were just in like the, I'll tell you

3:25:48.200 --> 3:25:51.000
 where we were after and you'll be like, oh, okay, I get it.

3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:59.520
 And then I found a forest and I just walked up with my book and I just lied there for

3:25:59.520 --> 3:26:01.960
 hours.

3:26:01.960 --> 3:26:05.160
 And then she all of a sudden started giving me what you call your downloads.

3:26:05.160 --> 3:26:09.280
 So the stuff you learn, the stuff that you were, all of a sudden you're remembering and

3:26:09.280 --> 3:26:13.400
 these messages that come through and that's what this is.

3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:17.600
 What kind of things are we talking about?

3:26:17.600 --> 3:26:21.960
 So my biggest thing that she tried to reiterate to me at the beginning of that first night

3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:24.800
 was that I don't breathe.

3:26:24.800 --> 3:26:32.880
 I just, I don't, I don't breathe, I don't fucking breathe at all.

3:26:32.880 --> 3:26:35.640
 I just, one thing to the next thing, the next thing, the next thing, the next thing just

3:26:35.640 --> 3:26:36.640
 to survive.

3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:39.160
 I don't take a minute and breathe.

3:26:39.160 --> 3:26:43.240
 And so she made, when I say she and I say it because it's hard for people to understand,

3:26:43.240 --> 3:26:47.200
 but I showed this to my husband, I showed it to my doctors and they're like, bitch, that's

3:26:47.200 --> 3:26:48.200
 not you.

3:26:48.200 --> 3:26:49.200
 You know, right?

3:26:49.200 --> 3:26:50.200
 Like that.

3:26:50.200 --> 3:26:51.200
 You don't talk like that.

3:26:51.200 --> 3:26:57.600
 So like you can flip through it, but it was like, I'll just give, I'll just let Lex read

3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:01.040
 for a second and just, I'll just do, here, let me do, I'll do an ad for heroic hearts,

3:27:01.040 --> 3:27:02.040
 heroic hearts.

3:27:02.040 --> 3:27:04.840
 Here, I'll get my papers while you read.

3:27:04.840 --> 3:27:07.280
 Connect to her, listen to her, open to her.

3:27:07.280 --> 3:27:08.280
 Do you mind if I read some of these things?

3:27:08.280 --> 3:27:09.280
 You can read some of it.

3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:10.280
 Yep.

3:27:10.280 --> 3:27:11.280
 Go right ahead.

3:27:11.280 --> 3:27:13.480
 The dark has lifted.

3:27:13.480 --> 3:27:16.800
 Judge my spelling and I'll punch you, read the face.

3:27:16.800 --> 3:27:22.600
 Well there's like, it's very sporadically, sporadically written.

3:27:22.600 --> 3:27:24.200
 It's okay to be still.

3:27:24.200 --> 3:27:26.320
 It's okay to be quiet.

3:27:26.320 --> 3:27:32.280
 This is good, like, and these are overstretch of...

3:27:32.280 --> 3:27:36.440
 That was the first couple pages were from the first night.

3:27:36.440 --> 3:27:37.440
 This was just that weekend.

3:27:37.440 --> 3:27:40.640
 And you just, they're laying looking at the eagles.

3:27:40.640 --> 3:27:44.320
 Yeah, with the pen just frantic as well, Lex.

3:27:44.320 --> 3:27:46.240
 Not like writing where you're like, oh, I'm just writing.

3:27:46.240 --> 3:27:52.120
 It's like, I had to get it down or I was going to lose it.

3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:54.480
 You are warrior.

3:27:54.480 --> 3:27:56.280
 You are power.

3:27:56.280 --> 3:28:06.120
 You can choose now, breathe now, be now.

3:28:06.120 --> 3:28:11.400
 Be present, be warrior, be strength, breathe.

3:28:11.400 --> 3:28:12.400
 Be the strength.

3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:15.000
 You are the strength.

3:28:15.000 --> 3:28:17.000
 There's some soul searching going on here.

3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:18.000
 This is incredible.

3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:19.000
 Yeah.

3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:20.000
 We wait till you get through.

3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:21.000
 You get in there.

3:28:21.000 --> 3:28:30.680
 She gets deep, real aggressive, like, crack the door for I am the light, the giver, the

3:28:30.680 --> 3:28:33.920
 taker.

3:28:33.920 --> 3:28:34.920
 I am warrior.

3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:35.920
 I am life.

3:28:35.920 --> 3:28:36.920
 I am air.

3:28:36.920 --> 3:28:37.920
 I am water.

3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:39.400
 I am fire.

3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:44.320
 I am light.

3:28:44.320 --> 3:28:46.400
 This will, this can.

3:28:46.400 --> 3:28:49.720
 This will, this can.

3:28:49.720 --> 3:28:53.800
 For I am warrior.

3:28:53.800 --> 3:28:54.800
 For I am light.

3:28:54.800 --> 3:28:56.320
 And there's a leaf here.

3:28:56.320 --> 3:28:57.880
 What's the story with the leaf?

3:28:57.880 --> 3:28:58.880
 I don't know.

3:28:58.880 --> 3:29:02.120
 I was walking and every single time over the, over those three days, any time I like went

3:29:02.120 --> 3:29:09.760
 for a walk by myself, I would just hear like, take this, like just almost like as if a voice

3:29:09.760 --> 3:29:12.400
 was standing there and be like, you need this, take it, take it with you and keep it in your

3:29:12.400 --> 3:29:13.400
 book.

3:29:13.400 --> 3:29:14.400
 Keep it.

3:29:14.400 --> 3:29:15.400
 Mm hmm.

3:29:15.400 --> 3:29:16.400
 Ground you.

3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:17.400
 And it just goes off.

3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:18.400
 So this is from there.

3:29:18.400 --> 3:29:19.400
 Yeah.

3:29:19.400 --> 3:29:23.160
 It's so cool to have sort of, it's almost like time travel.

3:29:23.160 --> 3:29:28.400
 I have poppies from France too when I did a, I did a 75th anniversary D day ride in France

3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:33.160
 where we rode 600 kilometers on our road bikes for charity and we landed on the beaches of

3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:40.520
 Juneau on the 75th and we got to go buy the poppy fields and I'm like covered in poppies

3:29:40.520 --> 3:29:42.600
 and I have some in a book.

3:29:42.600 --> 3:29:44.080
 I don't know why I do that.

3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:47.120
 I just, I do that.

3:29:47.120 --> 3:29:51.640
 That's cool because like these are your thoughts and those are the physical items as it really

3:29:51.640 --> 3:29:55.160
 helps transport to that place somehow.

3:29:55.160 --> 3:30:01.160
 Let the light in, let her in.

3:30:01.160 --> 3:30:08.840
 And she would show me these visuals so my drawings are just like, yeah, there's drawings

3:30:08.840 --> 3:30:12.200
 here and you're seeing this stuff.

3:30:12.200 --> 3:30:14.700
 Oh yeah.

3:30:14.700 --> 3:30:15.700
 I can't draw either.

3:30:15.700 --> 3:30:20.200
 So that's why there's, so I wish I could draw because if only I could translate what I could

3:30:20.200 --> 3:30:24.560
 see visually on the paper.

3:30:24.560 --> 3:30:26.000
 And you're talking to her.

3:30:26.000 --> 3:30:27.000
 Yeah.

3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:28.200
 It's time.

3:30:28.200 --> 3:30:32.000
 I'm here to listen.

3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:34.200
 Is this Mama Aya?

3:30:34.200 --> 3:30:35.200
 Yeah.

3:30:35.200 --> 3:30:36.200
 We call her Mama Aya.

3:30:36.200 --> 3:30:37.200
 Mama Aya.

3:30:37.200 --> 3:30:38.200
 Mama Aya.

3:30:38.200 --> 3:30:41.040
 So who, who are you seeing?

3:30:41.040 --> 3:30:42.360
 Is this a woman?

3:30:42.360 --> 3:30:48.080
 So for me at first, it was just eyes floating in the sky, these unbelievably gorgeous beautiful

3:30:48.080 --> 3:30:52.320
 eyes that I, and I was like literally looking up at the top of the year and I kept going

3:30:52.320 --> 3:30:54.960
 to myself, is anyone else seeing this?

3:30:54.960 --> 3:30:56.600
 There's eyes in the sky.

3:30:56.600 --> 3:30:57.600
 May.

3:30:57.600 --> 3:30:58.600
 Yeah.

3:30:58.600 --> 3:30:59.600
 Yeah.

3:30:59.600 --> 3:31:04.680
 And so there's these eyes floating and they just kept looking at me and I remember when

3:31:04.680 --> 3:31:09.480
 I kept telling myself like, oh, don't worry about nothing there, should we get angry?

3:31:09.480 --> 3:31:17.600
 I'm right here, pay attention to me and I'd be like, okay, like forceful, like very forceful.

3:31:17.600 --> 3:31:20.440
 So at first it was just the eyes.

3:31:20.440 --> 3:31:26.480
 The second night is I'm crazy when I say this.

3:31:26.480 --> 3:31:27.480
 Great.

3:31:27.480 --> 3:31:32.120
 That's going to be my clip.

3:31:32.120 --> 3:31:33.120
 Ain't they all crazy?

3:31:33.120 --> 3:31:35.200
 It's what I do when I get uncomfortable.

3:31:35.200 --> 3:31:37.840
 I do weird hand gestures and movements.

3:31:37.840 --> 3:31:40.080
 I like voices, I like it.

3:31:40.080 --> 3:31:41.080
 Yeah, I do.

3:31:41.080 --> 3:31:42.080
 Yeah.

3:31:42.080 --> 3:31:48.120
 You would hate to be in my office because most of the day it's just this weird lunges

3:31:48.120 --> 3:31:50.440
 and uncomfortable moments.

3:31:50.440 --> 3:31:54.680
 She turned me into a wolf.

3:31:54.680 --> 3:32:01.360
 I know I said it out loud, I hear it, I said it, head to toe.

3:32:01.360 --> 3:32:06.720
 And her takeaway for me was I'm trying to be this pack leader.

3:32:06.720 --> 3:32:08.320
 I'm trying to be this leader in my life.

3:32:08.320 --> 3:32:13.840
 I'm trying to do these things, but I'm going about them the whole wrong way.

3:32:13.840 --> 3:32:18.120
 So like when the shamans call you up to do their special prayer over you, you go up,

3:32:18.120 --> 3:32:19.120
 you don't touch them.

3:32:19.120 --> 3:32:20.120
 They flash their little light.

3:32:20.120 --> 3:32:24.080
 You see the little light spot, you walk to the light, you sit down on the light.

3:32:24.080 --> 3:32:27.840
 And then my shaman, he's so funny because he's got this great tone in his voice.

3:32:27.840 --> 3:32:31.400
 He goes, how are you doing, Kelsey?

3:32:31.400 --> 3:32:36.560
 And I'm like, so, hi, yeah, I have a problem.

3:32:36.560 --> 3:32:39.600
 I'm a wolf and I need it to stop.

3:32:39.600 --> 3:32:42.680
 And he'd be like, don't you worry, girl, I got you, you ready?

3:32:42.680 --> 3:32:44.840
 And I was like, uh huh, uh huh.

3:32:44.840 --> 3:32:48.440
 So I'm sitting there cross like I've got my palms out like this.

3:32:48.440 --> 3:32:50.280
 And I had a really traumatic shoulder injury.

3:32:50.280 --> 3:32:51.880
 So I don't just sit slanted like this.

3:32:51.880 --> 3:32:55.000
 My shoulders actually permanently detached and no one in the world will touch it or

3:32:55.000 --> 3:32:56.000
 fix it.

3:32:56.000 --> 3:32:58.480
 My collar bone comes out my back here.

3:32:58.480 --> 3:33:01.000
 And I don't have any collar bone here.

3:33:01.000 --> 3:33:02.560
 So nobody will fix it.

3:33:02.560 --> 3:33:03.920
 No one will touch it.

3:33:03.920 --> 3:33:06.880
 And I've had specialists, I've had surgeries, no one will do anything with it.

3:33:06.880 --> 3:33:09.680
 So I'm permanently down and forward.

3:33:09.680 --> 3:33:11.680
 So I slouch.

3:33:11.680 --> 3:33:14.960
 It's horrible.

3:33:14.960 --> 3:33:15.960
 So before I...

3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:16.960
 Horrible functionally too?

3:33:16.960 --> 3:33:17.960
 Oh, there's nothing.

3:33:17.960 --> 3:33:18.960
 I can't do a pull up anymore.

3:33:18.960 --> 3:33:19.960
 Oh, so weak.

3:33:19.960 --> 3:33:20.960
 Oh, wow.

3:33:20.960 --> 3:33:26.480
 Oh, you should, I'll show you how to do a pushup after you'll fucking throw up an embarrassment.

3:33:26.480 --> 3:33:27.720
 Yeah, it's bad.

3:33:27.720 --> 3:33:32.160
 So before I, though, chronic pain like had to drink a bottle of CBD every day just to

3:33:32.160 --> 3:33:35.360
 the pain is so bad because the trauma in it was so bad.

3:33:35.360 --> 3:33:38.040
 The surgery went wrong.

3:33:38.040 --> 3:33:40.760
 The collar bone dissipated and no longer exists.

3:33:40.760 --> 3:33:44.720
 Like there's just, and they're not sure how I lift things with it and do stuff with it.

3:33:44.720 --> 3:33:46.920
 It's like overcompensation everywhere.

3:33:46.920 --> 3:33:54.840
 Like my, my back, like my scapula like flares out where it's, I'm all messed up from it.

3:33:54.840 --> 3:33:56.440
 And so I was in chronic pain.

3:33:56.440 --> 3:33:58.360
 So he's praying over me.

3:33:58.360 --> 3:34:04.720
 And all of a sudden, all I feel is this arm just start just fucking vibrating and my hair

3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:05.920
 is really long.

3:34:05.920 --> 3:34:12.160
 And I feel somebody grab the back of my ponytail and snap my head back like this.

3:34:12.160 --> 3:34:18.960
 And it felt like something was coming out of my throat, like being pulled out of me.

3:34:18.960 --> 3:34:22.200
 And the takeaway that I ended up in the whole the rest of the night, there was a million

3:34:22.200 --> 3:34:23.200
 other things.

3:34:23.200 --> 3:34:30.160
 And the takeaway was you no longer need to bite.

3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:32.560
 You may only show your teeth.

3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:35.280
 You can be the leader that you want to be.

3:34:35.280 --> 3:34:39.440
 You do not always have to be the traditional type of leader.

3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:41.120
 You can be in the back of the pack.

3:34:41.120 --> 3:34:46.880
 You have to watch the rest around you, be, be mindful of those around you instead of

3:34:46.880 --> 3:34:50.600
 just being upfront, be, be behind as well.

3:34:50.600 --> 3:34:55.080
 Make sure that everything that you're doing is all being looked after because my thing

3:34:55.080 --> 3:34:59.760
 was I will rip your fucking head off if you just say the wrong thing to me before.

3:34:59.760 --> 3:35:03.880
 The whole thing was you can just show your teeth and that is more than enough.

3:35:03.880 --> 3:35:07.160
 Stop trying to be, stop trying to overcompensate.

3:35:07.160 --> 3:35:09.400
 You don't need to do that any longer.

3:35:09.400 --> 3:35:15.920
 And then I had this weird astral projection thing happen, like where I was in my house

3:35:15.920 --> 3:35:22.560
 and there were these flyers all over my husband and my son and like I went ham on them.

3:35:22.560 --> 3:35:24.680
 I like shredded them to pieces.

3:35:24.680 --> 3:35:31.320
 Like I was this protector and it's crazy because the guys told me after like someone

3:35:31.320 --> 3:35:35.160
 would be like, there were flyers all over you the whole night.

3:35:35.160 --> 3:35:36.160
 They were just all over you.

3:35:36.160 --> 3:35:38.840
 And I'm like, I was snarling when I was sitting there.

3:35:38.840 --> 3:35:43.960
 Like the shaman had to be like, I need you to try to calm your breathing after I could.

3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:50.240
 But before like I was like attacking things beside me that people could see and I could

3:35:50.240 --> 3:35:53.560
 see but couldn't wrap my brain around that they were real.

3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:55.200
 Like it was weird.

3:35:55.200 --> 3:35:58.440
 It was crazy, man.

3:35:58.440 --> 3:35:59.440
 That's day two.

3:35:59.440 --> 3:36:01.320
 That's day two.

3:36:01.320 --> 3:36:03.800
 So what's the big takeaway there?

3:36:03.800 --> 3:36:11.520
 My takeaway was I needed to be, I needed to stop trying to stop trying to push everything

3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:14.600
 too hard, stop trying to force everything.

3:36:14.600 --> 3:36:15.720
 It's all going to come.

3:36:15.720 --> 3:36:24.880
 It's all going to happen but you are too aggressive, you're trying so hard that you're missing

3:36:24.880 --> 3:36:25.880
 everything else.

3:36:25.880 --> 3:36:26.880
 Got it.

3:36:26.880 --> 3:36:30.480
 That's just how to be a better human kind of thing.

3:36:30.480 --> 3:36:32.840
 Right.

3:36:32.840 --> 3:36:34.840
 This is getting intense.

3:36:34.840 --> 3:36:35.840
 I like it.

3:36:35.840 --> 3:36:36.840
 Yeah, it gets aggressive.

3:36:36.840 --> 3:36:39.800
 Yeah, it gets aggressive.

3:36:39.800 --> 3:36:42.560
 I mean there's love and light still.

3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:43.560
 It gets them.

3:36:43.560 --> 3:36:48.720
 Love and light, love and light, the warrior within is calm.

3:36:48.720 --> 3:36:52.160
 She will test you daily, show her respect.

3:36:52.160 --> 3:36:53.160
 So that's what I mean.

3:36:53.160 --> 3:36:54.160
 You've read my book.

3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:55.160
 You know I don't write like that.

3:36:55.160 --> 3:36:56.160
 Yeah.

3:36:56.160 --> 3:36:57.160
 This is strange.

3:36:57.160 --> 3:36:58.160
 See?

3:36:58.160 --> 3:36:59.160
 Good.

3:36:59.160 --> 3:37:00.160
 You get it.

3:37:00.160 --> 3:37:04.680
 Because people don't understand when I say I didn't, I don't feel like I wrote that.

3:37:04.680 --> 3:37:10.280
 I feel like she gave me, I reread this all of the time.

3:37:10.280 --> 3:37:15.680
 So I wonder, I mean, well not obviously but this is somehow part of you.

3:37:15.680 --> 3:37:18.920
 I think it's a part of me obviously because.

3:37:18.920 --> 3:37:22.960
 Reconnecting you somehow to that part, it kind of is incredible to think of what are

3:37:22.960 --> 3:37:26.680
 the things that are part of us that we haven't really explored, you know.

3:37:26.680 --> 3:37:28.920
 And there's so many.

3:37:28.920 --> 3:37:29.920
 We just get in the talk.

3:37:29.920 --> 3:37:36.920
 There to connect to her, feel her flow through them, use them for the strength for each day

3:37:36.920 --> 3:37:40.560
 and you challenge will present itself.

3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:41.560
 Love, light, breathe.

3:37:41.560 --> 3:37:45.120
 Sorry, I have too much hair.

3:37:45.120 --> 3:37:46.120
 Never enough.

3:37:46.120 --> 3:37:47.120
 I used to have long hair.

3:37:47.120 --> 3:37:48.480
 What about day three?

3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:52.640
 So day three is the, the stuff I talked about on Jocko.

3:37:52.640 --> 3:37:57.240
 When I got taken over to the other side, I almost missed that night too.

3:37:57.240 --> 3:37:59.160
 I almost missed that ceremony.

3:37:59.160 --> 3:38:04.920
 I got a false positive on my COVID test and I got a call from the medical clinic that

3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:07.920
 night being like, you need to come in.

3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:13.080
 You got a false positive on your COVID test and if you're going to travel, you have to,

3:38:13.080 --> 3:38:14.080
 we got to figure this out.

3:38:14.080 --> 3:38:15.080
 You got to come do blood work.

3:38:15.080 --> 3:38:19.320
 You got to come do, you know, whatever it is you need to do if you want to get home,

3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:21.280
 but you got to come do something.

3:38:21.280 --> 3:38:24.920
 And so I didn't think I was going to be in ceremony.

3:38:24.920 --> 3:38:25.920
 I had to leave.

3:38:25.920 --> 3:38:35.680
 So I left and, you know, they waited, they waited for me.

3:38:35.680 --> 3:38:43.520
 And so I think the biggest takeaway from all of this for me was this isn't it.

3:38:43.520 --> 3:38:45.280
 This isn't everything.

3:38:45.280 --> 3:38:49.500
 This isn't the end all be all.

3:38:49.500 --> 3:38:50.960
 You can fight through this.

3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:52.480
 This is possible.

3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:53.480
 It's going to take work.

3:38:53.480 --> 3:38:55.480
 It's going to be fucking hard.

3:38:55.480 --> 3:38:56.480
 It's worth it though.

3:38:56.480 --> 3:39:01.640
 And if you just keep going in the right direction, everything that I wrote down, everything, every

3:39:01.640 --> 3:39:05.000
 goal, it'll happen.

3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:07.000
 What about love?

3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:09.520
 What about love?

3:39:09.520 --> 3:39:15.960
 Tell me about your husband, Kelsey, what role did he play in your life?

3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:17.460
 The most pivotal role.

3:39:17.460 --> 3:39:22.920
 He kept me alive and made me feel worthy enough to, until I knew that I was worthy enough

3:39:22.920 --> 3:39:25.160
 to be alive.

3:39:25.160 --> 3:39:31.040
 Can you dissect that a little bit like what role does love play in the human condition?

3:39:31.040 --> 3:39:36.400
 I think love is the only reason that we haven't destroyed ourselves.

3:39:36.400 --> 3:39:39.080
 I mean, we humans in general.

3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:40.080
 Yes.

3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:46.280
 I think there is a subset of people where love will always be, you know, love conquers

3:39:46.280 --> 3:39:49.720
 all, you know, but that's not always the reality.

3:39:49.720 --> 3:39:54.680
 The reality is life is messy and humans are messy.

3:39:54.680 --> 3:39:59.320
 And the way we choose to deal with things are messy and complicated and difficult, but

3:39:59.320 --> 3:40:02.760
 at the root of all good is love, I think.

3:40:02.760 --> 3:40:11.240
 And for me, I was fortunate enough to meet my husband through a friend, which you listened

3:40:11.240 --> 3:40:12.240
 to that podcast.

3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:16.640
 So I don't know that we need to, unless you really want to go into that story again, how

3:40:16.640 --> 3:40:17.640
 I met my husband.

3:40:17.640 --> 3:40:21.920
 Well, the only part of that story I like, if people should just go listen to the Jocko

3:40:21.920 --> 3:40:24.800
 podcast is how you made him uncomfortable, I love it.

3:40:24.800 --> 3:40:25.800
 Okay.

3:40:25.800 --> 3:40:26.800
 So how it works, let me explain.

3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:29.440
 In the supercross and motocross industry, it's really small.

3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:32.200
 The people who are professional, it's a small subset of people.

3:40:32.200 --> 3:40:35.040
 It's kind of like Formula One, 21 cars.

3:40:35.040 --> 3:40:36.040
 That's what there is.

3:40:36.040 --> 3:40:37.040
 That's the amount of riders.

3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:40.240
 And we should say your husband is a motocross guy.

3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:44.680
 My husband was a professional supercross and motocross racer for his whole life.

3:40:44.680 --> 3:40:48.600
 And he raced for Kawasaki in Suzuki.

3:40:48.600 --> 3:40:51.320
 He lived in California and raced all down there.

3:40:51.320 --> 3:40:54.320
 And when I met him, I met him at the tail end of his career.

3:40:54.320 --> 3:41:00.900
 And so I went to Montreal with a friend of mine to see somebody that I was currently

3:41:00.900 --> 3:41:08.520
 sleeping with, who was a friend of mine and end up meeting Brady instead.

3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:09.520
 Yeah.

3:41:09.520 --> 3:41:13.880
 And the funny moment in Jocko's podcast was saying that I was fucking him instead of just

3:41:13.880 --> 3:41:14.960
 sleeping with him.

3:41:14.960 --> 3:41:18.720
 And then Jocko's face exploded and Jocko was like, Oh, sleeping.

3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:23.080
 So like he was, he was trying to get details of the sleeping quarters that you're, he's

3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:26.320
 trying to get you to define as a good interview would, Oh, sleeping.

3:41:26.320 --> 3:41:27.320
 Okay.

3:41:27.320 --> 3:41:32.160
 And then you were like, it's fucking Jocko or something like that.

3:41:32.160 --> 3:41:33.160
 It was great.

3:41:33.160 --> 3:41:37.560
 But that's true because in that industry, it's like we, it's small.

3:41:37.560 --> 3:41:41.640
 We all share, trust me, this is what it is.

3:41:41.640 --> 3:41:45.280
 And it was, so I met him there and he had broken his wrist really, really bad.

3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:48.720
 And I was, this was before I deployed.

3:41:48.720 --> 3:41:54.280
 So I met him and I, we stayed in touch and just became friends and just texted.

3:41:54.280 --> 3:41:55.280
 That was it.

3:41:55.280 --> 3:41:56.280
 Nothing weird.

3:41:56.280 --> 3:41:57.680
 And I was deploying though.

3:41:57.680 --> 3:42:00.200
 So we disagreed, you know, we'd be friends.

3:42:00.200 --> 3:42:04.120
 We weren't actually talking about anything romantically at all.

3:42:04.120 --> 3:42:09.400
 And then I deployed and we got talking and to know each other a little more, a little

3:42:09.400 --> 3:42:10.400
 more.

3:42:10.400 --> 3:42:14.200
 And then we decided that we liked each other and we wanted to try to give it at least a

3:42:14.200 --> 3:42:15.480
 semi shot.

3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:21.720
 And so when I got home from Afghanistan, I went and watched him race his last, one of

3:42:21.720 --> 3:42:27.320
 his last two races that he did professionally before he retired, excuse me.

3:42:27.320 --> 3:42:34.520
 And it was a Montreal one was in Vegas and I hadn't seen him and he didn't really know

3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:35.520
 me.

3:42:35.520 --> 3:42:36.520
 We didn't really know each other.

3:42:36.520 --> 3:42:37.520
 We, you know, we met.

3:42:37.520 --> 3:42:41.760
 I slept in the bed beside him because my girlfriend didn't want to get in trouble from her boyfriend

3:42:41.760 --> 3:42:45.120
 from sleeping beside a random dude.

3:42:45.120 --> 3:42:53.120
 And then, um, yeah, we just, we, we started dating and he really slowly became my rock

3:42:53.120 --> 3:42:55.480
 and he understands trauma.

3:42:55.480 --> 3:43:00.640
 He had some stuff happen in his life and his family that he went through a lot of therapy.

3:43:00.640 --> 3:43:01.680
 He went through a lot of shit.

3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:07.240
 He went, he saw what traumatic situations can do to a family and to people and those

3:43:07.240 --> 3:43:09.440
 that are suffering with it.

3:43:09.440 --> 3:43:15.440
 And so he was well equipped to handle me, um, thankfully.

3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:18.360
 And it got to a point where we were doing the long distance back and forth, back and

3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:19.360
 forth and back and forth.

3:43:19.360 --> 3:43:22.800
 And I finally got the call that I was going to be released from the military.

3:43:22.800 --> 3:43:26.320
 And I wanted to live near him, but I couldn't afford to live in British Columbia because

3:43:26.320 --> 3:43:31.160
 I was from Ontario and BC is like, it means bring cash for a reason.

3:43:31.160 --> 3:43:32.440
 I'm like, no, I can live there.

3:43:32.440 --> 3:43:35.160
 And then his family was like, come live with us.

3:43:35.160 --> 3:43:39.000
 Like they had a big enough, they had a big enough house.

3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:40.520
 Maybe it was fine.

3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:42.440
 So I was like, okay.

3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:48.280
 And so I went from like dating this guy long distance to over, you know, from 2009 to 2011

3:43:48.280 --> 3:43:50.880
 just back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

3:43:50.880 --> 3:43:53.360
 And then finally his parents were like, shit, or get off the pot here with her.

3:43:53.360 --> 3:43:54.520
 Like, come on.

3:43:54.520 --> 3:43:56.600
 You know, it's obvious she loves you.

3:43:56.600 --> 3:43:58.280
 And I would never say it.

3:43:58.280 --> 3:44:01.080
 That word just as a love, like it was just like,

3:44:01.080 --> 3:44:04.040
 You guys didn't say, uh, for a long time.

3:44:04.040 --> 3:44:05.040
 For a long time.

3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:07.760
 Because I was dead inside.

3:44:07.760 --> 3:44:08.760
 I didn't know what that meant.

3:44:08.760 --> 3:44:09.760
 Because I did.

3:44:09.760 --> 3:44:10.760
 I couldn't feel.

3:44:10.760 --> 3:44:11.760
 I didn't feel anything.

3:44:11.760 --> 3:44:15.120
 He loved it because he like, we, we go, we go do something.

3:44:15.120 --> 3:44:17.440
 You would never complain about anything.

3:44:17.440 --> 3:44:19.760
 You wouldn't say a fucking word.

3:44:19.760 --> 3:44:25.040
 You just sit there and now you got all your feelies back and your emotions back and now

3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:27.160
 you're too hot and you're too cold.

3:44:27.160 --> 3:44:28.160
 Yeah.

3:44:28.160 --> 3:44:29.520
 Anyway, so yeah, he loved it.

3:44:29.520 --> 3:44:32.280
 I was numb and dead inside seriously when we, when I call him back.

3:44:32.280 --> 3:44:34.120
 But you, were you still able to have fun together?

3:44:34.120 --> 3:44:35.120
 That kind of thing?

3:44:35.120 --> 3:44:39.680
 Like when you say there's no emotion, there's more emotion around the basics of like everyday

3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:43.920
 life, but you're still able to just like enjoy shit together or is it?

3:44:43.920 --> 3:44:49.000
 I was enjoying stuff, but I wasn't feeling, feeling.

3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:50.480
 I was like, this is fun.

3:44:50.480 --> 3:44:51.480
 Yeah.

3:44:51.480 --> 3:44:52.480
 Right.

3:44:52.480 --> 3:44:53.480
 That was it.

3:44:53.480 --> 3:44:54.480
 That was surface level.

3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:56.480
 Like Lex, this is fun.

3:44:56.480 --> 3:44:57.480
 It wasn't.

3:44:57.480 --> 3:44:59.000
 Oh, there's nothing there.

3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:00.000
 Yeah.

3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:01.000
 No, there's nothing there.

3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:02.000
 Hey.

3:45:02.000 --> 3:45:03.000
 Yeah.

3:45:03.000 --> 3:45:04.000
 Nothing.

3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:09.000
 And then I lived with his parents and we, we lived there and that was, you know, God damn

3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:10.000
 it.

3:45:10.000 --> 3:45:12.000
 His family was so good to me because I was a nightmare.

3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:16.600
 I was a nightmare, couldn't cook certain food around me anymore, couldn't, couldn't

3:45:16.600 --> 3:45:21.200
 go certain places with me anymore, couldn't, you know, crowds were in hard, no, we didn't

3:45:21.200 --> 3:45:22.200
 do Canada today.

3:45:22.200 --> 3:45:23.360
 And I'm like, I just changed.

3:45:23.360 --> 3:45:27.880
 I, I moved in and was like, shit's got to change if you guys don't want me to kill

3:45:27.880 --> 3:45:28.880
 everyone.

3:45:28.880 --> 3:45:33.960
 Like, and they were willing and they were accepting and they were amazing about it.

3:45:33.960 --> 3:45:37.800
 And then we finally said, okay, well, like, is this, was this, we're good.

3:45:37.800 --> 3:45:44.320
 We're like, I, I said, I used to say like, I L you, like, I couldn't say love.

3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:46.680
 It freaked me out for a long time.

3:45:46.680 --> 3:45:50.840
 And then I finally said it and then that shithead said it like a month later and I was like,

3:45:50.840 --> 3:45:51.840
 that's not fair.

3:45:51.840 --> 3:45:52.840
 You should have said at the same exact time.

3:45:52.840 --> 3:45:53.840
 I wanted the response.

3:45:53.840 --> 3:45:54.840
 Yeah.

3:45:54.840 --> 3:46:00.600
 And he goes to treatment with me, he, whatever I need, he knows that like, hey, it's more

3:46:00.600 --> 3:46:03.200
 for like him and like, how do I handle her?

3:46:03.200 --> 3:46:04.200
 Yeah.

3:46:04.200 --> 3:46:07.920
 And then we moved out and we bought a house and then he took a sweet ass time.

3:46:07.920 --> 3:46:12.720
 We were dating for four years before we were engaged because just to be sure the crazy

3:46:12.720 --> 3:46:14.240
 wasn't too crazy.

3:46:14.240 --> 3:46:15.480
 He waited four years on that.

3:46:15.480 --> 3:46:16.480
 A smart man.

3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:17.480
 Right?

3:46:17.480 --> 3:46:18.480
 Yeah.

3:46:18.480 --> 3:46:20.760
 Or you could, you could say he's just a terrified of commitment, but both.

3:46:20.760 --> 3:46:21.760
 A little bit of both.

3:46:21.760 --> 3:46:26.320
 Hey, when you were the guy on the posters that all the girls sign up to that send all the

3:46:26.320 --> 3:46:28.320
 dirty pictures, why are you giving that up?

3:46:28.320 --> 3:46:29.320
 It's easy.

3:46:29.320 --> 3:46:30.320
 Yeah.

3:46:30.320 --> 3:46:32.320
 Commitment is a real commitment then.

3:46:32.320 --> 3:46:33.320
 Yeah.

3:46:33.320 --> 3:46:34.320
 Okay.

3:46:34.320 --> 3:46:37.800
 This is the jacquery set.

3:46:37.800 --> 3:46:40.400
 We talked about Brass and Unity a little bit.

3:46:40.400 --> 3:46:46.400
 What's the longterm mission goal and dream of your company and the podcast of the same

3:46:46.400 --> 3:46:47.720
 name?

3:46:47.720 --> 3:46:54.640
 So for me, what I've been trying to do with this company is create a community that can

3:46:54.640 --> 3:46:59.680
 really work together to not only help vets first responders, but to really bridge the

3:46:59.680 --> 3:47:04.360
 gap with the civilian population and letting them know what we go through and why it is

3:47:04.360 --> 3:47:10.320
 such an epidemic and why there is over 22 suicides a day and we are losing people.

3:47:10.320 --> 3:47:11.680
 Like it's going out of style.

3:47:11.680 --> 3:47:18.800
 The amount of vets that are questioning the last 20 years of their life right now is terrifying.

3:47:18.800 --> 3:47:22.400
 I work with organizations that are doing this outreach and they're overloaded right now

3:47:22.400 --> 3:47:28.320
 like they have never seen before because this whole thing is just, it's hit ahead here.

3:47:28.320 --> 3:47:33.080
 So what Brass and Unity tries to do is it is really just a vehicle to get the money

3:47:33.080 --> 3:47:35.520
 in the hands of the people that are doing the work with it.

3:47:35.520 --> 3:47:38.680
 I couldn't start a nonprofit because I'm not good at fundraising.

3:47:38.680 --> 3:47:42.920
 I'm not good at being like, give me your money, I'm going to do this with it.

3:47:42.920 --> 3:47:47.280
 The least I could do was come up with a product that I know I could give to people or people

3:47:47.280 --> 3:47:54.400
 could purchase and if I gave pretty much all of the profit, like the actual profit from

3:47:54.400 --> 3:48:01.160
 it to those organizations and I give them something to wear that is a touch piece or

3:48:01.160 --> 3:48:04.960
 if they're out and somebody sees a bullet on the wrist to go, hey, what is that?

3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:10.920
 It's a conversation starter and that's exactly what it's been and it's done its job is that.

3:48:10.920 --> 3:48:14.560
 And so we, like I said, we are a way to get the vehicle, we're the vehicle, we're the

3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:15.920
 money in the hands of the people.

3:48:15.920 --> 3:48:18.520
 People don't always want to just get a tax receipt.

3:48:18.520 --> 3:48:23.000
 It's great to donate to something, great on you to do that, but most people have a selfish

3:48:23.000 --> 3:48:24.000
 aspect.

3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:25.000
 And that's okay.

3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:29.800
 But if you can tap into that, you can then fund these charities properly and give them

3:48:29.800 --> 3:48:32.240
 the tools to do their jobs effectively.

3:48:32.240 --> 3:48:36.320
 Up until this point, they just count on people's goodness of their hearts.

3:48:36.320 --> 3:48:37.720
 Hate to break it to you.

3:48:37.720 --> 3:48:38.920
 Humanity is rough right now.

3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:40.960
 We need to look at something a little differently.

3:48:40.960 --> 3:48:46.200
 So did these things spark, like a Julie's sparks conversations and then do you work

3:48:46.200 --> 3:48:47.200
 with charities?

3:48:47.200 --> 3:48:48.200
 Yes.

3:48:48.200 --> 3:48:49.200
 Oh God, yeah.

3:48:49.200 --> 3:48:50.200
 That's what I do.

3:48:50.200 --> 3:48:56.280
 I get up, I push jewelry and sunglasses on people and say, but now that you're going

3:48:56.280 --> 3:48:59.160
 to wear that, now you're a part of the being you are me.

3:48:59.160 --> 3:49:00.480
 Now you're a part of this community.

3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:05.240
 This is speaking of which, let me put it right back on.

3:49:05.240 --> 3:49:08.120
 Branded, this is a organic product placement.

3:49:08.120 --> 3:49:09.120
 Yeah.

3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:12.080
 This isn't like marketing at all or nothing weird about this at all.

3:49:12.080 --> 3:49:16.080
 And so we work with a lot of organizations and I'm very particular about where we send

3:49:16.080 --> 3:49:21.840
 our money because there are, it feels like thousands of vet organizations right now.

3:49:21.840 --> 3:49:25.080
 And if we were able to consolidate, it would be more ideal.

3:49:25.080 --> 3:49:28.120
 I spoke about that on another show, but that's not currently happening.

3:49:28.120 --> 3:49:29.920
 So I try to work with the nonprofits.

3:49:29.920 --> 3:49:36.200
 I know number one are not paying six figure salaries, which trust me there's lots, a lot.

3:49:36.200 --> 3:49:39.880
 Number two, I look at the actual resources that they're providing and if they're going

3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:43.400
 to be something that are going to be useful in my opinion, whether or not they're actually

3:49:43.400 --> 3:49:46.400
 useful and I just don't think they are, that's up for debate.

3:49:46.400 --> 3:49:47.600
 I know it's worked for me.

3:49:47.600 --> 3:49:51.800
 So I try to fund the things that I know have been helpful for me and the people I associate

3:49:51.800 --> 3:49:52.800
 with.

3:49:52.800 --> 3:49:57.880
 So that's why I brought all the paper because I didn't want to be an idiot and forget anybody

3:49:57.880 --> 3:50:01.160
 that's really important because I get caught up in things and I think it's important to

3:50:01.160 --> 3:50:02.160
 acknowledge.

3:50:02.160 --> 3:50:05.280
 So number one, heroic hearts.

3:50:05.280 --> 3:50:10.480
 We just started working to talk about them and really make them known, but we're going

3:50:10.480 --> 3:50:12.320
 to be donating to them as well.

3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:15.040
 Are they doing more stuff than the ayahuasca thing?

3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:16.040
 Yeah.

3:50:16.040 --> 3:50:19.320
 So their points are, I got Jesse to actually, I'm like, what are your talking points because

3:50:19.320 --> 3:50:21.880
 I need people to know exactly what you do.

3:50:21.880 --> 3:50:25.160
 So veterans have had to take their mental and general health into their own hands due

3:50:25.160 --> 3:50:27.160
 to the failure of the government system.

3:50:27.160 --> 3:50:31.540
 So that is why they were created, but heroic hearts is a peer supported mental health network

3:50:31.540 --> 3:50:36.040
 involving full preparation, integration, coaching and connection to vetted psychedelic

3:50:36.040 --> 3:50:37.040
 treatments.

3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:38.580
 So they don't just do aya.

3:50:38.580 --> 3:50:44.000
 They deal with psilocybin, ketamine, Ibogaine, but they've got protocols in place.

3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:48.160
 They've got locations you go to that are safely vetted and they work.

3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:53.800
 They've got over right now, Jesse said they have 800 veterans on a waiting list for treatment.

3:50:53.800 --> 3:50:57.960
 That's just before the spike of the end of this war.

3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:02.680
 They have over 100, they've helped over 100 veterans, including dozens of special operation

3:51:02.680 --> 3:51:04.960
 vets find effective care.

3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:09.400
 They've now got branches in the US, UK and Canada, and the biggest thing about them and

3:51:09.400 --> 3:51:14.800
 why we talk about them is because the problem of psychedelics and the stigma around it is

3:51:14.800 --> 3:51:19.120
 so significant, but because of great universities that are now stepping up and doing the research

3:51:19.120 --> 3:51:21.400
 behind it, it is being legitimized.

3:51:21.400 --> 3:51:25.800
 So like they're doing that in Canada, there's a group called Therasil.

3:51:25.800 --> 3:51:29.840
 They are currently fighting the government to get the rights for Canadians under section

3:51:29.840 --> 3:51:34.960
 156 of our laws to get compassionate care for psilocybin use.

3:51:34.960 --> 3:51:40.520
 I've done a panel with them on that really great base set of Victoria, really smart people.

3:51:40.520 --> 3:51:44.240
 One of the other bigger charities that we work with, and they're honestly, they were

3:51:44.240 --> 3:51:48.480
 my first and foremost charity that I ever worked with, and they're a big component in

3:51:48.480 --> 3:51:51.040
 the veteran community in Canada.

3:51:51.040 --> 3:51:57.680
 They're called Honor House, and Honor House was started by honorary colonel Aldi Genova.

3:51:57.680 --> 3:52:00.120
 It was started because of a guy named Trevor Green.

3:52:00.120 --> 3:52:06.240
 He was a Canadian soldier who deployed, and he was, so Captain Trevor Green, sorry, Trevor,

3:52:06.240 --> 3:52:11.400
 Captain Trevor Green, he got an axe in the middle of his head, a Taliban member came

3:52:11.400 --> 3:52:16.240
 up and put an axe directly into his head when his helmet was off, and he survived.

3:52:16.240 --> 3:52:19.420
 He's done work with Invictus Games in Prince Harry.

3:52:19.420 --> 3:52:22.160
 He has an exoskeleton he uses on the island.

3:52:22.160 --> 3:52:23.360
 He's so cool.

3:52:23.360 --> 3:52:30.760
 He hasn't changed one bit from the infantry captain you expect him to be, and Al saw there

3:52:30.760 --> 3:52:36.040
 was a need for vets and first responders to get treatment because there's no real home

3:52:36.040 --> 3:52:37.760
 away from home for people.

3:52:37.760 --> 3:52:43.600
 Picture Ronald McDonald for cancer and families, this is vets and first responders.

3:52:43.600 --> 3:52:46.240
 Their whole thing, and I'll read it so I say it exactly right, because I used to be on the

3:52:46.240 --> 3:52:51.160
 board of their charity, but I ran out of time, so now I just consult.

3:52:51.160 --> 3:52:55.400
 They are a home away from home for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, veterans and

3:52:55.400 --> 3:53:00.440
 first responders, and their families to stay completely free of charge while they're receiving

3:53:00.440 --> 3:53:03.640
 medical care and treatment in the Vancouver area.

3:53:03.640 --> 3:53:08.080
 But since then, they've expanded since I've come on board, and they've opened on a ranch,

3:53:08.080 --> 3:53:14.000
 which is up in Ashcroft, BC, and it's 140 acres, 10 cabins, and a main cabin.

3:53:14.000 --> 3:53:19.480
 They do equine therapy, and they're more focused on operational stress injury clinics, sorry,

3:53:19.480 --> 3:53:22.320
 operational stress injury within the veteran community.

3:53:22.320 --> 3:53:24.200
 And they have specialists that do that.

3:53:24.200 --> 3:53:28.640
 They have their own bracelet with us, so every time you buy an honor house bracelet, all

3:53:28.640 --> 3:53:31.680
 the proceeds go to them.

3:53:31.680 --> 3:53:34.640
 And it's actually the green one, so that one.

3:53:34.640 --> 3:53:39.640
 So when you buy one of those honor house bracelets, they have those, they go directly to them,

3:53:39.640 --> 3:53:41.200
 which is really amazing.

3:53:41.200 --> 3:53:44.560
 They've been near and dear to my heart for a long time.

3:53:44.560 --> 3:53:49.080
 You've got the All Secure Foundation, which is, these guys are super dope.

3:53:49.080 --> 3:53:50.880
 I'm going to read exactly because Jen texts me.

3:53:50.880 --> 3:53:54.840
 So Jen and Tom Satterley, I've had them both on the podcast.

3:53:54.840 --> 3:53:58.040
 Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.

3:53:58.040 --> 3:53:59.040
 Tom is a Delta.

3:53:59.040 --> 3:54:00.040
 Have you heard of them?

3:54:00.040 --> 3:54:01.040
 No.

3:54:01.040 --> 3:54:02.040
 No.

3:54:02.040 --> 3:54:03.040
 No.

3:54:03.040 --> 3:54:04.040
 No.

3:54:04.040 --> 3:54:05.040
 So, okay.

3:54:05.040 --> 3:54:06.040
 So Tom was involved in Black Hawk Down.

3:54:06.040 --> 3:54:07.040
 It was one of his first operations.

3:54:07.040 --> 3:54:08.320
 He's a Delta operator.

3:54:08.320 --> 3:54:11.040
 And I asked her, I said, listen, I'm going to be doing these shows, and I think it's great

3:54:11.040 --> 3:54:12.160
 that we talk about you more.

3:54:12.160 --> 3:54:15.480
 So I said, give me your three points of importance.

3:54:15.480 --> 3:54:20.080
 So the All Secure Foundation serves special operations combat families in healing from

3:54:20.080 --> 3:54:23.360
 posttraumatic stress injury and secondary posttraumatic stress.

3:54:23.360 --> 3:54:27.640
 So that's often what the wife or the other husband or the other spouse suffers from.

3:54:27.640 --> 3:54:31.240
 And we're starting to see that be more and more of an issue now.

3:54:31.240 --> 3:54:35.200
 So they also are devoted to rebuilding the couple's relationships on the home front after

3:54:35.200 --> 3:54:36.600
 the separations of war.

3:54:36.600 --> 3:54:44.040
 And 80% of their warriors went on, went, yeah, 80% of their warriors want their families

3:54:44.040 --> 3:54:45.160
 to be more involved with the healing.

3:54:45.160 --> 3:54:51.120
 The problem is, is very often, vets don't realize that they can have, or just because

3:54:51.120 --> 3:54:54.640
 the system doesn't pay for it, actually have their spouse as a part of things.

3:54:54.640 --> 3:54:57.920
 And the biggest thing that we find with special operations families, I think the divorce rates

3:54:57.920 --> 3:55:00.360
 like 95%.

3:55:00.360 --> 3:55:03.360
 And so they work so hard with these families.

3:55:03.360 --> 3:55:06.440
 They take them on retreats, these husband and wives, and they get them to connect again

3:55:06.440 --> 3:55:09.720
 after being separated over such a long period of time.

3:55:09.720 --> 3:55:14.920
 There's other places like Children's of Fallen Patriots at a DC, where they fund education,

3:55:14.920 --> 3:55:20.120
 university for people who have lost their parents in deployments, whether they're kids

3:55:20.120 --> 3:55:21.120
 even born yet.

3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:23.080
 If they're still in utero, they still pay.

3:55:23.080 --> 3:55:24.580
 They do not care.

3:55:24.580 --> 3:55:30.320
 Then you've got people like in Canada, you've got vets Canada, you've got in the States,

3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:35.960
 you've got True Patriot Love, you've got, who else in the States is really great that

3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:36.960
 we've worked with?

3:55:36.960 --> 3:55:39.240
 I know there's a Green Beret Foundation, that's great.

3:55:39.240 --> 3:55:44.400
 One more wave gives amputees, teaches them to surf with amputees, like they're really

3:55:44.400 --> 3:55:45.400
 great.

3:55:45.400 --> 3:55:51.120
 There's so many organizations, but at the end of the day, I focus on a small subset.

3:55:51.120 --> 3:55:58.000
 Because you cannot fix everyone's problems, the least you can do for people is focus.

3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:01.600
 If you can provide focus, you can provide the proper amount of funding, the proper amount

3:56:01.600 --> 3:56:03.760
 of funding can give the proper amount of tools.

3:56:03.760 --> 3:56:06.800
 Those tools can actually be implemented properly.

3:56:06.800 --> 3:56:11.720
 And then those people can go on to hopefully have successful marriages and families.

3:56:11.720 --> 3:56:15.240
 And we don't have to watch our parents drink themselves to death and wonder why daddy's

3:56:15.240 --> 3:56:18.320
 yelling at mommy all the time and daddy storms out leaves.

3:56:18.320 --> 3:56:22.120
 Well, daddy had some shit happen in his life and mommy had some shit happen, but that does

3:56:22.120 --> 3:56:24.440
 not mean that's who they are.

3:56:24.440 --> 3:56:31.880
 And yeah, so trauma has completely destructive effects on family and relationships and correcting

3:56:31.880 --> 3:56:35.400
 that as ripple effects.

3:56:35.400 --> 3:56:38.360
 Oh, just astronomical ripple effects.

3:56:38.360 --> 3:56:44.080
 Because the problem is we are so quick to tell people they're suffering from PTSD.

3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:45.760
 We're so quick to give them drugs.

3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:48.360
 We're so quick to kick them out of the military.

3:56:48.360 --> 3:56:50.280
 We're so quick to let them be homeless on the street.

3:56:50.280 --> 3:56:52.320
 We're so quick to let them fucking kill themselves.

3:56:52.320 --> 3:56:53.320
 We're so quick.

3:56:53.320 --> 3:56:57.520
 And then all of a sudden when a politician goes, veteran suicides an issue, that's when

3:56:57.520 --> 3:56:58.520
 it's a problem.

3:56:58.520 --> 3:57:02.160
 Well, if you prevent the problem from happening in the first place or you give people the

3:57:02.160 --> 3:57:05.920
 right funding and tools to do the job, you won't have this problem.

3:57:05.920 --> 3:57:14.840
 Do you have advice for young people think high school students, maybe unaggrads, college

3:57:14.840 --> 3:57:21.200
 students about career, life, how to live a life they can be proud of?

3:57:21.200 --> 3:57:25.720
 You've had one heck of a life.

3:57:25.720 --> 3:57:29.360
 Some of them are really cheesy, but they're true.

3:57:29.360 --> 3:57:33.800
 Live a life you can be proud of, number one, if you wake up every morning and you hate

3:57:33.800 --> 3:57:37.580
 what you do, change the fucking station.

3:57:37.580 --> 3:57:41.440
 Do not live and stay in that perpetual cycle of bullshit.

3:57:41.440 --> 3:57:42.440
 It's not worth it.

3:57:42.440 --> 3:57:45.920
 It's not what you're on this planet for.

3:57:45.920 --> 3:57:51.120
 You're worth more than that than the monotony of waking up, going to work, hating your life,

3:57:51.120 --> 3:57:54.200
 drinking yourself to sleep, and functioning.

3:57:54.200 --> 3:57:55.200
 Do yourself a favor.

3:57:55.200 --> 3:58:00.800
 The thing I scream about on the show so much is move your fucking body.

3:58:00.800 --> 3:58:02.720
 Move your body.

3:58:02.720 --> 3:58:04.520
 Get your blood moving.

3:58:04.520 --> 3:58:07.440
 Allow your body to do what it's here for.

3:58:07.440 --> 3:58:08.440
 Go for a run.

3:58:08.440 --> 3:58:09.440
 Go for a walk.

3:58:09.440 --> 3:58:13.800
 If you can't run, walk to the fridge three times more than maybe you did before, but you're

3:58:13.800 --> 3:58:15.440
 moving.

3:58:15.440 --> 3:58:20.000
 Pay attention to the shit you look at.

3:58:20.000 --> 3:58:25.880
 More now than ever, we are seeing our younger generation just be force fed information from

3:58:25.880 --> 3:58:28.720
 one side or the other, and none of it makes sense.

3:58:28.720 --> 3:58:29.840
 None of it's understandable.

3:58:29.840 --> 3:58:32.960
 It just causes chaos in the brain.

3:58:32.960 --> 3:58:36.880
 Really pay attention to what you listen to.

3:58:36.880 --> 3:58:42.320
 Something I've had to learn to do is make time for myself.

3:58:42.320 --> 3:58:47.240
 All of this working 18 hours a day, not sleeping, just work, work, work, work.

3:58:47.240 --> 3:58:48.240
 That doesn't work.

3:58:48.240 --> 3:58:49.240
 That's not sustainable.

3:58:49.240 --> 3:58:52.720
 It's not healthy, and it's not anything anyone should be doing.

3:58:52.720 --> 3:58:55.400
 Balance is important.

3:58:55.400 --> 3:59:00.800
 But if you're going to take the time to do something for yourself, don't make it sitting

3:59:00.800 --> 3:59:05.160
 in front of the TV for six hours eating a bag of chips, drinking a Coke.

3:59:05.160 --> 3:59:10.000
 Make it, I'm going to go for a walk, maybe listen to a podcast where I can learn something.

3:59:10.000 --> 3:59:12.720
 Make it, I'm going to go volunteer somewhere.

3:59:12.720 --> 3:59:17.040
 Nobody does that anymore, but make it, I can go volunteer somewhere on our house.

3:59:17.040 --> 3:59:19.360
 They have no paid employees, they have one.

3:59:19.360 --> 3:59:20.560
 Everybody is a volunteer.

3:59:20.560 --> 3:59:23.240
 They're fucking phenomenal.

3:59:23.240 --> 3:59:28.920
 Do whatever you're going to do, do it with some fucking drive, put some goddamn effort

3:59:28.920 --> 3:59:34.440
 into your life, and pick something in a career that's going to make you happy.

3:59:34.440 --> 3:59:36.960
 Not something that's just going to give you six figures, because that's not going to make

3:59:36.960 --> 3:59:37.960
 you happy.

3:59:37.960 --> 3:59:41.280
 I can tell you right now, I have everything in the world, and the last thing I want is

3:59:41.280 --> 3:59:42.280
 more things.

3:59:42.280 --> 3:59:48.120
 I want less, I want the woods, and I want quiet, because that's what's important to me.

3:59:48.120 --> 3:59:54.000
 I want my family to matter, the people around me to matter, and the small group I keep that

3:59:54.000 --> 3:59:55.800
 tight knit I have.

3:59:55.800 --> 3:59:59.200
 I want them to wake up every minute knowing that they have a friend that they can call

3:59:59.200 --> 4:00:01.920
 on the other line that isn't just like, how's it going?

4:00:01.920 --> 4:00:09.760
 That can actually have a conversation, a meaningful, intelligent, caring conversation.

4:00:09.760 --> 4:00:16.480
 We are just breeding these kids to be followers who digest bullshit, who reverberate things

4:00:16.480 --> 4:00:22.480
 they don't fully understand, and have opinions on stuff they have no business talking about.

4:00:22.480 --> 4:00:29.160
 Yeah, with an open mind, humbly, think deeply about the world.

4:00:29.160 --> 4:00:32.760
 How has your relationship with death changed?

4:00:32.760 --> 4:00:36.160
 This is a Russian program, I have to ask you.

4:00:36.160 --> 4:00:38.680
 So you've considered suicide throughout your life.

4:00:38.680 --> 4:00:43.120
 You have been in the line of fire, you have witnessed death.

4:00:43.120 --> 4:00:50.200
 You as a human being, a mortal one, do you think about your death these days now that

4:00:50.200 --> 4:00:55.520
 you have begun the journey with dealing with your trauma?

4:00:55.520 --> 4:00:57.960
 Do you think about your death?

4:00:57.960 --> 4:01:01.400
 Are you afraid of your death?

4:01:01.400 --> 4:01:03.320
 Well you don't die, so that's why.

4:01:03.320 --> 4:01:05.360
 What do you mean you don't die?

4:01:05.360 --> 4:01:06.360
 You move on.

4:01:06.360 --> 4:01:08.800
 Where do you go?

4:01:08.800 --> 4:01:14.360
 To another plane, another vibration, whatever you want to call it, this isn't it.

4:01:14.360 --> 4:01:16.040
 This isn't all of it.

4:01:16.040 --> 4:01:17.440
 This is a blip.

4:01:17.440 --> 4:01:22.800
 This is a moment, this is a... I used to be afraid of death before the military.

4:01:22.800 --> 4:01:24.600
 I was always afraid of dying.

4:01:24.600 --> 4:01:25.600
 I don't know why.

4:01:25.600 --> 4:01:30.040
 I had this irrational fear that I was going to be kidnapped in my room, seriously, irrational

4:01:30.040 --> 4:01:31.040
 fear, afraid.

4:01:31.040 --> 4:01:37.000
 And it's funny because I talked to McKayla yesterday and she said the same thing and

4:01:37.000 --> 4:01:39.800
 I was like, oh my God, I know what you're talking about.

4:01:39.800 --> 4:01:41.080
 You're being afraid of being kidnapped?

4:01:41.080 --> 4:01:45.800
 Yeah, she had this fear that someone was going to come in and take her out of her room.

4:01:45.800 --> 4:01:46.800
 I had the same fear.

4:01:46.800 --> 4:01:49.080
 By a human being or a monster or some kind?

4:01:49.080 --> 4:01:50.480
 No, I think by a human being.

4:01:50.480 --> 4:01:55.120
 I had this irrational fear that something was going to happen to me.

4:01:55.120 --> 4:01:57.640
 Like I said, I don't know if it's because my parents were always made me aware of my

4:01:57.640 --> 4:01:59.440
 surroundings, people take people.

4:01:59.440 --> 4:02:01.400
 This is a real thing that happens.

4:02:01.400 --> 4:02:03.840
 I was really small and I looked like a little boy.

4:02:03.840 --> 4:02:06.160
 My hair was like that when I was training.

4:02:06.160 --> 4:02:11.040
 I had short, no hair, flat as a board, you would have thought I was a 12 year old boy.

4:02:11.040 --> 4:02:14.920
 And so my mom's like, people take people, sweetie, that's just the reality of life.

4:02:14.920 --> 4:02:15.920
 You need to be aware.

4:02:15.920 --> 4:02:18.120
 So I don't know if I have this ingrained in my mind.

4:02:18.120 --> 4:02:21.680
 I was always like training to protect myself or fight someone off.

4:02:21.680 --> 4:02:25.360
 So I was like afraid of this irrational thing.

4:02:25.360 --> 4:02:28.840
 And then I went overseas and then I realized that I could just be literally there talking

4:02:28.840 --> 4:02:32.240
 to you, having a conversation and I could just be taken off the face there.

4:02:32.240 --> 4:02:34.800
 And there's nothing I can do about it.

4:02:34.800 --> 4:02:37.800
 And then I adopted this idea that when it's my time, it'll be my time.

4:02:37.800 --> 4:02:50.440
 But the difference is now, at least I know that if I do go and I do cross and I am and

4:02:50.440 --> 4:02:59.360
 I do move on, I know that I live my life the way that I always hoped I would be proud to

4:02:59.360 --> 4:03:00.360
 live.

4:03:00.360 --> 4:03:04.640
 Can I ask you a dark question?

4:03:04.640 --> 4:03:10.360
 Because you mentioned Robin Williams, you mentioned Anthony Bourdain and your own struggle

4:03:10.360 --> 4:03:12.280
 with suicide.

4:03:12.280 --> 4:03:18.120
 Why do you think they ultimately lost that battle?

4:03:18.120 --> 4:03:19.720
 Why do you think they did their lives?

4:03:19.720 --> 4:03:25.960
 Oh man, that's a loaded question because you could look at everything from biomarkers in

4:03:25.960 --> 4:03:30.080
 the brain to know if there's serotonin and dopamine levels were crashed in the ground.

4:03:30.080 --> 4:03:36.440
 There's biological reasonings for some people where they're born bipolar and they have,

4:03:36.440 --> 4:03:37.440
 or they're schizophrenic.

4:03:37.440 --> 4:03:43.800
 There's so many things we don't fully grasp about the brain.

4:03:43.800 --> 4:03:52.960
 But what we do know from my perspective, for me at least, there really is no rhyme or reason

4:03:52.960 --> 4:03:56.880
 why I survived and others didn't.

4:03:56.880 --> 4:03:59.480
 Stuff and things don't make you happy.

4:03:59.480 --> 4:04:05.760
 People don't always know why they're feeling the way they're feeling, but they also are

4:04:05.760 --> 4:04:15.200
 not always willing to talk about it or they put on a good front.

4:04:15.200 --> 4:04:18.440
 And if nobody knows any different, what do you expect?

4:04:18.440 --> 4:04:24.240
 And it's especially clear with the two of them that on the surface they're exceptionally

4:04:24.240 --> 4:04:26.600
 successful in so many dimensions.

4:04:26.600 --> 4:04:34.840
 And still that means nothing, material possessions, anything really is not, doesn't guarantee you

4:04:34.840 --> 4:04:35.840
 happiness.

4:04:35.840 --> 4:04:36.840
 No, it doesn't.

4:04:36.840 --> 4:04:37.840
 That's scary.

4:04:37.840 --> 4:04:49.640
 Well, that's terrifying, but when it's good, that's what makes it joyful, like that's what

4:04:49.640 --> 4:04:55.840
 happiness is, is like holy shit, somehow, amidst all the absurdity, all the things that

4:04:55.840 --> 4:04:59.040
 you can't predict, you nevertheless feel really good.

4:04:59.040 --> 4:05:04.840
 That's why I feel really fortunate to be getting this feat of happiness all the time.

4:05:04.840 --> 4:05:09.960
 Well, to be or not to be, that's a good place to end it.

4:05:09.960 --> 4:05:13.200
 Kelsey, you're an amazing human being.

4:05:13.200 --> 4:05:18.080
 I'm really fortunate that you would spend your valuable time with me.

4:05:18.080 --> 4:05:23.400
 As I said, you're so good at not just talking, but listening.

4:05:23.400 --> 4:05:27.880
 So I definitely will listen to your podcast, because I can tell you're an incredible person

4:05:27.880 --> 4:05:30.920
 as an interviewer and as a storyteller.

4:05:30.920 --> 4:05:33.640
 So again, thank you for talking today.

4:05:33.640 --> 4:05:36.640
 Thank you so much.

4:05:36.640 --> 4:05:39.000
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Kelsey Sharon.

4:05:39.000 --> 4:05:43.240
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

4:05:43.240 --> 4:05:50.080
 And now let me leave you with some words from Herbert Hoover, older men declare war, but

4:05:50.080 --> 4:05:54.640
 it is the youth that must fight and die.

4:05:54.640 --> 4:06:20.600
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
