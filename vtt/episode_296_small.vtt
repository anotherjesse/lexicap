00:00.000 --> 00:02.040
 I think that some people are deliberately trying

00:02.040 --> 00:05.720
 to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past

00:05.720 --> 00:08.160
 in order to say there's nothing good,

00:08.160 --> 00:09.600
 nothing you can hold on to.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.840
 No one you should revere.

00:10.840 --> 00:12.320
 You've got no heroes.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.640
 The whole thing comes down.

00:13.640 --> 00:14.720
 Who's left standing?

00:14.720 --> 00:15.960
 Oh, we've also got this idea

00:15.960 --> 00:18.720
 from the 20th century still about Marxism.

00:18.720 --> 00:23.720
 And no, no, I will not have the entire landscape

00:23.720 --> 00:28.720
 deracinated and then the worst ideas tried again.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.760
 The following is a conversation with Douglas Murray,

00:33.760 --> 00:35.880
 author of The Badness of Crowds,

00:35.880 --> 00:38.120
 Gender, Race, and Identity,

00:38.120 --> 00:41.360
 and his most recent book, The War on the West,

00:41.360 --> 00:44.680
 How to Prevail in the Age of Unreason.

00:44.680 --> 00:48.760
 He's a brilliant, fearless, and often controversial thinker

00:48.760 --> 00:52.320
 who points out and pushes back against what he sees

00:52.320 --> 00:55.360
 as the madness of our modern world.

00:55.360 --> 00:57.880
 I should note that the use of the word Marxism

00:57.880 --> 01:01.440
 and the West in this conversation refers primarily

01:01.440 --> 01:04.800
 to cultural Marxism and the cultural values

01:04.800 --> 01:07.380
 of Western civilization, respectively.

01:07.380 --> 01:10.300
 This is in contrast to my previous conversation

01:10.300 --> 01:14.040
 with Richard Wolff, where we focused on Marxism

01:14.040 --> 01:16.600
 as primarily a critique of capitalism

01:16.600 --> 01:20.000
 and thus looking at it through the lens of economics

01:20.000 --> 01:21.840
 and not culture.

01:21.840 --> 01:24.400
 Nevertheless, these two episodes stand opposite

01:24.400 --> 01:26.920
 of each other with very different perspectives

01:26.920 --> 01:30.560
 on how we build a flourishing civilization together.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.000
 I leave it to you, the listener,

01:33.000 --> 01:36.920
 to think and to decide which is the better way.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.000
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.240
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:42.240 --> 01:43.440
 in the description.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.080
 And now, dear friends, here's Douglas Murray.

01:47.080 --> 01:51.520
 You recently wrote the book titled The War on the West,

01:51.520 --> 01:54.560
 which in part says that the values, ideas,

01:54.560 --> 01:57.360
 and history of Western civilization are under attack.

01:57.360 --> 01:59.680
 So let's start with the basics.

01:59.680 --> 02:02.120
 Historically and today, what are the ideas

02:02.120 --> 02:05.120
 that represent Western civilization?

02:05.120 --> 02:07.000
 The good, the bad, the ugly?

02:07.000 --> 02:09.800
 I actually don't get stuck on definitions,

02:09.800 --> 02:11.160
 precisely because as you know,

02:11.160 --> 02:12.440
 once you get stuck on definitions,

02:12.440 --> 02:13.960
 there's a possibility you'll never get off them.

02:13.960 --> 02:14.800
 Yes.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.560
 I'd say a few things.

02:17.560 --> 02:20.240
 Firstly, obviously, the Western tradition

02:20.240 --> 02:21.720
 is a specific tradition,

02:21.720 --> 02:24.400
 a specific tradition of ideas, culture,

02:25.600 --> 02:28.160
 well known to be perhaps easily defined

02:28.160 --> 02:30.560
 by the combination of Athens and Jerusalem,

02:30.560 --> 02:33.040
 the world of the Bible,

02:33.040 --> 02:36.360
 and the world of ancient Greece and indeed Rome.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.080
 It effectively creates European civilization,

02:41.080 --> 02:42.560
 which itself spawns the rest

02:42.560 --> 02:45.520
 of the Western civilizations, America, Canada,

02:45.520 --> 02:48.680
 Australia, New Zealand, and others.

02:48.680 --> 02:49.920
 But these are the main countries

02:49.920 --> 02:52.920
 that we still refer to as the West.

02:52.920 --> 02:54.520
 So there's a specific tradition

02:54.520 --> 02:56.520
 and all the things that come from it.

02:58.120 --> 03:01.680
 My shorthand cheat on this answer is to say,

03:02.560 --> 03:04.120
 you know when you're not in it.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.760
 So if you've ever been to Beijing, Shanghai,

03:08.760 --> 03:11.320
 you know you're not in the West, somewhere else.

03:11.320 --> 03:12.840
 You know you're not in the West.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.440
 When you're in Tokyo, somewhere extraordinary,

03:15.440 --> 03:17.360
 but you know you're not in the West.

03:18.440 --> 03:22.720
 Obviously there are, let's say, borderline questions

03:22.720 --> 03:24.480
 like, is Russia in the West?

03:25.880 --> 03:28.800
 Which I sort of leave open as a question.

03:31.440 --> 03:32.280
 Possibly.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.920
 If you were placed into Moscow blindfolded

03:34.920 --> 03:38.280
 and you woke up and you couldn't hear the language

03:38.280 --> 03:40.160
 or maybe you didn't know what the language sounded like,

03:40.160 --> 03:42.960
 would you guess you were in the West or not?

03:42.960 --> 03:47.160
 I think I was somewhere near it, getting closer.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.320
 I mean, you know, Tulsa asks the question,

03:49.320 --> 03:51.080
 doesn't he, whether it's European?

03:51.080 --> 03:53.920
 And I think the answer to that is not really,

03:53.920 --> 03:55.960
 although massively influenced by Europe,

03:55.960 --> 03:59.000
 but and times wanting to reach towards it,

03:59.000 --> 04:01.120
 at times wanting to stay away,

04:01.120 --> 04:04.760
 but a part of the West possibly, yes.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.920
 But anyway, it's a very specific tradition.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.280
 I mean, it's one of a number of major traditions

04:13.280 --> 04:16.920
 in the world and because it's hard to define,

04:16.920 --> 04:19.400
 doesn't mean it doesn't exist, you know.

04:19.400 --> 04:21.160
 Are there certain characteristics and qualities

04:21.160 --> 04:23.960
 about the values and the ideas that define it?

04:23.960 --> 04:28.160
 Is the type of rule, the type of governmental structure?

04:28.160 --> 04:32.040
 Yes, I mean, the rule of law, property owning democracies

04:33.000 --> 04:35.440
 and much more, I mean, these are, of course,

04:35.440 --> 04:37.840
 things that were ended up being developed in America

04:37.840 --> 04:41.080
 and then given back to much of the rest of the West.

04:43.000 --> 04:47.520
 I'd say there are other, perhaps more controversial

04:47.520 --> 04:49.360
 attributes I would give to the West.

04:49.360 --> 04:53.200
 One is a ravenous interest in the rest of the world,

04:53.200 --> 04:55.800
 which is not shared, of course, by every other culture.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.360
 The late philosopher George Steiner,

04:59.360 --> 05:01.000
 who said he could never get out of his head,

05:01.000 --> 05:04.160
 the haunting fact that the boats only seemed to go out

05:04.160 --> 05:09.160
 from Europe, the explorers, the scholars, the linguists,

05:11.000 --> 05:14.640
 that the people who wanted to discover other civilizations

05:14.640 --> 05:17.240
 and indeed even resurrect ancient civilizations

05:17.240 --> 05:18.960
 and lost civilizations.

05:18.960 --> 05:21.000
 These were scholars that were always coming from the West

05:21.000 --> 05:22.040
 to discover this elsewhere.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.120
 By contrast, they were never boats coming from Egypt

05:26.120 --> 05:28.880
 to help the Anglo Saxons discover the origins

05:28.880 --> 05:30.520
 of their language and so on.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.880
 So I think there is a sort of ravenous interest

05:32.880 --> 05:35.640
 in the rest of the world, which can be said to be a Western.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.000
 Attributal load, of course,

05:37.000 --> 05:39.480
 also has a bunch of immediately preface it,

05:39.480 --> 05:41.800
 some downsides and many criticisms

05:41.800 --> 05:43.360
 that could be made of some of the consequences

05:43.360 --> 05:46.280
 of that interest because, of course,

05:46.280 --> 05:50.600
 it's not entirely lacking in self interest.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.280
 So it's not just the scholars, it's also...

05:53.280 --> 05:54.120
 The armies.

05:54.120 --> 05:57.680
 The armies and they're looking to gain access

05:57.680 --> 05:59.760
 and control over resources elsewhere.

05:59.760 --> 06:00.600
 To market.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.680
 Hence the imperial imperative.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.520
 Exactly.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.240
 To conquer, to expand.

06:06.240 --> 06:08.520
 Although that itself, of course, is a universal thing.

06:08.520 --> 06:13.000
 I mean, no civilization, I think that we know of,

06:13.000 --> 06:17.240
 doesn't try to gain ground from its neighbors where it can.

06:17.240 --> 06:19.800
 With the ability to go further, faster,

06:21.440 --> 06:23.640
 certainly gave an advantage in that regard.

06:23.640 --> 06:26.720
 Do some civilizations get a bit more excited

06:26.720 --> 06:28.440
 by that kind of idea than others?

06:28.440 --> 06:29.440
 Possible.

06:29.440 --> 06:30.280
 It's possible.

06:30.280 --> 06:33.920
 Because you could say it's the Western civilization

06:33.920 --> 06:36.000
 because the technological innovation

06:36.000 --> 06:39.400
 was more efficient at doing that kind of thing.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.240
 Absolutely.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.920
 But maybe you wanted it more, too.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.840
 Well, the Ottomans wanted it, it's an awful lot

06:44.840 --> 06:48.120
 and did very terribly well for many centuries.

06:48.120 --> 06:52.160
 One shouldn't forget that as did others.

06:53.600 --> 06:54.760
 I'd also say, by the way,

06:54.760 --> 06:56.200
 and again, it's a very broad one,

06:56.200 --> 06:57.240
 but it's worth throwing out there.

06:57.240 --> 07:02.240
 I think self criticism is an important attribute

07:02.520 --> 07:05.720
 of the Western mind, one that, as you know,

07:05.720 --> 07:07.840
 is not common everywhere.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.520
 Not all societies allow even their most

07:10.520 --> 07:13.000
 vociferous critics to become rich.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
 So, you know, criticism is a negative sounding word.

07:16.000 --> 07:19.440
 It could be self introspection, self analysis,

07:19.440 --> 07:20.680
 self reflection.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.880
 And it can be what you need, you know?

07:23.880 --> 07:25.920
 And in the Western system,

07:25.920 --> 07:27.320
 I'd argue that one of the advantages

07:27.320 --> 07:30.080
 of the system of representative governance

07:30.080 --> 07:32.600
 is that where there are problems in the system,

07:32.600 --> 07:36.760
 you can attempt to sort them out by peaceable means.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.240
 We listen to arguments, most famously in America

07:41.240 --> 07:43.520
 in the late 20th century.

07:43.520 --> 07:45.840
 The civil rights movement achieved its aims

07:45.840 --> 07:48.120
 by force of moral argument

07:48.120 --> 07:49.480
 and persuaded the rest of the country

07:49.480 --> 07:50.800
 that it had been wrong.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.880
 That's not common in every society by any means.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.680
 So, I think there are certain attributes

07:57.680 --> 08:00.800
 of the Western mind that you could say are,

08:02.200 --> 08:03.320
 they're not entirely unique,

08:03.320 --> 08:06.560
 but they are not as commonplace elsewhere.

08:06.560 --> 08:09.400
 What about the emergence and hierarchies

08:09.400 --> 08:14.480
 of asymmetry of power, most visible,

08:14.480 --> 08:18.120
 most drastic in the form of slavery, for example?

08:18.120 --> 08:19.920
 Well, I mean, everyone in the world is slavery.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.200
 So, I don't regard it as being a Western,

08:22.200 --> 08:23.680
 the unique Western sin.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.240
 It's rather hard to think of a civilization

08:27.240 --> 08:29.360
 in history that didn't have slavery of some kind.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.520
 One of the oddities of the Western ignorance of our day

08:32.520 --> 08:34.000
 is that people seem to imagine

08:34.000 --> 08:35.760
 that our societies in the West

08:35.760 --> 08:39.000
 were the only ones who ever engaged in any vices.

08:39.000 --> 08:40.480
 Alas, this isn't true.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.000
 It's a sort of Rousseauian mistake,

08:43.000 --> 08:45.600
 or at least one that's blossomed since Rousseau,

08:45.600 --> 08:47.600
 that everybody else in the world

08:47.600 --> 08:49.480
 was born into sort of Edenic innocence,

08:49.480 --> 08:52.720
 and only we in the West had this sort of evil in us

08:52.720 --> 08:55.880
 that caused us to do bad things to other people.

08:55.880 --> 08:58.280
 Slavery was engaged in by everyone in the ancient world,

08:58.280 --> 09:01.760
 of course, and through most of the modern world as well.

09:01.760 --> 09:04.520
 Of course, there are 40 million slaves in the world today,

09:04.520 --> 09:06.120
 so it's clearly not something

09:06.120 --> 09:08.600
 that the species as a whole has a problem with.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.200
 That's more slaves, of course,

09:11.200 --> 09:13.040
 than there were in the 19th century.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.160
 And I'd say on top of that,

09:16.160 --> 09:18.960
 that the interesting thing about the Western mind,

09:18.960 --> 09:19.960
 as regards to slavery,

09:19.960 --> 09:23.560
 is that we were the civilization that did away with it.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.280
 And by the way, the founding fathers of America,

09:26.280 --> 09:30.840
 who today are lambasted routinely

09:30.840 --> 09:34.440
 for being acquiescent in the slave trade,

09:35.360 --> 09:37.800
 engaging in it, owning slaves.

09:39.360 --> 09:42.000
 There's not, people almost don't even bother now

09:42.000 --> 09:45.440
 to recognize the facts that Thomas Jefferson,

09:45.440 --> 09:48.000
 George Washington all wanted to see this trade

09:48.000 --> 09:50.720
 done away with, couldn't hold the country together

09:50.720 --> 09:53.240
 at the origins if they'd have made such an effort

09:53.240 --> 09:55.640
 and believed and hoped that it would be something

09:55.640 --> 09:57.960
 that would be dealt with after their time.

09:58.760 --> 10:02.320
 So the founding ideas had within them

10:02.320 --> 10:05.840
 the notion that we should, as a people, get rid of this.

10:05.840 --> 10:08.440
 The opening lines of the Declaration of Independence

10:08.440 --> 10:13.440
 set up the conditions under which slavery will be impossible.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.680
 All men are created equal.

10:16.680 --> 10:19.640
 Once you've put that, that's a time bomb

10:19.640 --> 10:22.600
 under the whole concept of slavery.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.840
 That's ticking away, okay.

10:24.840 --> 10:28.360
 And sure enough, it detonated in the next century.

10:28.360 --> 10:32.640
 If we just step back and look at the human species,

10:32.640 --> 10:36.360
 what does slavery teach you about human nature?

10:36.360 --> 10:41.360
 The fact that slavery has appeared

10:41.720 --> 10:44.360
 as a function of society throughout human history.

10:44.360 --> 10:47.600
 There are two possibilities.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.520
 One is it's what people think they can do

10:51.520 --> 10:52.880
 when God is not watching.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.320
 Another is it's what they can do

10:56.320 --> 10:57.960
 if they think that God allows it.

11:00.000 --> 11:02.040
 Really, really well put.

11:02.040 --> 11:07.040
 And the fact that they want to do this kind of subjugation,

11:09.280 --> 11:10.880
 what does that mean?

11:10.880 --> 11:14.480
 Well, I mean, it's pretty straightforward in a way.

11:14.480 --> 11:17.080
 There are people who get to work for free.

11:17.080 --> 11:19.320
 There's economic in nature in some sense.

11:19.320 --> 11:23.360
 Yes, but in order to do it, I mean, almost always,

11:23.360 --> 11:24.960
 there are some examples in the ancient world

11:24.960 --> 11:25.800
 where this wasn't the case,

11:25.800 --> 11:28.080
 but almost always it had to be a subjugated people

11:28.080 --> 11:30.520
 or people that regard it as different.

11:30.520 --> 11:31.360
 One of the things, actually,

11:31.360 --> 11:34.720
 I've tried to sort of inject into the discussion

11:34.720 --> 11:35.920
 through this book, among other things,

11:35.920 --> 11:40.680
 is a recognition that there were very major questions

11:40.680 --> 11:43.400
 still going on in the 18th and early 19th century

11:43.400 --> 11:45.040
 that were unresolved,

11:45.040 --> 11:47.720
 which were one of the reasons why slavery

11:47.720 --> 11:50.920
 was not as morally repugnant to people then

11:50.920 --> 11:53.600
 as it is to us now.

11:53.600 --> 11:56.720
 And that's the question of polygenesis and monogenesis.

11:58.120 --> 11:59.800
 At the time of Thomas Jefferson,

11:59.800 --> 12:03.040
 the founding fathers were thinking and working,

12:03.040 --> 12:06.880
 they didn't know because nobody knew

12:06.880 --> 12:11.760
 whether the human races were related or not.

12:11.760 --> 12:15.880
 There were arguments, the monogenesis argument

12:15.880 --> 12:19.480
 that we were all indeed from the same racial stock.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.240
 Polygenesis argument was that we weren't.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.960
 Black Africans, Ethiopians, they were often referred to

12:26.960 --> 12:30.880
 at the time because they provided some of the first slaves,

12:30.880 --> 12:33.080
 were different from white Europeans,

12:33.080 --> 12:35.600
 simply not related in any way.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.280
 And that makes it easier, of course,

12:37.280 --> 12:38.880
 that makes it easier to enslave people

12:38.880 --> 12:41.200
 if you think they're not your brother.

12:41.200 --> 12:42.200
 Am I my brother's keeper?

12:42.200 --> 12:43.480
 No, he's not your brother.

12:46.200 --> 12:51.200
 And it's a very,

12:51.440 --> 12:54.440
 it was a very troubling argument in the 18th and 19th century

12:54.440 --> 12:56.200
 also because there was a biblical question.

12:56.200 --> 12:58.640
 It threw up a theological question,

12:58.640 --> 13:03.640
 which was, people were literally debating this at the time,

13:03.640 --> 13:07.200
 was there also a black Adam and Eve?

13:08.560 --> 13:11.240
 Was there, was it an Indian Adam and Eve,

13:11.240 --> 13:13.360
 the Native American Adam and Eve?

13:13.360 --> 13:17.160
 I mean, this was a serious theological debate

13:17.160 --> 13:18.520
 because they didn't know the answer.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.880
 And I mean, people say that Darwin solved this.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.280
 It wasn't just Darwin, of course,

13:25.280 --> 13:28.360
 but by the late 19th century,

13:28.360 --> 13:32.360
 the argument that we were not all related

13:32.360 --> 13:35.000
 as human beings had suffered so many blows

13:35.000 --> 13:38.920
 that you had to really be very, very ignorant,

13:38.920 --> 13:41.400
 deliberately, willfully ignorant to ignore it by then.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.120
 So it no longer was after Darwin a theological question,

13:45.120 --> 13:46.840
 it became a moral question.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.240
 It was already a moral question,

13:48.240 --> 13:51.160
 but it clarified, Darwin clarifies it, definitely.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.480
 And then you're in this, as I say in this situation,

13:53.480 --> 13:55.920
 if you're not subjugating some other people,

13:55.920 --> 13:58.760
 you're subjugating your own kin.

13:58.760 --> 14:02.280
 And that becomes morally unsustainable.

14:03.440 --> 14:08.440
 So given that slavery in America is part of its history,

14:14.200 --> 14:19.200
 how do we incorporate it into the calculus of policy today,

14:21.400 --> 14:26.200
 social discourse, what we learn in school?

14:26.200 --> 14:27.600
 We can look at slavery in America,

14:27.600 --> 14:30.760
 we can look at maybe more recent things

14:30.760 --> 14:35.120
 like in Europe, the other atrocities, the Holocaust.

14:36.120 --> 14:40.280
 How do we incorporate that in terms of how we create policy,

14:40.280 --> 14:43.120
 how we treat each other, all those kinds of things?

14:43.120 --> 14:47.200
 What is the calculus of integrating the atrocities,

14:47.200 --> 14:51.600
 the injustices of the past into the way we are today?

14:51.600 --> 14:53.000
 That's a very complex question

14:53.000 --> 14:56.320
 because it's a moral question at this point.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.840
 And a moral question long after the fact.

15:01.560 --> 15:02.920
 I say at one point in the war in the West

15:02.920 --> 15:05.800
 that the argument, for instance, on reparations now

15:05.800 --> 15:09.040
 that goes on, and it's not a fringe argument anymore.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.200
 Some people say, oh, you're pulling up

15:10.200 --> 15:11.800
 this fringe argument, it really isn't.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.760
 I mean, every contender for the Democratic nomination

15:14.760 --> 15:18.240
 for the presidency in 2020 was willing to talk

15:18.240 --> 15:20.400
 about the possibility of reparations.

15:20.400 --> 15:26.400
 I'm very eager that this country, America, goes through that

15:26.400 --> 15:30.680
 entirely self destructive exercise.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.400
 I say that there's a lot of problems with this,

15:33.400 --> 15:36.760
 but if I could refine it out on one thing, I'd say this.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.640
 It's no longer about a wealth transfer

15:38.640 --> 15:40.520
 from one group of people who did something wrong

15:40.520 --> 15:42.840
 to another group of people who were wronged.

15:42.840 --> 15:46.520
 It would have been that 200 years ago.

15:46.520 --> 15:48.840
 Today, it's not even the descendants of people

15:48.840 --> 15:51.000
 who did something wrong giving money to people who

15:51.000 --> 15:53.600
 were the descendants of people who were wronged.

15:53.600 --> 15:55.760
 It's a wealth transfer from people

15:55.760 --> 15:58.440
 who look like people who did a wrong thing in the past

15:58.440 --> 16:02.960
 to another group of people who resemble people who were wronged.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.800
 That's impossible to do.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.600
 I'm completely clear about this.

16:07.600 --> 16:11.360
 There is no way in which you could organize

16:11.360 --> 16:17.160
 such a wealth transfer on moral or practical reasons.

16:17.160 --> 16:20.440
 America is filled with people who

16:20.440 --> 16:23.000
 have same skin color as us, for instance, who

16:23.000 --> 16:24.480
 have no connection to the slave trade

16:24.480 --> 16:28.240
 and should not be made to pay money to people

16:28.240 --> 16:30.600
 who have some connection.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.480
 And then the country is also filled

16:32.480 --> 16:37.040
 with ethnic minorities who have come after slavery who would not

16:37.040 --> 16:42.760
 be due for any reimbursement, as it were.

16:42.760 --> 16:46.480
 The problem with this is, though, is that there are,

16:46.480 --> 16:48.120
 I'm perfectly open to the possibility

16:48.120 --> 16:51.560
 that there are residual inequities that

16:51.560 --> 16:56.240
 exist in American life and that the consequences of slavery

16:56.240 --> 17:01.480
 could be one of the factors that result from this.

17:01.480 --> 17:08.000
 The thing is, I don't think it's a single issue answer.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.680
 I think it's a multidimensional issue, something

17:10.680 --> 17:12.320
 like Blackhunter achievement in America.

17:12.320 --> 17:16.000
 It's obviously a multidimensional issue.

17:16.000 --> 17:20.360
 Much of the left and others wish to say, it's not.

17:20.360 --> 17:22.400
 It's only about racism.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.440
 And they can't answer why Asians who have arrived more

17:26.440 --> 17:29.040
 recently don't, for instance, get held down

17:29.040 --> 17:30.520
 by white supremacy.

17:30.520 --> 17:33.800
 But actually, I say white supremacy in quotes,

17:33.800 --> 17:36.280
 obviously, but don't get held back by it,

17:36.280 --> 17:38.120
 but actually flourish to the extent

17:38.120 --> 17:41.760
 that Asian Americans have higher household earnings

17:41.760 --> 17:48.280
 and higher household mean equity than home equity

17:48.280 --> 17:52.320
 and so on than white Americans.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.560
 So I don't think that on the merits, the evidence is there

17:55.560 --> 17:59.680
 that racism is the explanation for black ongoing Blackhunter

17:59.680 --> 18:03.600
 achievement in some sections of the Black community in America.

18:03.600 --> 18:04.800
 It's obviously a part of it.

18:04.800 --> 18:09.000
 Could you say that even those things like fatherlessness

18:09.000 --> 18:14.560
 and similar family breakdown issues

18:14.560 --> 18:18.400
 are a long term consequence of it?

18:18.400 --> 18:23.040
 Possibly, but it's being awfully generous to people's ability

18:23.040 --> 18:25.000
 to make bad decisions.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.600
 For instance, how many generations

18:26.600 --> 18:29.320
 after the Holocaust would you allow people

18:29.320 --> 18:33.040
 to claim that everything that went wrong in the Jewish community

18:33.040 --> 18:35.440
 was as a result of the Holocaust?

18:35.440 --> 18:39.160
 I mean, is there some kind of term limit on this?

18:39.160 --> 18:40.760
 I would have thought so.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.600
 And I think most people probably think that's over.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.240
 I think the details matter there.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.200
 But it's very difficult.

18:51.200 --> 18:52.560
 You're in deep waters, yeah.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.360
 Oh, I enjoy swimming out in the ocean.

18:54.360 --> 18:57.960
 So although I'm terrified of what's

18:57.960 --> 19:00.240
 lurking underneath in the darkness.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.240
 You're right.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.480
 You're right to be.

19:04.480 --> 19:07.080
 OK, it's really complicated calculus

19:07.080 --> 19:10.000
 with the Holocaust and with slavery.

19:10.000 --> 19:15.600
 So the argument in America is that there's

19:15.600 --> 19:20.600
 deep institutional racism against African Americans that's

19:20.600 --> 19:23.000
 rooted in slavery.

19:23.000 --> 19:28.120
 And so however that calculus turns out,

19:28.120 --> 19:30.600
 that calculation, it still persists.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.200
 In the culture, in the institutions,

19:33.200 --> 19:35.800
 in the allocation of resources, in the way

19:35.800 --> 19:39.840
 that we communicate in subtle ways, in major ways,

19:39.840 --> 19:41.920
 all that kind of stuff.

19:41.920 --> 19:44.880
 How is it possible to win or lose

19:44.880 --> 19:47.960
 that argument of how much institutional racism there

19:47.960 --> 19:50.840
 is that's rooted in slavery?

19:50.840 --> 19:52.280
 Is it a winnable?

19:52.280 --> 19:55.280
 It's an unquantifiable argument.

19:55.280 --> 19:59.400
 And I'd like to apply some shortcuts to some of this

19:59.400 --> 20:01.960
 in the following.

20:01.960 --> 20:09.120
 For instance, let's take the EVV1 that's most often cited.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.000
 If a white person is walking down a street in America

20:12.000 --> 20:14.480
 and they see a group of young black men coming towards them

20:14.480 --> 20:16.960
 and it's late at night and they cross the road,

20:16.960 --> 20:20.360
 is it because of slavery?

20:20.360 --> 20:23.400
 Is it because of institutional racism?

20:23.400 --> 20:29.200
 No, it's because they've made a calculus based not entirely

20:29.200 --> 20:37.560
 on unfounded beliefs that given crime rates,

20:37.560 --> 20:41.560
 it's possible that this group of people might be a group of people

20:41.560 --> 20:43.680
 they don't want to meet late at night.

20:43.680 --> 20:49.400
 That's an ugly fact, but crime statistics in American cities

20:49.400 --> 20:52.400
 after American cities bear out.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.160
 It's not an entirely unreasonable one.

20:55.160 --> 20:59.360
 It's not reasonable every time, obviously.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.960
 But is it attributable to slavery?

21:02.960 --> 21:05.640
 That's a stretch.

21:05.640 --> 21:11.960
 If you're in a city like Chicago where the homicide rates shot

21:11.960 --> 21:16.760
 up in the last two years, albeit again, as always

21:16.760 --> 21:20.720
 has to be remembered, mainly black on black gun

21:20.720 --> 21:23.440
 violence and knife violence, nevertheless,

21:23.440 --> 21:26.920
 if you're in a city like Chicago and you make that calculus,

21:26.920 --> 21:30.360
 I've just suggested the cliched one,

21:30.360 --> 21:33.680
 the street late at night, there are other factors

21:33.680 --> 21:36.920
 other than a memory of slavery that kick in.

21:39.880 --> 21:43.040
 And I'm afraid it's something which people don't

21:43.040 --> 21:45.200
 want to particularly acknowledge in America for obvious reasons

21:45.200 --> 21:47.600
 because it's the ugliest damn debate in the world.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.240
 But I was actually just writing in my column in New York Post

21:50.240 --> 21:54.200
 today about a very interesting case that's similar, which

21:54.200 --> 21:58.640
 is the question of obesity in the US.

21:58.640 --> 22:01.960
 As you know, America's the most overweight country

22:01.960 --> 22:03.800
 in the world.

22:03.800 --> 22:08.760
 America has, I think, 40% of the population is obese

22:08.760 --> 22:09.640
 in medical ways.

22:09.640 --> 22:12.360
 And the nearest next country is a long way down.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.400
 That's New Zealand, a 30% of the population.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.200
 So America's a long way ahead.

22:16.200 --> 22:20.920
 Why during the coronavirus era when we know that obesity

22:20.920 --> 22:24.080
 is the one clearest factor that's likely to lead

22:24.080 --> 22:26.680
 to your hospitalization if you also get the virus?

22:26.680 --> 22:29.400
 Why did almost no public health information in America

22:29.400 --> 22:31.080
 focus on obesity?

22:31.080 --> 22:34.240
 80% of the people who ended up hospitalized in America

22:34.240 --> 22:37.960
 with coronavirus were obese.

22:37.960 --> 22:41.080
 We locked the schools when there was no evidence

22:41.080 --> 22:43.680
 that the coronavirus was deadly for children.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.840
 We all wore cloth masks when there was very little evidence

22:46.840 --> 22:52.200
 that this was much use in stopping the spread of the virus.

22:52.200 --> 22:55.160
 We had massive evidence about obesity being a problem.

22:55.160 --> 22:56.440
 And we never addressed it.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.920
 Why is it just because we worried about fat people?

22:58.920 --> 23:01.800
 No, it's actually because about fat shaming as it were.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.480
 No, it's also because to a great extent

23:03.480 --> 23:05.520
 it's a racial issue in America as well.

23:05.520 --> 23:07.600
 And actually, I quoted this new publication

23:07.600 --> 23:10.400
 from the University of Chicago as it happens, which

23:10.400 --> 23:11.400
 makes that claim explicit.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.880
 It says, the reasons why people have views

23:14.880 --> 23:17.280
 that are negative about obesity is because of racism

23:17.280 --> 23:18.640
 and slavery.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.240
 This is what everything is drawn back to in America.

23:21.240 --> 23:23.360
 Anything you want to stop, you say

23:23.360 --> 23:25.840
 it's because of racism, it's because of slavery.

23:25.840 --> 23:31.720
 How about it's actually because you mind the hospitals

23:31.720 --> 23:34.320
 getting clogged up, you mind people dying,

23:34.320 --> 23:37.600
 you mind ethnic minorities disproportionately dying,

23:37.600 --> 23:39.200
 and you'd like to say something about it.

23:39.200 --> 23:41.040
 Once again, as is in everything in America,

23:41.040 --> 23:46.760
 it's cut off by some poorly educated academic saying

23:46.760 --> 23:48.680
 it's about slavery.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.200
 So we're really not.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.640
 I mean, this requires a kind of form of brain

23:52.640 --> 23:55.080
 surgery to perform it on a society, probably one that's not

23:55.080 --> 23:57.360
 possible without killing the patient.

23:57.360 --> 24:04.880
 And it's being done by people who are wearing like mittens.

24:04.880 --> 24:09.640
 So I'm sure that there's a few folks listening to this

24:09.640 --> 24:12.280
 that are rolling their eyes and saying,

24:12.280 --> 24:15.640
 here we go again, two white guys talking

24:15.640 --> 24:20.600
 about the lack of institutional racism in America.

24:23.240 --> 24:27.800
 First of all, what would you like to tell them?

24:27.800 --> 24:32.000
 So our African American friends who are looking at this,

24:32.000 --> 24:34.480
 and I've gotten a chance to talk to a bunch of them

24:34.480 --> 24:35.800
 on Clubhouse recently.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.240
 Clubhouse is the social app.

24:37.240 --> 24:37.920
 Yeah, yeah, I know.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.800
 And I really enjoy it.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.240
 It's an absolute zoo of an app, as far as I can see.

24:41.240 --> 24:44.560
 I personally love it, because you get to talk to,

24:44.560 --> 24:48.080
 as somebody who's an introvert and doesn't socialize much,

24:48.080 --> 24:52.160
 I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life.

24:52.160 --> 24:55.560
 So it gave me a chance to, first of all, practice Russian

24:55.560 --> 24:58.200
 and Ukrainian to get the chance to do that.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.600
 Then you get a chance to talk about Israel and Palestine

25:00.600 --> 25:05.000
 with people who are from that part of the world.

25:05.000 --> 25:10.000
 And you get to hear raw emotion of people from the ground,

25:10.200 --> 25:14.080
 where they start screaming, they start crying,

25:14.080 --> 25:16.960
 they start being calm and collected and thoughtful.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.480
 And this is, as if you walked into a bar

25:20.480 --> 25:25.000
 with custom picked regular folks, in quotes, regular folks.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.200
 Just people that have, quote unquote, lived experiences,

25:29.200 --> 25:34.040
 real pain, real hope, real emotions, biases,

25:34.040 --> 25:36.120
 and you get to listen to them, go at it.

25:36.120 --> 25:39.720
 With no, because it's an audio app,

25:39.720 --> 25:43.600
 you're not allowed to start getting into a physical fistfight.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.240
 So even though it really sounds like people want it.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.560
 Sounds like it's happening, yeah.

25:47.560 --> 25:50.200
 Yeah, and so you get to really listen to that feeling.

25:50.200 --> 25:53.520
 And for example, it allows a white guy like me

25:53.520 --> 25:55.360
 from another part of the world,

25:55.360 --> 25:58.320
 coming from the former survey union,

25:58.320 --> 26:03.320
 to go into a room with a few hundred African Americans

26:03.320 --> 26:07.600
 screaming about Joe Rogan using the N word.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.960
 And I get to really listen.

26:08.960 --> 26:11.280
 There's very different perspectives on that

26:11.280 --> 26:13.000
 in the African American community.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.440
 And it's fascinating to listen.

26:14.440 --> 26:18.840
 So I don't get access to that by sort of excellent books

26:18.840 --> 26:20.280
 and articles and so on.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.240
 You get that real raw emotion.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.320
 And I'm just saying, there's a few of those folks

26:24.320 --> 26:27.560
 listening to this with that real raw emotion.

26:27.560 --> 26:32.560
 And one argument they say is you, Douglas Murray,

26:32.560 --> 26:35.280
 you, Lex Freeman, don't have the right

26:36.200 --> 26:38.800
 to talk about race and racism in America.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.560
 It is our struggle.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.560
 You are from a privileged class of people

26:42.560 --> 26:46.720
 that don't know what it's like

26:46.720 --> 26:49.040
 to be a black man or woman in America

26:49.040 --> 26:51.120
 walking down the street.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.920
 Can you steel man that case?

26:54.520 --> 26:56.160
 First of all, fuck that.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.920
 Okay, that's not, I think we need to define steel,

26:59.920 --> 27:01.080
 steel manning.

27:01.080 --> 27:04.000
 Okay, I know what steel manning is.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.320
 I really resent that form of argumentation.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.280
 I really resent it.

27:09.280 --> 27:11.760
 I have the right to talk about whatever the hell I want.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.680
 And no one's gonna stop me or try to intimidate me

27:14.680 --> 27:18.040
 or tell me that I can't simply because of my skin color.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.120
 And I think that if I said to somebody else

27:20.120 --> 27:23.320
 the other way around, it would be equally reprehensible.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.440
 If I said shut up, you have no right to criticize anything

27:26.440 --> 27:29.920
 that Douglas Murray says because you've not got my skin color.

27:29.920 --> 27:32.160
 Okay, it's not an exact comparison,

27:32.160 --> 27:36.320
 but seriously, is that a reasonable form of argument?

27:36.320 --> 27:37.440
 You haven't been through everything

27:37.440 --> 27:39.880
 I've been through in my life, therefore you can't comment.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.600
 No, in that case, nobody can talk about anything.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.200
 We might as well pack up, go home and isolate ourselves.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.920
 Strong words, but can you try to steel me on that case?

27:49.920 --> 27:51.280
 Not in this particular situation,

27:51.280 --> 27:56.040
 but there's people that have lived through something

27:57.160 --> 27:59.040
 that can comment in a very specific way.

27:59.040 --> 28:00.800
 Like for example, Holocaust survivors.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.640
 Yes.

28:03.160 --> 28:07.640
 There is a sense in which maybe a basic sense of civility

28:07.640 --> 28:09.680
 when a Holocaust survivor speaking

28:09.680 --> 28:12.200
 about their experience of the Holocaust,

28:12.200 --> 28:17.200
 then an intellectual from a very different part of the world

28:17.200 --> 28:21.600
 that's simply writing about nuanced geopolitics

28:21.600 --> 28:25.240
 of World War II just should not interrupt

28:25.240 --> 28:26.720
 the Holocaust survivor.

28:26.720 --> 28:27.880
 We physically interrupt them

28:27.880 --> 28:29.680
 if they're telling their stories.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.000
 With logic and reason,

28:32.000 --> 28:34.320
 that the experience of the Holocaust survivors

28:34.320 --> 28:38.200
 somehow fundamentally has a deeper understanding

28:38.200 --> 28:42.200
 of the humanity and the injustice of the...

28:42.200 --> 28:45.040
 First of all, again, we're even deeper waters now,

28:45.040 --> 28:48.440
 but in terms of wanting to listen to another person

28:48.440 --> 28:52.680
 who has experienced something, yes, yes.

28:52.680 --> 28:56.520
 But not endlessly, not endlessly.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.320
 I mean, there are some people who've written about that.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.040
 I mean, there are people who've written about the Holocaust

29:00.040 --> 29:02.280
 who didn't experience the Holocaust

29:02.280 --> 29:04.880
 and have written about it better than people who did.

29:05.880 --> 29:09.840
 It's not this idea that the lived experience

29:09.840 --> 29:12.240
 to use this terrible modern jargon

29:12.240 --> 29:14.080
 as if there's another type.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.360
 This idea that the lived experience

29:16.360 --> 29:20.680
 has to triumph over everything else is not always correct.

29:20.680 --> 29:23.720
 It can be correct in some circumstances.

29:23.720 --> 29:26.240
 If you are sitting in a room with a Holocaust survivor

29:26.240 --> 29:28.600
 and somebody who'd never heard about the Holocaust

29:28.600 --> 29:31.400
 and wanted to kind of shoot out their views on it,

29:32.280 --> 29:34.000
 yeah, one of those people should be heard

29:34.000 --> 29:36.280
 more than the other, obviously, obviously.

29:37.240 --> 29:40.040
 If there's somebody who's experienced racism firsthand

29:40.040 --> 29:42.960
 and there's somebody else who has never experienced it,

29:42.960 --> 29:45.320
 then obviously you'd want to hear from the person

29:45.320 --> 29:47.560
 who has experienced it firsthand.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.760
 If that is the discussion underway.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.920
 I don't think that it's the case

29:53.920 --> 29:56.000
 that that is endlessly the case.

29:57.120 --> 30:00.760
 I'm also highly reluctant to concede

30:00.760 --> 30:02.840
 that there are groups of people who by dint

30:02.840 --> 30:06.280
 of their skin color or anything else

30:06.280 --> 30:08.240
 get to dominate the microphone.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.520
 Now, of course, we're literally both speaking

30:09.520 --> 30:10.560
 to microphones at the moment,

30:10.560 --> 30:11.680
 so there's an irony to this,

30:11.680 --> 30:13.600
 but let's skate over the irony.

30:15.120 --> 30:17.960
 What I mean is people saying you don't have the right

30:17.960 --> 30:20.240
 to speak, I have the right to take the microphone

30:20.240 --> 30:23.280
 from you and speak because I know best.

30:23.280 --> 30:27.280
 Fine, if you know best, we'll argue it out

30:27.280 --> 30:29.920
 and someone will win long or short term.

30:31.360 --> 30:36.360
 But the almost aggressive tone

30:36.960 --> 30:40.320
 in which this is now leveled, I don't like the sound of,

30:41.240 --> 30:44.480
 nobody's experience is completely understandable

30:44.480 --> 30:47.440
 by another human being, nobody's.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.080
 And what many people are asking us to do at the moment,

30:50.080 --> 30:53.160
 us collectively is to fall for that thing.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.480
 I think it was Camille Foster who said it first,

30:55.480 --> 30:57.920
 but I've adopted it in recent years,

30:57.920 --> 31:01.200
 is to say you must spend an inordinate amount of your life

31:01.200 --> 31:04.080
 trying to understand me personally,

31:04.080 --> 31:07.000
 my lived experience, everything about me.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.200
 You should dedicate your life to trying to do that.

31:11.200 --> 31:14.240
 Simultaneously, you'll never understand me.

31:15.720 --> 31:17.860
 This is not an attractive invitation.

31:18.920 --> 31:22.720
 This is an unwinnable game.

31:22.720 --> 31:27.720
 So if somebody has a legitimate and important point

31:29.920 --> 31:32.200
 to make, they should make it and they will win through

31:32.200 --> 31:34.120
 whatever their character is or whatever their race.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.760
 And by the way, there are plenty of white people

31:35.760 --> 31:37.560
 who experience racism as well.

31:37.560 --> 31:40.960
 There are plenty of white people who do and have done

31:40.960 --> 31:42.880
 and increasingly so, which is one of the things

31:42.880 --> 31:44.640
 I write about from the war on the West.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.600
 I mean, I would argue that today in America,

31:47.600 --> 31:51.000
 the only group who are actually allowed to be consistently

31:51.000 --> 31:53.960
 vilely racist against the white people.

31:53.960 --> 31:57.080
 If you say discussing things about black people in America

31:57.080 --> 31:59.400
 in 2022, you will be over.

32:00.480 --> 32:01.960
 You will be over.

32:01.960 --> 32:05.000
 If you decide to talk about people's white tears,

32:05.000 --> 32:07.960
 their white female tears, their white guilt,

32:07.960 --> 32:10.560
 their white privilege, their white rage,

32:10.560 --> 32:13.880
 and all these other pseudo pathologizing terms,

32:13.880 --> 32:14.920
 you'll be just fine.

32:14.920 --> 32:17.140
 You could be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

32:17.140 --> 32:20.080
 You could lecture at Yale University, absolutely fine.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.200
 And the white people have to suck that up

32:22.200 --> 32:24.960
 as if that's fine because there was racism

32:24.960 --> 32:26.360
 in another direction in the past.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.840
 So white people can have racism as well.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.680
 Does that mean that I think that I have a right

32:30.680 --> 32:33.000
 or other white people have a right to dominate the discourse

32:33.000 --> 32:34.280
 by talking about their feelings

32:34.280 --> 32:37.500
 of having been the victims of racism?

32:37.500 --> 32:39.740
 No, not particularly, because what does that get us?

32:39.740 --> 32:41.880
 It gets us into an endless cycle

32:41.880 --> 32:43.560
 of competitive victimhood.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.960
 Am I saying that white people who've experienced violence

32:46.960 --> 32:49.840
 have experienced historically anything like the violence

32:49.840 --> 32:52.040
 that was perpetrated against black people in America,

32:52.040 --> 32:54.320
 historically, obviously not.

32:54.320 --> 32:59.200
 But what kind of competition do we want to enter here?

33:00.480 --> 33:05.040
 And this is very, very important to reign now in America

33:05.040 --> 33:06.960
 because there's one other thing I have to throw in there

33:06.960 --> 33:10.960
 which is how do you work out the sincerity of the claim?

33:11.920 --> 33:15.440
 How do you work out the sincerity of the claim being made?

33:15.440 --> 33:17.960
 At one point in this latest book,

33:17.960 --> 33:21.800
 I refer to a very useful bit in Nietzsche

33:21.800 --> 33:25.920
 and the genealogy of morals where, as you know,

33:25.920 --> 33:28.080
 Nietzsche always has to be treated carefully

33:28.080 --> 33:32.320
 when people say, I love Nietzsche, you know, which bits?

33:34.320 --> 33:36.520
 What exactly do you love about him?

33:37.800 --> 33:42.800
 But he, a lot can be learned from the answer.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.920
 But there are moments in genealogy of morals

33:46.920 --> 33:49.160
 that are very useful for this book.

33:49.160 --> 33:51.840
 One of them was the moment when Nietzsche used a phrase

33:51.840 --> 33:54.160
 that I've now stolen for myself, appropriated,

33:54.160 --> 33:58.400
 you might say, where he refers to people

33:58.400 --> 34:02.920
 who tear at wounds long since closed

34:02.920 --> 34:04.880
 and then cry about the pain they feel.

34:07.560 --> 34:12.560
 Now, how do you know whether the pain is real?

34:13.920 --> 34:15.400
 How do you know?

34:15.400 --> 34:19.400
 I'm not saying you can never know, but it's hard.

34:20.200 --> 34:22.680
 So when somebody says, I feel that my life

34:22.680 --> 34:24.640
 hasn't gone that well and it's because of something

34:24.640 --> 34:27.680
 that was done to my ancestors 200 years ago,

34:27.680 --> 34:29.720
 maybe they do feel that.

34:29.720 --> 34:32.000
 Maybe they're right to feel that.

34:32.000 --> 34:34.000
 Maybe they're making it up.

34:34.000 --> 34:37.360
 Maybe they're using it as their reason for failure in life.

34:37.360 --> 34:40.880
 Maybe they're using it as their reason to not even try.

34:40.880 --> 34:45.000
 Maybe they're using it as their reason to smoke weed all day.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.040
 I don't know, and who does know?

34:47.040 --> 34:48.960
 How can you work that out?

34:48.960 --> 34:50.800
 And that's why I come back to this thing of,

34:50.800 --> 34:54.480
 who are we to constantly judge in this society,

34:54.480 --> 34:56.920
 other people who we don't know

34:56.920 --> 35:00.960
 and attribute motives to them based on racial

35:00.960 --> 35:02.640
 or other characteristics?

35:03.840 --> 35:05.560
 And as you write in this part,

35:07.120 --> 35:10.680
 I like your cultural appropriation of Nietzsche

35:10.680 --> 35:14.960
 and at the same time, canceling Nietzsche

35:16.240 --> 35:17.840
 in the same set of sentences,

35:17.840 --> 35:20.480
 but you write in this part about evil.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.600
 No, I didn't cancel Nietzsche.

35:22.600 --> 35:25.640
 Well, I can't cancel Nietzsche, I was saying.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.080
 I was saying, treat him carefully.

35:27.080 --> 35:29.680
 Treat him carefully, fair enough.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.840
 But you can judge a man's character

35:31.840 --> 35:35.160
 by which parts of Nietzsche he quotes.

35:35.160 --> 35:36.560
 Fair enough, I think.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.560
 I think when you meet people who do man and Superman

35:38.560 --> 35:41.000
 a bit too much, you're in there.

35:41.000 --> 35:45.320
 Now you're pulling in even deeper water

35:45.320 --> 35:47.080
 referencing Hitler here.

35:47.080 --> 35:51.120
 Okay, so you write in this part of the book about evil.

35:53.240 --> 35:57.280
 Quote, what is it that drives evil?

35:57.280 --> 35:58.480
 Many things without doubt,

35:58.480 --> 36:00.080
 but one of them is identified

36:00.080 --> 36:04.400
 by several of the great philosophers is resentment.

36:04.400 --> 36:06.600
 That sentiment is one of the greatest drivers

36:06.600 --> 36:10.080
 of people who want to destroy colon,

36:10.080 --> 36:12.760
 blaming someone else for having something you believe

36:12.760 --> 36:14.160
 you deserve more.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.480
 And you're saying this kind of resentment,

36:17.480 --> 36:21.160
 we don't know as it surfaces, whether it's genuine

36:21.160 --> 36:26.160
 or if it's used to sort of play games of power to evil ends.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.760
 Can you speak to this?

36:30.760 --> 36:35.760
 Because it's such a fascinating idea that one of the biggest

36:36.680 --> 36:41.400
 drivers of evil in the world is resentment.

36:41.400 --> 36:45.040
 Because if you look at, boy, if you look at human history,

36:45.040 --> 36:48.520
 if you look at Hitler, so much of the propaganda,

36:48.520 --> 36:51.120
 so much of the narrative was about resentment.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.160
 So is that surface or is it level or is that deep?

36:55.160 --> 36:56.240
 The resentment that drives people?

36:56.240 --> 36:58.200
 It can be any of the above.

36:58.200 --> 37:00.880
 Let's first of all preface it, everybody has resentment.

37:02.640 --> 37:04.280
 I used the term, raison de mort,

37:04.280 --> 37:06.760
 which is sort of very similar to resentment,

37:06.760 --> 37:08.160
 let's stick with resentment.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.360
 So we don't sound too pretentious.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.240
 Let me give you a quick example of somebody in our own day

37:19.240 --> 37:22.720
 who has a form of resentment, Vladimir Putin.

37:23.880 --> 37:27.480
 Did you see Navalny's documentary, Putin's Palace?

37:27.480 --> 37:28.320
 Yes.

37:28.320 --> 37:32.320
 You remember the stuff about Putin as a young KGB officer

37:32.320 --> 37:34.760
 in Germany, remember the stuff about Putin,

37:34.760 --> 37:37.960
 his first wife's resentment of one of his KGB colleagues

37:37.960 --> 37:41.040
 who had an apartment that was a few meters bigger

37:41.040 --> 37:42.720
 than the Putin's apartment.

37:43.800 --> 37:45.560
 Yeah, it's very interesting.

37:45.560 --> 37:48.080
 And by the way, I'm not saying that, you know,

37:48.080 --> 37:49.800
 Vladimir Putin became the man he has become

37:49.800 --> 37:51.840
 and invaded Ukraine because he didn't have an apartment

37:51.840 --> 37:54.320
 he liked in Berlin or Munich or everywhere.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.160
 But it's just distinct possibility.

37:56.160 --> 38:01.160
 My point is that resentment is a factor in all human lives

38:03.360 --> 38:06.160
 and we all feel it in our lives.

38:06.160 --> 38:09.320
 And it's something that has to be struggled against.

38:10.560 --> 38:13.960
 Resentment is, in political terms, can be a deadly.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.680
 I mean, it's an incredibly deep thing to draw upon.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.000
 I mean, you mentioned Hitler.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.400
 Obviously one of the things that Hitler played on

38:21.400 --> 38:23.000
 was resentment, obviously.

38:23.000 --> 38:27.080
 Almost every revolutionary does.

38:27.080 --> 38:28.920
 I mean, the French revolutionaries did as well.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.600
 And we're not without cause.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.880
 It's a good reason to feel that Versailles

38:33.880 --> 38:38.040
 was not listening to Paris in the 1780s

38:38.040 --> 38:41.680
 and feel resentment for Marie Antoinette

38:41.680 --> 38:44.200
 in her palace within the palace,

38:44.200 --> 38:47.360
 ignoring the bread shortages in Paris.

38:47.360 --> 38:52.360
 So resentment is a very understandable thing

38:53.000 --> 38:54.960
 and sometimes it's justifiable.

38:54.960 --> 38:59.040
 And it's also deadly to the person as it is to the society.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.680
 It's an incredibly deep sentiment.

39:01.680 --> 39:05.040
 Somebody else has got something that you should have.

39:06.000 --> 39:09.240
 And the problem about it is that it has the potential

39:09.240 --> 39:10.080
 to be endless.

39:11.160 --> 39:13.160
 You can do it your whole life.

39:13.160 --> 39:16.280
 And one of the ways I've sort of found myself

39:16.280 --> 39:18.400
 explaining this to people is to say,

39:18.400 --> 39:20.320
 it's also important to recognize that resentment

39:20.320 --> 39:23.320
 is something that can cross absolutely every boundary.

39:24.200 --> 39:27.560
 So for instance, it crosses all racial boundaries,

39:27.560 --> 39:30.320
 obviously is how it goes without saying.

39:30.320 --> 39:32.760
 More interesting is it crosses all class boundaries

39:32.760 --> 39:34.560
 and socioeconomic boundaries.

39:35.480 --> 39:38.120
 And if I was to sort of simplify this thought,

39:38.120 --> 39:41.560
 I would say, I guess that you and I

39:41.560 --> 39:46.240
 and everybody watching knows or has known somebody

39:46.240 --> 39:51.240
 in their lives who has almost nothing in worldly terms

39:53.520 --> 39:57.040
 and is a generous person, a kindly person,

39:57.040 --> 40:02.040
 a giving person, a happy person, even a cheerful person.

40:03.320 --> 40:06.480
 And I think we probably have also,

40:06.480 --> 40:07.920
 or many of us would have met people

40:07.920 --> 40:11.600
 who seem to have everything and who are filled

40:11.600 --> 40:14.640
 with resentment, filled with resentment.

40:14.640 --> 40:16.400
 Somebody else has held them back from something.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.400
 Their sister once did something.

40:18.400 --> 40:21.200
 She got this and I should have got that.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.440
 And on and on and on.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.200
 It's a human trait.

40:25.200 --> 40:28.400
 And one of the things that suggests to me is

40:28.400 --> 40:30.840
 that we therefore have a choice in our lives about this.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.320
 This is something which we can do something about,

40:33.320 --> 40:34.840
 not limitlessly.

40:35.760 --> 40:39.080
 But for instance, I mean, there are very good reasons

40:39.080 --> 40:42.480
 that some people in their lives might feel resentment.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.320
 Let's say you're involved in a car crash

40:45.320 --> 40:47.760
 and a friend fell asleep at the wheel

40:47.760 --> 40:49.960
 and that's why you are spending the rest of your life

40:49.960 --> 40:51.400
 in a wheelchair.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.560
 It's a pertinent example of this in American politics

40:53.560 --> 40:54.400
 at the moment.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.320
 You would be justified in feeling resentment.

41:00.280 --> 41:03.160
 And at some point you have to make a decision which is,

41:03.160 --> 41:08.160
 am I going to be that person or a different person?

41:08.320 --> 41:11.080
 But even in that case, you're saying at the individual level

41:11.080 --> 41:13.800
 and that societal level is destructive to the mind.

41:13.800 --> 41:16.080
 Even when you're, quote unquote, justified.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.400
 It rots you.

41:17.400 --> 41:20.880
 It rots you because the best you can do

41:21.960 --> 41:25.760
 is to eke out your days unfulfilled.

41:27.120 --> 41:30.080
 So the antidote, as you describe, is gratitude.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.080
 Yes.

41:31.080 --> 41:35.640
 Gratitude is the antidote to evil, in a sense.

41:35.640 --> 41:37.440
 So gratitude is the individual level

41:37.440 --> 41:38.360
 and the societal level.

41:38.360 --> 41:41.240
 Gratitude is certainly the answer to resentment.

41:41.240 --> 41:44.640
 I quote in The War on the West this,

41:44.640 --> 41:47.000
 but when I read it the first time a few years ago

41:47.000 --> 41:51.200
 I was absolutely floored by the brothers Karamazov.

41:52.440 --> 41:53.400
 Not everything in it, by the way,

41:53.400 --> 41:54.520
 when I won't get into it,

41:54.520 --> 41:59.520
 but I have some very big structural criticisms of the novel.

41:59.680 --> 42:01.560
 Now you're just sweet talking to me

42:01.560 --> 42:04.920
 because I'm a Dostoyevsky fan, but I appreciate this.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.280
 Oh, okay.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.600
 Well, we could get into what I see as big structural flaws

42:08.600 --> 42:10.360
 in the brothers Karamazov, but anyway.

42:10.360 --> 42:12.240
 Now I'm offended and triggered.

42:12.240 --> 42:17.000
 Yeah, no, I mean, this is coming out of Macbeth

42:17.000 --> 42:19.040
 and saying I didn't think it was much good.

42:19.040 --> 42:20.760
 Yeah, there's structural flaws.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.160
 Yeah, I thought the ending stank.

42:23.160 --> 42:24.000
 Yeah.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.840
 The middle wasn't very good.

42:24.840 --> 42:28.120
 No, when I read that novel,

42:28.120 --> 42:30.040
 I was floored by a couple of things.

42:30.040 --> 42:32.160
 One is, of course, at the moment

42:32.160 --> 42:34.000
 where we realize the devil appears.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.840
 The moment that Yvan says to his brother,

42:36.840 --> 42:40.000
 you know he visits me and you realize that

42:40.000 --> 42:41.280
 he's talking about the devil,

42:41.280 --> 42:46.280
 the whole novel goes into this totally different space.

42:46.840 --> 42:49.240
 Anyway, it's even more than you've already

42:49.240 --> 42:50.960
 realized the novel's about.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.000
 And then when the conversation occurs

42:53.000 --> 42:55.840
 between Yvan and the devil, remember,

42:55.840 --> 43:00.840
 I think he describes him as dressed in the French style

43:00.840 --> 43:06.120
 of the early part of the 90th century.

43:06.120 --> 43:07.720
 Very strange that the devil will be dressed like that,

43:07.720 --> 43:08.560
 but sort of.

43:10.880 --> 43:13.640
 And if you remember that he's sort of crossed the legs

43:13.640 --> 43:15.120
 and rather a bane figure.

43:16.160 --> 43:19.640
 But the devil mentions impassing to Yvan

43:19.640 --> 43:23.160
 that he says, I don't know why gratitude

43:23.160 --> 43:27.360
 is not an interesting thing that's being given to me.

43:27.360 --> 43:32.160
 And you're not allowed,

43:32.160 --> 43:35.880
 this is not, given the role of being the devil,

43:35.880 --> 43:37.240
 this is not one of the things.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.080
 It's not one of the things.

43:38.080 --> 43:39.240
 And you think, and of course,

43:39.240 --> 43:42.080
 only a genius of Dostoevsky's stature could,

43:42.080 --> 43:44.440
 I mean, the lesser genius would have made

43:44.440 --> 43:46.200
 a whole novel out of that insight.

43:47.080 --> 43:49.320
 Only Dostoevsky can just throw it away

43:49.320 --> 43:51.400
 because there's such an abundance of riches

43:51.400 --> 43:54.360
 that he still has to get through the structural problems

43:54.360 --> 43:59.360
 on the side, but the passive aggressive nature,

44:00.640 --> 44:04.360
 the microaggression in this conversation is palpable.

44:06.040 --> 44:07.720
 A little knife fight, okay?

44:07.720 --> 44:10.000
 No, but the reason I mentioned it is because of course,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.480
 when I saw it, this is such a brilliant insight

44:13.480 --> 44:16.960
 by Dostoevsky because why would gratitude

44:16.960 --> 44:19.960
 not be a sentiment that the devil was capable of?

44:19.960 --> 44:21.440
 The answer is, of course,

44:21.440 --> 44:23.800
 that if the devil was capable of gratitude,

44:23.800 --> 44:27.200
 he wouldn't be the devil, he'd be somebody else.

44:28.760 --> 44:31.480
 He has to be incapable of gratitude.

44:31.480 --> 44:32.840
 Do you think for Dostoevsky,

44:32.840 --> 44:36.720
 that was as strong of an insight as it is for you?

44:36.720 --> 44:39.440
 Because I think that's a really powerful idea

44:39.440 --> 44:43.880
 that with gratitude, you don't get the resentment

44:43.880 --> 44:46.080
 that rots you from the core.

44:46.080 --> 44:48.920
 Yes, I think it was one of the just endless things

44:48.920 --> 44:50.800
 that he saw in us.

44:50.800 --> 44:54.040
 And the way I put it is that, I mean,

44:54.040 --> 44:57.920
 I also think of it in terms of the era of deconstruction,

44:57.920 --> 44:59.520
 which is one of the things I'd like us to call

44:59.520 --> 45:00.920
 the era that's now ending.

45:02.440 --> 45:05.920
 The era of deconstruction was the era that started,

45:05.920 --> 45:08.400
 let's say, from the 60s onwards,

45:08.400 --> 45:11.720
 and was originally an academic game

45:11.720 --> 45:13.760
 that then spilled out into the wider culture,

45:13.760 --> 45:17.000
 which was, let's take everything apart,

45:17.000 --> 45:18.280
 let's pull it all apart.

45:18.280 --> 45:20.920
 And there are lots of problems with it.

45:20.920 --> 45:22.240
 One is it's quite boring.

45:23.120 --> 45:25.720
 You don't get an awful lot from it.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.800
 You also have the problem of what children find

45:30.800 --> 45:32.600
 when they try to do this with bicycles,

45:32.600 --> 45:34.480
 which is they can take it apart quite easily,

45:34.480 --> 45:36.280
 but they can't put it back together.

45:38.160 --> 45:43.160
 And the era of taking things apart as a game

45:45.280 --> 45:46.280
 is one we've lived through,

45:46.280 --> 45:48.200
 and it's been highly destructive.

45:48.200 --> 45:50.560
 But you can do it for quite a long time.

45:51.560 --> 45:53.120
 I'm going to look at this society,

45:53.120 --> 45:54.560
 and I'm going to take it apart

45:54.560 --> 45:56.640
 by showing systemic problems.

45:56.640 --> 46:00.400
 I'm going to, at the end of that, what have you got?

46:00.400 --> 46:01.240
 What have you done?

46:01.240 --> 46:03.160
 What have you achieved?

46:03.160 --> 46:05.440
 We need to interrogate this.

46:05.440 --> 46:07.440
 Okay, interrogate, by all means, ask questions,

46:07.440 --> 46:11.160
 but interrogate as a deliberate hostility to this.

46:11.160 --> 46:13.320
 I'm going to interrogate this thing and take it apart.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.600
 And again, at the end of it, what have you got?

46:15.600 --> 46:20.600
 Whether you're interrogating a text or a piece of music

46:21.160 --> 46:24.520
 or an idea or a society, fine.

46:24.520 --> 46:26.280
 Question, endlessly question.

46:26.280 --> 46:31.280
 Yes, interrogate assumes it's all a criminal in a cell,

46:33.520 --> 46:37.640
 and it's guilty, and therefore it must be taken apart.

46:37.640 --> 46:41.120
 And that's what we've been doing for decades in the West.

46:41.120 --> 46:43.760
 And that's resentment.

46:43.760 --> 46:46.200
 That's one byproduct of resentment.

46:46.200 --> 46:49.720
 You can't build the thing, but you know how to take it apart.

46:51.000 --> 46:53.480
 Is a little bit of resentment good?

46:53.480 --> 46:56.960
 So you have, you know, that, I love Tom Waits,

46:56.960 --> 47:00.240
 and he has a song where a little drop,

47:00.240 --> 47:03.000
 I like my Tom with a little drop of poison.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.280
 Is it good to do that?

47:05.280 --> 47:08.320
 Is it good to have a little bit of poison in your drink?

47:08.320 --> 47:09.600
 Depends on what the poison is,

47:09.600 --> 47:12.080
 and it depends if you know not to have another drink.

47:12.080 --> 47:16.120
 It might be the case you find out as some alcoholics do

47:16.120 --> 47:19.760
 that one was too many and 10 is not enough.

47:21.120 --> 47:24.160
 So there's a natural, in this case,

47:25.040 --> 47:27.800
 this kind of deconstruction is a slippery slope.

47:27.800 --> 47:29.800
 It becomes an addiction, becomes a drug,

47:29.800 --> 47:31.080
 and you just can't stop.

47:31.080 --> 47:32.880
 Well, you'd have to wean yourself off it

47:32.880 --> 47:34.600
 and try to start creating again.

47:35.560 --> 47:38.120
 You'd have to start trying to put things together again.

47:38.120 --> 47:43.120
 Something I think might be in the throes of starting

47:45.160 --> 47:46.000
 as it happens.

47:46.880 --> 47:51.320
 Well, speaking of taking things apart

47:51.320 --> 47:53.480
 and not putting them together again,

47:53.480 --> 47:55.640
 the idea of critical race theory.

47:58.160 --> 48:02.200
 Can you to me explain, so I'm an engineer

48:02.200 --> 48:05.040
 and have not been actually paying attention much,

48:05.040 --> 48:07.440
 unfortunately, to these things.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.760
 None of the people in your field were

48:08.760 --> 48:11.200
 until it comes along and smacks you in the face.

48:11.200 --> 48:16.200
 I've had that line of thinking from MIT.

48:17.640 --> 48:21.560
 I said, well, surely whatever you folks are busy

48:21.560 --> 48:24.440
 about yelling at each other for is a thing

48:24.440 --> 48:26.080
 at Harvard and Yale.

48:26.080 --> 48:27.040
 It's not going to be.

48:27.040 --> 48:28.800
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.

48:28.800 --> 48:31.400
 People in the STEM subjects thought it's not coming for us.

48:31.400 --> 48:33.680
 It can't come to us, and bang.

48:33.680 --> 48:36.880
 Well, it hasn't quite been a bang, I'm not sure.

48:36.880 --> 48:39.600
 Engineering is more safe than others.

48:39.600 --> 48:43.040
 Yeah, so let's draw a line now

48:43.040 --> 48:45.440
 between engineering and science.

48:45.440 --> 48:50.400
 So I think engineering is, I'm sitting in a castle

48:50.400 --> 48:53.480
 in the tallest tower with my pinky out drinking

48:53.480 --> 48:57.600
 my martini saying, surely the peasants below

48:57.600 --> 49:00.640
 with their biology and their humanities

49:00.640 --> 49:02.440
 will figure it all out.

49:02.440 --> 49:03.280
 No, I'm just kidding.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.440
 There's no pinky out.

49:04.440 --> 49:07.400
 I drink vodka and I hang with the peasants.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.720
 Okay, whereas this metaphor has gone too far.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.480
 Can you explain to this engineer

49:14.480 --> 49:16.400
 what critical race theory is?

49:16.400 --> 49:19.440
 Is it a term that's definable?

49:19.440 --> 49:20.760
 Is there a tradition?

49:20.760 --> 49:21.520
 Is there a history?

49:21.520 --> 49:22.640
 What is good about it?

49:22.640 --> 49:23.800
 What is bad about it?

49:23.800 --> 49:25.120
 It is a tradition.

49:25.120 --> 49:25.960
 It is a history.

49:25.960 --> 49:26.800
 It's a school of thought.

49:26.800 --> 49:30.240
 It started in the law roughly in the 1970s

49:30.240 --> 49:32.680
 and some of the American Academy.

49:32.680 --> 49:36.720
 It spilled out, it always aimed to be an activist philosophy.

49:36.720 --> 49:39.920
 People deny that now, but as I cite in the war on the West

49:39.920 --> 49:42.640
 and the foundational texts say as much,

49:42.640 --> 49:47.640
 this is an activist academic study.

49:48.240 --> 49:50.600
 We're not just looking at the law,

49:50.600 --> 49:52.200
 we seek to change the law.

49:53.600 --> 49:56.200
 And it's spilled out into all of the other disciplines.

49:56.200 --> 49:57.640
 I think there's a reason for that, by the way,

49:57.640 --> 49:58.760
 which is it happened at the time

49:58.760 --> 50:00.520
 that the humanities and others in America

50:00.520 --> 50:03.640
 were increasingly weak and didn't know what to do

50:03.640 --> 50:06.840
 and they needed more games to play or new games to play.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.400
 The psychologist got bored.

50:09.400 --> 50:12.760
 Yeah, I mean, well, they needed tenure

50:12.760 --> 50:14.600
 and they needed something to do.

50:14.600 --> 50:16.880
 And I mean, it's not an original observation.

50:16.880 --> 50:17.800
 Plenty of people have made this,

50:17.800 --> 50:19.720
 but I mean, Neil Ferguson said this some time ago,

50:19.720 --> 50:23.440
 for instance, that in the last 50 years

50:23.440 --> 50:26.400
 in American academia, certainly in humanities departments,

50:26.400 --> 50:29.920
 when somebody dies out as a great scholar or something,

50:29.920 --> 50:33.320
 that's just not replaced by somebody of equal stature.

50:33.320 --> 50:36.080
 They're replaced by somebody who does theory

50:36.080 --> 50:38.080
 or critical race theory.

50:38.080 --> 50:41.560
 They're replaced by somebody who does the modern games.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.480
 Somebody dies out who's a great historian of, say,

50:44.480 --> 50:46.960
 I don't know, it's once in my mind,

50:46.960 --> 50:48.720
 Russian history or Russian literature.

50:48.720 --> 50:53.160
 And they're not replaced by a similar scholar.

50:53.160 --> 50:55.840
 In his observation and in yours,

50:55.840 --> 50:57.680
 is this a recent development?

50:57.680 --> 50:59.960
 It's happened in the last few decades for sure.

50:59.960 --> 51:01.560
 And it's sped up.

51:01.560 --> 51:02.960
 Is it because we've gotten to the bottom

51:02.960 --> 51:05.000
 of some of the biggest questions of history?

51:05.000 --> 51:08.320
 No, it's because we're willing to forget the big questions.

51:09.320 --> 51:12.200
 Because it's more fun to, big questions are as fun.

51:12.200 --> 51:13.880
 No, partly it's a, partly it's,

51:13.880 --> 51:15.520
 no, I should stress that partly isn't,

51:15.520 --> 51:17.680
 this is in the weeds, but partly it's a result

51:17.680 --> 51:19.960
 of hyper specialization in academia.

51:21.360 --> 51:24.400
 You know, if you said you'd like to

51:24.400 --> 51:27.960
 write your dissertation on Hobbes.

51:27.960 --> 51:31.480
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:31.480 --> 51:33.960
 If you wanted to, if you,

51:35.920 --> 51:39.080
 something central to Kant's thought or Hegel or something,

51:39.080 --> 51:42.320
 I mean, that's not popular.

51:42.320 --> 51:45.920
 That what's popular is to take somebody way down the line

51:45.920 --> 51:47.320
 from that because there's a feeling

51:47.320 --> 51:48.800
 that that's all been done.

51:49.920 --> 51:52.440
 So you take something way, way, way down the line

51:52.440 --> 51:54.240
 from that that's much less important

51:54.240 --> 51:56.040
 and then you sort of play with that.

51:57.200 --> 51:58.960
 And I think most people, anyone who's watching

51:58.960 --> 52:01.000
 who's being in a philosophy department

52:01.000 --> 52:04.360
 or anything else in recent years will know that tendency.

52:04.360 --> 52:06.920
 By the way, there's a very practical consequence of this.

52:06.920 --> 52:09.040
 I saw this at the end of my friend Roger Scruton's life

52:09.040 --> 52:11.360
 when he, he would occasionally,

52:11.360 --> 52:13.600
 he didn't get tenure at universities,

52:13.600 --> 52:15.720
 but he would occasionally be flown in

52:15.720 --> 52:18.240
 even by his enemies to teach courses

52:18.240 --> 52:21.000
 in various universities in basics of philosophy

52:21.000 --> 52:24.400
 because there was no one in the department able to do it.

52:24.400 --> 52:28.600
 Like he would go in and teach for a semester,

52:29.520 --> 52:34.040
 you know, Hegel and Kant and Schopenhauer and others

52:34.040 --> 52:36.160
 because there was no one to do it

52:36.160 --> 52:38.120
 because they were all playing with the things

52:38.120 --> 52:40.680
 way, way, way down the road from this.

52:40.680 --> 52:43.000
 So that had already happened

52:43.000 --> 52:45.280
 and people were searching for new games to play

52:45.280 --> 52:48.840
 and the critical race theory stuff forced its way in

52:48.840 --> 52:52.520
 partly in the way that all of this

52:52.520 --> 52:54.520
 that's now known as anti racism does,

52:54.520 --> 52:56.760
 which is in a sort of bullying tone

52:56.760 --> 52:58.200
 of saying if you don't follow this,

52:58.200 --> 53:01.480
 it's the same way that all the things that are called studies,

53:01.480 --> 53:03.280
 I think everything called studies

53:03.280 --> 53:06.920
 and the humanities should be shut down.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.680
 Because of the activist element.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.800
 It's an act, they're all activists.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.760
 Gay studies and queer studies,

53:14.560 --> 53:17.400
 nothing good has ever come from it, nothing good.

53:17.400 --> 53:21.400
 To push back, is it obvious that activism

53:21.400 --> 53:24.720
 is a sign of a flaw in a discipline?

53:24.720 --> 53:26.040
 So isn't it?

53:26.040 --> 53:27.840
 It's a sign of the death of the discipline.

53:27.840 --> 53:29.800
 It's a sign that the discipline's over.

53:29.800 --> 53:33.000
 But isn't it a good goal to have for discipline

53:33.000 --> 53:36.480
 to enact change, positive change in the world?

53:36.480 --> 53:40.200
 Or is that too, is that that's for politicians

53:40.200 --> 53:43.240
 to do with the findings of science?

53:43.240 --> 53:46.080
 I mean, why create an ideology

53:46.080 --> 53:48.200
 and then set out to find disciplines

53:48.200 --> 53:49.960
 that are weakly put together

53:49.960 --> 53:53.560
 to try to back up your political ideology.

53:53.560 --> 53:58.560
 So ideology should not be part of science or of humanities.

54:00.400 --> 54:04.760
 Why would you, I mean, anyone could do it.

54:05.640 --> 54:09.520
 You could decide to go in and be wildly right wing

54:09.520 --> 54:11.320
 about something and only do things

54:11.320 --> 54:13.720
 that prove your right wing ideas.

54:13.720 --> 54:16.280
 Be fantastically antiacademic,

54:16.280 --> 54:18.400
 fantastically anti science.

54:18.400 --> 54:23.400
 It's an absurd way to mix up activism and academia.

54:25.560 --> 54:26.960
 And it's absolutely right.

54:26.960 --> 54:28.760
 And Critical Race Theory is one of the ones

54:28.760 --> 54:31.680
 that completely polluted the academy.

54:31.680 --> 54:34.320
 Yeah, and there's been dark moments throughout history,

54:34.320 --> 54:38.040
 both for during World War II with both communism

54:38.040 --> 54:43.040
 and Nazism, fascism, that infiltrated science,

54:44.400 --> 54:45.920
 and then they've corrupted it.

54:45.920 --> 54:48.920
 Yes, I mean, for instance, also, let's face it,

54:48.920 --> 54:50.560
 in science, as in everything else,

54:50.560 --> 54:53.720
 there are dark, difficult things.

54:53.720 --> 54:55.840
 It's much better we know about them, face up to them

54:55.840 --> 54:59.240
 and try to find a way socially to deal with them

54:59.240 --> 55:02.640
 than that you leave them in the hands of some activist

55:02.640 --> 55:04.960
 who wants to do stuff with them.

55:04.960 --> 55:07.720
 Some of my best friends are activists.

55:07.720 --> 55:09.040
 I'm just kidding, okay.

55:09.040 --> 55:11.240
 And none of my best friends are activists.

55:11.240 --> 55:12.480
 That's how it should be.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.880
 Well, I was kidding because I don't have any friends,

55:15.880 --> 55:20.880
 but okay, no, I'm trying to gain some pity points.

55:22.920 --> 55:24.600
 Okay, so to return.

55:24.600 --> 55:27.000
 You have your clubhouse friends.

55:27.000 --> 55:31.280
 Screaming away like deranged maniacs.

55:31.280 --> 55:32.400
 No, I'm anti clubhouse, by the way,

55:32.400 --> 55:33.640
 because at the only time I heard it

55:33.640 --> 55:36.360
 was that Brett Weinstein won when he did that.

55:36.360 --> 55:38.320
 And I don't know if you heard that early in clubhouse.

55:38.320 --> 55:40.040
 I was invited to clubhouse with various people.

55:40.040 --> 55:41.600
 He said, oh, this is a really great civilized way

55:41.600 --> 55:43.640
 to hang out and talk with interesting people.

55:43.640 --> 55:46.440
 And I downloaded the app and I got on one night

55:46.440 --> 55:48.560
 and because Brett Weinstein said,

55:48.560 --> 55:49.600
 you know, I'm doing this conversation

55:49.600 --> 55:53.520
 and I listened and it was the maddest damn discussion

55:53.520 --> 55:54.360
 I've ever heard.

55:54.360 --> 55:55.640
 Was it something about biology?

55:55.640 --> 55:59.080
 Something about, was it COVID times or that?

55:59.080 --> 56:04.080
 At some point, Brett said I'm an evolutionary biologist

56:04.080 --> 56:08.080
 and somebody else started saying, you're a eugenicist.

56:08.080 --> 56:11.080
 And he said, no, I'm an evil eugenicist.

56:11.080 --> 56:13.520
 And I said, that's the same thing.

56:13.520 --> 56:15.200
 And it just went on like that.

56:15.200 --> 56:17.440
 And Brett desperately tried to explain

56:17.440 --> 56:20.200
 that's not the same thing as being a eugenicist

56:20.200 --> 56:22.600
 and he lost the clubhouse room.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.360
 They thought that was the same thing.

56:24.360 --> 56:27.800
 He'd come, it horribly reminded me of a time some years ago

56:27.800 --> 56:30.520
 when a British newspaper ran a sort of,

56:30.520 --> 56:33.280
 realizing that the only thing you can unite people on

56:33.280 --> 56:36.680
 in sexual ethics is revulsion against pedophilia,

56:36.680 --> 56:39.160
 ran an anti pedo campaign.

56:39.160 --> 56:43.640
 And shortly after, pediatricians offices were torched

56:43.640 --> 56:48.160
 in north of England by a mob who hadn't read the whole sign.

56:48.160 --> 56:49.000
 Yeah.

56:49.000 --> 56:52.200
 Well, to me, like I said,

56:52.200 --> 56:54.240
 a little bit of poison is good for the town.

56:54.240 --> 56:55.080
 So.

56:55.080 --> 56:57.200
 Anyhow, sorry, I interrupted you with flattering you

56:57.200 --> 56:58.040
 with people on clubhouse.

56:58.040 --> 57:02.400
 I have many, I have multiples of friends, yes.

57:02.400 --> 57:07.400
 We didn't get to some of the ideas of critical race theory.

57:09.520 --> 57:11.960
 What exactly is it?

57:11.960 --> 57:14.480
 I'm actually in part asking this question quite genuinely.

57:14.480 --> 57:15.320
 Yeah.

57:15.320 --> 57:17.600
 It's an attempt to look at everything

57:17.600 --> 57:20.240
 among other things through the lens of race

57:20.240 --> 57:24.400
 and to add race into things where it may not be

57:24.400 --> 57:26.240
 as a way of adding,

57:26.240 --> 57:30.080
 I'm trying to give the most generous estimation,

57:30.080 --> 57:32.440
 to add race in as a conversation in a place

57:32.440 --> 57:35.200
 where it may not have been in the conversation.

57:37.000 --> 57:38.640
 And that means history too?

57:38.640 --> 57:40.480
 The history of racism.

57:40.480 --> 57:41.920
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

57:41.920 --> 57:43.360
 All history.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.960
 And to look at it through these particular lenses.

57:48.160 --> 57:50.160
 I mean, there's a certain,

57:50.160 --> 57:51.920
 like all these things, there's a certain logic in it,

57:51.920 --> 57:55.000
 like with feminist studies or something.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.320
 I mean, is there a utility in looking back

57:57.320 --> 57:59.920
 through undoubtedly male dominated histories

57:59.920 --> 58:03.640
 and asking whether the more silent female voice was,

58:03.640 --> 58:08.440
 yes, very interesting, not endlessly interesting

58:08.440 --> 58:12.800
 and can't be put exactly on the same par as,

58:12.800 --> 58:14.880
 but it has a utility.

58:16.680 --> 58:18.680
 It's that endlessly, sorry to interrupt that,

58:18.680 --> 58:21.600
 endlessly part that seems to get us into trouble or like it.

58:21.600 --> 58:24.320
 Well, because of this thing of where do you stop?

58:24.320 --> 58:29.320
 And that's always a, I talked about this in my last book

58:30.920 --> 58:32.440
 in The Manors of Crowds.

58:32.440 --> 58:35.560
 It's one of the big conundrums in activist movements

58:35.560 --> 58:38.520
 and particularly in activist academia.

58:38.520 --> 58:39.360
 Where would you stop?

58:39.360 --> 58:42.080
 It's not clear because you've got a job in it.

58:42.080 --> 58:44.000
 You've got a pension in it.

58:44.000 --> 58:48.480
 You've got, your only esteem in society

58:48.480 --> 58:50.280
 is in keeping this gig going.

58:50.280 --> 58:55.280
 Well, I mean, is there any likelihood?

58:55.640 --> 58:58.120
 Have you ever, there's the old academic joke, isn't it?

58:58.120 --> 59:00.080
 That, you know, the end of every conference,

59:00.080 --> 59:01.520
 the only thing everyone agrees on is

59:01.520 --> 59:03.920
 that we must have another conference like this one.

59:05.200 --> 59:07.280
 It's the one thing they always agree on.

59:07.280 --> 59:09.760
 This conference is so great, we must have another one.

59:09.760 --> 59:11.320
 Well, that's a criticism you could apply

59:11.320 --> 59:12.480
 to a lot of disciplines.

59:12.480 --> 59:15.480
 Of course, civil engineering, bridge building.

59:15.480 --> 59:19.080
 At a certain point, do we need any more bridges?

59:19.080 --> 59:20.760
 Can we just fly everywhere?

59:21.920 --> 59:23.600
 Well, at the very least,

59:23.600 --> 59:26.080
 you need to keep the bridges up.

59:26.080 --> 59:28.480
 Sure, and they would, critical race theory,

59:28.480 --> 59:30.920
 folks would probably make the same argument

59:30.920 --> 59:33.680
 that at the very least, we need to keep the racism out.

59:34.880 --> 59:37.680
 We have to make sure we don't descend into the racism.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.800
 It assumes all the time that we are living

59:39.800 --> 59:42.280
 on the cusp of the return of the KKK.

59:42.280 --> 59:43.120
 Right.

59:43.120 --> 59:44.560
 Which is totally wrong.

59:44.560 --> 59:45.520
 I mean, it's a massive.

59:45.520 --> 59:49.920
 You say that now until the KKK armies march in.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.480
 We don't always, we can't always predict the future.

59:52.480 --> 59:53.800
 We can't always predict the future,

59:53.800 --> 59:58.400
 and you can always say you should be careful,

59:58.400 --> 1:00:02.680
 but you've also got to be careful of people

1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:05.280
 who've got their timing like totally, totally wrong

1:00:05.280 --> 1:00:06.920
 or the estimation of the society they're in.

1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:11.920
 You mean like most of society before in the 1930s

1:00:11.920 --> 1:00:16.920
 when Hitler was, I mean, so many people got Hitler wrong.

1:00:17.160 --> 1:00:18.160
 Sure they did.

1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:19.000
 And so.

1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:19.840
 Most people.

1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:23.720
 So maybe it was nice to have the alarmist thinking there.

1:00:23.720 --> 1:00:27.680
 Well, beware of the man with the mustache.

1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:28.520
 Yes.

1:00:28.520 --> 1:00:29.840
 If only it was that easy.

1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:33.320
 It's not always a biofacial here.

1:00:33.320 --> 1:00:36.640
 I always say that, I mean, one of the very often is

1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:39.280
 these two clean shaven chaps both say,

1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:40.240
 one of the problems of everybody

1:00:40.240 --> 1:00:42.680
 knowing a little bit about Nazism

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:47.680
 is that they think that they know where evil comes from

1:00:48.280 --> 1:00:52.160
 and that it comes from like a German with a small moustache

1:00:52.160 --> 1:00:54.840
 getting people to goose step, for instance.

1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:56.320
 And that's not correct.

1:00:57.240 --> 1:00:59.640
 A much better understanding of it is

1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:03.160
 it can come from all number of directions

1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:06.280
 and keep your antennae as good as you can.

1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:09.640
 But once you end up in this society

1:01:09.640 --> 1:01:11.960
 which I would argue certainly parts of America

1:01:11.960 --> 1:01:15.080
 where you're always in 1938,

1:01:15.080 --> 1:01:17.960
 that's not healthy for a society either.

1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:20.000
 Where people are so primed

1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.080
 and think they're so well trained

1:01:22.080 --> 1:01:25.880
 because they spent a term in school

1:01:25.880 --> 1:01:28.160
 learning about the Second World War and the Holocaust.

1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:30.960
 Think they're so well trained in Hitler spotting

1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:33.040
 that they can do it all the time.

1:01:33.040 --> 1:01:35.360
 Look at all these phrases we now have in our societies

1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:36.560
 like dog whistle.

1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:38.920
 You know, as I always say, if you hear the whistle,

1:01:38.920 --> 1:01:40.160
 you're the dog.

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.360
 But people say, that's a dog whistle

1:01:43.360 --> 1:01:46.520
 as if they're highly trained anti Nazis.

1:01:47.560 --> 1:01:49.680
 I mean, you know, there should be some humility

1:01:49.680 --> 1:01:52.840
 that we should be careful, we should be wary for sure.

1:01:54.320 --> 1:01:57.240
 And we should also be slightly humble

1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:01.600
 in our inability to spot everything.

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:04.000
 If not significantly humble.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.280
 Right, so if we can,

1:02:10.920 --> 1:02:15.440
 there's something funny if not dark

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:19.880
 about the activity of Hitler spotting.

1:02:19.880 --> 1:02:21.520
 If I just may take it aside.

1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:26.520
 But so critical race theory, how much racism,

1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:28.720
 what is racism?

1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:31.240
 How much of it is in our world today?

1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:34.680
 If we're thinking about this activity of Hitler spotting,

1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:39.640
 how, and trying to steal man the case

1:02:39.640 --> 1:02:41.120
 of if not critical race theory,

1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:45.760
 but people who look for racism in our world,

1:02:45.760 --> 1:02:48.160
 how much would you say?

1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:50.160
 Well, it's a good thing to try to define.

1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:54.920
 I would say that racism is the belief

1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:57.920
 that other people are inferior to you.

1:02:57.920 --> 1:03:00.080
 You could say, you could see a form

1:03:00.080 --> 1:03:02.440
 where you thought people were superior to you.

1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:04.560
 That could also happen, but more commonly is

1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:07.200
 you see a group of people as being inferior to you

1:03:07.200 --> 1:03:08.520
 simply by dint of the fact

1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:11.240
 that they have a different racial background.

1:03:12.320 --> 1:03:17.320
 And that's sort of the easiest way to define racism.

1:03:20.920 --> 1:03:22.840
 As I say, I mean, there are types of racism.

1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:24.920
 I mean, mainly antisemitism actually,

1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:26.760
 perhaps it's the only one,

1:03:26.760 --> 1:03:30.800
 which weirdly relies on a hatred of people

1:03:30.800 --> 1:03:34.600
 who a certain type of person thinks are better than them.

1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:37.840
 And that's a particular peculiarity,

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:40.120
 one of the peculiarities of antisemitism.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:42.760
 Well, antisemitism somehow does both, right?

1:03:42.760 --> 1:03:43.600
 Yes.

1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:46.280
 One of the eternal fascinating things

1:03:46.280 --> 1:03:47.840
 about antisemitism is it can do,

1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:49.920
 it does everything at the same time.

1:03:50.760 --> 1:03:52.800
 It's like a quantum racism.

1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:53.640
 Yes.

1:03:53.640 --> 1:03:54.880
 You're both superior and inferior.

1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:58.840
 Do you know Varsity Grossman's Life and Fate?

1:03:59.920 --> 1:04:02.320
 So in the middle of Life and Fate,

1:04:02.320 --> 1:04:04.040
 which a Persian friend of mine said was one

1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:05.960
 of only two great novels of the 20th century.

1:04:05.960 --> 1:04:08.040
 She was very harsh, literally, critic.

1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:08.960
 What was the other one?

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:10.840
 Oh, The Leopard, obviously.

1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:11.680
 The Leopard?

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:14.040
 The Leopard, of Giuseppe Delan, producer, yeah.

1:04:14.040 --> 1:04:14.880
 Okay.

1:04:14.880 --> 1:04:16.800
 She's definitely right on that one.

1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:18.040
 Life and Fate is a...

1:04:18.040 --> 1:04:19.480
 I'm learning so much today, yes.

1:04:19.480 --> 1:04:23.960
 Life and Fate is an extraordinary book.

1:04:23.960 --> 1:04:25.560
 Mainly about, well, you know,

1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:29.360
 Grossman was obviously Jewish himself.

1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:34.360
 He saw almost everything that he could have done

1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:36.240
 in the Second World War.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:38.640
 He saw Stalingrad, you know, the journalist.

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:41.960
 And he wrote first hand accounts of Stalingrad.

1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:45.880
 He was also the first journalist into Treblinka.

1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:47.200
 And his account, which you can read him

1:04:47.200 --> 1:04:49.240
 on the collections of his journalism,

1:04:49.240 --> 1:04:51.160
 his account of walking into Treblinka

1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:54.640
 is just one of the most devastating, haunting pieces

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:56.680
 of journalism or prose you can read.

1:04:56.680 --> 1:04:58.000
 Anyhow, I mentioned him because Grossman

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.240
 at the beginning, in the middle of Life and Fate,

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:04.160
 which is about 900 page novel, in the middle of it,

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:07.600
 which is about the dark axis around Stalingrad.

1:05:11.440 --> 1:05:13.720
 He, at one point, he amazingly sort of goes

1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:16.600
 into the minds of Earth Hitler and Stalin.

1:05:16.600 --> 1:05:21.600
 He says he says Stalin in his study feels his counterpart

1:05:22.120 --> 1:05:24.520
 in Berlin and he says he feels very close to him

1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:25.360
 at this moment.

1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:29.640
 Wow, around Stalingrad, like leading up to the back.

1:05:29.640 --> 1:05:32.040
 After Stalingrad, when the Germans have lost,

1:05:32.040 --> 1:05:34.200
 he says he feels the closeness of Hitler.

1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:37.400
 But Grossman, in the middle of Life and Fate,

1:05:37.400 --> 1:05:40.480
 slap bang at the worst hours of the 20th century,

1:05:40.480 --> 1:05:45.480
 suddenly dedicates a chapter to antisemitism.

1:05:47.160 --> 1:05:48.960
 And I've seen antisemitism is something

1:05:48.960 --> 1:05:51.480
 I've always been very interested in

1:05:51.480 --> 1:05:54.840
 because I've always had an instinctive utter revulsion

1:05:54.840 --> 1:05:59.840
 of it and also partly because of having seen bits of it

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:02.880
 in the Middle East and elsewhere.

1:06:02.880 --> 1:06:05.360
 But I mentioned this because Grossman

1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:08.160
 in the middle of Life and Fate takes time out

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:10.640
 and does this like three page explanation,

1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:12.880
 three page description of antisemitism.

1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:15.480
 And it's extraordinary, I mean, it's the only thing

1:06:15.480 --> 1:06:16.840
 I can think of that's equally good

1:06:16.840 --> 1:06:21.840
 is Gregor von Retzordi, who wrote a luridly titled

1:06:27.040 --> 1:06:29.120
 but brilliant set of novellas called

1:06:29.120 --> 1:06:34.120
 Confessions of an Antisemite and about pre First World War

1:06:34.720 --> 1:06:36.680
 antisemitism in Eastern and Central Europe.

1:06:36.680 --> 1:06:40.760
 Anyway, Grossman says in the middle of Life and Fate

1:06:40.760 --> 1:06:44.800
 that one of the extraordinary things about antisemitism

1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:47.240
 is that it does everything at the same time,

1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:50.120
 that the Jews get condemned in one place for being rich

1:06:50.120 --> 1:06:52.320
 and in another for being poor,

1:06:52.320 --> 1:06:54.800
 condemned in one place for assimilating

1:06:54.800 --> 1:06:56.920
 and another for not assimilating,

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:01.800
 for assimilating too much and assimilating too little

1:07:01.800 --> 1:07:05.480
 for being too successful for not being successful enough.

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:07.960
 So it's, I think it's the only racism

1:07:07.960 --> 1:07:12.800
 that includes within it, a detestation

1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:16.040
 for the real antisemite, a detestation of people

1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:18.960
 that the person may perceive to be better than them,

1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:21.280
 correctly or otherwise.

1:07:21.280 --> 1:07:24.720
 By the way, I'm embarrassed to say I have not read

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:27.360
 this one of two greatest novels of the 20th century,

1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:29.480
 Life and Fate, the Zhizniy Sejba

1:07:29.480 --> 1:07:31.520
 and just to read off of Wikipedia of a city,

1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:33.880
 Grossman, Ukrainian Jew became a correspondent

1:07:33.880 --> 1:07:37.200
 for the Soviet military paper Krasnaya Zvezda,

1:07:37.200 --> 1:07:40.720
 having volunteered and been rejected for military service.

1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:43.160
 He spent a thousand days in the front lines,

1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:45.520
 roughly three of the four years of the conflict

1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:48.040
 between the Germans and the Soviets.

1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:50.440
 And the main themes covered in,

1:07:51.880 --> 1:07:55.360
 how's it go, Life and Fate, I keep thinking Zhizniy Sejba

1:07:55.360 --> 1:07:58.480
 is a theme on Jewish identity in the Holocaust,

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:01.200
 Grossman's idea of humanity and the human goodness,

1:08:01.200 --> 1:08:03.040
 Stalin's distortion of reality

1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:08.000
 and values and science like goes on in reality of war.

1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:08.840
 It's interesting.

1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:09.680
 I need to definitely.

1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:10.800
 You need to read it.

1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:13.280
 I think you'll really get a lot from it.

1:08:13.280 --> 1:08:14.640
 One of the other things, sorry, one reference,

1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:15.880
 but one of the other things he does

1:08:15.880 --> 1:08:17.840
 is that he has this extraordinary ability

1:08:17.840 --> 1:08:22.840
 to talk about the absolute highest levels of the conflict

1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:23.680
 and then zoom in.

1:08:23.680 --> 1:08:25.160
 It's rather like the camera work they use

1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:26.680
 and things like Lord of the Rings,

1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:30.320
 where he zooms down and then gets one person

1:08:30.320 --> 1:08:32.880
 in the midst of all this and you get on there.

1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:34.160
 We'll put you in the study too.

1:08:34.160 --> 1:08:36.800
 So I personally have read and reread

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:39.480
 the William Shire's Rise and Fall with the Reich,

1:08:39.480 --> 1:08:42.840
 who's another journalist who was there,

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:45.600
 but he does not do it.

1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:49.080
 Interestingly enough, given such a large novel,

1:08:49.080 --> 1:08:52.400
 kind of the definitive work on the original work

1:08:52.400 --> 1:08:54.920
 that goes to source materials on Hitler,

1:08:54.920 --> 1:08:59.680
 he doesn't touch antisemitism really.

1:09:01.040 --> 1:09:02.480
 Big thing to miss out.

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:06.880
 Well, he just says it very calmly and objectively

1:09:06.880 --> 1:09:08.280
 as he does for most of the work

1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:12.280
 that this was the fact of life.

1:09:12.280 --> 1:09:13.800
 There's a lot of cruelty throughout,

1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:15.240
 but he doesn't get to...

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:16.840
 Well, one of the things is, of course,

1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:18.880
 he lost the war because of antisemitism.

1:09:19.760 --> 1:09:22.560
 I mean, that's one quite important way to view it,

1:09:22.560 --> 1:09:24.240
 is how Andrew Roberts and other historians say it,

1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:26.720
 is that in the end, the Nazis lost the war

1:09:26.720 --> 1:09:27.960
 because they were Nazis.

1:09:29.440 --> 1:09:31.000
 It sounds almost too neat,

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:35.680
 but it's worth remembering that at the end of the war,

1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:38.760
 when the Germans need to be transporting troops

1:09:38.760 --> 1:09:42.640
 and they need to be transporting very basic supplies,

1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:45.200
 Eichmann makes sure he gets the trains

1:09:45.200 --> 1:09:49.200
 to transport the Jews right up to the end.

1:09:49.200 --> 1:09:52.440
 Well, that's certainly a dark possibility.

1:09:53.800 --> 1:09:55.880
 But to go back to racism in general,

1:09:55.880 --> 1:09:58.080
 racism in general, apart from antisemitism,

1:09:58.080 --> 1:10:03.080
 relies on the perception that another group of people,

1:10:04.280 --> 1:10:07.960
 a racial group, other than your own are inferior to you.

1:10:07.960 --> 1:10:11.240
 That's what I'd say is the easiest shorthand of racism.

1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:15.360
 And of course, it's one of the stupidest things

1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:17.920
 that our species is capable of.

1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:19.680
 I mean, one of the stupidest,

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:23.440
 that you can look at a person and guess them

1:10:23.440 --> 1:10:28.160
 in their entirety, in fact, because of their skin color.

1:10:28.160 --> 1:10:31.840
 I mean, it's like, what a stupid idea that is,

1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:32.920
 as well as being an evil one.

1:10:32.920 --> 1:10:37.920
 But the, I would say that one of the,

1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:41.160
 I think it's a dangerous thing in our era

1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:43.080
 that there are bits of it coming back.

1:10:43.080 --> 1:10:45.120
 That's why I say we do need sort of,

1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:48.560
 we need our antennae working.

1:10:48.560 --> 1:10:51.680
 We just don't need them to be overactive or underactive.

1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:53.280
 You know.

1:10:53.280 --> 1:10:55.480
 Now the book is war on the West,

1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:57.520
 but speaking of racism,

1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:01.480
 racism towards different groups based on their skin color,

1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:05.360
 you've said that there's a war on white people in the West.

1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:06.680
 Would you say that's the case?

1:11:06.680 --> 1:11:11.760
 Would you say that there are significant racism

1:11:11.760 --> 1:11:13.440
 towards white people in the United States?

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:15.560
 I'd say that the white people in the United States

1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:16.560
 are the only people who are told

1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:18.080
 that they have hereditary sin.

1:11:18.080 --> 1:11:22.360
 And that's a big one just to start with.

1:11:22.360 --> 1:11:25.640
 Based strictly on their skin color.

1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:27.960
 I mean, I would find it so repugnant

1:11:29.120 --> 1:11:31.680
 if, and I hope everybody would join me in feeling this,

1:11:31.680 --> 1:11:33.680
 I would feel so repugnant

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:36.160
 if there were any school of thought in America today

1:11:36.160 --> 1:11:41.160
 that had any grasp on the public attention

1:11:43.960 --> 1:11:46.560
 that said that black people were born into evil

1:11:46.560 --> 1:11:49.600
 because of something their ancestors had done.

1:11:49.600 --> 1:11:52.520
 Like they had the mark of cane upon them.

1:11:52.520 --> 1:11:56.960
 I mean, I think it would be such a vicious way

1:11:56.960 --> 1:12:01.960
 to try to demoralize a group of people

1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:05.440
 and to tell them that the things they would be able

1:12:05.440 --> 1:12:07.640
 to achieve in their lives are much lessened

1:12:07.640 --> 1:12:10.520
 because they should spend significant portions

1:12:10.520 --> 1:12:13.600
 of their lives trying to atone for something they didn't do.

1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:15.440
 Is there a difference?

1:12:15.440 --> 1:12:19.600
 And the obvious point left unsaid,

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:24.600
 but let's say it, nobody in the public square says that.

1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:27.960
 I mean, they're the maniacs and the far fringes,

1:12:27.960 --> 1:12:32.320
 but nobody in the mainstream would dare to say that

1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:34.800
 or I think even think that about any group of people

1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:36.560
 other than white people.

1:12:36.560 --> 1:12:39.360
 And does this mean that white people

1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:42.720
 are more disadvantaged than black people know?

1:12:42.720 --> 1:12:45.040
 And again, let's not make this a competition,

1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:48.760
 but let's not get into, I just desperately urge people

1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:51.440
 not to get into the idea of hereditary sin

1:12:51.440 --> 1:12:54.000
 according to racial background.

1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.200
 Is there something to be said about the feature aspect,

1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:59.200
 to sort of play devil's advocate,

1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:04.200
 about the asymmetry of sort of accusations

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:06.400
 towards the majority?

1:13:06.400 --> 1:13:07.720
 So because white...

1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:09.320
 Much easier to attack a majority.

1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:11.320
 It is much easier, but is there something to be said

1:13:11.320 --> 1:13:14.080
 about that being a useful function of society

1:13:14.080 --> 1:13:15.920
 that you always attack,

1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:20.600
 that the minority has disproportionate power

1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:22.160
 to attack the majority

1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:24.880
 so that you can always keep the majority in check?

1:13:24.880 --> 1:13:26.200
 Well...

1:13:26.200 --> 1:13:28.240
 It's a dangerous game to play, isn't it?

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:29.240
 I think...

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:30.520
 It's a very dangerous game to play.

1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:33.400
 That's a good summary of entirety of human civilization.

1:13:33.400 --> 1:13:35.840
 Oh yeah, everything is dangerous.

1:13:35.840 --> 1:13:37.800
 But it's a very dangerous game to play that.

1:13:37.800 --> 1:13:39.760
 I wrote about this bit in the matters of crowds

1:13:39.760 --> 1:13:43.080
 when I was saying like gay rights people,

1:13:43.080 --> 1:13:44.400
 the ones that still exist,

1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:46.280
 the ones who don't have homes to go to,

1:13:47.320 --> 1:13:51.520
 who want to beat up on straight people in a way,

1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:53.680
 or want to make straight people feel like they're

1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:59.920
 kind of unremarkable, uncool, boring straights.

1:14:00.760 --> 1:14:02.360
 So boring.

1:14:02.360 --> 1:14:06.120
 So not like the magical pixie fairy dust gaze.

1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:10.800
 That's a bad idea to push that one.

1:14:10.800 --> 1:14:13.520
 That's a bad idea, and some gays push that.

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:18.440
 Highly unwise, given the fact that about

1:14:18.440 --> 1:14:21.000
 two to 3% of the population are actually gay,

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.720
 although now there's like an additional 20%

1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:25.840
 who think they're like two spirit or something,

1:14:25.840 --> 1:14:27.440
 and all that bullshit,

1:14:27.440 --> 1:14:31.000
 but they're just a tenancy

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.160
 because they don't spend too much time on that.

1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:37.280
 But equally, as I said in the matters of crowds,

1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:40.560
 with the feminist movement,

1:14:40.560 --> 1:14:43.440
 very unwise for half of the species

1:14:43.440 --> 1:14:46.200
 to say that the other half of the species isn't needed.

1:14:47.200 --> 1:14:49.920
 And there were always third and fourth wave feminists

1:14:49.920 --> 1:14:52.200
 willing to make that nuts argument.

1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:54.840
 Not first wave feminists,

1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:56.040
 you didn't hear it in first wave feminists,

1:14:56.040 --> 1:14:59.320
 you didn't hear Suffragette tended not to say,

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:02.340
 we'd like the vote and men a scum.

1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:06.520
 It would be hard to have won everyone over to their side,

1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:09.160
 not least the men they needed to win over to their side.

1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:12.400
 But you do get third and fourth wave feminists who say like,

1:15:12.400 --> 1:15:15.480
 do we need men or men are all X?

1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:17.320
 Again, it's a bad idea.

1:15:17.320 --> 1:15:19.760
 It's a bad idea tactically.

1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:24.480
 What if men, Richard Rangham, somebody from Harvard,

1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:29.640
 describes that men are the originators of violence,

1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:31.640
 physical violence in society,

1:15:31.640 --> 1:15:35.520
 and he argues that actually the world would be better off.

1:15:35.520 --> 1:15:38.640
 No, just a very cold calculus

1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.240
 if you get rid of men,

1:15:40.240 --> 1:15:44.280
 there would be a lot less violence in society is his claim.

1:15:44.280 --> 1:15:47.000
 But who says you need to get rid of violence in society?

1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.040
 Well, that's, but shouldn't that at least be a discussion?

1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:51.720
 Well, I'm very happy with the discussion.

1:15:51.720 --> 1:15:55.600
 Have a debate, a panel discussion, violence, pros and cons.

1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:56.720
 Well, that's the sort of thing,

1:15:56.720 --> 1:15:57.560
 as if I can say so,

1:15:57.560 --> 1:16:00.000
 the Sunday we cast academic decides to do

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:02.600
 because he thinks that his area of Boston

1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:04.280
 would be nicer or whatever.

1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:09.280
 He might decide it's useful if he was living in Kiev today

1:16:10.960 --> 1:16:12.240
 to have violent men.

1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:17.960
 I mean, it might, if New York was invaded right now,

1:16:17.960 --> 1:16:20.560
 I'd need some violent men around here.

1:16:22.120 --> 1:16:25.760
 But it wouldn't be invaded if there's no violent men.

1:16:25.760 --> 1:16:27.760
 Well, that's the cause of argument.

1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:32.000
 There's also, at least there's some level of threat

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:35.640
 that you ought to exude that puts people off.

1:16:35.640 --> 1:16:38.720
 If I was in, you know,

1:16:38.720 --> 1:16:41.360
 I'm very glad that the men and women of Ukraine

1:16:41.360 --> 1:16:45.960
 are capable of and more than capable of fighting

1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:48.400
 for their country and for their neighbors

1:16:48.400 --> 1:16:49.840
 and their families and much more.

1:16:49.840 --> 1:16:54.240
 But it's better that, that there was violence ready

1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:57.040
 to unleash when violence was unleashed upon them

1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:58.960
 than that the whole society had been told

1:16:58.960 --> 1:17:02.540
 that they should identify as non binary.

1:17:02.540 --> 1:17:05.400
 But at least it's a conversation to have.

1:17:05.400 --> 1:17:10.400
 Isn't there aspect to the sort of the feminist movement

1:17:12.040 --> 1:17:17.000
 that is correct in challenging the...

1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:20.160
 Some forms of violence, domestic violence for instance,

1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:23.000
 although women are capable of that as well.

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:24.360
 I'm learning about this.

1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:26.800
 We're always learning about this at the moment.

1:17:26.800 --> 1:17:29.200
 I can't help but watch the entirety of it go down

1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:31.440
 in this beautiful mess that is human relations.

1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:32.280
 Okay.

1:17:32.280 --> 1:17:33.640
 But just to finish that thought,

1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:38.640
 it's very unwise for women to war against men

1:17:39.240 --> 1:17:41.200
 as it would be for men to war against women.

1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:45.280
 It's highly, highly unwise to war on a majority population.

1:17:45.280 --> 1:17:47.740
 And in America, Britain and other Western countries,

1:17:47.740 --> 1:17:49.760
 white people are still a majority.

1:17:49.760 --> 1:17:52.160
 And so why would you tell the majority

1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:55.200
 that they're evil by dint of their skin color

1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:58.160
 and think that that would be a good way to keep them in check?

1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:02.120
 I mean, I'm not guilty of anything because of my skin color.

1:18:02.120 --> 1:18:03.360
 I'm not guilty of anything.

1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:05.840
 My answers didn't do anything wrong.

1:18:05.840 --> 1:18:08.880
 And even if they had, why would I be held responsible for it?

1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:13.160
 So to go back to Nietzsche,

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:16.560
 is there some aspect to where if we try to explain

1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:18.360
 the forces of play here,

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:22.560
 is it the will to power playing itself out

1:18:22.560 --> 1:18:27.560
 from individual human nature and from group behavior nature?

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.080
 Is there some elements to this,

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:32.760
 which is the game we play as human beings,

1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:34.800
 is always when we have less power,

1:18:34.800 --> 1:18:36.920
 we try to find ways to gain more power?

1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:39.280
 That's certainly one.

1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:42.800
 The desire to grab is,

1:18:42.800 --> 1:18:45.840
 let me see if I can find a quote for you on that.

1:18:45.840 --> 1:18:49.880
 The desire to grab that which we think we're owed

1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:54.880
 and to do it often in the guise of justice.

1:18:56.800 --> 1:19:00.720
 I mean, justice is one of the great terms of our age

1:19:00.720 --> 1:19:03.760
 and one of the great bogus terms of our age.

1:19:03.760 --> 1:19:06.160
 People forever talk about their search for justice

1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:08.320
 and it's amazing how violent they can often be

1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:09.600
 in their search for justice

1:19:09.600 --> 1:19:11.880
 and how many rules they're willing to break

1:19:11.880 --> 1:19:14.200
 so long as they can say they're after justice

1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:16.240
 and how many norms they can trample

1:19:16.240 --> 1:19:18.520
 so long as they can say it's in the name of justice.

1:19:18.520 --> 1:19:21.440
 You can burn down buildings in the name of justice.

1:19:21.440 --> 1:19:23.720
 Well, the majority groups throughout history,

1:19:23.720 --> 1:19:25.640
 including those with white skin color

1:19:25.640 --> 1:19:28.280
 have done the same in the name of justice.

1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:31.120
 We come up with all kinds of sexy terms

1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:33.280
 in our propaganda machines to sell

1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:35.520
 whatever atrocities we'd like to commit.

1:19:36.600 --> 1:19:40.080
 One of the quotes from Nietzsche that I liked

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:41.200
 and I quoted in this.

1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:43.080
 Careful, I'm judging you harshly.

1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:43.920
 Yeah, of course.

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:48.920
 Nietzsche says that one of the dangers of men of resentment

1:19:49.720 --> 1:19:52.960
 is they'll achieve their ultimate form of revenge,

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:54.640
 which is to turn happy people

1:19:54.640 --> 1:19:57.360
 into unhappy people like themselves,

1:19:57.360 --> 1:19:59.760
 to shove their misery in the faces of the happy

1:19:59.760 --> 1:20:01.360
 so that in due course, the happy,

1:20:01.360 --> 1:20:02.600
 and this is quoting Nietzsche,

1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:05.240
 start to be ashamed of their happiness

1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:06.800
 and perhaps say to one another,

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:08.840
 it's a disgrace to be happy.

1:20:08.840 --> 1:20:11.000
 There is too much misery.

1:20:11.000 --> 1:20:12.200
 This is something to be averted.

1:20:12.200 --> 1:20:16.040
 For the sick says Nietzsche must not make the healthy sick too

1:20:16.040 --> 1:20:20.120
 or make the healthy confuse themselves with the sick.

1:20:20.120 --> 1:20:24.120
 Well, I think there again, there's a lot of that going on.

1:20:24.120 --> 1:20:25.160
 How could I be happy

1:20:25.160 --> 1:20:27.120
 when there is unhappiness in the world?

1:20:27.120 --> 1:20:29.720
 Why should I not join the ranks of the unhappy?

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:34.200
 I think Dostoevsky has a book about that as well.

1:20:34.200 --> 1:20:36.360
 Sure, notes from underground.

1:20:36.360 --> 1:20:37.200
 Okay.

1:20:39.360 --> 1:20:41.640
 This has been very Russian, Russian focus.

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:43.520
 I'm very pleased with it a number of times,

1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:45.720
 but Dostoevsky and Grossman and others have come in.

1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:49.040
 This is very, I wasn't like doing this as a sort of.

1:20:49.040 --> 1:20:51.960
 Yeah, well, it's always good to plug the greats

1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:56.120
 and good to know they're still relevant.

1:20:57.080 --> 1:20:59.800
 Do you speak Russian by the way at all?

1:20:59.800 --> 1:21:00.840
 Which I did.

1:21:00.840 --> 1:21:03.000
 I'm told it's a 10 year language basically

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:06.080
 to learn from scratch as my friends who have done it.

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:07.080
 Well, there's the language

1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:10.480
 and then there's the personality behind the language

1:21:10.480 --> 1:21:12.920
 and the personality I feel like you already have.

1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:15.120
 So you just need to know the surface details.

1:21:15.120 --> 1:21:18.440
 Okay.

1:21:18.440 --> 1:21:21.800
 In fact, the silence to be silent

1:21:21.800 --> 1:21:22.760
 in the Russian language

1:21:22.760 --> 1:21:24.760
 is something that's already important.

1:21:24.760 --> 1:21:25.880
 Oh, if we had a moment,

1:21:25.880 --> 1:21:28.080
 I told you my story about Stalin's birthplace.

1:21:28.080 --> 1:21:28.920
 Should I tell you that?

1:21:28.920 --> 1:21:29.760
 No.

1:21:29.760 --> 1:21:31.880
 I once went to Gory where Stalin was born.

1:21:33.040 --> 1:21:33.880
 Have you been?

1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:34.720
 No.

1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:37.520
 I was there just after the Georgia war.

1:21:37.520 --> 1:21:41.440
 I went to the No Man's Land in South Ossetia, Kasia.

1:21:42.680 --> 1:21:47.320
 And I said, I really got to go to Gory also here

1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:49.400
 because the shell had landed in Gory rather weirdly

1:21:49.400 --> 1:21:50.560
 from the Russian side

1:21:50.560 --> 1:21:53.280
 and Gory is where Stalin was born.

1:21:53.280 --> 1:21:55.560
 And of course, Gory is in Georgia.

1:21:55.560 --> 1:21:59.440
 And I only had the museum of Stalin's birthplace.

1:21:59.440 --> 1:22:01.600
 They'd been trying to change for some years

1:22:01.600 --> 1:22:06.600
 because it had been unadulteratedly pro Stalin for years.

1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:07.720
 And the Georgian authorities,

1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:11.760
 this is in Shakhashvili's time,

1:22:11.760 --> 1:22:14.680
 were trying to make it into a museum of Stalinism.

1:22:15.600 --> 1:22:17.440
 And it was really tough.

1:22:17.440 --> 1:22:18.960
 The only place I've seen which is similar

1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:21.960
 is the house in Mexico City where Trotsky was killed.

1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:25.600
 That also is that they're not quite sure to do.

1:22:25.600 --> 1:22:27.920
 They don't want to say he's a bad guy

1:22:27.920 --> 1:22:30.880
 because they think that people won't come anyhow.

1:22:30.880 --> 1:22:32.400
 Stalin's house in Gory had changed

1:22:32.400 --> 1:22:34.200
 from the museum of Stalin to the museum of Stalinism.

1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:37.200
 There was this large Georgian woman with a pink pencil

1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:40.720
 who had just clearly been doing the tour for like 50 years.

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:41.840
 And he just pointed all the facts.

1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:43.040
 And she did that classic thing.

1:22:43.040 --> 1:22:44.840
 I also saw it once in North Korea

1:22:44.840 --> 1:22:47.760
 where they sort of, that sort of communist thing

1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:51.560
 where they say, here is, this is 147 feet high

1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:52.840
 by 13 feet deep.

1:22:52.840 --> 1:22:55.040
 I give you lots of facts, I don't care.

1:22:55.040 --> 1:22:56.600
 Why does it matter?

1:22:56.600 --> 1:22:58.800
 They always give you facts.

1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:00.200
 This is Stalin's suitcase.

1:23:00.200 --> 1:23:03.480
 It is 13 inches wide by, you know,

1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:05.240
 it isn't anyhow.

1:23:05.240 --> 1:23:06.760
 And this woman did all of this

1:23:06.760 --> 1:23:08.840
 and it was all just wildly pro,

1:23:08.840 --> 1:23:10.680
 well, not pro science, just explaining the science lives.

1:23:10.680 --> 1:23:13.720
 It was just a great local boy, done good.

1:23:13.720 --> 1:23:15.600
 They didn't mention the fact he killed more Georgians

1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:17.240
 per capita than anyone else.

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:18.800
 What done good?

1:23:18.800 --> 1:23:21.360
 And we get to the end.

1:23:21.360 --> 1:23:23.240
 And before being taken to the gift shop

1:23:23.240 --> 1:23:25.720
 where they sell red wine with Stalin's face on it

1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:27.360
 and among other things.

1:23:27.360 --> 1:23:30.280
 And a lighter with Stalin on it.

1:23:30.280 --> 1:23:35.280
 They took you to a little room under the stairs

1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:38.960
 and they said, this is a replica of interrogation cell

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:43.960
 to show, represent horror of what happened in Stalin time.

1:23:44.440 --> 1:23:45.760
 Now, gift shop.

1:23:45.760 --> 1:23:48.680
 As I said, there's no, no kind of,

1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:50.720
 and I took the woman aside at the end.

1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:52.520
 I discovered she'd said this to other journalists

1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:54.880
 and visited before, I took her aside and said,

1:23:54.880 --> 1:23:57.840
 I said, what do you think about comrade Stalin?

1:23:57.840 --> 1:24:01.040
 And she said, let's say she'd obviously done this

1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:03.440
 during communist times.

1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:08.440
 She said, it's not my place to judge, you know, sort of thing.

1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:10.760
 We had an interesting comment in itself.

1:24:10.760 --> 1:24:13.040
 I said, yeah, but he killed more Georgians than anyone,

1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:15.160
 you know, and all that sort of thing.

1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:17.000
 And she says, it's not my place to judge

1:24:17.000 --> 1:24:19.000
 or to give my views and that sort of thing.

1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:22.360
 And the venture said, but what do you feel about it?

1:24:22.360 --> 1:24:26.640
 And she said, it was like a hurricane.

1:24:26.640 --> 1:24:30.320
 It happened, that's interesting

1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:34.040
 because if I may mention Clubhouse once again,

1:24:34.040 --> 1:24:37.640
 I got a chance to talk to a few people from Mongolia.

1:24:37.640 --> 1:24:39.040
 There's a woman from Mongolia

1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:40.680
 and they talked about the fact

1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:43.480
 that they deeply admire Stalin, love.

1:24:43.480 --> 1:24:45.480
 She, she sounded, if I may,

1:24:45.480 --> 1:24:46.960
 hopefully that's not crossing the line.

1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:48.960
 I think I'm representing her correctly

1:24:48.960 --> 1:24:51.800
 and saying she admired him almost like,

1:24:53.880 --> 1:24:56.400
 like loved him, like the way people love,

1:24:56.400 --> 1:25:00.080
 like Jesus, like a holy figure.

1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:02.600
 Well, isn't that still the case in large parts of Russia?

1:25:02.600 --> 1:25:03.440
 Yeah.

1:25:03.440 --> 1:25:04.560
 I mean, Stalin keeps on winning

1:25:04.560 --> 1:25:06.040
 Greatest Russian of all time.

1:25:07.480 --> 1:25:10.240
 And that's perhaps, maybe there's a dip,

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:12.880
 but if we were to think about the long arc of history,

1:25:12.880 --> 1:25:15.480
 perhaps that's going to go up and up and up and up.

1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:18.520
 There's something about human memory

1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:20.720
 that just you forget the details

1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:22.800
 of the atrocities of the past and remember the,

1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:25.040
 I mean, think of the number of people we talk about

1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:27.600
 as historical heroes, Napoleon.

1:25:27.600 --> 1:25:30.440
 I mean, British people don't talk about Napoleon as a hero,

1:25:30.440 --> 1:25:31.440
 but the French.

1:25:33.240 --> 1:25:34.600
 Now, now you're, now you're.

1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:36.800
 You didn't think that the Stiyosky, now again.

1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:38.160
 Now you're on a tricky ground.

1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:42.120
 But no, but like the French are enormous in my Napoleon

1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:44.320
 and there hadn't many admiral aspects to you.

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:46.280
 It was also an unbelievable brute

1:25:46.280 --> 1:25:49.360
 and killed many people unnecessarily.

1:25:49.360 --> 1:25:51.720
 And there are lots of figures from history

1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:56.480
 that we sort of cover that over with.

1:25:56.480 --> 1:25:58.560
 Yeah, yeah.

1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:00.280
 Can we mention Churchill briefly?

1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:05.280
 Because he is one of the, you could make a case for him

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:08.720
 being one of the great representatives

1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:12.280
 or great figures historically of the Western civilization.

1:26:12.280 --> 1:26:16.880
 And then there's a lot of people from not a lot.

1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:18.520
 I know I have like three friends

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:21.400
 and one of them happens to be from London

1:26:21.400 --> 1:26:26.400
 and they say that he's a, not a good person.

1:26:26.600 --> 1:26:27.440
 Why?

1:26:27.440 --> 1:26:30.440
 So listen, this friend would not discuss,

1:26:30.440 --> 1:26:33.200
 I just, this is an opinion poll of the three friends,

1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:35.360
 but I do know that there's quite a bit, you know.

1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:37.200
 There's a backcash going on at the moment.

1:26:37.200 --> 1:26:39.240
 At the moment and in general, there's a spirit

1:26:39.240 --> 1:26:42.320
 like reflecting on the darker sides

1:26:42.320 --> 1:26:43.640
 of some of these historical figures,

1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:46.400
 like challenging history through,

1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:48.360
 it's not just critical race theory,

1:26:48.360 --> 1:26:52.040
 it's challenging history through.

1:26:52.040 --> 1:26:57.040
 Well, are the people who think of us heroes,

1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:01.320
 what are their flaws and are they villains

1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:06.320
 that are convenient sort of,

1:27:06.320 --> 1:27:08.560
 we're there at the right time

1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:12.040
 to accidentally do the right thing.

1:27:12.040 --> 1:27:13.120
 Accidentally.

1:27:13.120 --> 1:27:18.120
 I hope this isn't the representative of fair estimation

1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:21.280
 of your friend in London's views.

1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:23.720
 No, she's going to be quite mad at this,

1:27:23.720 --> 1:27:26.200
 but I didn't say the name, so it could be any friend.

1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:28.760
 It could be, it's like my girlfriend in Canada.

1:27:28.760 --> 1:27:30.640
 Well, see, I, I,

1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:31.720
 You've given that away.

1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:34.920
 Well, that's, of course I would not,

1:27:34.920 --> 1:27:36.160
 I made that up completely.

1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:39.680
 It's all, just like my girlfriend in Canada,

1:27:39.680 --> 1:27:41.840
 she's completely a figment of my imagination.

1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:46.320
 Nevertheless, Winston Churchill is somebody,

1:27:46.320 --> 1:27:48.160
 I mean, just looking at reading

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:49.360
 The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich

1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:53.560
 is an incredible figure that to me,

1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:58.440
 so much of World War II is marked,

1:27:58.440 --> 1:28:00.000
 leading up to the war is marked

1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:03.760
 by stunning amounts of cowardice by political leaders.

1:28:03.760 --> 1:28:07.400
 And it's fascinating to watch here,

1:28:07.400 --> 1:28:09.800
 this person clearly with the drinking

1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:11.560
 and a smoking problem,

1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:12.400
 was it?

1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:14.000
 Well, I didn't understand why that's a negative.

1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:15.720
 No, I didn't say, you see.

1:28:15.720 --> 1:28:17.880
 Yeah, you throw it in as if it is.

1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:19.720
 No, well, it's called humor.

1:28:19.720 --> 1:28:21.480
 I'll explain it to you one day what that means,

1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:22.920
 but he stood.

1:28:22.920 --> 1:28:25.240
 I haven't explained drawing him.

1:28:25.240 --> 1:28:26.920
 He stood up.

1:28:26.920 --> 1:28:31.920
 He stood up to what we now see as evil,

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.880
 when at the time it was not so obvious to see.

1:28:36.920 --> 1:28:39.840
 You know, so that's just a fascinating figure

1:28:39.840 --> 1:28:40.800
 of Western civilization.

1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:42.240
 I'd love to get your comments.

1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:45.400
 The real criticisms, I mean, I'm smoking and drinking.

1:28:45.400 --> 1:28:49.240
 The real criticisms of Churchill are quite easy to sum up,

1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:50.560
 and I do so in the war in the West,

1:28:50.560 --> 1:28:54.120
 I say these are the things that they now use against him.

1:28:54.120 --> 1:28:56.920
 Didn't do enough to revert the Bengal famine in 1943,

1:28:56.920 --> 1:28:59.600
 for instance, that's been shot down by numerous historians,

1:28:59.600 --> 1:29:01.680
 including Indian historians,

1:29:01.680 --> 1:29:03.040
 in the middle of the war,

1:29:03.040 --> 1:29:05.280
 in the middle of a World War Churchill did what he could

1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:10.280
 to get grain supplies diverted from Australia to Bengal.

1:29:12.120 --> 1:29:15.040
 The famine was appalling, it was caused by a typhoon,

1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:17.720
 it was not caused by Winston Churchill,

1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:22.720
 and the idea that some, basically Indian nationalists,

1:29:22.920 --> 1:29:25.440
 historians have pumped out in recent years,

1:29:25.440 --> 1:29:28.160
 and just anti Churchill figures,

1:29:28.160 --> 1:29:31.960
 that he actually wanted Indians to die as his,

1:29:31.960 --> 1:29:34.360
 just a total calumny.

1:29:34.360 --> 1:29:36.240
 And when people claim, some people claim that,

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:39.160
 I mean, there was a few fairly ignorant scholars,

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:41.800
 we know the less with some credentials,

1:29:41.800 --> 1:29:44.960
 who claim that Churchill wanted the Indian population

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:48.520
 to basically be genocided, and it's complete nonsense,

1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:51.240
 not least by the fact that during the period

1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:54.600
 which in question, Indian population boomed.

1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:59.640
 So that's one of the main ones.

1:29:59.640 --> 1:30:02.120
 Another one is that he had some views

1:30:02.120 --> 1:30:03.440
 that we now regard as racist.

1:30:03.440 --> 1:30:07.760
 He definitely regarded racism as being of different characters,

1:30:07.760 --> 1:30:10.320
 and that there were superior races,

1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:15.260
 and as it were, the white European was a superior culture.

1:30:19.480 --> 1:30:21.800
 He was born in Victorian England,

1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:23.600
 so he had some Victorian attitudes.

1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:28.200
 These are things in the negative side of the ledger,

1:30:28.200 --> 1:30:29.720
 and as with all history,

1:30:29.720 --> 1:30:31.960
 you should have a negative and a positive side of the ledger.

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:33.960
 The positive side of the ledger includes he almost certainly

1:30:33.960 --> 1:30:35.280
 did more than any one human being

1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:37.280
 to save the world from Nazism.

1:30:37.280 --> 1:30:39.480
 So that should count as something.

1:30:39.480 --> 1:30:41.280
 And one of the reasons I talk about Churchill

1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:45.200
 in this regard is to stress that if you get,

1:30:46.120 --> 1:30:49.640
 I'm not trying to stop anyone doing history at all.

1:30:49.640 --> 1:30:51.720
 I don't think that the revisionism of recent years

1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:53.960
 about Churchill or the founding fathers of Merrick

1:30:53.960 --> 1:30:57.000
 or anyone else is anything I want to stop.

1:30:57.000 --> 1:30:58.840
 I find it interesting, I find it interesting,

1:30:58.840 --> 1:31:00.560
 not least because it's so sloppy on occasions,

1:31:00.560 --> 1:31:02.280
 but I find it interesting and it's important,

1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:04.760
 and we should be able to see people in the round.

1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:09.760
 But that includes recognizing the positive side of the ledger,

1:31:10.560 --> 1:31:13.760
 and if you can't recognize that side,

1:31:13.760 --> 1:31:15.800
 you're doing something else.

1:31:15.800 --> 1:31:18.640
 You're doing something else, it's not history.

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:23.440
 It's some form of politicking of a very particular kind,

1:31:23.440 --> 1:31:26.120
 and I think it's the same thing with the founding fathers.

1:31:26.120 --> 1:31:28.680
 There are some people, for instance, certainly since the 90s

1:31:28.680 --> 1:31:32.880
 who have pushed the Sally Hemmings Thomas Jefferson story

1:31:32.880 --> 1:31:35.560
 to show that Thomas Jefferson was some kind of brute.

1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:39.800
 As a result, we see Jefferson's statue

1:31:39.800 --> 1:31:41.240
 being removed from the council chamber

1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:43.400
 the city was sitting in last November

1:31:43.400 --> 1:31:45.720
 by council members who said that Thomas Jefferson

1:31:45.720 --> 1:31:47.680
 no longer represents our values.

1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:51.480
 If you can't recognize greatness of Thomas Jefferson

1:31:51.480 --> 1:31:53.240
 and that he had flaws,

1:31:53.240 --> 1:31:58.240
 I mean, that's not a grown up debate,

1:31:58.600 --> 1:32:01.400
 and weigh them and weigh them in the context of the time,

1:32:01.400 --> 1:32:06.040
 but let me sort of throw a curveball at you then.

1:32:06.040 --> 1:32:09.360
 What about recognizing the positive and the negative

1:32:09.360 --> 1:32:13.080
 of a fellow with nice facial hair called Karl Marx?

1:32:13.080 --> 1:32:14.440
 Sure, sure.

1:32:14.440 --> 1:32:17.880
 I mean, I have a section in the War on the West

1:32:17.880 --> 1:32:20.440
 as you know where I go for Karl Marx with some glee.

1:32:20.440 --> 1:32:25.240
 So he seems to have gotten, you know,

1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:29.120
 some popularity in the West recently.

1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:30.640
 Not just recently, yeah.

1:32:30.640 --> 1:32:32.720
 I mean, he's had a resurgence recently.

1:32:32.720 --> 1:32:33.800
 Yes, resurgence recently.

1:32:33.800 --> 1:32:36.920
 Well, that's because whenever things are seen to go wrong,

1:32:36.920 --> 1:32:39.800
 people reach for other options.

1:32:40.960 --> 1:32:41.800
 And when, for instance,

1:32:41.800 --> 1:32:43.680
 it's very hard for people to accumulate capital,

1:32:43.680 --> 1:32:46.640
 it's not obvious that they're gonna become capitalists.

1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:49.080
 And so one thing that happens is people say,

1:32:49.080 --> 1:32:50.600
 let's look at the Marxism thing again,

1:32:50.600 --> 1:32:52.760
 see if that's a viable goer.

1:32:52.760 --> 1:32:55.560
 And my argument would simply be,

1:32:55.560 --> 1:32:58.320
 point me to one place, that's worked.

1:32:58.320 --> 1:33:01.440
 Well, the argument from the Marxist

1:33:01.440 --> 1:33:06.440
 or the Marxian economists is that we've only really tried it

1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:08.480
 once the Soviets tried it.

1:33:08.480 --> 1:33:10.360
 And then if there's a few people

1:33:10.360 --> 1:33:12.240
 that kind of tried the Soviet thing.

1:33:12.240 --> 1:33:13.680
 Cuba tried it?

1:33:13.680 --> 1:33:18.120
 Well, they basically, it's an offshoot of the Soviet,

1:33:18.120 --> 1:33:19.480
 yes, they've tried it.

1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:20.880
 They've tried it in Venezuela.

1:33:22.120 --> 1:33:23.360
 Yes, yes, yes.

1:33:23.360 --> 1:33:27.600
 So let's just quickly say, how did all these experiments go?

1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:31.120
 They did not, well, they failed in fascinating ways.

1:33:31.120 --> 1:33:32.600
 They did, but they failed.

1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:33.440
 Yes, they failed.

1:33:33.440 --> 1:33:36.800
 And we should stress, so grossly failed,

1:33:36.800 --> 1:33:38.200
 so grossly failed,

1:33:38.200 --> 1:33:41.360
 that they threw millions and millions of people

1:33:41.360 --> 1:33:43.880
 into completely thwarted lives

1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:46.280
 that were much shorter than they should have been.

1:33:46.280 --> 1:33:50.040
 Yeah, so the lesson to learn there,

1:33:50.040 --> 1:33:52.280
 that you can learn several lessons.

1:33:52.280 --> 1:33:56.160
 One is that anything that smells like Marxism

1:33:56.160 --> 1:33:59.880
 is going to lead to a lot of problems.

1:33:59.880 --> 1:34:02.120
 Now, another lesson could be,

1:34:02.120 --> 1:34:05.960
 well, what is the fundamental idea that Marx had?

1:34:05.960 --> 1:34:10.440
 He was criticizing capitalism and the flaws of capitalism.

1:34:10.440 --> 1:34:13.400
 So is it possible to do better than capitalism?

1:34:13.400 --> 1:34:15.360
 And that's if you take that spirit,

1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:16.720
 you start to wonder,

1:34:16.720 --> 1:34:18.680
 that might actually become relevant in,

1:34:18.680 --> 1:34:21.200
 I don't know, 20, 30, 50 years

1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:25.160
 when the machines start doing more and more

1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:26.600
 of the labor, all those kinds of things.

1:34:26.600 --> 1:34:27.920
 You start to ask questions.

1:34:27.920 --> 1:34:29.840
 I finally might get to Marx's dream

1:34:29.840 --> 1:34:31.800
 of what the average day would look like.

1:34:31.800 --> 1:34:32.640
 Yes.

1:34:33.840 --> 1:34:35.000
 Well, there's going to be an awful lot

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.440
 of literary criticism then.

1:34:38.240 --> 1:34:39.680
 If you remember, that's what Marx said

1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:41.200
 that we would be doing in the evenings,

1:34:41.200 --> 1:34:42.520
 the labor in the evening.

1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:45.360
 Well, he didn't know Twitter was a thing or Netflix,

1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:47.720
 so he would change.

1:34:47.720 --> 1:34:50.680
 Are there things we could learn from Marx plausibly?

1:34:50.680 --> 1:34:51.760
 Possibly.

1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:53.840
 I can't think of anything myself offhand,

1:34:53.840 --> 1:34:56.800
 but to have a critique of capitalism

1:34:56.800 --> 1:34:58.920
 isn't by any means a bad thing in the society.

1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:00.760
 I'd rather that it was a critique of capitalism

1:35:00.760 --> 1:35:02.800
 that showed how you improve capitalism,

1:35:02.800 --> 1:35:04.240
 a critique of the free market

1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:06.120
 that showed how people could get better access

1:35:06.120 --> 1:35:08.680
 to the free market, how you could ensure, for instance,

1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:10.680
 that young people get onto the property ladder,

1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:11.880
 things like that.

1:35:11.880 --> 1:35:13.120
 Those are constructive things.

1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:15.200
 So people who say we must have Marxism,

1:35:15.200 --> 1:35:17.320
 I mean, don't know what the hell they're talking about,

1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:19.880
 because that never leads to any of those things.

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:22.000
 Haven't led in the past.

1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:23.000
 It's never led in the past.

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:25.920
 And at some point, you've got to try to work out

1:35:25.920 --> 1:35:30.280
 how many attempts you make at this damn philosophy

1:35:30.280 --> 1:35:32.040
 before you realize that every attempt

1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:34.200
 always leads to the same thing.

1:35:34.200 --> 1:35:36.360
 I would say we could pretend that fascism

1:35:36.360 --> 1:35:38.160
 has never been properly tried

1:35:38.160 --> 1:35:43.160
 and that it was unfortunate what happened in Nazi Germany.

1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:45.840
 But, you know, that wasn't real fascism

1:35:45.840 --> 1:35:48.560
 and in Mussolini's fascism, you know,

1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:51.320
 didn't go all that well, but it was, you know, a bit better.

1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:54.560
 And maybe we could try a bit more Franco fascism.

1:35:54.560 --> 1:35:57.640
 Nobody would have any time for this crap,

1:35:57.640 --> 1:35:58.680
 nor should they.

1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:02.160
 The people who try that are reviled and quite rightly.

1:36:02.160 --> 1:36:04.680
 So why do we tolerate it with the Marxism thing?

1:36:04.680 --> 1:36:06.800
 And it's a great mystery to me,

1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:08.760
 the way that people do tolerate it.

1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:11.840
 Always, always in this stupid way of saying,

1:36:11.840 --> 1:36:13.920
 we haven't done it yet.

1:36:13.920 --> 1:36:16.240
 And if you keep trying the same recipe

1:36:16.240 --> 1:36:19.160
 and every time it comes out as shit,

1:36:19.160 --> 1:36:21.240
 it's the recipes shit.

1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:23.400
 Well, sort of, I'm trying to practice here

1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:25.480
 by playing devil's advocate, practice the same idea

1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:29.360
 that you mentioned, which is when you say the word Marxism,

1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:30.720
 should you throw out everything

1:36:30.720 --> 1:36:32.320
 or should you ask a question?

1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:34.480
 Is there good ideas here?

1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:37.320
 And the same, it's the good, it's weighing the good

1:36:37.320 --> 1:36:40.680
 and the bad and being able to do so calmly and thoughtfully.

1:36:40.680 --> 1:36:41.800
 Sure.

1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:45.600
 You know, do you know the famous George Orwell comment

1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:48.760
 on the style, in an argument with a Stalinist?

1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:49.600
 Do you know that?

1:36:49.600 --> 1:36:51.400
 That's one of my favorite quotes.

1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:53.560
 George Orwell in the early 40s gets into an argument

1:36:53.560 --> 1:36:57.040
 with a Stalinist who's obviously a Marxist.

1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:02.920
 And the, it's after the show trials, 37.

1:37:02.920 --> 1:37:07.920
 This is when it's very clear what Marxism

1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:09.960
 in the Russian form is.

1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:15.240
 And this Orwell is in the discussion with this Marxist

1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:18.960
 and it goes on and on and eventually Orwell says,

1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:20.560
 well, you know, what about the show trials

1:37:20.560 --> 1:37:23.040
 and what about what's happened in Ukraine

1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:27.600
 and the famines and much more and the purges

1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:29.160
 and the purges and the purges.

1:37:29.160 --> 1:37:33.080
 And eventually the Stalinist says to Orwell,

1:37:33.080 --> 1:37:35.480
 what Orwell knows he's going to say all along,

1:37:35.480 --> 1:37:37.520
 which is he says, you can't make an omelette

1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:39.360
 without breaking eggs.

1:37:40.200 --> 1:37:42.920
 And Orwell says, where's the omelette?

1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:49.600
 Oh yeah, that's a good, that's a really good,

1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:50.440
 because it's...

1:37:50.440 --> 1:37:52.600
 Look at this by this stage, okay?

1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:53.440
 How many...

1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:54.640
 Where's my damn omelette?

1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:59.640
 How many just messy, big, bloody, eggy piles

1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:04.120
 have the Marxists created by now in country after country?

1:38:05.080 --> 1:38:06.920
 Always next time they're going to produce

1:38:06.920 --> 1:38:10.160
 the great omelette, but they never have

1:38:10.160 --> 1:38:12.640
 and they never will because the whole thing

1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:14.680
 is rotten from the start.

1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:17.560
 But let me just also say one thing about that,

1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:20.720
 because of course Marx isn't as nice as he sounds.

1:38:20.720 --> 1:38:23.360
 And that's one of the things that I try to highlight

1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:26.000
 in the book is if we're going to do this reductive thing

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.120
 of people in history and saying, well,

1:38:27.120 --> 1:38:29.560
 they had views that were of their time

1:38:29.560 --> 1:38:32.080
 and we must therefore condemn them for them.

1:38:32.080 --> 1:38:34.240
 Say, fine, let's do the same thing with Marx.

1:38:34.240 --> 1:38:35.760
 And there are things I quote in this book

1:38:35.760 --> 1:38:38.480
 from Marx's letters, not least letters to Engels.

1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:40.880
 And indeed in his published writings,

1:38:40.880 --> 1:38:45.880
 he was writing for the American press in the 1950s.

1:38:47.280 --> 1:38:50.000
 The way he shares horrible views on slavery

1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:53.920
 and colonialism and much more.

1:38:53.920 --> 1:38:54.840
 But the main thing is, I mean,

1:38:54.840 --> 1:38:57.720
 the horrible things he says about black people

1:38:57.720 --> 1:38:59.480
 and the constant use of the N word.

1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:00.800
 In fact, when I was doing the audiobook

1:39:00.800 --> 1:39:03.400
 for the Warner West, I had to decide,

1:39:03.400 --> 1:39:05.760
 will I read out the quotes from Marx or not?

1:39:05.760 --> 1:39:08.960
 If I had read them out, I'd have been canceled

1:39:08.960 --> 1:39:11.280
 because people would have just said,

1:39:11.280 --> 1:39:14.440
 you've been using the N word so much in this passage.

1:39:14.440 --> 1:39:17.720
 And I slightly thought of doing it

1:39:17.720 --> 1:39:20.680
 so that I could say I was only quoting Marx

1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:22.480
 to try to hit the point home.

1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:24.280
 In the end, of course, I was sensible and decided not to.

1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:27.600
 But Marx's letters are disgusting on these terms.

1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:29.440
 Since I highlighted this in this book

1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:31.440
 and some of the media picked it up

1:39:32.920 --> 1:39:35.840
 and have popularized this thing,

1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:37.400
 I'm trying to put into the system,

1:39:37.400 --> 1:39:39.440
 which is if you're going to accuse Churchill of racism,

1:39:39.440 --> 1:39:41.600
 if you're going to accuse Jefferson of racism,

1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:44.280
 Washington of racism and so on, what about Marx?

1:39:44.280 --> 1:39:46.680
 The two things that Marxists have said since this came out

1:39:46.680 --> 1:39:48.880
 has been, first of all, why are you saying this

1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:49.720
 about Marx?

1:39:49.720 --> 1:39:54.280
 He was a man of his time, like everyone else.

1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:55.680
 And the second thing they say is,

1:39:55.680 --> 1:39:58.880
 we don't go to Marx for his horrible, abhorrent views on race.

1:39:58.880 --> 1:40:01.840
 So talking about mixed race people as gorillas and so on.

1:40:02.920 --> 1:40:04.320
 We don't go to him for that.

1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:06.640
 We go to him for his economic theories.

1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:10.240
 I say, okay, well, we don't go to Thomas Jefferson

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:12.020
 for his views on slaves.

1:40:12.020 --> 1:40:17.020
 We don't go to Churchill for the precise language

1:40:18.780 --> 1:40:21.420
 he used that points in the 1910s about Indians.

1:40:21.420 --> 1:40:22.780
 Or his health advice.

1:40:22.780 --> 1:40:24.620
 Or his health advice.

1:40:24.620 --> 1:40:26.060
 I do get him for that.

1:40:27.460 --> 1:40:28.620
 That explains so much.

1:40:28.620 --> 1:40:31.740
 But let's have some standards on this.

1:40:31.740 --> 1:40:34.340
 And that's why I'm very suspicious of the fact

1:40:34.340 --> 1:40:36.100
 that the people don't do this with Marx

1:40:36.100 --> 1:40:38.380
 because I think what some people are trying to do,

1:40:38.380 --> 1:40:40.060
 and this may sound conspiratorial,

1:40:40.060 --> 1:40:41.500
 but I really don't think it is.

1:40:41.500 --> 1:40:43.540
 I think that some people are deliberately trying

1:40:43.540 --> 1:40:47.220
 to completely clear the cultural landscape of our past

1:40:47.220 --> 1:40:49.660
 in order to say there's nothing good,

1:40:49.660 --> 1:40:51.100
 nothing you can hold on to.

1:40:51.100 --> 1:40:52.340
 No one you should revere.

1:40:52.340 --> 1:40:53.820
 You've got no heroes.

1:40:53.820 --> 1:40:55.180
 The whole thing comes down.

1:40:55.180 --> 1:40:56.220
 Who's left standing?

1:40:56.220 --> 1:40:57.460
 Oh, we've also got this idea

1:40:57.460 --> 1:41:00.500
 from the 20th century still about Marxism.

1:41:00.500 --> 1:41:02.540
 Well, the 19th and 20th centuries.

1:41:02.540 --> 1:41:07.540
 And no, no, I will not have the entire landscape

1:41:07.540 --> 1:41:12.540
 deracinated and then the worst ideas tried again.

1:41:13.060 --> 1:41:15.100
 So basically destroy all of history

1:41:15.100 --> 1:41:16.580
 and the lessons learned from history

1:41:16.580 --> 1:41:17.860
 and then start from scratch

1:41:17.860 --> 1:41:20.740
 and then it's completely any idea can work

1:41:20.740 --> 1:41:22.340
 and then you could just take whatever.

1:41:22.340 --> 1:41:24.380
 Well, and the thing is there are always some people

1:41:24.380 --> 1:41:25.940
 with preprepared ideas.

1:41:25.940 --> 1:41:27.940
 And I mentioned this also with the postcolonialists.

1:41:27.940 --> 1:41:30.620
 The postcolonialists were really interesting

1:41:30.620 --> 1:41:33.300
 because when the European powers were moving

1:41:33.300 --> 1:41:35.700
 from Africa and the Far East,

1:41:35.700 --> 1:41:38.740
 postcolonial movements had one obvious move

1:41:38.740 --> 1:41:41.340
 they could have done, which was to say,

1:41:41.340 --> 1:41:43.260
 since the European powers have left,

1:41:43.260 --> 1:41:46.420
 we will return to a precolonial life,

1:41:46.420 --> 1:41:48.300
 which in some of their places would have been returning

1:41:48.300 --> 1:41:50.620
 to slave markets and slave ownership

1:41:50.620 --> 1:41:52.500
 and slave selling and much more.

1:41:52.500 --> 1:41:54.300
 But put that aside for a second.

1:41:54.300 --> 1:41:56.300
 They could have said we have an indigenous culture

1:41:56.300 --> 1:41:59.660
 which we will return to almost uniformly

1:41:59.660 --> 1:42:01.100
 in the postcolonial era.

1:42:01.100 --> 1:42:04.100
 You had figures like France Fanon.

1:42:04.100 --> 1:42:06.580
 You had European intellectuals like Satra

1:42:06.580 --> 1:42:09.780
 who said the Western powers are retreating

1:42:09.780 --> 1:42:11.620
 from these countries and therefore we should

1:42:11.620 --> 1:42:14.940
 institute in these countries what but Western Marxism?

1:42:17.060 --> 1:42:20.020
 Well, it's not obvious to me that like the bad ideas

1:42:20.020 --> 1:42:21.300
 would be the ones that emerge,

1:42:21.300 --> 1:42:23.260
 but it's more likely that the bad ideas

1:42:23.260 --> 1:42:24.580
 would emerge in this kind of context

1:42:24.580 --> 1:42:26.540
 when you erase history.

1:42:26.540 --> 1:42:27.380
 When you erase tradition.

1:42:27.380 --> 1:42:28.660
 When you erase history

1:42:28.660 --> 1:42:33.500
 and you leave some ideas deliberately uninterrogated.

1:42:33.500 --> 1:42:38.500
 I mean, as I say, find me one in 100 American students

1:42:39.020 --> 1:42:44.020
 who've heard of any of the communist despots

1:42:44.180 --> 1:42:45.460
 of the 20th century.

1:42:47.260 --> 1:42:49.500
 I mean, name recognition in,

1:42:49.500 --> 1:42:52.260
 there was a poll done a few years ago in the UK

1:42:52.260 --> 1:42:56.380
 and like name recognition among children,

1:42:56.380 --> 1:43:01.380
 school children for Stalin, let alone Mao.

1:43:01.380 --> 1:43:03.980
 I mean, Mao who kills more people

1:43:03.980 --> 1:43:08.980
 than anyone 65 million Chinese, perhaps.

1:43:09.540 --> 1:43:13.140
 How many students in America know what Mao was,

1:43:13.140 --> 1:43:16.500
 who he was, where he was, nothing.

1:43:16.500 --> 1:43:17.940
 Or the atrocities committed.

1:43:17.940 --> 1:43:19.380
 Where the atrocities were committed.

1:43:19.380 --> 1:43:20.540
 Or. And I worry about that

1:43:20.540 --> 1:43:23.620
 because it means that we might have learned one

1:43:23.620 --> 1:43:26.140
 of the two lessons of the 20th century.

1:43:26.140 --> 1:43:29.460
 We think we've learned one of the two lessons

1:43:29.460 --> 1:43:30.380
 of the 20th century.

1:43:30.380 --> 1:43:32.140
 We actually haven't learned that lesson.

1:43:32.140 --> 1:43:33.860
 We've learned a little bit of it

1:43:33.860 --> 1:43:35.860
 and we've not learned the other one at all.

1:43:35.860 --> 1:43:37.740
 Because that's why we still have people

1:43:37.740 --> 1:43:39.380
 in American politics and elsewhere

1:43:39.380 --> 1:43:42.820
 actually talking about collectivization and things.

1:43:42.820 --> 1:43:44.780
 As if there's no problem with that.

1:43:44.780 --> 1:43:47.580
 And as if it's perfectly obvious and they could run it

1:43:47.580 --> 1:43:49.620
 and they'd know exactly where to start.

1:43:49.620 --> 1:43:51.460
 What are the two lessons of the 20th century?

1:43:51.460 --> 1:43:52.780
 Fascism and communism.

1:43:55.340 --> 1:43:56.500
 Yeah.

1:43:56.500 --> 1:43:57.860
 I mean, I'm not exactly sure

1:43:57.860 --> 1:44:00.940
 what exactly the lessons are.

1:44:00.940 --> 1:44:02.060
 No, it's not clear.

1:44:02.060 --> 1:44:04.940
 The lessons were very clear that we'd be better at it.

1:44:04.940 --> 1:44:08.300
 Well, one is your book broadly applied

1:44:08.300 --> 1:44:10.620
 of Madness of Crowds.

1:44:10.620 --> 1:44:11.780
 That's one lesson.

1:44:12.940 --> 1:44:14.100
 How so?

1:44:14.100 --> 1:44:19.100
 Meaning like large crowds can display heard like behavior.

1:44:19.300 --> 1:44:20.140
 Yes.

1:44:20.140 --> 1:44:21.300
 Be very suspicious of crowd.

1:44:21.300 --> 1:44:22.140
 Yeah.

1:44:22.140 --> 1:44:24.140
 In general, I mean, you apply it in different,

1:44:24.140 --> 1:44:26.460
 more to modern application in a sense,

1:44:26.460 --> 1:44:30.860
 but that's rooted in history that crowds can,

1:44:30.860 --> 1:44:32.420
 when humans get together,

1:44:32.420 --> 1:44:35.540
 they can do some quite radically silly things.

1:44:35.540 --> 1:44:37.060
 Elias Canetti is very good on that.

1:44:37.060 --> 1:44:38.300
 Crowds and power.

1:44:40.460 --> 1:44:43.140
 And Eric Hoffa, who was a sort of self taught,

1:44:43.140 --> 1:44:47.900
 amazing, not say autodidactic writer,

1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:49.220
 the true believer and so on.

1:44:49.220 --> 1:44:51.420
 He was extremely good on that.

1:44:51.420 --> 1:44:52.860
 But the reason I mentioned the two thing though,

1:44:52.860 --> 1:44:54.860
 I mean, we should have realized that the two nightmares

1:44:54.860 --> 1:44:57.580
 of the 20th century fascism and communism,

1:44:57.580 --> 1:45:00.060
 that we should know how they came about.

1:45:00.060 --> 1:45:01.260
 And we're interested in learning

1:45:01.260 --> 1:45:03.220
 how one of them came about fascism.

1:45:03.220 --> 1:45:05.660
 And we know some of the lessons like,

1:45:05.660 --> 1:45:08.380
 don't treat other people as less than you

1:45:08.380 --> 1:45:10.260
 because of their race.

1:45:10.260 --> 1:45:12.180
 That's one lesson.

1:45:12.180 --> 1:45:16.260
 But when we've done some good at learning that,

1:45:17.540 --> 1:45:20.620
 but the second one, not to do communism again,

1:45:20.620 --> 1:45:22.140
 not to do socialism.

1:45:22.140 --> 1:45:26.580
 I think we're way away from knowing

1:45:26.580 --> 1:45:29.540
 because we don't know how it happened.

1:45:29.540 --> 1:45:32.660
 And the little temptations are still there always.

1:45:32.660 --> 1:45:33.500
 Look at the people saying,

1:45:33.500 --> 1:45:35.740
 I'm gonna expropriate your property.

1:45:39.060 --> 1:45:40.540
 If people do things they don't like,

1:45:40.540 --> 1:45:42.980
 they will get, we can't wait to take your property.

1:45:42.980 --> 1:45:45.820
 Well, there's a sense, there's an appealing sense.

1:45:47.100 --> 1:45:50.980
 Okay, every ideology has an appealing narrative behind it

1:45:50.980 --> 1:45:52.540
 that sells the ideology.

1:45:52.540 --> 1:45:57.180
 So for socialism, for communism is that there's a,

1:45:57.180 --> 1:46:01.660
 it seems unfair that the working class does all of this work

1:46:01.660 --> 1:46:05.100
 and gets only a fraction of the output.

1:46:05.100 --> 1:46:07.060
 It just seems unfair.

1:46:07.060 --> 1:46:07.900
 So you wanna make it.

1:46:07.900 --> 1:46:10.180
 If they do get a fraction of the output, yes.

1:46:10.180 --> 1:46:11.340
 Yes.

1:46:11.340 --> 1:46:16.260
 And so it seems to be more fair if we increase that.

1:46:16.260 --> 1:46:21.260
 If the workers own all of the value of their output

1:46:21.460 --> 1:46:24.100
 and well, the things that are more fair

1:46:24.100 --> 1:46:26.740
 seems to be a good thing.

1:46:26.740 --> 1:46:29.020
 I'd say, well, yeah, I mean, fairness is,

1:46:29.860 --> 1:46:31.580
 I like fairness as a term.

1:46:31.580 --> 1:46:32.420
 My justice.

1:46:32.420 --> 1:46:33.780
 No, I much prefer fairness

1:46:33.780 --> 1:46:36.820
 because it's a much easier thing to try to work out.

1:46:36.820 --> 1:46:38.620
 It's quite amorphous itself as a concept,

1:46:38.620 --> 1:46:40.780
 but everyone can recognize it.

1:46:40.780 --> 1:46:41.660
 So for instance,

1:46:41.660 --> 1:46:46.660
 should the boss of the company earn a million times

1:46:49.500 --> 1:46:52.460
 that of the lowest paid employee, it doesn't seem fair.

1:46:53.700 --> 1:46:57.820
 Should they earn maybe five or 10 times?

1:46:57.820 --> 1:47:00.620
 The salary of the lowest, right?

1:47:00.620 --> 1:47:01.700
 Yeah, possibly.

1:47:01.700 --> 1:47:03.380
 That could be fair.

1:47:03.380 --> 1:47:05.060
 There are certain sort of multiples

1:47:05.060 --> 1:47:08.380
 which are within the bounds of,

1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:12.500
 you know, reasonableness.

1:47:12.500 --> 1:47:14.140
 I think actually that's the,

1:47:15.780 --> 1:47:18.260
 that's the much bigger problem in capitalism

1:47:18.260 --> 1:47:19.100
 at the moment as I see it,

1:47:19.100 --> 1:47:22.820
 is the not untrue perception

1:47:22.820 --> 1:47:26.100
 that a tiny number of people get a lot of the,

1:47:26.100 --> 1:47:28.660
 accrue a lot of the benefits

1:47:28.660 --> 1:47:33.660
 and that the bit in the middle

1:47:35.340 --> 1:47:37.820
 has become increasingly squeezed

1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:39.580
 and is at danger always of falling

1:47:39.580 --> 1:47:41.020
 all the way down to the bottom.

1:47:41.020 --> 1:47:42.060
 I mean, I think in the snakes

1:47:42.060 --> 1:47:43.620
 and ladders of American capitalism,

1:47:43.620 --> 1:47:47.260
 for instance, it's a correct perception to say

1:47:47.260 --> 1:47:51.340
 that the snakes go down awfully far.

1:47:52.460 --> 1:47:54.660
 If you tread on the snake,

1:47:54.660 --> 1:47:57.460
 you can plummet an awfully long way in America.

1:47:58.340 --> 1:48:03.100
 And the deal in the game was that the ladders took you high

1:48:03.980 --> 1:48:05.060
 and there's a perception.

1:48:05.060 --> 1:48:07.540
 And again, it's not entirely wrong

1:48:07.540 --> 1:48:10.460
 that the ladders system on the board is kind of broken.

1:48:11.980 --> 1:48:14.940
 So what you're saying is you're a Marxist.

1:48:14.940 --> 1:48:16.860
 I'm not saying I'm a Marxist.

1:48:16.860 --> 1:48:19.500
 You heard that here first in the,

1:48:19.500 --> 1:48:21.900
 in the out of context blog post,

1:48:21.900 --> 1:48:22.900
 you're going to write about this.

1:48:22.900 --> 1:48:24.260
 I get to that, I get practice point it.

1:48:24.260 --> 1:48:26.300
 The way to critique capitalism

1:48:26.300 --> 1:48:28.940
 if it's gone bad is to get better capital.

1:48:28.940 --> 1:48:29.780
 Yes.

1:48:29.780 --> 1:48:32.780
 Free markets where they're not fair should be made fair.

1:48:32.780 --> 1:48:36.060
 Never decide that the answer is

1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:39.060
 the thing that has never produced any human flourishing,

1:48:39.060 --> 1:48:41.060
 i.e. Marxism.

1:48:41.060 --> 1:48:43.300
 So as you describe in the madness of crowds,

1:48:43.300 --> 1:48:45.540
 the herd like behavior of humans,

1:48:45.540 --> 1:48:47.100
 that gets us into trouble,

1:48:49.180 --> 1:48:51.500
 you as an individual thinker

1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.220
 and others listening to this,

1:48:53.220 --> 1:48:55.940
 how can you, because all of us are midst crowds.

1:48:55.940 --> 1:48:58.740
 We're influenced by the society that's around us,

1:48:58.740 --> 1:49:00.060
 by the people that's around us.

1:49:00.060 --> 1:49:01.660
 How can we think independently?

1:49:02.580 --> 1:49:05.300
 How can we, you know,

1:49:05.300 --> 1:49:10.300
 if you're in the Soviet Union

1:49:10.420 --> 1:49:12.340
 at the beginning of the 20th century,

1:49:13.220 --> 1:49:17.940
 if you're in, I don't know, Nazi Germany

1:49:17.940 --> 1:49:19.820
 at the end of the 30s or the 40s,

1:49:19.820 --> 1:49:21.500
 how can you think independently?

1:49:22.500 --> 1:49:26.900
 Given, first of all, that it's hard to think independently,

1:49:26.900 --> 1:49:28.580
 just intellectually speaking,

1:49:28.580 --> 1:49:31.020
 but also that there's,

1:49:31.020 --> 1:49:33.700
 it just becomes more and more dangerous.

1:49:33.700 --> 1:49:36.780
 So the incentive to think independently

1:49:36.780 --> 1:49:39.620
 under the uncertainty that's usually involved

1:49:39.620 --> 1:49:42.860
 with thinking is, I mean, it's a silly thing to say,

1:49:42.860 --> 1:49:45.380
 but on Twitter, there's a cost to be paid for.

1:49:45.380 --> 1:49:46.220
 Yes.

1:49:46.220 --> 1:49:49.580
 For going against the crowd on any silly thing.

1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:52.900
 We can even talk about, what is it?

1:49:52.900 --> 1:49:55.380
 Will Smith slapping Chris Rock.

1:49:55.380 --> 1:49:56.780
 You know, there's a crowd that believes

1:49:56.780 --> 1:49:59.020
 that that was unjustified.

1:49:59.020 --> 1:50:00.980
 I forget what the crowd decided,

1:50:00.980 --> 1:50:01.820
 but I don't.

1:50:01.820 --> 1:50:03.980
 The crowd split on that one, it's safe to have one opinion

1:50:03.980 --> 1:50:04.820
 either way.

1:50:04.820 --> 1:50:05.660
 Okay, it is, right.

1:50:05.660 --> 1:50:07.940
 But there's a, you put it very nicely,

1:50:07.940 --> 1:50:10.300
 that there's clearly a calculus here

1:50:10.300 --> 1:50:12.140
 and that you can measure on Twitter,

1:50:12.140 --> 1:50:14.420
 and particularly you can measure kind of the crowd,

1:50:14.420 --> 1:50:16.180
 a sense of where the crowd lays.

1:50:16.180 --> 1:50:17.140
 Michael Jackson.

1:50:19.340 --> 1:50:20.700
 Well, oh boy.

1:50:22.460 --> 1:50:26.060
 I don't want to, this is not a legal discussion

1:50:26.060 --> 1:50:28.060
 where I don't have my lawyer present.

1:50:28.060 --> 1:50:29.060
 I don't even have a lawyer.

1:50:29.060 --> 1:50:30.540
 The man in question is dead,

1:50:30.540 --> 1:50:33.900
 but I think most people who are not just die hard fans

1:50:33.900 --> 1:50:35.060
 would concede that Michael Jackson

1:50:35.060 --> 1:50:37.060
 had a strange relationship with children

1:50:37.060 --> 1:50:40.940
 and was almost certainly a pedophile.

1:50:42.100 --> 1:50:45.180
 Is that, was that, did the crowd agree on that?

1:50:45.180 --> 1:50:46.300
 No, the crowd hasn't agreed

1:50:46.300 --> 1:50:48.500
 because he's too famous and we all love thriller.

1:50:48.500 --> 1:50:49.580
 Yeah, we do.

1:50:49.580 --> 1:50:52.500
 So you said people who are not fans, I just don't.

1:50:52.500 --> 1:50:53.940
 No, I'm a fan of Michael Jackson,

1:50:53.940 --> 1:50:56.660
 but I think he was almost certainly a pedophile.

1:50:56.660 --> 1:51:01.540
 And but nobody wants to give up dancing to bad at weddings.

1:51:01.540 --> 1:51:04.940
 So they just kind of added in, it's fine.

1:51:05.900 --> 1:51:10.900
 Seriously, is your law not applied to Bill Cosby?

1:51:11.420 --> 1:51:12.260
 Oh, that's it.

1:51:12.260 --> 1:51:14.380
 Well, he wasn't, he was, of course,

1:51:14.380 --> 1:51:16.700
 one of the most famous people in America,

1:51:16.700 --> 1:51:18.740
 but maybe he wasn't regarded as talented.

1:51:19.620 --> 1:51:22.100
 Oh, wow, there's depth to this calculation.

1:51:22.100 --> 1:51:25.140
 Oh yeah, there's a genius opt out in all cultures.

1:51:25.140 --> 1:51:27.460
 There's a genius opt out in all cultures.

1:51:27.460 --> 1:51:29.980
 Look at Lord Byron, Lord Byron shagged his sister.

1:51:31.300 --> 1:51:32.740
 Doesn't affect his reputation.

1:51:32.740 --> 1:51:34.820
 In fact, if anything, it kind of adds to it.

1:51:34.820 --> 1:51:38.340
 But then again, there's kind of war against the West.

1:51:38.340 --> 1:51:41.660
 Geniuses actually makes you more likely,

1:51:41.660 --> 1:51:43.740
 or no, to get canceled.

1:51:43.740 --> 1:51:47.740
 So if you look at the genius of Thomas Jefferson, or...

1:51:47.740 --> 1:51:49.500
 Well, yes, because if you haven't done anything,

1:51:49.500 --> 1:51:51.220
 remarkable nobody will come looking for you

1:51:51.220 --> 1:51:52.980
 possibly, possibly, yeah.

1:51:52.980 --> 1:51:55.900
 Also, genius can get you in trouble eventually.

1:51:55.900 --> 1:51:58.020
 Sidel through life and nobody noticing.

1:51:58.020 --> 1:52:00.460
 Be totally harmless and then die

1:52:00.460 --> 1:52:02.660
 and hope you haven't used any carbon.

1:52:05.660 --> 1:52:07.100
 But you were asking about,

1:52:07.100 --> 1:52:08.940
 you were asking about how to survive

1:52:08.940 --> 1:52:13.140
 the era of social media, as it were, and the crowds.

1:52:13.140 --> 1:52:15.460
 And there's a very simple answer to that.

1:52:15.460 --> 1:52:20.460
 Don't overrate the significance of the unreal world.

1:52:20.460 --> 1:52:24.020
 Oh, come on, but this is still human psychology.

1:52:24.020 --> 1:52:26.020
 Because you want to fit in, there's a, you wanna...

1:52:26.020 --> 1:52:27.340
 Why?

1:52:27.340 --> 1:52:30.660
 Because you're, you like people, and you're just a...

1:52:30.660 --> 1:52:32.260
 Why not just like a small number of people

1:52:32.260 --> 1:52:33.460
 and ignore the rest?

1:52:33.460 --> 1:52:34.660
 Yeah, that's...

1:52:34.660 --> 1:52:35.900
 That's what I do.

1:52:35.900 --> 1:52:38.300
 Well, I mean, I actually like most people.

1:52:38.300 --> 1:52:39.580
 And this isn't a general thing.

1:52:39.580 --> 1:52:42.860
 I don't have detestation for most people at all.

1:52:42.860 --> 1:52:45.860
 Most people I can't really enjoy speaking with

1:52:45.860 --> 1:52:47.060
 and being with.

1:52:47.060 --> 1:52:51.060
 But in terms of storing your sense of self worth

1:52:51.060 --> 1:52:53.460
 in absolute strangers, big mistake.

1:52:53.460 --> 1:52:57.660
 Yeah, well, me, that's, let's turn it into a therapy session.

1:52:57.660 --> 1:52:59.660
 Because for me, and I think I represent

1:52:59.660 --> 1:53:02.660
 some number of population, is I'm pretty self critical.

1:53:02.660 --> 1:53:04.660
 I'm looking for myself in the world.

1:53:04.660 --> 1:53:07.660
 And there is a depth of connection

1:53:07.660 --> 1:53:09.460
 with people on the internet.

1:53:09.460 --> 1:53:10.460
 I mean, I have some...

1:53:10.460 --> 1:53:11.860
 I think there's a shallowness of it.

1:53:11.860 --> 1:53:13.260
 It's shallow connection.

1:53:13.260 --> 1:53:14.260
 Interesting.

1:53:14.260 --> 1:53:15.260
 I...

1:53:15.260 --> 1:53:16.260
 Put it this way.

1:53:16.260 --> 1:53:20.860
 If you became very ill tomorrow, would any of them help?

1:53:20.860 --> 1:53:21.860
 On the internet? No.

1:53:21.860 --> 1:53:22.860
 No, no.

1:53:22.860 --> 1:53:23.860
 Good. That's a good test.

1:53:23.860 --> 1:53:24.860
 Yeah, that's a good test.

1:53:24.860 --> 1:53:27.660
 But then at the end of the day, yeah, you're right.

1:53:27.660 --> 1:53:29.860
 Your very close friends would help, family would help.

1:53:29.860 --> 1:53:30.860
 Yeah.

1:53:30.860 --> 1:53:32.660
 And perhaps that's the only thing...

1:53:32.660 --> 1:53:39.060
 You can't store significant amounts of trust

1:53:39.060 --> 1:53:43.860
 or faith or belief or self worth in places

1:53:43.860 --> 1:53:46.460
 which will not return it to you.

1:53:46.460 --> 1:53:48.860
 Okay, so let's talk about the more extreme case,

1:53:48.860 --> 1:53:49.860
 the harsher case.

1:53:49.860 --> 1:53:54.460
 When you talk about the things you talk about in the war,

1:53:54.460 --> 1:53:57.660
 on the West and madness of crowds,

1:53:57.660 --> 1:54:03.460
 I mean, you're getting a lot of blowback, I'm sure.

1:54:03.460 --> 1:54:07.060
 As for the listener, you just shrugged lightly.

1:54:07.060 --> 1:54:10.260
 With a zen like look on your face.

1:54:10.260 --> 1:54:14.660
 So you don't... All you need is Sam Harris to say

1:54:14.660 --> 1:54:17.860
 that you're brilliant and you're happy.

1:54:17.860 --> 1:54:21.460
 No, I love Sam.

1:54:21.460 --> 1:54:23.860
 I'm deeply pleased when he flatters me.

1:54:23.860 --> 1:54:27.660
 And he's nice about me, but no, I don't just rely on Sam.

1:54:27.660 --> 1:54:31.660
 No, I mean, why would I mind?

1:54:31.660 --> 1:54:34.460
 I mean, maybe it's self selecting.

1:54:34.460 --> 1:54:37.860
 If I didn't have the view I had about that

1:54:37.860 --> 1:54:40.660
 or whatever armory it is that I have on that,

1:54:40.660 --> 1:54:43.260
 I wouldn't do what I did, maybe.

1:54:43.260 --> 1:54:45.860
 I mean, have you been to some dark places psychologically

1:54:45.860 --> 1:54:48.860
 because of the challenging ideas you explore?

1:54:48.860 --> 1:54:52.060
 Like significant self doubt, just kind of...

1:54:52.060 --> 1:54:55.460
 I can't say I've been unaffected by everything in my life.

1:54:55.460 --> 1:55:01.060
 By any means, that would make me an automator of some kind.

1:55:01.060 --> 1:55:05.460
 There's definitely times I've got things wrong and regretted that.

1:55:05.460 --> 1:55:09.660
 There's times I've...

1:55:09.660 --> 1:55:13.660
 There was a period around the time I wrote my book,

1:55:13.660 --> 1:55:21.260
 The Strange Death of Europe, which was very, very dark time.

1:55:21.260 --> 1:55:25.260
 And it wasn't because I was having a dark time in my life,

1:55:25.260 --> 1:55:27.460
 but because of the book I was writing.

1:55:27.460 --> 1:55:31.260
 Oh, because of the place you had to go in order to write?

1:55:31.260 --> 1:55:32.260
 Yeah.

1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:35.660
 And well, I was contemplating the end of a civilization.

1:55:35.660 --> 1:55:41.060
 So occasionally now I have maybe slightly too pat at this stage,

1:55:41.060 --> 1:55:44.060
 but sometimes readers come up to me in the street

1:55:44.060 --> 1:55:45.060
 or whatever and say, you know,

1:55:45.060 --> 1:55:47.860
 I love The Strange Death of Europe.

1:55:47.860 --> 1:55:48.860
 And we'll say, you know,

1:55:48.860 --> 1:55:51.860
 it's a very depressing book to read, however.

1:55:51.860 --> 1:55:56.660
 And I would say, well, you should have tried writing it.

1:55:56.660 --> 1:55:59.060
 But it was because I mean, I was...

1:55:59.060 --> 1:56:02.660
 It has chunks of it which I'm very proud of in particular

1:56:02.660 --> 1:56:06.860
 about the death of religion, the death of God,

1:56:06.860 --> 1:56:11.660
 the loss of meaning and the void.

1:56:11.660 --> 1:56:16.860
 And that's difficult stuff to write about and to grapple with.

1:56:16.860 --> 1:56:18.460
 And there is a sort of...

1:56:18.460 --> 1:56:21.660
 I haven't reread that book since it came out,

1:56:21.660 --> 1:56:25.260
 but I think there are passages in it

1:56:25.260 --> 1:56:28.060
 which reveal what I was thinking very clearly

1:56:28.060 --> 1:56:34.660
 in the poetry of it, as it were, as well as the detail.

1:56:34.660 --> 1:56:39.260
 But yeah, I can't say...

1:56:39.260 --> 1:56:45.860
 I'm used to saying what I think and what I see.

1:56:45.860 --> 1:56:49.060
 And if there's any pushback I've got from that,

1:56:49.060 --> 1:56:54.460
 I'm completely consoled that I'm saying what I see with my own eyes.

1:56:54.460 --> 1:56:59.260
 That's your source of strength is that you're always seeking the truth as best you see it.

1:56:59.260 --> 1:57:02.860
 Well, I can't agree to go along with a lie

1:57:02.860 --> 1:57:06.460
 if I've seen something with my own eyes.

1:57:06.460 --> 1:57:07.260
 Do you ever...

1:57:07.260 --> 1:57:11.460
 So speaking of Sam Harris, and I mentioned to you offline,

1:57:11.460 --> 1:57:13.060
 a lot of people...

1:57:13.060 --> 1:57:17.060
 I talk to a lot of smart people in my private life on this podcast,

1:57:17.060 --> 1:57:23.060
 and a lot of them will reference you as their example of a very smart person.

1:57:23.060 --> 1:57:28.260
 So given that compliment,

1:57:28.260 --> 1:57:33.460
 do you ever worry that your sort of ego grows to a level

1:57:33.460 --> 1:57:37.860
 where you're not what you think is the truth is no longer the truth?

1:57:37.860 --> 1:57:42.460
 Is this kind of...

1:57:42.460 --> 1:57:44.260
 It blinds you.

1:57:44.260 --> 1:57:50.460
 And also, on top of that, the fact that you stand against the crowd often,

1:57:50.460 --> 1:57:56.260
 that there's part of it that appeals to you that you like to point out the emperor has no clothes.

1:57:56.260 --> 1:57:58.460
 I get a certain thrill from the friction.

1:57:58.460 --> 1:58:05.060
 Yeah, that sometimes both your ego and the thrill of friction

1:58:05.060 --> 1:58:10.260
 will get you to deviate from the truth and instead just look for the friction.

1:58:10.260 --> 1:58:11.260
 Could do.

1:58:11.260 --> 1:58:13.660
 Could do for sure.

1:58:13.660 --> 1:58:15.860
 I try to keep alive to that.

1:58:15.860 --> 1:58:24.860
 Early in my career, I realized that, for instance, I didn't want to make enemies unnecessarily,

1:58:24.860 --> 1:58:30.060
 any more than strictly necessary, because there was a very large number of already necessary enemies.

1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:35.460
 And I remember one, so I won't get into the details, but I already had one sort of thing I'd done,

1:58:35.460 --> 1:58:39.260
 and then another thing came out, and I just thought, I can't, I can't do it.

1:58:39.260 --> 1:58:46.060
 And I remember thinking, don't be the sort of person who's forever creating storms.

1:58:46.060 --> 1:58:50.860
 And I tried to make sure I wasn't, and I think I pretty much stuck to that.

1:58:50.860 --> 1:58:58.460
 But to answer your question, well, the first thing is I'm as confident as I can be

1:58:58.460 --> 1:59:03.660
 that I wouldn't fall into the trap you described for two reasons.

1:59:03.660 --> 1:59:09.060
 I mean, one is that I don't think of myself as a wildly intelligent person.

1:59:09.060 --> 1:59:13.860
 Partly because I'm very, very aware of the things I know nothing about.

1:59:13.860 --> 1:59:26.260
 I mean, for instance, I have almost no knowledge of the details of finance or economic theory.

1:59:26.260 --> 1:59:30.860
 I mean, the real details, I don't mean the big picture of the kind that we were just discussing earlier.

1:59:30.860 --> 1:59:45.460
 But I have, if you put the periodic table in front of me, I would struggle to do more than a handful.

1:59:45.460 --> 1:59:53.660
 I am very conscious of huge gaps in my knowledge.

1:59:53.660 --> 1:59:59.260
 And where I have gaps or chasms, I tend to find I have a disproportionate admiration

1:59:59.260 --> 2:00:01.460
 for the people who know that stuff.

2:00:01.460 --> 2:00:05.460
 Like, I'm wildly impressed by people who understand money, really understand it.

2:00:05.460 --> 2:00:09.860
 They don't think, well, how the hell do you do that?

2:00:09.860 --> 2:00:17.460
 And the same thing with biologists, medics, stuff I just know very little about.

2:00:17.460 --> 2:00:19.460
 And that's a source of humility for you, just knowing that.

2:00:19.460 --> 2:00:25.260
 Yes, I mean, I think, well, I'm okay on that stuff, but Jesus, if you've got me on the general knowledge,

2:00:25.260 --> 2:00:31.460
 I would say that some years ago, there's a thing in the UK called University Challenge.

2:00:31.460 --> 2:00:40.060
 And I was asked some years ago, there's a sort of like celebrity one of former students of the universities or colleges

2:00:40.060 --> 2:00:42.460
 asked to go back for the Christmas special.

2:00:42.460 --> 2:00:49.160
 And I was asked to be one of the people from my old college to go back and compete in the sort of celebrity alumni one.

2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:53.560
 And the only thing I actually wanted to do it was go discover that Louis Theroux had been to my college before my time.

2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:55.760
 And he was on he'd agreed to be on the team.

2:00:55.760 --> 2:00:57.660
 And I thought I'd love to meet Louis Theroux.

2:00:57.660 --> 2:00:58.960
 That'd be great fun.

2:00:58.960 --> 2:01:01.860
 And anyhow, and I said, well, I really don't want to do it.

2:01:01.860 --> 2:01:03.160
 And they said, come on, you'd be great.

2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:03.760
 I said, I wouldn't.

2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:07.360
 I'd show myself up to be a total asshole and ignorant ramus.

2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:14.760
 And as it was, I sat down my flat and I watched some past episodes of University Challenge.

2:01:14.760 --> 2:01:20.460
 I realized I just sat and mute for the whole hour.

2:01:20.460 --> 2:01:25.960
 I just couldn't know the first question was about physics and the second one was about as it was.

2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:35.360
 I watched the the one and I could answer the first two or three questions of the one that actually went out because they made it a bit simpler.

2:01:35.360 --> 2:01:41.960
 But but I mean, I'm terribly conscious of the and I said to the producers, I said, I can't go on because I mean, I just couldn't answer the questions.

2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:46.060
 These unbelievably smart students seem to be able to answer a whole range of things.

2:01:46.060 --> 2:01:49.760
 So I'm perfectly aware of my limitations.

2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:53.560
 And you can't to play your limitations.

2:01:53.560 --> 2:01:53.960
 Yeah.

2:01:53.960 --> 2:01:55.360
 And they're forever before me.

2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:58.860
 You know, they're not hard to find in every day.

2:01:58.860 --> 2:02:08.360
 And and then on top of that, I suppose it's in a way, you know, that line from Rudyard Kipfing's

2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:13.760
 alternatively brilliant and slightly nauseating poem F.

2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:14.960
 There's a line.

2:02:14.960 --> 2:02:16.960
 You just enjoy a good poem, can you?

2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:20.760
 Well, no, it's not I can enjoy a great poem.

2:02:20.760 --> 2:02:21.160
 Yes.

2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:22.960
 But I mean, a good poem.

2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:23.160
 Yeah.

2:02:23.160 --> 2:02:25.360
 This is, you know, site you off.

2:02:25.360 --> 2:02:29.460
 But wait, this is this is this goes to your criticism of Dostoevsky.

2:02:29.460 --> 2:02:33.360
 Take, take, take, take Douglas's criticism with a grain of salt.

2:02:33.360 --> 2:02:37.460
 So maybe I've heard it read at too many memorial services and things.

2:02:37.460 --> 2:02:37.660
 Sure.

2:02:37.660 --> 2:02:41.860
 But that line of it's a good piece of rice.

2:02:41.860 --> 2:02:46.960
 If you can learn to meet triumph and disaster and meet these greet these two impostors just

2:02:46.960 --> 2:02:47.860
 the same.

2:02:47.860 --> 2:02:48.360
 Yeah.

2:02:48.360 --> 2:02:49.660
 That's a good line.

2:02:49.660 --> 2:02:53.260
 A good line as it's keeping off an amazing turn of line.

2:02:53.260 --> 2:03:00.860
 But I do think that it's a very sensible thing to try to greet triumph and disaster and

2:03:00.860 --> 2:03:03.860
 regard them as imposters and greet them just the same.

2:03:03.860 --> 2:03:10.960
 And actually, anyone who knows me knows that I never partly it's because I have a sort of

2:03:10.960 --> 2:03:12.660
 belief in the old gods.

2:03:12.660 --> 2:03:17.060
 And at the moment that I thought that I was at the moment of triumph, the fates would

2:03:17.060 --> 2:03:22.060
 hitch up their skirts and run at me at a million miles an hour.

2:03:22.060 --> 2:03:26.060
 But it's also because I gen anyone who knows me knows.

2:03:26.060 --> 2:03:32.460
 I never have a moment when I say that's just great.

2:03:32.460 --> 2:03:37.360
 I feel totally fulfilled and victorious.

2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:41.260
 I mean, it happened to me recently when the war in the West went straight in a number

2:03:41.260 --> 2:03:43.360
 one in the best out of this.

2:03:43.360 --> 2:03:46.060
 How long did that last in terms of your self satisfaction?

2:03:46.060 --> 2:03:47.860
 Didn't have.

2:03:47.860 --> 2:03:49.060
 Not even for a brief moment.

2:03:49.060 --> 2:03:51.560
 No.

2:03:51.560 --> 2:03:55.460
 When I first saw that it was selling, I had that moment of relation.

2:03:55.460 --> 2:03:57.260
 I thought, good.

2:03:57.260 --> 2:03:58.060
 I've done it.

2:03:58.060 --> 2:03:59.560
 It's out.

2:03:59.560 --> 2:04:01.560
 And I did have a moment of relation then.

2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:03.160
 Definitely.

2:04:03.160 --> 2:04:07.060
 But it doesn't last partly because I tell myself it mustn't last.

2:04:07.060 --> 2:04:11.960
 Because as you said, fate hitches up its skirt.

2:04:11.960 --> 2:04:14.660
 Is that skirts?

2:04:14.660 --> 2:04:20.460
 You brits with your poetry, even when it's nauseating.

2:04:20.460 --> 2:04:26.060
 As of 2022, this year, what's your final analysis of the political leadership and the

2:04:26.060 --> 2:04:32.460
 human mind and the human being of Donald Trump?

2:04:32.460 --> 2:04:34.660
 I sort of avoided this for years.

2:04:34.660 --> 2:04:35.860
 Just talking about Trump.

2:04:35.860 --> 2:04:37.460
 I tried to avoid talking about Trump for years.

2:04:37.460 --> 2:04:39.660
 It's the same reason I tried to avoid writing about Brexit.

2:04:39.660 --> 2:04:45.660
 Do you think the Trump, just sorry on a small tangent, do you think the Trump story is over?

2:04:45.660 --> 2:04:47.660
 Are we just done with volume one?

2:04:47.660 --> 2:04:52.960
 I've no idea the people I know who know him say that he's running.

2:04:52.960 --> 2:05:02.760
 And I think that in general, Republicans have to do have a choice in front of them.

2:05:02.760 --> 2:05:10.860
 And one friend put it to me recently said, you've got to go in with your toughest fighter.

2:05:10.860 --> 2:05:15.560
 And I understand that instinct.

2:05:15.560 --> 2:05:18.560
 And I also think it's a very dangerous instinct.

2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:23.660
 Because what if your toughest fighter is also your biggest liability?

2:05:23.660 --> 2:05:28.060
 What's the best way to get out the Democrat voter than 2024 than to have Donald Trump running?

2:05:28.060 --> 2:05:32.660
 And the people that are doing the war in the West are pretty tough fighters.

2:05:32.660 --> 2:05:33.860
 But they are.

2:05:33.860 --> 2:05:38.860
 And I'm cautious about this because I know every way I tread is dangerous.

2:05:38.860 --> 2:05:41.260
 But let me just be frank.

2:05:41.260 --> 2:05:42.460
 I'll tread gracefully.

2:05:42.460 --> 2:05:46.460
 I'll tread as gracefully as I can in my Wellington boots.

2:05:46.460 --> 2:05:49.660
 Am I galoshes?

2:05:49.660 --> 2:05:52.260
 Here's the thing.

2:05:52.260 --> 2:05:54.660
 I think everybody knows what Trump is.

2:05:54.660 --> 2:05:56.960
 I think we all knew for years.

2:05:56.960 --> 2:06:02.860
 And I feel sorry for the conservatives who had to pretend that he was something he wasn't.

2:06:02.860 --> 2:06:09.860
 I felt sorry for the ones who had to pretend that, for instance, he was a devout Christian

2:06:09.860 --> 2:06:16.460
 or a man of faith or a man of great integrity or all of these sorts of things.

2:06:16.460 --> 2:06:20.960
 Because in the public eye for years, it would be obvious that wasn't the case.

2:06:20.960 --> 2:06:25.860
 But he has something extraordinary.

2:06:25.860 --> 2:06:32.660
 Well, one thing is a method of communication that you've just got to say is was unbelievable.

2:06:32.660 --> 2:06:35.860
 In one fundamental way that you can't look away for some reason.

2:06:35.860 --> 2:06:36.960
 Can't look away.

2:06:36.960 --> 2:06:45.060
 I mean, I mean, watching him clear everyone out of the way in 2016 was thrilling

2:06:45.060 --> 2:06:47.960
 because those people needed clearing away.

2:06:47.960 --> 2:06:53.060
 You know, it's just horrifying what America is going to give us another bush.

2:06:53.060 --> 2:06:55.760
 What's so great about this family?

2:06:55.760 --> 2:06:58.460
 America is going to give us another Clinton.

2:06:58.460 --> 2:07:01.360
 We're going to get to choose any Clinton on the bush.

2:07:01.360 --> 2:07:04.660
 Mark Stein said, whatever, we'll just wait for the day the Clinton's on the bushes into

2:07:04.660 --> 2:07:08.760
 Mary and then we can really have a monarchy again.

2:07:08.760 --> 2:07:12.160
 So I was very pleased to see him clear them away.

2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:18.760
 I was very pleased to see him sort of raise some of the issues that needed raising.

2:07:18.760 --> 2:07:24.760
 I thought it was a sort of breath of fresh air and I wished it wasn't him doing it.

2:07:24.760 --> 2:07:27.660
 And then there was a question of him governing and it was just perfectly clear.

2:07:27.660 --> 2:07:29.960
 He didn't know how to govern.

2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:35.160
 What he did have, however, what he does have is an incredible ability to fight.

2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:38.260
 And some of the forces he was arraigned against or were arraigned against him.

2:07:38.260 --> 2:07:41.560
 My gosh, they would have taken down anyone else.

2:07:41.560 --> 2:07:49.060
 I mean, if they'd have probably done some similar BS against Ted Cruz if he, you know,

2:07:49.060 --> 2:07:53.860
 or Marco Rubio, you know, they'd have said, as some people admitted,

2:07:53.860 --> 2:07:57.760
 they'd have accused all these people of racism and misogyny and everything else as well,

2:07:57.760 --> 2:08:01.160
 just like they did Mitt Romney, just like they did John McCain.

2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:06.460
 But Trump was the one ugly enough and bruisy enough to fight.

2:08:06.460 --> 2:08:17.960
 And also a willingness or a lack of willingness to play sort of the civil game of politics,

2:08:17.960 --> 2:08:23.760
 sort of, you know, at a party when like politeness gets you in trouble.

2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:28.360
 You show up and everybody's polite and you just out of momentum want to be being polite.

2:08:28.360 --> 2:08:34.460
 And all of a sudden you're on an island with Jeffrey Epstein and it gets you into a huge amount of trouble.

2:08:34.460 --> 2:08:37.160
 But so Trump has these sort of extraordinary qualities.

2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:42.560
 But I just, you know, look, he screwed up during his time in office

2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:44.960
 because he didn't achieve as much as he should have done.

2:08:44.960 --> 2:08:47.960
 You could say that about every president, but I refuse to acknowledge that two years

2:08:47.960 --> 2:08:52.360
 when he had both houses in the first beginning, he just didn't know what leave us to pull.

2:08:52.360 --> 2:08:58.260
 You know, I mean, he was sitting in the office behind the Oval Office tweeting, watching the news.

2:08:58.260 --> 2:09:00.260
 Sorry, that's not a president.

2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:08.060
 And he couldn't fill and didn't fill positions because people knew, I mean, people who were very loyal to him,

2:09:08.060 --> 2:09:12.460
 he would just, you know, he'd get them to do something loyal and then destroy them.

2:09:12.460 --> 2:09:17.360
 And I think, and then we get onto the thing about, and here we get onto the, you know,

2:09:17.360 --> 2:09:22.460
 what of course is very, very fractious terrain, but, you know, I covered the 2020 election

2:09:22.460 --> 2:09:27.960
 and I was traveling all around the States and I went to Trump rally and all sorts of stuff.

2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:35.960
 And I, I mean, I was in D.C. on election night and went and it got very ugly at one point

2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:38.660
 in so called Black Lives Matter Plaza.

2:09:38.660 --> 2:09:41.960
 When it looked like Trump might win when Florida came in and got really,

2:09:41.960 --> 2:09:44.360
 I could feel the air were very, very heated.

2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:48.960
 And like some Antifa people started getting into Black Block and this sort of stuff.

2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:53.360
 And I thought, this town's going to burn, you know, if Trump wins.

2:09:53.360 --> 2:09:58.360
 And in the aftermath of the vote, I was willing to hang around and watching for a bit.

2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:00.660
 And then I saw it was going to drag on.

2:10:00.660 --> 2:10:04.760
 And I saw some of his people and others and people told me they had great evidence of vote rigging

2:10:04.760 --> 2:10:06.360
 and all this sort of thing.

2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:12.160
 And I'm afraid I'm one of those people who doesn't believe that the evidence that they presented

2:10:12.160 --> 2:10:15.760
 is good enough to justify the claim that he won the election.

2:10:15.760 --> 2:10:19.560
 And I, and people say, have you seen 2000 meals?

2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:20.760
 And have you seen anything?

2:10:20.760 --> 2:10:26.560
 Look, the evidence isn't there that the election was won by Donald Trump.

2:10:26.560 --> 2:10:33.960
 And I think that what he did on January the 6th was unbelievably dangerous.

2:10:33.960 --> 2:10:38.860
 And, you know, here it is possible for us to hold two ideas in our head at the same time.

2:10:38.860 --> 2:10:45.760
 January the 6th was not nothing, nor was it an insurrection, an attempt to stage a coup.

2:10:45.760 --> 2:10:50.760
 And there's a vanishing number of people in the U.S.

2:10:50.760 --> 2:10:57.560
 Or as Eric Weinstein said, it's like, this is the roof that you have to walk along.

2:10:57.560 --> 2:11:03.560
 And like the sides are very steep if you fall off either side.

2:11:03.560 --> 2:11:09.560
 Is there some sense, given the forces that are waging war in the West,

2:11:09.560 --> 2:11:16.760
 you said this feeling perhaps because of Antifa or something else that this town is going to burn

2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:22.760
 and maybe a continued feeling that this town is going to burn with the January 6th events.

2:11:22.760 --> 2:11:29.660
 Are you worried about the future of the United States in the coming years

2:11:29.660 --> 2:11:33.660
 because of the feeling of escalation?

2:11:33.660 --> 2:11:41.160
 Is that just a war of Twitter or is there a real brewing of something?

2:11:41.160 --> 2:11:42.460
 Oh, it's real.

2:11:42.460 --> 2:11:45.560
 And how, well, let me then respond to that.

2:11:45.560 --> 2:11:47.560
 How, what is the hopeful?

2:11:47.560 --> 2:11:57.460
 If you 10 years from now look back at the United States and say we turned it around,

2:11:57.460 --> 2:12:01.060
 what would be the reason, what would be the ways, the mechanisms that we do so?

2:12:01.060 --> 2:12:05.960
 Tell you, since I wrote this book, there are two things in particular

2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:12.260
 that I've been really pleased that a specific type of specialist has approached me on

2:12:12.260 --> 2:12:17.160
 to say that things I've written about actually have more application than I realized.

2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:19.760
 One is the gratitude issue.

2:12:19.760 --> 2:12:25.960
 A number of people have approached me who have gone through AA or Alcoholics Anonymous.

2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:27.760
 They sometimes say, have you ever been to AA?

2:12:27.760 --> 2:12:33.960
 And that's a bit personal question.

2:12:33.960 --> 2:12:36.560
 But they say, but the reason they ask it is because they say,

2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:42.860
 well, because if you go to drug rehabilitation or Alcoholics Anonymous,

2:12:42.860 --> 2:12:44.960
 Norm McDonald says, it doesn't sound very anonymous.

2:12:44.960 --> 2:12:48.760
 You stand up in a room, you say your name and you tell everyone the worst things you've ever done.

2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:50.260
 Sounds the opposite of anonymous.

2:12:50.260 --> 2:12:54.460
 Anyhow, but they say, look, because if you go to these things,

2:12:54.460 --> 2:13:00.460
 apparently you're asked to as part of your recovery, say what you're grateful for,

2:13:00.460 --> 2:13:02.060
 like list what you're grateful for.

2:13:02.060 --> 2:13:05.060
 I didn't know that, by the way, until the book was out.

2:13:05.060 --> 2:13:08.260
 And so it turned out to have more application than I knew.

2:13:08.260 --> 2:13:12.060
 The other thing though is that I say that it's absolutely crucial in America

2:13:12.060 --> 2:13:14.360
 that we try to find things that we agree on.

2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:16.460
 And a couple of times since the book came out,

2:13:16.460 --> 2:13:20.260
 I've been approached by people who are marriage counselors.

2:13:20.260 --> 2:13:25.060
 By the way, we've also said, we've been through marriage counseling again, that's a very personal question.

2:13:25.060 --> 2:13:27.660
 Stop asking me personal questions.

2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:30.660
 No, but why?

2:13:30.660 --> 2:13:41.560
 Because this is one of the things that we do in couples therapy is try to find things you agree on.

2:13:41.560 --> 2:13:45.460
 And I think this is very important in America.

2:13:45.460 --> 2:13:48.660
 And it's made much harder by the fact, and I said this many times,

2:13:48.660 --> 2:13:50.460
 but forgive me if I'm repeating myself,

2:13:50.460 --> 2:13:57.460
 but it's made much harder by the fact that having different opinions is very last century.

2:13:57.460 --> 2:14:02.260
 Now we all have different facts, or at least the two sides have different facts.

2:14:02.260 --> 2:14:07.960
 One half of the country, roughly, or let's say 40%, 30%, whatever you want to put it,

2:14:07.960 --> 2:14:11.860
 with a tired minority in the middle.

2:14:11.860 --> 2:14:16.060
 One segment of the country believes that Hillary Clinton won the 2016 election

2:14:16.060 --> 2:14:19.460
 and that the Russians interfered and got Donald Trump into power.

2:14:19.460 --> 2:14:23.060
 Another half of the country believes that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.

2:14:23.060 --> 2:14:27.560
 If you can't agree on who wins elections, it's very hard to see what you agree on as a country.

2:14:27.560 --> 2:14:32.160
 That's one of the reasons I mind the war on American history and Western history is,

2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:36.060
 one of the things you have to agree on is at least some attitude towards your past.

2:14:36.060 --> 2:14:37.660
 You don't have to go on everything.

2:14:37.660 --> 2:14:43.160
 But like, the public square has to have public heroes who are agreed to be heroes to some extent,

2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:48.260
 warts and all. If you don't have that, if actually you think, for instance,

2:14:48.260 --> 2:14:51.960
 like half the country thinks founding fathers were pretty good,

2:14:51.960 --> 2:14:55.660
 the other half thinks they were absolutely rotten racists and so on.

2:14:55.660 --> 2:15:00.260
 If half the country basically thinks it would have been better if Columbus had taken a different turn,

2:15:00.260 --> 2:15:05.060
 never found America, gone back home and said, I don't know, nothing out of there,

2:15:05.060 --> 2:15:06.260
 that would have been better.

2:15:06.260 --> 2:15:13.060
 And the other half's pretty glad in the end that we've got America.

2:15:13.060 --> 2:15:16.460
 You know, you've got to agree on something.

2:15:16.460 --> 2:15:20.460
 And I just see in America, so I do think we've got to try to find things to agree on,

2:15:20.460 --> 2:15:22.960
 like a reasonable attitude towards the past.

2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:24.360
 That's why that matters.

2:15:24.360 --> 2:15:29.360
 And again, I stress, I'm not trying to say that everything in the American past was good.

2:15:29.360 --> 2:15:33.160
 God knows that wouldn't stand up to a second scrutiny or self scrutiny.

2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:34.960
 But nor was it all bad.

2:15:34.960 --> 2:15:40.560
 This wasn't a country formed in sin and in a radical sin.

2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:48.660
 It wasn't founded in 1619 in order to make the country wicked and incapable of escaping that wickedness.

2:15:48.660 --> 2:15:52.660
 You know, these are things that will matter enormously in the years ahead,

2:15:52.660 --> 2:15:59.260
 because if you can't agree on anything, including who your heroes are,

2:15:59.260 --> 2:16:03.960
 like the whole thing is just one massive division and we'll see what I think we're already seeing,

2:16:03.960 --> 2:16:08.960
 which is people basically going to states where it's more like the life they want to live.

2:16:08.960 --> 2:16:11.360
 And some people say to me, well, that's okay.

2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:16.260
 And the genius of the founding is that it allows for that.

2:16:16.260 --> 2:16:22.660
 That's possible, but it's also, it eradicates part of what has been American public life,

2:16:22.660 --> 2:16:26.760
 which is the ability to look at each other and discuss face to face.

2:16:26.760 --> 2:16:31.860
 And I see things like this bomb place under America the other week with the Supreme Court League,

2:16:31.860 --> 2:16:37.060
 the draft league as being just a further example of that.

2:16:37.060 --> 2:16:39.160
 I'm very, very worried about it in America.

2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:45.560
 And because if America screws up everything, everything else in the world goes.

2:16:45.560 --> 2:16:53.760
 Yeah, there's the degree to which America is still the beacon of these ideas on which the country was founded

2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:58.860
 and has been able to live out in better and better forms,

2:16:58.860 --> 2:17:02.860
 sort of live out the actual ideals of the founding principles versus like.

2:17:02.860 --> 2:17:08.160
 And with the desire to improve an imperfect union.

2:17:08.160 --> 2:17:08.660
 Yeah.

2:17:08.660 --> 2:17:14.660
 Well, I generally have hope that people want to sort of, in terms of gratitude,

2:17:14.660 --> 2:17:20.060
 people are aware of how good it feels to be grateful.

2:17:20.060 --> 2:17:22.360
 It's a better life psychologically.

2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:25.760
 The resentment is a thing that destroys you from within.

2:17:25.760 --> 2:17:31.560
 So I just feel that people will long for that and will find that.

2:17:31.560 --> 2:17:33.460
 And that's the America way.

2:17:33.460 --> 2:17:38.760
 Some of the division that we reveal now has to do with new technologies like social media.

2:17:38.760 --> 2:17:46.260
 That kind of is a small kind of deviation from the path we're on because it's a new, we've got a new toy.

2:17:46.260 --> 2:17:47.760
 Just like nuclear weapons.

2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:50.860
 Yeah, which is relatively new.

2:17:50.860 --> 2:17:54.460
 But we need to find reasonable attitudes towards these things.

2:17:54.460 --> 2:17:59.460
 And that's why I say like it matters how you and I feed back on social media

2:17:59.460 --> 2:18:02.160
 because we're all going through it to some extent.

2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:02.760
 We're learning.

2:18:02.760 --> 2:18:03.560
 And we're learning.

2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:07.960
 And we've got to learn how to do this without going mad.

2:18:07.960 --> 2:18:16.660
 I say this as my minimalist call to friends in this era was the main job is not to go insane.

2:18:16.660 --> 2:18:19.260
 Yeah.

2:18:19.260 --> 2:18:20.360
 Yeah.

2:18:20.360 --> 2:18:24.060
 And like walk towards sanity.

2:18:24.060 --> 2:18:30.460
 Cause you know, I'm sure there's a hunter as Thompson quote in there and like the insanity and the weekends can be at least fun.

2:18:30.460 --> 2:18:31.360
 Okay.

2:18:31.360 --> 2:18:41.560
 Do you have advice for young people that just put down their Tik Tok and are listening to this podcast in high school and college

2:18:41.560 --> 2:18:47.260
 about how to have a career or how to have a life that can be part of.

2:18:47.260 --> 2:18:53.360
 So April question, but of course, I mean, I can give specific advice for people who want to be writers and so on.

2:18:53.360 --> 2:18:54.160
 But that's a bit niche.

2:18:54.160 --> 2:18:57.760
 Maybe the writers will be very interesting.

2:18:57.760 --> 2:18:58.760
 Sorry to interrupt.

2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:06.960
 Also how to put your ideas down on paper and ideas, develop them and have the guts to go to a large audience.

2:19:06.960 --> 2:19:10.960
 Especially when the ideas are sort of controversial or dangerous or difficult.

2:19:10.960 --> 2:19:13.360
 Well, the main thing to do is to read.

2:19:13.360 --> 2:19:21.560
 When I was a schoolboy, I've ever have a book in my pocket, the side pocket of my jacket on his side pocket and would read.

2:19:21.560 --> 2:19:31.860
 And that wasn't just because I swatish in some way, but because I discovered probably at some point in my early teens,

2:19:31.860 --> 2:19:34.660
 I discovered something I read about this one.

2:19:34.660 --> 2:19:44.460
 I discovered that books were dangerous, which was a thrilling discovery.

2:19:44.460 --> 2:19:47.860
 I discovered they could contain anything.

2:19:47.860 --> 2:19:50.360
 And also people didn't know what you were reading.

2:19:50.360 --> 2:19:52.660
 I remember I get far too young an age.

2:19:52.660 --> 2:20:01.860
 I read the Doors of Perception of Aldous Huxley and I didn't make head or tail of it probably.

2:20:01.860 --> 2:20:06.660
 But I knew that it was about something really interesting and dangerous.

2:20:06.660 --> 2:20:18.860
 And I thought constantly when I read poetry or read history, I was just constantly thrilled and wanted to know more.

2:20:18.860 --> 2:20:26.360
 And if you want to become a writer, you have to be a reader.

2:20:26.360 --> 2:20:29.660
 You have to read the best stuff.

2:20:29.660 --> 2:20:37.560
 And obviously people disagree or agree on what that is and you'll find the people that really impress you.

2:20:37.560 --> 2:20:44.460
 But I know that I just came across certain writers who just knocked me off my feet.

2:20:44.460 --> 2:20:53.560
 And when you find those people, read everything and cling on to them and find other people like that.

2:20:53.560 --> 2:21:01.660
 Find other writers like that where people are connected by history or scholarship or circles or whatever.

2:21:01.660 --> 2:21:03.960
 For you, was it fiction or nonfiction?

2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:07.960
 Is there a particular books that you just remember or just give you pause?

2:21:07.960 --> 2:21:13.960
 Well, I remember that the first book that absolutely threw me was The Lord of the Flies by William Golden,

2:21:13.960 --> 2:21:19.760
 which used to be a signed text and everyone's a bit snotty about because it's so popular.

2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:27.660
 But I was thrown because I think it was the first adult book I read in that I had been used to the world of children's literature,

2:21:27.660 --> 2:21:34.160
 of everything ends up fine in the end, the lost all get found, you know.

2:21:34.160 --> 2:21:39.360
 And this was the first book I read where that's not the case, where the world turns out differently.

2:21:39.360 --> 2:21:45.860
 And I remember for days afterwards, I was just in a state of shock.

2:21:45.860 --> 2:21:51.160
 I couldn't believe what I'd just discovered.

2:21:51.160 --> 2:21:55.160
 And partly because I sort of intuited it must be true.

2:21:55.160 --> 2:22:00.860
 And of course, that is not to say that The Lord of the Flies, there's lots of scholarship on what children do in this situation

2:22:00.860 --> 2:22:04.360
 of being on the island or when they do congregate.

2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:06.860
 But yes, that was a sort of introduction to the adult world.

2:22:06.860 --> 2:22:14.360
 And it was shocking and thrilling and I wanted more of it.

2:22:14.360 --> 2:22:15.360
 It was dangerous.

2:22:15.360 --> 2:22:16.360
 And it was dangerous.

2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:21.360
 And then, of course, when I became interested in sex, the moment I realized I was gay,

2:22:21.360 --> 2:22:25.360
 I realized books were a very, very good way to learn about what I was.

2:22:25.360 --> 2:22:28.360
 And that was even more dangerous in a way.

2:22:28.360 --> 2:22:33.360
 And I thought, I mean, nobody knows what I know.

2:22:33.360 --> 2:22:37.360
 You discovered sex, that was an invention in books.

2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:45.360
 No, what I mean is that one of the things that gay people have when they're growing up is that you have this terribly big secret

2:22:45.360 --> 2:22:47.360
 and you don't think the world will ever know.

2:22:47.360 --> 2:22:49.360
 You hope the world will never know.

2:22:49.360 --> 2:22:56.360
 And it's been called by one psychologist, the little boy with a big secret.

2:22:56.360 --> 2:23:05.360
 And so if you discover that other people have the same secret, there's a sort of, thank God for that.

2:23:05.360 --> 2:23:09.360
 But I mean, that's just a version of what everybody gets in reading in a way,

2:23:09.360 --> 2:23:15.360
 which is the thrill of discovery that somebody else thought something you thought only you'd thought.

2:23:15.360 --> 2:23:21.360
 I mean, one of the greatest thrill in all of literature is when a voice comes across the centuries

2:23:21.360 --> 2:23:24.360
 and seems to leave a handprint, you know.

2:23:24.360 --> 2:23:30.360
 It makes you feel a little bit less alone because somebody else feels he's the world the same way, is the same way.

2:23:30.360 --> 2:23:34.360
 That's what C.S. Lewis said to have said.

2:23:34.360 --> 2:23:37.360
 We read to know we're not alone.

2:23:37.360 --> 2:23:42.360
 But we don't only read to know we're not alone, we read to become other people.

2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:47.360
 I mean, I think I saw in books the version of the life I wanted to live and then I decided to live it.

2:23:47.360 --> 2:23:52.360
 And I'm fortunate enough to have done so.

2:23:52.360 --> 2:24:01.360
 I wanted to live in the world of ideas and books and debate and I wanted to live in the debates of my time, you know.

2:24:01.360 --> 2:24:09.360
 And I remember when, like a lot of people, I read Ordon when I was young and, you know, certain lines obviously stuck with me.

2:24:09.360 --> 2:24:17.360
 But that poem of his which everybody, you know, knows and which he hated, September 1st, 1939.

2:24:17.360 --> 2:24:22.360
 I remember certain lines in that just like whacked me.

2:24:22.360 --> 2:24:31.360
 I was sitting on a dive for a second to be degraded and alone at the end of a low dishonest decade.

2:24:31.360 --> 2:24:36.360
 Of course, there's a problem with that line, which is you kind of want to be living at the end of a low dishonest decade as well.

2:24:36.360 --> 2:24:38.360
 It sounds sort of cool in a way.

2:24:38.360 --> 2:24:41.360
 You know, you're the only person who sees it.

2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:43.360
 So yeah, anyhow, that's the diversion.

2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:47.360
 But the point is, if you want to be a writer, you've got to be a reader.

2:24:47.360 --> 2:24:53.360
 And apart from anything else, you discover the lilt of language and the things you can do.

2:24:53.360 --> 2:24:58.360
 And I've read people who, and I still do, who I think, my God, I didn't know.

2:24:58.360 --> 2:25:00.360
 How did you do that?

2:25:00.360 --> 2:25:04.360
 In fact, books for me now and articles and other things fall into two categories.

2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:06.360
 One is, I know how you did that.

2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:10.360
 And the other is, I don't know how you did that.

2:25:10.360 --> 2:25:16.360
 And the best feeling as a writer is when you do the second one.

2:25:16.360 --> 2:25:19.360
 And it happens occasionally in my writing life.

2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:22.360
 Were you almost like returned to something you've written or like right after you?

2:25:22.360 --> 2:25:23.360
 No, the moment you write it.

2:25:23.360 --> 2:25:25.360
 You wonder, how did I do that?

2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:26.360
 Yes.

2:25:26.360 --> 2:25:29.360
 That's the most, I've never said that before.

2:25:29.360 --> 2:25:31.360
 That's the happiest thing in writing.

2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:32.360
 Yeah.

2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:37.360
 Very occasionally, this sounds, but I mean, I've occasionally finished something.

2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:44.360
 Funny enough, it happened some years ago in a long piece I wrote about the artist Basquiat.

2:25:44.360 --> 2:25:47.360
 I finished the piece and I gasped.

2:25:47.360 --> 2:25:49.360
 I didn't know.

2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:55.360
 Because that's also a thing with writing is you, you, you, it's not, sometimes people say you need to write

2:25:55.360 --> 2:25:56.360
 in order to know what you think.

2:25:56.360 --> 2:25:58.360
 That's not quite true.

2:25:58.360 --> 2:26:03.360
 Sometimes you, that's a very bad piece of advice for some writers who don't know what they think.

2:26:03.360 --> 2:26:09.360
 And it's not going to become clearer if they just start typing.

2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:17.360
 Sometimes it is true that you, there's a thought that's just waiting there and a clarity that comes across

2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:20.360
 and suddenly the sentence emerges in your brain.

2:26:20.360 --> 2:26:25.360
 And by the time you've typed it, you, you just go, yes.

2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:27.360
 That's the greatest feeling of the writing.

2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:29.360
 Almost like it came from somewhere else.

2:26:29.360 --> 2:26:36.360
 That's what a Bakunin says about, you know, what's the moment is Tom Stoppard's favorite quote about,

2:26:36.360 --> 2:26:41.360
 you know, Bakunin saying what happened to the moment where the writer's pen when he pauses,

2:26:41.360 --> 2:26:44.360
 where does he go in that moment?

2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:46.360
 Yeah.

2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:48.360
 That's so interesting.

2:26:48.360 --> 2:26:54.360
 That's, that's all, because I think the answer to that question will help us explain consciousness

2:26:54.360 --> 2:26:57.360
 and all those other weird things about the human mind.

2:26:57.360 --> 2:26:59.360
 Yeah. So that was advice for writers.

2:26:59.360 --> 2:27:02.360
 I didn't really give any advice to people in general, but

2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:05.360
 Is that, oh, you want to give health advice?

2:27:05.360 --> 2:27:06.360
 No.

2:27:06.360 --> 2:27:07.360
 To channel a Churchill and

2:27:07.360 --> 2:27:09.360
 No, I don't give health advice.

2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:15.360
 Clearly, because you imply that Churchill was one of your early guides in that aspect.

2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:21.360
 So when you discovered your sexuality, let me ask about love.

2:27:21.360 --> 2:27:28.360
 Of course, far too personal of a question to ask a Brit, but what was that like?

2:27:28.360 --> 2:27:35.360
 And broadly speaking, what's the role of love in the human condition?

2:27:35.360 --> 2:27:37.360
 Sex and love.

2:27:37.360 --> 2:27:45.360
 And for you personally, discovering that you were and maybe telling the world that you were gay.

2:27:45.360 --> 2:27:51.360
 Very perilously personal. I do actually have a sort of rule that I don't talk about my personal life.

2:27:51.360 --> 2:27:53.360
 Rules are meant to be broken.

2:27:53.360 --> 2:27:55.360
 Okay. I'll break it a little bit.

2:27:55.360 --> 2:28:10.360
 The, the, one of the ways in which growing up and rising your gay differs from growing up and being straight is that it's almost inevitable that your first passions will be unrequited.

2:28:10.360 --> 2:28:13.360
 Oh, wow. I never thought about that. Yeah.

2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:19.360
 Now that's not to say, I mean, you know, there's plenty of unrequited love among young men for young women, young women for young men.

2:28:19.360 --> 2:28:33.360
 There's plenty of, you know, that, but it's almost inevitable if you're gay that your first, you know, passions will be totally unrequited because the odds are that the personal question will not be gay.

2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:37.360
 So the experience of love is mostly heartbreak.

2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:39.360
 Is heartbreak and disappointment.

2:28:39.360 --> 2:28:41.360
 That heartbreak can be beautiful too.

2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:48.360
 Of course. Well, again, it comes back to the thing of if you're a writer or something because you can always do something with it.

2:28:48.360 --> 2:28:52.360
 That's why all writers are sort of not to be trusted.

2:28:52.360 --> 2:28:59.360
 I didn't trust you the moment you walked in here.

2:28:59.360 --> 2:29:05.360
 No, I mean, it's a famous problem with writers because you always think, well, I could use that.

2:29:05.360 --> 2:29:08.360
 It's dangerous. It's a dangerous thing and all writers should be aware of it.

2:29:08.360 --> 2:29:10.360
 It's almost like a drug, right?

2:29:10.360 --> 2:29:12.360
 No, it's not like a drug.

2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:19.360
 It's the fear that all things, even the greatest suffering, it could be material.

2:29:19.360 --> 2:29:22.360
 What's the danger in that exactly?

2:29:22.360 --> 2:29:27.360
 That seeing the material in the human experience, you don't experience it fully?

2:29:27.360 --> 2:29:30.360
 You don't experience it fully and you might be using it.

2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:36.360
 I had a friend who wrote a poem about a friend who died in a motorcycle accident in Sydney in the 60s.

2:29:36.360 --> 2:29:41.360
 And he said he knew the moment he was told that his friend was dead, a tiny bit of him thought I could use this for a poem.

2:29:41.360 --> 2:29:47.360
 And he did and the poem was wonderful, but there's always a slight guilt for writers of, am I going to use that?

2:29:47.360 --> 2:29:49.360
 Anyhow, that's a diversion.

2:29:49.360 --> 2:29:57.360
 Life is full of guilty pleasures and I think that's one of them because if you feel that guilt, really, what you're doing is you're capturing that moment

2:29:57.360 --> 2:30:02.360
 and you're going to impact the lives of many, many people by writing about that moment

2:30:02.360 --> 2:30:07.360
 because it's going to stimulate something that resonates with those people because they had similar kinds of memories

2:30:07.360 --> 2:30:11.360
 about a loss and a passion towards somebody that they had to lose.

2:30:11.360 --> 2:30:14.360
 Yes, but there is a good sign.

2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:24.360
 More obvious perhaps problem is reporting from war zones or bad places and wanting to find bad stories because it's useful.

2:30:24.360 --> 2:30:30.360
 There is a definite guilt you get from that sort of thing, like the worse the situation, the more useful.

2:30:30.360 --> 2:30:36.360
 Anyhow, no, so that's sort of the only difference that happens from growing up in gay.

2:30:36.360 --> 2:30:45.360
 And it means that most, certainly in my generation, most gay men came to sexual or romantic maturity later.

2:30:45.360 --> 2:30:54.360
 And there's lots of explanations of that maybe being one of the reasons for perceived or otherwise promiscuity among gay men,

2:30:54.360 --> 2:31:03.360
 which is, I think, more easily persuaded by the fact that gay men behaved like men would if women were men.

2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:05.360
 That's one explanation.

2:31:05.360 --> 2:31:12.360
 But it's both a feature and a bug that you come to sexual flourishing later in life.

2:31:12.360 --> 2:31:18.360
 That could be seen as a, in the trajectory of human life, that could be a positive or a negative.

2:31:18.360 --> 2:31:25.360
 But what's broadly speaking is the role of love in the human condition, Douglas?

2:31:25.360 --> 2:31:29.360
 Well, it's the nearest thing we have to finding the point.

2:31:29.360 --> 2:31:33.360
 What is the point? What's the meaning of life? Let's go there.

2:31:33.360 --> 2:31:39.360
 So what's the meaning? It's a hard one, of course. Where is the meaning? It's slightly easier.

2:31:39.360 --> 2:31:46.360
 And I'd say that everyone can find that. You gravitate towards the places you find meaning.

2:31:46.360 --> 2:31:51.360
 Now, there's a conservative answer to this, which is quite useful, and it's certainly more useful than any others,

2:31:51.360 --> 2:31:58.360
 because the conservative answer is find meaning where people have found it before, which is a very, very good answer.

2:31:58.360 --> 2:32:05.360
 If your ancestors have found meaning in a place of worship or a particular canon of work,

2:32:05.360 --> 2:32:16.360
 or go there because it's been proven by time to be able to give you the goods.

2:32:16.360 --> 2:32:24.360
 Much more sensible than saying, hey, I don't know, discover new ways of meaning.

2:32:24.360 --> 2:32:36.360
 But love is probably the nearest thing we can have to the divine on Earth.

2:32:36.360 --> 2:32:43.360
 And of course, the problem of what type of love we mean is an issue.

2:32:43.360 --> 2:32:47.360
 Well, that goes to the fact that you don't like definitions anyway.

2:32:47.360 --> 2:32:57.360
 I do like definitions. I just think they need to be pinned down, but let's not go there at the moment because it's...

2:32:57.360 --> 2:32:59.360
 Doesn't that pin down love at the moment?

2:32:59.360 --> 2:33:03.360
 Well, no, because as you know, I mean, because of the different varieties of love

2:33:03.360 --> 2:33:09.360
 and the fact that we have one word for it in our culture and that it means an awful lot of things and we don't delineate it well.

2:33:09.360 --> 2:33:21.360
 But let's say human love with the greatest fulfillment in sexual... fulfillment in sexual love with another person

2:33:21.360 --> 2:33:33.360
 is probably the greatest intimation you can have of what might otherwise only be superseded by divine love.

2:33:33.360 --> 2:33:46.360
 And it's the sense that all young lovers have, which is that they've just walked through the low door in the garden and found themselves in bliss.

2:33:46.360 --> 2:33:56.360
 And that this is... there's a beautiful, beautiful poem of... can I read it to you?

2:33:56.360 --> 2:33:57.360
 Yes, please.

2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:10.360
 I'll try to find it. There's a beautiful poem of Philip Larkin, which slightly says what I'm trying not to duck your question by referring to other people.

2:34:10.360 --> 2:34:16.360
 Maybe that's the best way to answer the question, is to read a poem.

2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:30.360
 So there's a poem by Philip Larkin called High Windows, which is remarkable because he came to sexual...

2:34:30.360 --> 2:34:40.360
 He was straight, he had a rather unhappy sex life, but he came to sexual fruition in the 40s and 50s and all the hell that involved.

2:34:40.360 --> 2:34:50.360
 And he took what I regard as being a really remarkable and important view on the sexual revolution in the 60s,

2:34:50.360 --> 2:34:54.360
 which is that most people of his generation, most older people, resented the young.

2:34:54.360 --> 2:35:01.360
 They resented the freedom they had, and actually they pretended the freedom was terrible, and it was always getting likely to...

2:35:01.360 --> 2:35:05.360
 And Philip Larkin, rather surprisingly, he was a very conservative person, took a different view.

2:35:05.360 --> 2:35:10.360
 And he says it in his poem, and the opening of the poem is, he says,

2:35:10.360 --> 2:35:16.360
 When I see a couple of kids, and guess he's fucking her, and she's taking pills or wearing a diaphragm.

2:35:16.360 --> 2:35:21.360
 I know this is paradise. Everyone old has dreamed of all their lives.

2:35:21.360 --> 2:35:27.360
 Bonds and gestures pushed to one side like an outdated combine harvester,

2:35:27.360 --> 2:35:33.360
 and everyone young going down the long slide to happiness endlessly.

2:35:33.360 --> 2:35:38.360
 I wonder if anyone looked at me 40 years back and thought,

2:35:38.360 --> 2:35:43.360
 that will be the life, no God anymore, or sweating in the dark about hell and that,

2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:46.360
 or having to hide what you think of the priest.

2:35:46.360 --> 2:35:51.360
 He and his lot will all go down the long slide like free, bloody birds.

2:35:51.360 --> 2:35:58.360
 And immediately, rather than words, comes the thought of high windows,

2:35:58.360 --> 2:36:03.360
 the sun comprehending glass, and beyond it the deep blue air,

2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:09.360
 that shows nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless.

2:36:09.360 --> 2:36:12.360
 The divine, he found it.

2:36:12.360 --> 2:36:16.360
 He found it in seeing a couple of young kids,

2:36:16.360 --> 2:36:20.360
 and knowing that one of them was wearing a diaphragm.

2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:22.360
 First of all, it's very counterintuitive.

2:36:22.360 --> 2:36:28.360
 But secondly, this is the point that sex had been so tied up with misery.

2:36:28.360 --> 2:36:32.360
 I mean, people don't remember this now when they talk about the past.

2:36:32.360 --> 2:36:36.360
 I mean, one of my favorite books, Stefan Zweig's The World of Yesterday,

2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:41.360
 descriptions of what it was like trying to have sex in pre First World War Vienna.

2:36:41.360 --> 2:36:45.360
 All the men ended up going to female prostitutes.

2:36:45.360 --> 2:36:47.360
 So many of them got syphilis.

2:36:47.360 --> 2:36:49.360
 And this was their first experience of sex.

2:36:49.360 --> 2:36:53.360
 It was so goddamn awful, and they were stuck with it all their lives.

2:36:53.360 --> 2:36:57.360
 And there's lots of stuff that's gone better in our ascension.

2:36:57.360 --> 2:36:59.360
 That's one of them.

2:36:59.360 --> 2:37:00.360
 But you ask about love.

2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:07.360
 Yes, I do think that love is basically the thing that gives us the best glimpse of the divine.

2:37:07.360 --> 2:37:15.360
 And by the way, liberating sex doesn't buy you love.

2:37:15.360 --> 2:37:16.360
 No.

2:37:16.360 --> 2:37:24.360
 I mean, it throws in an entirely, it threw in another set of problems.

2:37:24.360 --> 2:37:32.360
 If there's any meaning on top of all of that is we like to find problems and solve that as a human species.

2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:37.360
 And sometimes we even create problems.

2:37:37.360 --> 2:37:41.360
 Douglas, thank you for highlighting all the problems of human civilization

2:37:41.360 --> 2:37:44.360
 and giving us a glimmer of hope for the future.

2:37:44.360 --> 2:37:46.360
 This is an incredible conversation.

2:37:46.360 --> 2:37:47.360
 Thank you for talking today.

2:37:47.360 --> 2:37:48.360
 It's a huge honor.

2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:49.360
 Thank you.

2:37:49.360 --> 2:37:50.360
 It's very kind of you to say that.

2:37:50.360 --> 2:37:51.360
 Thank you.

2:37:51.360 --> 2:37:54.360
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Douglas Murray.

2:37:54.360 --> 2:37:58.360
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:37:58.360 --> 2:38:02.360
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Douglas Murray himself.

2:38:02.360 --> 2:38:05.360
 Disagreement is not oppression.

2:38:05.360 --> 2:38:08.360
 Argument is not assault.

2:38:08.360 --> 2:38:13.360
 Words, even provocative and repugnant ones, are not violence.

2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:18.360
 The answer to speech we do not like is more speech.

2:38:18.360 --> 2:38:19.360
 Thank you for listening.

2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:44.360
 I hope to see you next time.
