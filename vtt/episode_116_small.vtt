00:00.000 --> 00:06.240
 The following is a conversation with Sarah Seeger, a planetary scientist at MIT known

00:06.240 --> 00:11.200
 for her work on the search for exoplanets, which are planets outside of her solar system.

00:11.840 --> 00:18.240
 She's an author of two books on this fascinating topic. Plus, in a couple days, August 18th,

00:18.240 --> 00:23.600
 her new book, A Memoir, called The Smallest Lights in the Universe, is coming out.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.520
 I read it and I can recommend it highly, especially if you love space

00:27.520 --> 00:32.160
 and are a bit of a romantic like me. It's beautifully written.

00:32.160 --> 00:36.000
 She weaves the stories of the tragedies and the triumphs of her life

00:36.000 --> 00:40.480
 with the stories of her love for and research on exoplanets,

00:40.480 --> 00:44.480
 which represent our hope to find life out there in the universe.

00:58.640 --> 01:04.960
 As a quick side note, let me say that extraterrestrial life, aliens, I think represent

01:04.960 --> 01:10.400
 our civilization longing to make contact with the unknown. With others like us,

01:10.400 --> 01:16.080
 or maybe others that are very different from us, entities that might reveal something profound

01:16.080 --> 01:22.880
 about why we're here. The possibility of this is both exciting and, at least to me,

01:22.880 --> 01:26.880
 terrifying, which is exactly where we humans do our best work.

 As usual, I'll do a few minutes of as now and never any ads in the middle that could

01:40.960 --> 01:45.680
 break the flow of the conversation. I try to make these ad reads interesting if you do listen,

01:45.680 --> 01:50.560

02:01.360 --> 02:06.000
 the one stop shop for affordable, sustainable, healthy household products.

02:06.560 --> 02:10.560
 Their products have a minimalist black and white design that I find to be just

02:10.560 --> 02:15.520
 clean, elegant, and beautiful. It's a style that makes me feel like I'm living in the future.

02:15.520 --> 02:20.480
 I imagine we'll all be using Public Goods products once we colonize Mars.

02:21.200 --> 02:26.000
 They got all the basics you need from healthy snacks like almonds to my favorite,

02:26.560 --> 02:32.720
 the bamboo toothbrush, and other stuff for personal care, home essentials, healthy food,

02:32.720 --> 02:37.680
 and vitamins and supplements. I take their fish oil, for example, which I recommend highly for

02:37.680 --> 02:43.920
 everyone. They use a membership model to keep costs low and pass on the savings to us, the people.

02:43.920 --> 02:50.000

 It's an eStim electrical stimulation device that I've been using a lot for muscle recovery,

03:14.960 --> 03:20.160
 mostly for my shoulders and legs as I've been doing the crazy amounts of body weight reps

03:20.160 --> 03:25.120
 and six miles every other day now after the challenge. Yes, I'm still doing it.

03:25.760 --> 03:30.480
 They call it the smart muscle stimulator since the app that goes with it is amazing.

03:31.200 --> 03:35.040
 It has 15 programs with different body parts and guides you through everything you need to do.

03:35.040 --> 03:40.880
 I take recovery really seriously these days and PowerDot has been a powerful addition to stretching,

03:40.880 --> 03:48.480
 ice, massage, and sleep and diet. It's used by professional athletes and by slightly insane

03:48.480 --> 03:53.680
 but mostly normal people like me. It's portable so you can throw it in a bag and bring it anywhere.

 Okay, back to the read. When you get it, use code Lex podcast. Cash App lets you send money to friends,

04:32.480 --> 04:38.480
 buy Bitcoin, invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App allows you to buy

04:38.480 --> 04:43.840
 Bitcoin, let me mention that cryptocurrency and the context of the history of money is fascinating.

04:43.840 --> 04:49.040
 I recommend The Sent of Money as a great book on this history. Debits and credits on ledgers

04:49.040 --> 04:56.720
 started around 30,000 years ago. Time flies. The US dollar created over 200 years ago and

04:56.720 --> 05:01.920
 the first decentralized cryptocurrency released just over 10 years ago. So given that history,

05:01.920 --> 05:07.360
 cryptocurrency is still very much in its early days of development, but it's still aiming to

05:07.360 --> 05:13.360
 and just might redefine the nature of money. So again, if you get Cash App from the app store

05:13.360 --> 05:21.120

 an organization that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the

05:26.080 --> 05:33.760
 world. And now here's my conversation with Sarah Seeger. When did you first fall in love with

05:33.760 --> 05:40.000
 the stars? I think I've always loved the stars. One of my first memory is of the moon. I remember

05:40.000 --> 05:44.640
 watching the moon and I was in the car with my dad who my parents were divorced and he was driving

05:44.640 --> 05:49.440
 me and my siblings to his house for the weekend. And the moon was just following me. Just had no

05:49.440 --> 05:54.800
 idea why that was. Yeah. So like looking up at the sky and there's this glowing thing. How do

05:54.800 --> 06:00.080
 you make sense of the moon at that age? At age, like age five, there's just no way you can. I think

06:00.080 --> 06:04.080
 it's one of the great things about being a kid. It's just that curiosity that all kids have.

06:04.080 --> 06:11.520
 You know, I was thinking because there's these almost out there ideas of that our earth is flat

06:12.080 --> 06:17.600
 floating about on the internet. And it made me think, you know, when did I first realize that

06:18.160 --> 06:28.480
 the earth is like this ball that's flying through empty space? I mean, it's terrifying. It's awe

06:28.480 --> 06:33.120
 inspiring. I don't know how to make sense of it. It's hard because we live in our frame of reference

06:33.120 --> 06:37.680
 here on this planet. Yeah. It's nearly impossible. None of us are lucky to go to see the curvature

06:37.680 --> 06:43.360
 of earth. I mean, do you remember when you realized understood like the physics, like the layout of

06:43.360 --> 06:50.400
 the solar system? Was it like, did you first have to take physics to really like high school

06:50.400 --> 06:55.280
 physics to really take that in? I think it's hard to say. I had this book when I was a child. It was

06:55.280 --> 07:00.480
 in French. I grew up in Canada where French is supposedly taught to all of us English speaking

07:00.480 --> 07:04.480
 Canadians. And it was this French book in French was about the solar system. And I just love

07:04.480 --> 07:09.440
 flipping through it. It's hard to say how much, you know, you or I understand when we're kids,

07:09.440 --> 07:14.240
 but it was really great book. What about the stars? When did you first learn about the stars?

07:14.240 --> 07:18.480
 I have like, I do have this very incredible distinctive memory. And again, it had to do with

07:18.480 --> 07:24.800
 my dad. He took us camping. Now, my dad was from the UK. And he was the type who you'd find wearing

07:24.800 --> 07:30.080
 a tie on weekends. So camping was not in his fear. It's his comfort zone. We had a babysitter every

07:30.080 --> 07:34.640
 summer we got a baby. We every summer we had a babysitter. And one summer we had Tom. He was

07:34.640 --> 07:39.440
 barely older than than we were. He was 14. My brother was 12. I would have been 11 or 10 maybe.

07:40.080 --> 07:44.160
 And we went camping because Tom said camping is the thing we should we should try it. And I just

07:44.160 --> 07:48.720
 remember I didn't aim to see the stars, but I walked out of my tent in the middle of the night.

07:49.440 --> 07:58.000
 And I looked up and wow, so many stars. The dark night sky and all those stars just like screaming

07:58.000 --> 08:03.280
 at me. I just couldn't believe that. Honestly, like my first thought was this is so incredible,

08:03.280 --> 08:06.320
 mind blowing. Like why wouldn't anyone have told me this existed?

08:06.960 --> 08:11.920
 Can anyone else see this? Have you had an experience like that with anything?

08:12.960 --> 08:17.040
 Yeah, I've had that. I mean, I don't know if maybe you can tell me if it's the same.

08:17.760 --> 08:22.480
 I've had that with robots. There's a few robots I've met where I just fell in love with this.

08:22.480 --> 08:31.680
 Like, is anyone else seeing this? Is anyone else seeing that here in a robot is our ability to

08:31.680 --> 08:38.800
 engineer some intelligent beings, intelligent beings that we could love, that could love us,

08:38.800 --> 08:44.720
 that we can interact with in some rich ways that we haven't yet discovered? Like almost like when

08:44.720 --> 08:53.120
 you get a puppy, you need to have a dog and there's this immediate bond and love. And on top of that,

08:53.120 --> 08:59.840
 ability to engineer it, I had to just pause and hold myself. I imagine, I don't have kids,

08:59.840 --> 09:05.120
 I imagine there's a magic to that as well, where it's a totally new experience. It's like, what?

09:06.720 --> 09:10.400
 Well, yeah, the stars though, unlike kids or the puppy, it's only a good thing.

09:10.400 --> 09:17.840
 So you felt, you weren't terrified? Like, just to me, when I look at the stars,

09:18.720 --> 09:26.320
 it's almost paralyzingly scary how little we know about the universe, how alone we are. I mean,

09:26.320 --> 09:31.520
 somehow it feels alone. I'm not sure if it's a, it's just a matter of perspective, but it feels

09:31.520 --> 09:40.000
 like, wow, there's billions of them out there. And we know nothing about them. And then also

09:40.000 --> 09:45.040
 immediately to me, some immortality comes into it. I mean, how did that make you feel at that time?

09:45.040 --> 09:50.240
 I think as a child without articulating it, I felt that same way. Just like, wow, this is terrifying.

09:50.240 --> 09:53.840
 What's out there? Like, what is this? What does it mean about us here?

09:54.800 --> 10:02.240
 You're a scientist, an exo world class scientist, planetary scientist, astronomer. Now,

10:02.880 --> 10:08.320
 I'm a bit of an idiot who likes to ask silly questions. So some questions are a little bit

10:08.320 --> 10:14.960
 in the realm of speculation, almost philosophical, because we know so little. And one of the awesome

10:14.960 --> 10:19.520
 things about your work is you've actually put data and real science behind some of the biggest

10:19.520 --> 10:23.600
 questions that we're all curious about. But nevertheless, many of the questions might be a

10:23.600 --> 10:32.080
 little bit speculative. So on that topic, just in your sense, do you think we're alone in the

10:32.080 --> 10:35.760
 universe, human beings? Do you think there's life out there?

10:35.760 --> 10:40.480
 Sure. Well, Lex, the funny thing is, is that as a scientist, I so don't even want to answer that.

10:41.520 --> 10:45.920
 I will answer it, though. But I just love to say, yeah, we naturally resist that,

10:45.920 --> 10:50.960
 because we want numbers and hard facts and not speculation. But I do love that question.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.720
 It's a great question. And it's one we all wonder about. But I have to give you the

10:54.720 --> 10:59.200
 scientist answer first, which is, we'll have the capability to answer that question

11:00.160 --> 11:03.600
 soon, even starting soon. How do you define soon?

11:03.600 --> 11:06.640
 How do I define soon? What do you so much happened in the last 100 years?

11:07.680 --> 11:12.000
 Right, right. And there's a difference, right? If it's 10 years or 20 years or 100 years. Yeah,

11:12.000 --> 11:16.880
 there's a difference in that. Well, soon could be a decade or two decades.

11:17.760 --> 11:22.880
 And the journalists usually don't like that, or the people want like tomorrow, they want the news.

11:22.880 --> 11:28.720
 But what it's going to take is telescopes, space telescopes, or very sophisticated ground or

11:28.720 --> 11:35.120
 space telescopes, to let us study the atmospheres of other planets far away and to look what's

11:35.120 --> 11:38.400
 in the atmospheres and to look for water, which is needed for life as we know it,

11:38.400 --> 11:41.280
 to look for gases that don't belong, that we might attribute to life.

11:41.840 --> 11:45.440
 So we have to do some really nitty gritty astronomy.

11:45.440 --> 11:51.200
 So the promising way to answer this question scientifically is to look for hints of life.

11:51.200 --> 11:56.400
 That's where like many of your ideas come in, of what kind of hints might we actually see

11:56.400 --> 12:00.480
 about this life. Right, right. That's exactly what we need to do. And I like the word you chose,

12:00.480 --> 12:04.720
 hint, because it's going to be a hint. It's not going to be a 100%. Yay, we found it.

12:05.360 --> 12:12.320
 And then it will take future generations to do more careful work, to hopefully even find a way

12:12.320 --> 12:17.760
 to send a probe to these distant exoplanets and to really figure this out for us.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.160
 I mean, we'll talk about the details. Those are fun, but like,

12:20.160 --> 12:25.680
 the back to the speculation. The zoomed out big picture. The zoomed out big picture is, yes,

12:25.680 --> 12:32.560
 I believe absolutely there is life out there somewhere because the vastness of the universe

12:32.560 --> 12:38.080
 is incredible. It's so breathtaking. When we look at the night sky, if you can go to that dark sky,

12:38.080 --> 12:42.560
 you can see, you know, many, many hundred or even if you have good eyesight and you're somewhere

12:42.560 --> 12:48.480
 very dark, you could see thousands of stars. But in our galaxy, we have hundreds of billions of

12:48.480 --> 12:55.280
 stars. And our universe has hundreds of billions of galaxies. So think about all those stars out

12:55.280 --> 13:02.560
 there. And even if planets are rare, even if life is rare, just because the number of stars is so

13:02.560 --> 13:06.880
 huge, things have to come together somewhere someplace in our universe.

13:06.880 --> 13:13.600
 Yeah, it's so amazing to think that somebody might be looking up on another planet in a distant

13:13.600 --> 13:20.080
 galaxy. After you interrupt your reverie and get back to, in our lifetime at least, the short term,

13:20.640 --> 13:26.560
 we have to, we only have the nearest stars to look at. It's true that there are so many stars,

13:27.120 --> 13:32.880
 so many hosts for planets that might have life. But in the practical question of will we find it,

13:33.440 --> 13:38.640
 it has to be a star quite close to Earth, like a few light years, tens of light years, maybe

13:38.640 --> 13:44.480
 hundreds of light years. And by the way, you've introduced me to a tool of eyes on exoplanets,

13:44.480 --> 13:50.160
 I think, that NASA has put together. Eyes on exoplanets, so great software, you can download.

13:50.160 --> 13:57.040
 It's so cool. But anyway, can you give a sense of who our neighbors are? You said

13:58.160 --> 14:05.520
 hundreds of light years, like how many stars are close by? What's our neighborhood like?

14:05.520 --> 14:11.600
 We're talking about five, 10 stars that we might actually have a chance to zoom in on.

14:12.480 --> 14:18.880
 I'm talking about maybe a dozen or two dozen stars. And those that's with planets that look

14:20.240 --> 14:26.480
 suitable for us to follow up in detail. For life. Right. But one thing that's really exciting in

14:26.480 --> 14:32.720
 this field is that the very nearest star to Earth called Proxima Centauri. It's part of the Alpha

14:32.720 --> 14:36.720
 Centauri star system. Cool name, by the way. Yeah, Proxima. Whoever names them. Nearby.

14:37.360 --> 14:44.000
 Okay, but it sounds cool. But Proxima Centauri appears to have a planet around it. That's

14:44.000 --> 14:49.520
 an earth, about an earth mass planet in the so called habitable zone or the Goldilocks zone

14:49.520 --> 14:54.240
 of the host star. So think about how incredible that is, like out of all the stars out there,

14:54.240 --> 14:58.480
 even the very nearest star has planets and has a planet of huge interest to us.

14:58.480 --> 15:08.640
 Yeah. Okay. So can we talk about that planet? What does it mean to be maybe possibly habitable?

15:12.080 --> 15:20.720
 What is how does size come into play? How does what we know about gases and what kind of things

15:20.720 --> 15:26.960
 are necessary for life? What are the factors that you make you think that it's habitable? And by the

15:26.960 --> 15:33.200
 way, I mean, maybe one way to talk about that is people know about the Drake equation, which is

15:34.720 --> 15:40.320
 a very high level, almost framework to think about what is the probability that,

15:40.320 --> 15:46.880
 correct me if I'm wrong, that there's life out there and intelligent life, I think. I don't know.

15:46.880 --> 15:54.400
 But then you have an equation named after you now, which I think nicely focuses in on the more

15:54.400 --> 16:01.920
 achievable and interesting part of that question, which is on whether there is habitable planets

16:01.920 --> 16:06.800
 out there or how many, I guess, habitable planets out there. So the funny thing is, was one time

16:06.800 --> 16:13.840
 I met Frank Drake and I asked if he minded if I took his equation and kind of revamped it for

16:13.840 --> 16:20.080
 this new field of exoplanet astronomy. He was totally cool with it. He's got total approval.

16:20.080 --> 16:24.880
 Well, maybe, okay, so sorry. I'm not sure if you'd actually read the stuff about my equation,

16:24.880 --> 16:30.080
 but he was cool with it. He was cool with it. Okay, so I just said like 15 different things,

16:30.080 --> 16:36.160
 but maybe can you tell from your perspective what is the Drake equation and what is sorry,

16:36.160 --> 16:40.400
 the Seeger equation? Sure. Well, the Drake equation, as you said, it's a framework.

16:41.440 --> 16:48.640
 It's a description of the number of civilizations out there of intelligent beings that are able to

16:48.640 --> 16:55.920
 communicate with us by radio waves. So if you think of the movie Contact, you've seen Contact,

16:55.920 --> 17:00.960
 right? We're listening in, actually. It's an active field of research, listening to other

17:00.960 --> 17:06.320
 stars at radio wavelengths, hoping that some intelligent civilizations are sending us a message.

17:06.960 --> 17:13.760
 And the Drake equation came at the start of that whole field to put the factors down on paper to

17:13.760 --> 17:19.600
 sort of illustrate what is involved to kind of estimating. And there's no real estimate or prediction

17:19.600 --> 17:23.680
 of how many civilizations are out there, but it's a way to frame the question and show you each term

17:23.680 --> 17:30.240
 that's involved. So I took the Drake equation and I called it a revised Drake equation. And

17:30.960 --> 17:38.320
 I recast it for the search for planets by more traditional astronomy means. We're looking at

17:38.320 --> 17:43.200
 stars, looking for planets, looking for rocky planets, looking for planets that are the right

17:43.200 --> 17:50.400
 temperature for life, looking for planets that might have life, that outputs gases that we might

17:50.400 --> 17:54.960
 detect in the future. It's the same spirit of the Drake equation. It's not going to give us any magic

17:54.960 --> 17:59.840
 numbers. So I'm going to say, hey, here's exactly what's out there. It's meant to kind of guide,

17:59.840 --> 18:03.600
 guide of where we're going. Although the Drake equation did, I mean, the initial

18:03.600 --> 18:08.800
 equation proposed actual numbers for those variables, right? Oh, yes, the equation proposed

18:08.800 --> 18:13.680
 numbers. And you can still plug your own numbers in. And there's this really cute website that

18:13.680 --> 18:18.080
 lets you, for both the Drake and my revised equation, plug in some numbers and see what you get. So,

18:18.080 --> 18:24.880
 yeah. So, okay, so what are, I mean, what are the variables, but maybe also what are the critical

18:24.880 --> 18:33.280
 variables? So in my equation, I set out to what are the numbers of inhabited planets that show

18:33.280 --> 18:37.760
 signs of life by way of gases in the atmosphere that can be attributed to life. I could just

18:37.760 --> 18:41.440
 walk through the terms. That's probably simpler. So the first thing I say is, what are the number

18:41.440 --> 18:47.440
 of stars available? And it's not that those trillions and trillions of stars everywhere.

18:47.440 --> 18:54.560
 It's what are available to like a specific search. And so, for example, the MIT led NASA mission

18:54.560 --> 19:01.360
 TESS is surveying the sky looking for all kinds of planets, but it can also, it also has stars.

19:01.360 --> 19:07.600
 It has about 30,000 red dwarf stars. So we just take a number of stars that are given survey

19:07.600 --> 19:13.120
 can access. So that's what the number of stars is. Then I wanted to know what kind of stars are

19:14.240 --> 19:20.240
 quiet. A quiet, I called it a fraction of those stars that is quiet. In the case of TESS, the way

19:20.240 --> 19:25.040
 it's looking for planets is planets that transit the star. They go in front of the star as seen

19:25.040 --> 19:30.080
 from the telescope. But it turns out that some stars are very active. They're variable. And

19:30.080 --> 19:33.360
 they brighten and dim with time. And that interferes with our observation.

19:33.360 --> 19:39.440
 I apologize to interrupt. So it's a transiting planet. So you're really looking for a black blob,

19:39.440 --> 19:44.240
 essentially, that blocks the light. We're looking for a black blob that blocks the light.

19:44.240 --> 19:50.320
 And then trying to say something about the size of the planet from the frequency of that black

19:50.320 --> 19:54.960
 blob's appearance and the size of that black blob, that kind of thing. Yeah. But let's just say that

19:54.960 --> 19:59.360
 out of all the stars there are accessible to whatever telescope, some of them are just bad.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.760
 For whatever reason, you're not going to be able to find planets around them.

20:01.760 --> 20:07.600
 So I need to know the fraction of those that are good. So again, we have the number of stars,

20:07.600 --> 20:09.760
 the fraction of them that we can actually find planets around.

20:11.120 --> 20:16.320
 And by the way, is our sun, one such, is our sun quiet?

20:16.320 --> 20:22.160
 Our sun is quiet. So I have actually two terms. One describes how quiet they are. And one is

20:22.880 --> 20:26.960
 if we can find a planet around that star. These transiting planets, for example,

20:26.960 --> 20:32.560
 not all planets transit, because the planet would have to be orbiting that star in this kind of plane

20:33.840 --> 20:38.800
 as viewed from you. But if a star is, for example, orbiting in the plane of the sky,

20:38.800 --> 20:43.200
 it will never transit. It will never go in front of the star. So in that case,

20:43.200 --> 20:48.400
 we have to have a fraction that takes into account of that kind of geometric factor.

20:48.400 --> 20:52.720
 And hopefully, I mean, you can assume that it's uniformly distributed, hopefully.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.760
 Yes, we can assume and there's evidence that it's uniformly distributed. Yes.

20:55.760 --> 21:01.520
 So then the next, so all of these factors so far, number of stars accessible to whatever

21:01.520 --> 21:05.440
 telescope you're thinking about, how many stars are quiet, fraction of stars that are quiet,

21:06.000 --> 21:10.640
 fraction that are observable, in this case, for the geometric factor, those are all things we

21:10.640 --> 21:15.840
 can measure. And there's one more term in the Seger equation we can measure. I call it fraction

21:15.840 --> 21:21.760
 of planets in the habitable zone. Because believe it or not, we have a handle on that for a certain

21:21.760 --> 21:27.600
 set of stars. We know from our, the Kepler space telescope that operated for a number of years,

21:28.160 --> 21:31.760
 we have estimates for how many planets are in the so called habitable zone of the host star

21:31.760 --> 21:36.160
 for certain type of star. So all those we have measurable. And then like the Drake equation

21:36.160 --> 21:42.240
 itself, there are some terms we can not measure. And those ones, I call them FL, fraction of all

21:42.240 --> 21:49.040
 those planets that have life on them. Because we don't know what that is. And FS, I called for

21:49.040 --> 21:55.600
 spectroscopy, the fraction that have, we can use our telescope and instrument tools

21:56.640 --> 22:02.400
 to look for light. Actually, FS was the ones that the planets that have life that actually

22:02.400 --> 22:07.680
 gives off a gas, a useful gas that might accumulate in the atmosphere. So we could eventually observe

22:07.680 --> 22:13.920
 it. How do the FL and FS interplay? So these are separate terms?

22:13.920 --> 22:21.280
 Separate terms. And so. So for example, you could imagine, so for example, you could imagine life

22:22.400 --> 22:28.240
 like us humans, we breathe out carbon dioxide. But our planet Earth, we already have a lot of

22:28.240 --> 22:32.320
 carbon dioxide on it. Well, we have hundreds of parts per million, but it has a really strong

22:32.320 --> 22:37.040
 signal. So us humans breathing out carbon dioxide, it's not helpful for any intelligent

22:37.040 --> 22:40.720
 beings that are looking back at Earth. Because there's already a lot of, there's already enough

22:40.720 --> 22:45.680
 carbon dioxide, we're not adding to it. So if there is life on a planet, and it's outputting

22:45.680 --> 22:52.560
 a boring gas, that's not helpful for us to uniquely identify as being made by life versus

22:52.560 --> 22:58.480
 just being there anyway, then it's not helpful. So I separated those two terms out. Soon, I think

22:58.480 --> 23:02.880
 we'll have evidence that planets that can support life at least are common.

23:02.880 --> 23:11.520
 So, okay, this is such an awesome topic. I have a million questions. What, okay,

23:11.520 --> 23:17.760
 I know it's a little bit of speculation, but what's your sense about that? I think FS, which is like

23:18.800 --> 23:26.480
 that life would produce interesting gases that would be able to detect. Like, is there one,

23:26.480 --> 23:32.400
 is there scientific evidence? And, and second, is there some intuition around life producing

23:32.400 --> 23:38.800
 gases detectable hints in terms of chemistry? So interestingly enough, that entire question

23:40.400 --> 23:44.800
 relates to, I'm going to say almost my life's work, the work I'm doing now and the work I'm

23:44.800 --> 23:49.440
 doing for the next 20 years. And I wish I could give you a concrete number, like 1%. Like on

23:49.440 --> 23:54.480
 the worst days, it's 1%, let's say, in my mind. You know, in the best days, it's like 80%. And I

23:54.480 --> 23:58.480
 could actually go into a lot of detail here, but I'll just give you the simplest things.

23:58.480 --> 24:06.640
 So first of all, we make an assumption that like us and our life here on earth, life uses chemistry.

24:07.440 --> 24:11.600
 So we use chemistry because we eat food, we breathe air, and we have metabolism that

24:12.480 --> 24:19.440
 to break down food to get energy, to store energy, and then ultimately to use it. And all life here

24:19.440 --> 24:23.120
 has some kind of byproduct in doing all that, some kind of waste product that goes into the

24:23.120 --> 24:30.800
 atmosphere. So I like to think that life everywhere uses chemistry. Some people have imagined like,

24:30.800 --> 24:35.920
 let's imagine like a windmill, like mechanical energy, just getting energy and using it without

24:35.920 --> 24:41.280
 storing it. And if there was life like that, it might not need to output a gas. So we make this

24:41.280 --> 24:45.600
 basic assumption of chemistry. That's the first thing. The second more complicated thing that

24:45.600 --> 24:50.480
 I and my team work on is what happens to the gas once it is produced by life. It goes into the

24:50.480 --> 24:57.040
 atmosphere. And a lot of gas is just destroyed immediately actually by ultraviolet radiation

24:58.080 --> 25:05.200
 or by oxygen. Oxygen is incredibly destructive to a lot of gases. So the gas can be produced by

25:05.200 --> 25:09.840
 life, but it could be just completely destroyed by its environment. I guess we should pause on that,

25:10.480 --> 25:18.080
 that you mentioned your life's work. This is just the beautiful idea that it's kind of paralyzing

25:18.080 --> 25:23.680
 when you look out there and you wonder, is there a life out there? It's the first paralyzing.

25:24.240 --> 25:30.800
 Actually, before I encountered your work, I feel like an idiot, but it feels like there's no tool

25:30.800 --> 25:39.200
 to answer that question. And then what you kind of provided is this cool idea that it might be

25:39.200 --> 25:44.560
 possible to answer that by looking at the gases. I mean, that's a really interesting, that's a

25:44.560 --> 25:52.160
 beautiful idea. And yeah, so we could just pause on like, that's as a powerful tool, I think,

25:54.080 --> 25:58.720
 that to build the intuition wrong, because I was totally clueless about it. And that was kind of

25:58.720 --> 26:05.440
 exciting. I mean, I'm sure there's a folks probably early on in your life who were very skeptical

26:05.440 --> 26:11.600
 about this notion. Maybe I'm not sure, but it's generally you would want to be skeptical. It's

26:11.600 --> 26:17.680
 like, well, all these kinds of other things could generate gases, all those. Oh, that's so true.

26:17.680 --> 26:23.440
 And that's a big part of this growing field is how to make sure that this gas isn't produced by

26:23.440 --> 26:29.520
 another effect. But I do want to, again, pausing on that and going back a bit. It's incredible to

26:29.520 --> 26:33.920
 think, but like, at least almost 100 years ago, there's a record of someone talking about

26:35.120 --> 26:37.680
 the idea of a gas being an indicator of life elsewhere.

26:37.680 --> 26:41.680
 Oh, that idea was floating about somewhere. Yes, it was totally floating about.

26:41.680 --> 26:47.360
 And it comes down to oxygen, which on our planet fills our atmosphere to 20% by volume.

26:48.160 --> 26:53.040
 And we rely on oxygen to breathe. When you hear about the people on Mount Everest running out of

26:53.040 --> 26:57.280
 air, they're really running out of oxygen, well, they're running out of oxygen because the air is

26:57.280 --> 27:05.520
 getting thinner as they climb up the mountain. But without plants and bacteria, there's plants

27:05.520 --> 27:09.840
 that bacteria that also photosynthesizes and produces oxygen as a waste product. Without

27:09.840 --> 27:14.640
 those, we would have virtually no oxygen. Our atmosphere would be devoid of oxygen.

27:15.280 --> 27:21.440
 So yeah, if you were to analyze Earth, is oxygen the strong indicator here?

27:21.440 --> 27:24.560
 Oxygen's a huge indicator. And that's what we're hoping that there is an intelligent

27:24.560 --> 27:30.160
 civilization not too far from here around a planet orbiting a nearby star with the kind

27:30.160 --> 27:34.640
 of telescopes we're trying to build. And they're looking back at our sun and they've seen our Earth

27:34.640 --> 27:41.360
 and they see oxygen. And they probably won't be like 100.0% sure that there's life making it.

27:41.360 --> 27:44.960
 But if they go through all the possible scenarios, they'll be left with a pretty strong

27:44.960 --> 27:52.880
 hint that there's life here. Okay, but how do you detect that type of gases that are on the planet

27:53.520 --> 27:58.720
 from a distance? And that's going back to that. That's what people were skeptical about.

27:58.720 --> 28:05.040
 When I first started working on exoplanets, a long time ago, people didn't believe we would

28:05.040 --> 28:11.040
 ever, ever, ever study an exoplanet atmosphere of any kind. And now dozens of them are studied.

28:11.040 --> 28:15.280
 There's a whole field of people, hundreds of people working on exoplanet atmospheres, actually.

28:15.280 --> 28:20.560
 Wow. But first there was a point where people didn't even know there's exoplanets, right?

28:20.560 --> 28:25.040
 When was the first exoplanet detected? The first exoplanet around a sun like star,

28:25.040 --> 28:30.640
 anyway, was detected in the mid 1990s. That was a big deal. Kind of vaguely remember that.

28:30.640 --> 28:37.600
 Well, at the time it was a big deal, but it was also incredibly controversial. Because in exoplanets,

28:37.600 --> 28:42.960
 we only had one example of a planetary system, our own solar system. And in our solar system,

28:42.960 --> 28:48.960
 Jupiter, our big, massive planet, is really far from our star. And this first exoplanet

28:48.960 --> 28:53.920
 around a sun like star was incredibly close to its star, its star, so close that people just

28:53.920 --> 28:59.280
 couldn't believe it was a planet, actually. So maybe zoom out what the heck is an exoplanet.

28:59.840 --> 29:06.640
 An exoplanet is our name. Like is the name that we call a planet orbiting a star other than our sun.

29:06.640 --> 29:10.160
 Right. Extrasolar, I guess is another. You can call it extrasolar.

29:10.720 --> 29:16.560
 Exoplanet is simpler. But I think it's worth pausing to remember that each one of those stars

29:16.560 --> 29:22.320
 out there in our night sky is a sun. And our sun has planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.

29:22.320 --> 29:28.320
 And so for a long time, people have wondered, do those other stars or other suns have planets?

29:28.880 --> 29:33.760
 And they do. And it appears that nearly every star has a planet, has a planet we call exoplanet.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.800
 And there are thousands of known exoplanets already.

29:36.800 --> 29:43.680
 So that's already, yeah, like there's so many things about space that it's hard to put into one's

29:43.680 --> 29:50.880
 brain because it starts filling it with awe. So yeah, if you visualize the fact that the stars

29:50.880 --> 29:58.400
 that we see in the sky aren't just stars, they're like their suns. And they very likely,

29:59.200 --> 30:06.400
 as you're saying, would have planets around them. There's all these planets roaming about in this

30:07.920 --> 30:16.240
 dimly lit darkness with potentially life. I mean, it's just mind blowing. But maybe can you

30:16.240 --> 30:24.880
 give a brief history of discovering all the exoplanets? So there's no exoplanets in the 90s.

30:26.080 --> 30:29.360
 And then there's a lot of exoplanets now. So how did that come about?

30:29.360 --> 30:32.480
 So many planets. How did it come about? Well,

30:33.360 --> 30:37.360
 maybe another way to ask is, what is the methodology that was used to discover them?

30:37.360 --> 30:42.480
 I can say that. But I'd like to just say something else first where, so in exoplanets,

30:42.480 --> 30:47.840
 it's the line between what is considered completely crazy and what is considered

30:47.840 --> 30:52.640
 mainstream research legit is constantly shifting. This is awesome, yeah.

30:52.640 --> 30:58.080
 So before, when I started on exoplanets, it was still sketchy. It wasn't considered a career or

30:58.080 --> 31:04.960
 a thing, a place where you should be investing. And right now, now today, it's so many people

31:04.960 --> 31:09.040
 are working in this field, a good, I don't know, at least a thousand, probably more. I don't know

31:09.040 --> 31:13.600
 if that sounds like a lot to you, but it's a lot. No, it's a legitimate field of inquiry.

31:13.600 --> 31:17.120
 Yeah, legitimate field of inquiry. And what's helped us is everything that's helped

31:17.120 --> 31:22.560
 everyone else. It's software, it's computers, it's hardware. It's like our phones. You have a

31:22.560 --> 31:26.080
 fantastic detector in there. Like they didn't always have that. I don't know if you remember

31:26.720 --> 31:31.360
 the so called olden days, we didn't have digital cameras. We had film. You take a film camera,

31:31.360 --> 31:34.880
 you send the film away and eventually it comes back and then you see your pictures and they

31:34.880 --> 31:39.680
 could all be horrible. So yeah, it's digital. It just changed everything, data changed everything.

31:39.680 --> 31:44.800
 Yeah. And so one thing that really helped exoplanets were detectors that were very sensitive

31:45.520 --> 31:51.040
 because when we're looking for the transiting planets, what we're doing is we're monitoring

31:51.040 --> 31:55.840
 a star's brightness as a function of time. It's like click, taking a picture of the stars every

31:55.840 --> 32:01.840
 few seconds or minutes. And we're measuring the brightness of a star, like every frame.

32:01.840 --> 32:06.400
 And we're looking for a drop in brightness that's characteristic of a planet going in front of the

32:06.400 --> 32:13.200
 star and then finishing its so called transit. And to make that measurement, we have to have

32:13.200 --> 32:19.600
 precise detectors. And the detectors that are making the measurement, can you do it from earth?

32:19.600 --> 32:26.320
 Is it, are they folding the ball in space? Like what kind of telescope? Both. So on the ground,

32:26.320 --> 32:31.040
 people are using telescopes, small telescopes that are almost just like a glorified telephoto lens.

32:31.040 --> 32:37.440
 And they're looking at big swaths of the sky. And from the ground, people can find giant planets

32:37.440 --> 32:42.640
 like the size of Jupiter. So it's about 10 to 12 times the size of earth. We can find big planets

32:42.640 --> 32:48.400
 because we can reach about 1% precision. So not sure how much technically you want to get, but...

32:48.400 --> 32:54.880
 Well, yeah. Well, how many pixels are we talking about? Like what, you mentioned phones as a bunch

32:54.880 --> 33:00.400
 of megapixels, I think. So for exoplanets, you want to think about it as like a pixel or less

33:00.400 --> 33:05.520
 than a pixel. We're not getting any information. But to be more technical, our telescope, you know,

33:05.520 --> 33:09.440
 spreads the light out over many pixels, but we're not getting information. We're not

33:10.160 --> 33:15.040
 tiling the planet with pixels. It's just like a point of light, or in most cases, we don't even

33:15.040 --> 33:19.440
 see the planet itself, just the planet's effect on the star. But another thing that really helped

33:19.440 --> 33:23.680
 was computers, because transiting planets are actually quite rare. I mean, they don't all go

33:23.680 --> 33:29.360
 in front of their star. And so to find transiting planets, we look at a big part of the sky at once,

33:29.360 --> 33:33.680
 or we look at tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, or even in some cases, millions of

33:33.680 --> 33:37.920
 stars at one time. And so, you know, you're not going to do this by hand, going through a million

33:37.920 --> 33:44.960
 stars, counting up the brightness. So we have computer software and computer code that does the

33:44.960 --> 33:50.640
 job for us and looks for a, you know, counts the brightness and looks for a signal that could be

33:50.640 --> 33:56.480
 due to a transiting planet. And, you know, I just finished a job called Deputy Science Director for

33:56.480 --> 34:04.560
 the MIT led NASA mission test. And it was my purview to make sure that we got the planet candidates,

34:05.120 --> 34:08.720
 the transiting light curves, out to the community so people could follow them up

34:09.360 --> 34:12.560
 and figure out if they're actual planets or false positives.

34:12.560 --> 34:15.840
 I'll also publish the data so that people could just...

34:15.840 --> 34:16.880
 Yeah, publish the data.

34:16.880 --> 34:20.880
 All the data scientists out there could crunch and see if they can discover something.

34:20.880 --> 34:25.360
 Exactly. They can discover something. And in fact, the NASA policy for this mission is that

34:25.360 --> 34:30.000
 all the data becomes public as soon as possible. So anyone could act... It's not as easy as it

34:30.000 --> 34:36.160
 sounds, though, to download the data and look for planets. But there is a group called PlanetHunters.org

34:36.160 --> 34:40.400
 and they take the data and they actually crowdsource it out to people to look for planets. Yeah. And

34:40.400 --> 34:43.840
 they often find signals that our computers and our team missed.

34:44.720 --> 34:50.640
 So we mentioned exoplanets. What about Earth like or I don't know what the right distinction is.

34:50.640 --> 34:55.600
 Is it habitable or is it Earth like planets? But what are those different categories and how

34:55.600 --> 35:00.240
 can we tell the difference and detect each? Right, right. So we're not at Earth like planets yet.

35:01.040 --> 35:06.640
 All the planets we're finding are so different from what we have in our solar system. They're

35:06.640 --> 35:09.280
 just easier planets to find, but like... In which way?

35:09.280 --> 35:12.960
 For example, there could be a Jupiter size planet where an Earth should be.

35:12.960 --> 35:20.000
 We find planets that are the same size as Earth but are orbiting way closer to their star than

35:20.000 --> 35:26.000
 Mercury is to our Sun. And they're so close that because close to a star means they also orbit

35:26.000 --> 35:32.480
 faster. And some of these hot super Earths we call them, their year, their time to go around their

35:32.480 --> 35:38.080
 star is less than a day. And they're heated so much by their star. They're heated so much by

35:38.080 --> 35:42.880
 their star. They're heated so much by the star, we think the surface is hot enough to melt rock. So

35:42.880 --> 35:48.000
 instead of running out by the bay or the river, you'll have like liquid lava. There'll be liquid

35:48.000 --> 35:55.200
 lava lakes on these planets, we think. And life can't survive? Way too hot. The molecules for life

35:55.200 --> 35:59.520
 would just be... Molecules needed for life just wouldn't be able to survive those temperatures.

35:59.520 --> 36:05.520
 We have some other planets. One of the most mysterious things out there, factoid, if you will,

36:05.520 --> 36:10.080
 is that the most common type of planet we know about so far is a planet that's

36:10.800 --> 36:16.080
 in between Earth and Neptune size. It's two to three times the size of Earth. And we have no

36:16.080 --> 36:22.320
 solar system counterpart of that planet. That is like going outside to the forest and finding some

36:22.320 --> 36:26.640
 kind of creature or animal that just no one has ever seen before and then discovering that is the

36:26.640 --> 36:31.600
 most common thing out there. And so we're not even sure what they are. We have a lot of thoughts as

36:31.600 --> 36:36.000
 to the different types of planet it could be, but people don't really know. I mean, what are your

36:36.000 --> 36:40.320
 thoughts about what it could be? Well, one thought, and this is more when we want to be rather than

36:40.320 --> 36:47.040
 might be, is that these so called mini Neptune's, we call them, that they are water worlds,

36:47.840 --> 36:52.240
 that they could be scaled up versions of Jupiter's icy moons, such that they are

36:52.240 --> 36:58.640
 planets that are made of more than half of water by mass. So yeah, and what's the connection between

36:58.640 --> 37:02.960
 water and life and the possibility of seeing that from a gas perspective?

37:03.920 --> 37:10.560
 Okay, so all life on Earth needs liquid water. And so there's been this idea in astronomy or

37:10.560 --> 37:14.880
 astrobiology for a long time called follow the water, find water. That will give you a chance

37:14.880 --> 37:21.520
 of finding life. But we could still zoom out. And the kind of the community consensus is that we

37:21.520 --> 37:27.360
 need some kind of liquid for life to originate and to survive because molecules have to react.

37:27.360 --> 37:31.520
 If you don't have a way that molecules can interact with each other, you can't really make

37:31.520 --> 37:37.440
 anything. And so when we think of all the liquids out there, water is the most abundant liquid in

37:37.440 --> 37:41.040
 terms of planetary materials. There really aren't that many liquids. Like I mentioned,

37:41.040 --> 37:47.280
 liquid rock, way too hot for life. We have some really cold liquids, like almost gasoline,

37:47.280 --> 37:51.280
 like ethane and methane lakes that have been found on one of Saturn's moons, Titan.

37:51.920 --> 37:55.680
 That's so cold though. And for exoplanets, we can't study really cold planets because

37:55.680 --> 38:02.080
 they're just simply too dark and too cold. So we usually just left with looking for planets

38:02.080 --> 38:11.440
 with liquid water. And to your point, remember, we talked about how planets are less than a pixel

38:11.440 --> 38:16.240
 in that way to say. So we can't see oceans on the planet. We're not going to see continents and oceans

38:16.240 --> 38:21.600
 not yet anyway. But we can see gases in the atmosphere. And if it's a small rocky planet,

38:21.600 --> 38:28.000
 and this is going into some more detail, if we see a small rocky planet with water vapor in the

38:28.000 --> 38:34.240
 atmosphere, we're pretty sure that means there has to be a liquid water reservoir. Because it's not

38:34.240 --> 38:40.240
 intuitive in any way, but water is broken up by ultraviolet radiation from the star or from the sun.

38:40.960 --> 38:47.200
 And on most planets, when water is broken up into HNO, the H, the hydrogen, will escape to space.

38:47.200 --> 38:52.880
 Because just like when you think of a child letting go of a helium filled balloon, it floats upwards.

38:53.440 --> 38:57.920
 And hydrogen's a light gas and will leave from earths, leave from the planet. So ultimately,

38:57.920 --> 39:02.560
 if you have water, unless there's an ocean, like a way to keep replenishing water vapor in the

39:02.560 --> 39:06.960
 atmosphere, that water vapor should be destroyed by ultraviolet radiation.

39:07.760 --> 39:14.560
 Got it. So there's a, okay, so there's a need for liquid. I mean, I guess, what is water?

39:14.560 --> 39:19.200
 Well, is water sensors other liquids? I mean, the chemistry here is probably super complicated.

39:19.200 --> 39:22.160
 Well, there's not, it does, but you know, there's not an infinite number of liquids.

39:22.160 --> 39:26.560
 Right. There's maybe like five liquids that can exist inside or on the surface of a planet.

39:27.200 --> 39:31.280
 And water is the one that exists for the largest range of temperatures and pressures.

39:31.280 --> 39:36.080
 And it's also the easiest type of planet for us to find and study is one with water vapor,

39:36.080 --> 39:38.960
 rather than a cold planet that has ethane and methane lakes.

39:38.960 --> 39:46.000
 What's your personal, in terms of solar systems and planets that you're most hopeful about

39:46.000 --> 39:53.360
 in terms of our closest neighbors, that you kind of have a sense that there might be

39:54.080 --> 39:59.920
 somebody living over there, whether it's bacteria or somebody that looks like us?

40:00.400 --> 40:04.000
 I'm hopeful that every star nearby has a planet.

40:04.000 --> 40:08.960
 Because it almost has to for us to make progress. We have to have that dream condition.

40:08.960 --> 40:13.920
 So the dream condition is like, life is just super abundant out there.

40:13.920 --> 40:17.600
 Yeah, the dream, well, yes, the dream condition is that life is super abundant.

40:17.600 --> 40:23.600
 And it's based on the thought that if there is a planet with water and continents,

40:23.600 --> 40:28.720
 that it also has the ingredients for life. And that the kind of base, the base,

40:28.720 --> 40:37.600
 the base kernel thought is that if the ingredients for life is there, life will form.

40:37.600 --> 40:38.160
 Life will form.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.040
 That's what we're holding on to.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.600
 With a relatively high probability.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.440
 With a, yes, that's it.

40:43.440 --> 40:48.080
 Okay, let's go into land of speculation. What about intelligent life?

40:49.280 --> 40:54.320
 Us humans consider ourselves intelligent, surprisingly, or unsurprisingly,

40:54.320 --> 41:02.560
 do you think about, from your perspective of looking at planets from a gas composition

41:02.560 --> 41:10.400
 perspective, and in general, of how we might see intelligent life and your intuition about

41:10.400 --> 41:12.000
 whether that life is even out there?

41:12.000 --> 41:16.640
 I think the life is out there somewhere, the huge numbers of stars and planets.

41:17.360 --> 41:20.400
 I like to think that life had a chance to evolve to be intelligent.

41:20.400 --> 41:26.800
 And I'm not convinced the life is anywhere near here only because if it's hard for intelligent life

41:26.800 --> 41:29.520
 to evolve, then it will be far away by definition.

41:29.520 --> 41:34.320
 Well, the sad thing is maybe from the artificial intelligence perspective is

41:35.200 --> 41:38.560
 it makes me sad there might be intelligent life out there that we're just not,

41:40.160 --> 41:45.760
 like the pathways of evolution can go in all these different directions where we might not

41:45.760 --> 41:50.800
 be able to communicate with it, or even know that, or even detect its intelligence, or even

41:50.800 --> 41:56.400
 comprehend its intelligence. I'm convinced cats are more intelligent than humans that

41:57.600 --> 42:04.080
 we're just not able to comprehend the measures, the proper measures of their intelligence.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.520
 My dog is so funny. He's the golden doodle. His name's Leo.

42:08.080 --> 42:12.240
 We joke that he's either a really dumb dog. And so he's not here to defend himself,

42:12.240 --> 42:16.000
 but he's either really dumb or he's a super genius just pretending to be dumb.

42:16.000 --> 42:23.440
 Yeah. And he's possible. He's a multi dimensional projection of alien life here,

42:23.440 --> 42:29.760
 monitoring one of the, you know, one of the top scientists in the world trying to find aliens

42:29.760 --> 42:34.320
 just to make sure, just to make sure that humans don't get out of hand.

42:34.320 --> 42:37.920
 That's funny. Oh, I'm definitely going to go in and ask him, ask him about that.

42:38.960 --> 42:39.680
 Ask him about that one again.

42:39.680 --> 42:44.640
 She's onto something. Yeah. What might we look for in terms of signs of intelligent life?

42:46.320 --> 42:54.160
 From your toolkit, do you think there are things that we should, we might be able to use or maybe

42:54.160 --> 43:00.640
 in the next couple of decades discover that would be different than life that's like bacteria,

43:00.640 --> 43:01.600
 that's primitive life?

43:02.960 --> 43:07.760
 I still love SETI, search for extraterrestrial intelligence. I like to hope that if there is a

43:07.760 --> 43:12.480
 civilization out there, they're trying to send us a message. I think, like think about it,

43:12.480 --> 43:14.720
 I don't know, what are your thoughts? Like if you think about our earth,

43:15.520 --> 43:20.400
 there's no structure we've built that intelligent civilizations could see from far away.

43:20.400 --> 43:24.400
 There's literally nothing, not even the Great Wall of China. And so to think like,

43:24.400 --> 43:28.000
 why would this other civilization build a giant structure that we could see?

43:29.120 --> 43:34.080
 Yeah. So with SETI, the idea is that we're both trying to hear signals and send signals, right?

43:34.080 --> 43:39.920
 We haven't sent one, they call that METI messaging. And there's a big kind of fear over METI,

43:39.920 --> 43:44.640
 because do you want to tell them you're here? It's kind of this like, let's wait till they call us.

43:47.200 --> 43:52.480
 It's like a dating game. You have to like, how many days do I wait before I call kind of thing?

43:52.480 --> 43:55.520
 Yes, it is. And so, but the funny thing is, if no one's sending us a message,

43:55.520 --> 43:58.080
 if everybody's only listening, how do you make progress?

43:58.080 --> 44:04.720
 Yes. That's right. And I mean, but there's also, there's the Voyager spacecraft that we have these

44:04.720 --> 44:11.600
 little pixels of robots flying out all over the place. Some of them, like the Voyager,

44:11.600 --> 44:17.120
 reach out really far and they have some stuff on them. Okay. I just... We do. We have the Voyager,

44:17.120 --> 44:21.280
 but they're not really going anywhere in particular and they're moving very, very slowly on a cosmic

44:21.280 --> 44:26.640
 scale. Yeah. And me saying they're far is kind of silly. Yeah, it's all relative in astronomy.

44:26.640 --> 44:33.200
 It's all relative. Yeah. Yeah. I just, so from a, if you look at Earth from an alien perspective,

44:34.480 --> 44:40.640
 from visually and from gas composition, I wonder if it's possible to determine the degree

44:41.680 --> 44:47.760
 of maybe productive energy use? I wonder if it's possible to tell

44:48.720 --> 44:54.560
 like how busy these earthlings are. Well, let's zoom out again and think about oxygen.

44:54.560 --> 45:00.160
 So when cyanobacteria arose like billions of years ago and figured out how to harness the energy of

45:00.160 --> 45:06.800
 the sun for photosynthesis, they reengineered the entire atmosphere. 20% of the atmosphere has

45:06.800 --> 45:12.880
 oxygen now. Like that is a huge scale. You know, they almost poisoned everything else by making

45:12.880 --> 45:17.280
 this what was apparently very poisonous to everything that was alive. But imagine, so are

45:17.280 --> 45:21.280
 we doing anything at that scale? Like are we changing anything at like 20% of the earth with

45:21.280 --> 45:27.520
 a giant structure or 20% of this or 20% of that? Like we aren't actually. Yeah. Yeah. That's,

45:28.240 --> 45:32.240
 that's humbling to think that we're not actually having that much of an impact.

45:32.240 --> 45:35.120
 I know. Well, we are because in a way we're destroying our entire planet,

45:35.120 --> 45:39.520
 but it's humbling to think that from far away, people probably can't even tell.

45:39.520 --> 45:44.480
 But from the perspective of the planet, when we say we're destroying, you know,

45:44.480 --> 45:49.280
 global warming, all that kind of stuff, what we really mean is we're destroying it

45:49.280 --> 45:55.040
 for a bunch of different species, including humans. But like, I think the earth will be okay.

45:55.040 --> 45:59.840
 Oh, the earth will be, the earth will remain. Whatever, whatever happens to us, the earth

45:59.840 --> 46:04.160
 will still be here. And it'll still be difficult to detect any difference. Like it's sad to think

46:04.160 --> 46:09.760
 that if humans destroy ourselves, except potentially in nuclear war, it'll be hard to

46:09.760 --> 46:14.160
 tell that anything even happened. Yeah, it will be hard to tell from far away that anything happened.

46:14.160 --> 46:20.160
 What about, what are your thoughts now? This is really getting into speculation land there.

46:21.120 --> 46:27.760
 You've, you've mentioned exoplanets were in the realm of, you know, this is beautiful edge

46:27.760 --> 46:36.400
 between science and science fiction that some of us, a rare few are brave enough to walk. I think

46:36.400 --> 46:41.920
 in academia, you were brave enough to do that. I think in some sense, artificial intelligence

46:41.920 --> 46:50.480
 sometimes walks that line a little bit. There is so much excitement about extraterrestrial life

46:50.480 --> 46:58.000
 and aliens in this world. I mean, I don't know what, how to comprehend that excitement. But to me,

46:58.800 --> 47:03.760
 it's great to see people curious, because to me, extraterrestrial life and aliens

47:04.560 --> 47:10.960
 is at the core, a scientific question. And it's almost looks like people are excited about science.

47:10.960 --> 47:18.000
 They're excited by discovery. Discovery, right. And then the possibility that there's alien

47:18.000 --> 47:28.160
 life that visited earth or is here on earth now is, is excitement about discovery in your lifetime,

47:28.160 --> 47:34.880
 essentially. I mean, what do you make, what do you make of that? There's recent events where DARPA

47:34.880 --> 47:45.360
 or DoD released footage of these unmanned aerial phenomena. They're calling them now UAP.

47:46.000 --> 47:52.400
 They got everybody like super excited. Like maybe there is like what, what's here on earth? Do you

47:52.400 --> 48:00.240
 follow the, this world of people who are thinking about aliens that are already here or have visited?

48:00.240 --> 48:05.760
 I don't really follow it. They follow me, I'd say. Because in this field, if you're a scientist of

48:05.760 --> 48:13.520
 any kind, you get, people contact us, me. There's a lot of them about, hey, I have stuff you should

48:13.520 --> 48:18.240
 see. Hey, the aliens are already here. I need to tell you about it. And I know there are people

48:18.240 --> 48:23.520
 out there who really believe. There's a psychology to it. There's a psychology to it.

48:23.520 --> 48:27.120
 And it's fascinating. But okay. So it's similar to artificial intelligence.

48:27.120 --> 48:31.360
 But I still, but like you, I'm still enamored with the point that it is out there and that people

48:31.360 --> 48:40.320
 believe so strongly and that so many people out there believe. Believe and I don't know. I'm not

48:40.320 --> 48:46.800
 as allergic to it as some scientists are because ultimately if aliens showed up or do show up or

48:46.800 --> 48:52.800
 have showed up, you know, these are going to be very difficult to study scientific phenomena.

48:52.800 --> 49:02.640
 Like, in fact, like going back to cats and dogs, like, I just, I think we should be more open minded

49:02.640 --> 49:09.040
 about developing new tools and looking for intelligent life on earth that we haven't yet

49:09.040 --> 49:15.120
 found. Or even understanding the nature of our own intelligence, because it kind of is an alien

49:15.120 --> 49:18.720
 life form, the thing that's living, you know, in our skull.

49:18.720 --> 49:23.360
 It's so true. And we don't understand consciousness. Yeah. It's true. We don't understand how

49:24.160 --> 49:29.120
 biology is hard, you know, unpacking it and working it all out. It's a stretch. And they

49:29.120 --> 49:34.720
 say too that our thinking mind is like the tip of a pyramid, that everything else is happening

49:34.720 --> 49:40.240
 under the hood and, but what is happening? But the thing with, so the typical scientist's response

49:40.240 --> 49:47.440
 to, you know, are there aliens here is that we need to see major evidence, not like a sketchy

49:47.440 --> 49:52.160
 picture of something. We need some cold heart evidence and we just don't have that.

49:53.280 --> 49:59.040
 That's exactly right. But from my perspective, I admire people that dream. And I think that's

49:59.040 --> 50:05.440
 beautiful. The thing I don't like, there's two sides of the folks that probably listen to this

50:06.160 --> 50:12.560
 broadcast is, oh, those that dream, I think is beautiful, that wonder what's out there,

50:12.560 --> 50:17.760
 what's here on earth. And then the other ones who are very conspiratorial and thinking that stuff

50:17.760 --> 50:23.120
 is being hidden. It becomes about institutions. Right, right, right. Okay. I have a funny thing

50:23.120 --> 50:27.840
 to tell you about that. So one of my colleagues had a really good answer to that. And it's not

50:27.840 --> 50:32.640
 me saying this, so I can say this, but he said, look, he works with NASA, not at NASA. He works

50:32.640 --> 50:36.880
 with government, not in the government. It's kind of me, but he'd say, trust me, they couldn't hide

50:36.880 --> 50:42.160
 it if they tried. Do you know what I'm saying? Like we're not smart enough or good enough.

50:42.160 --> 50:46.720
 Not we or not me or not you, but whoever to cover it up. It's just, it's sort of a myth.

50:47.920 --> 50:56.240
 Yeah. It makes it sad because the people at NASA, the people at MIT, the people in academia,

50:56.800 --> 51:04.160
 the people in these institutions, and yes, even in government are often trying, they're like just

51:04.160 --> 51:09.760
 curious descendants of apes. They're just, they want to do good. They want to discover stuff.

51:09.760 --> 51:16.400
 They're not trying to hide stuff. In fact, most of them would, in terms of leaks, would love

51:16.400 --> 51:22.240
 to discover this and release this kind of stuff. There's a, did you ever watch this show called

51:22.240 --> 51:27.440
 The X Files? Yeah. Scully and Mulder? Yeah. And what I love actually, I used to put it up during

51:27.440 --> 51:32.800
 my talks, my public talks, there's a picture of a UFO or what looks like UFO and it says,

51:32.800 --> 51:40.480
 I want to believe. So that's where I think a lot of us are coming from. I want to believe. And it's

51:40.480 --> 51:46.080
 so great. And one time I put that up and this very, very nice couple approached me really nervous

51:46.080 --> 51:50.480
 afterwards and I said, hey, can we take you out for lunch sometime? And I said, sure. And they

51:50.480 --> 51:57.600
 were like the nicest people and just one of many who has an alien abduction story. And the woman

51:58.560 --> 52:02.080
 could never have kids. They were older, but they didn't have kids, which for them was a real

52:02.080 --> 52:05.440
 source of regret. But it was because the aliens who had abducted her had made it so that she

52:05.440 --> 52:11.440
 couldn't have kids. And she had apparently something implanted behind her ear, which was somehow

52:11.440 --> 52:16.720
 unimplanted later. And they were just so sincere. And they're such a lovely couple.

52:17.520 --> 52:22.480
 And they just wanted to share their story. That's, that's a real, whatever that is, that's a real

52:22.480 --> 52:30.160
 thing. The mystery of the human mind is more powerful than any alien or, I mean, it's as

52:30.160 --> 52:36.240
 interesting I think as the universe. And I think they're somehow intricately linked. Maybe getting

52:36.240 --> 52:46.400
 a sense of numbers. How many stars are there in maybe, I don't know what the radius that's

52:46.400 --> 52:50.960
 reasonable to think about. I don't know if the observable universe is like way too big to think

52:50.960 --> 52:55.920
 about. But in terms of when we think about how many habitable planets there are, what are the

52:55.920 --> 53:01.280
 numbers we're working with in your sense? What are the scale? Honestly, the numbers are probably

53:01.280 --> 53:06.080
 like billions of trillions of stars. Yeah, you know, in the UK, I think, I don't know if we do

53:06.080 --> 53:10.400
 that here, but they will call a billion trillion. We put like one billion followed by a trillion.

53:11.440 --> 53:14.720
 Yeah, it's kind of weird. But here, I don't even know how to say the number 10 to the 20.

53:14.720 --> 53:18.400
 Like if you know what that is, that's one followed by 20 zeros. That's a big number.

53:18.400 --> 53:23.440
 And we don't have a name for that number. There's so many per star. I think we kind of mentioned

53:23.440 --> 53:28.720
 this. Is there a good sense? There's probably argument about this, but per star, how many

53:29.440 --> 53:34.480
 planets are there? We don't have that number yet per se. You know, we're not really there.

53:34.480 --> 53:39.200
 But some people think that there's many planets per star. There's this analogy of

53:40.720 --> 53:45.440
 filling the coffee cup. Like, you know, you don't usually just pour one drop. You fill it. And that

53:45.440 --> 53:51.680
 planetary systems, we see stars being born that have a disk of gas and dust, and that ultimately

53:51.680 --> 53:57.920
 forms planets. So the idea, this kind of concept is that planets, so many planets form too many.

53:58.640 --> 54:02.400
 And eventually, some get kicked out and you're left with like a full planetary system,

54:02.400 --> 54:06.800
 a dynamically full system. And so there have to be a lot because so many form and a bunch survive.

54:07.920 --> 54:12.240
 I mean, that makes perfect intuitive sense, right? Like why wouldn't that happen?

54:13.120 --> 54:18.160
 Right. Well, there's other thoughts too, though. These big planets that are really close to the star,

54:18.160 --> 54:22.800
 we think they formed far away from the star where there's enough material to form,

54:22.800 --> 54:27.520
 and they migrated inwards. And some of these planets migrating inwards due to interaction

54:27.520 --> 54:30.240
 with other planets or with the disk itself, they may have cleared it out,

54:31.840 --> 54:36.320
 like kicked other planets out of the system. So there's a lot of ideas floating around.

54:36.320 --> 54:42.560
 We're not entirely sure. And what about Earth like planets? Is that that's another level of

54:42.560 --> 54:47.680
 uncertainty that? It's a level of uncertainty. If we think of an Earth like planet being an

54:47.680 --> 54:53.520
 Earth around a Sun in the same orbit, an Earth like planet being an Earth size planet in an

54:53.520 --> 54:58.240
 Earth like orbit about a Sun like star, we're not there yet. We're not able to detect enough of those

54:58.240 --> 55:04.800
 to give you a hard number. Some people have extrapolated and they will say as many as one

55:04.800 --> 55:09.200
 in five stars like our Sun could be hosting a true Earth like planet.

55:09.200 --> 55:14.960
 Wow. On the topic of space exploration, there's been a lot of exciting developments with NASA,

55:14.960 --> 55:23.920
 with SpaceX, with other companies successfully getting rockets into space with humans and getting

55:23.920 --> 55:30.800
 them to land back, especially with SpaceX. What are your thoughts about Elon Musk and SpaceX,

55:30.800 --> 55:36.560
 Crew Dragon, while working with NASA to launch astronauts? What's your sense about

55:37.520 --> 55:42.640
 these exciting new developments? Well, SpaceX and other so called commercial

55:42.640 --> 55:48.240
 companies are only good news for my field because they're lowering the cost of getting to space.

55:48.880 --> 55:53.600
 By having reusable rockets, it's just been it's incredible and we need cheaper access to space.

55:53.600 --> 55:58.240
 So from a very practical viewpoint, it's all good. About getting people, there's this dream

55:58.240 --> 56:04.640
 that we have to go to Mars, Boots on Mars. Boots on Mars. What do you think about that?

56:04.640 --> 56:11.920
 You mentioned probes. What's the value of humans? Is that interesting to you from both scientific

56:11.920 --> 56:17.200
 and a human perspective? Human mostly. I think it's such in our desire to explore because part

56:17.200 --> 56:22.640
 of what it means to be human. So wanting to go to another planet and be able to live there for

56:22.640 --> 56:30.240
 some time, it's just what it means to be human. Oftentimes in science and engineering, big huge

56:30.240 --> 56:35.600
 discoveries are made when we didn't intend to. So often this kind of pure exploratory type of

56:35.600 --> 56:39.040
 research or this pure exploration research, it can lead to something really important,

56:39.040 --> 56:43.680
 like the laser. We couldn't really live without that now. At the grocery, you scan your foods.

56:43.680 --> 56:49.280
 There's surgery that involves lasers. GPS, we all use our GPS. We don't have GPS because someone

56:49.280 --> 56:56.400
 thought, hey, it'd be great to have a navigation system. And so I do support, I do, but I really

56:56.400 --> 57:01.840
 think it comes primarily just from the desire to explore. Do you think something, there's a lot of

57:01.840 --> 57:10.640
 criticism and a lot of excitement about Mars. Do you think there's value in trying to go to put

57:10.640 --> 57:16.320
 humans on Mars, first of all, and second of all, colonize Mars? Do you think there's something

57:16.320 --> 57:20.560
 interesting that might come from there? I'm convinced there will be something interesting.

57:20.560 --> 57:26.000
 I just don't know what it is yet. But I don't think having some commercial value or value in

57:26.000 --> 57:31.280
 the metric of something useful is really what's motivating us. So really, you see, exploration

57:31.280 --> 57:35.440
 is a long term investment into something awesome that eventually will be commercial value.

57:35.440 --> 57:45.440
 I do, actually. Yeah. So what about visiting? Okay, I apologize, but there's an exciting longing to

57:47.520 --> 57:56.400
 visit Earth like planets elsewhere. So what's the closest Earth like planet you think is worth

57:56.400 --> 58:03.360
 visiting? And how hard is it? Wow, it is very hard. I mean, our nearest, call it Earth,

58:03.360 --> 58:08.720
 mass planet, it's orbiting a star very different from our own Sun, an Emdorff star, a small red star,

58:08.720 --> 58:14.160
 Proxima Centauri. It's over four light years away. And we can't travel at the speed of light.

58:15.120 --> 58:19.040
 We can't even, I mean, it would take tens of thousands of years to get there with conventional

58:19.040 --> 58:22.880
 methods. So you know, the movies like multigenerational, you have, yeah, this movie,

58:22.880 --> 58:28.560
 Passenger, have you seen that movie? Passenger. It's about a big spaceship that is traveling

58:28.560 --> 58:31.840
 to another planet and everyone's hibernating. I won't give you the spoiler alert because one

58:31.840 --> 58:36.800
 person wakes up and then it's kind of a problem. Okay, got it. But yeah, the multigenerational

58:36.800 --> 58:43.120
 ships, I mean, when you think about where we're headed as a species, maybe we don't send people.

58:43.840 --> 58:49.760
 Maybe we end up sending raw biological materials and instructions to print out

58:49.760 --> 58:55.360
 humans. It sounds kind of farfetched, but already we're printing like liver cells in the lab and

58:55.360 --> 59:01.920
 beating heart cells. We're starting to reconstruct body parts. I mean, the thing is, it is so hard

59:01.920 --> 59:06.960
 to get to another planet that this thought of printing humans or printing life forms actually

59:06.960 --> 59:14.320
 could be easier. Yeah, that's somehow so sad to think, to think of the idea that we would launch

59:14.320 --> 59:22.320
 a successful spaceship that has multigenerational, like nonhuman life, and it's going to reach

59:22.320 --> 59:29.280
 other intelligent life. And by the time they figure out where it came from, human civilization

59:29.280 --> 59:35.280
 will be extinct. Wow, yeah, that is really suffering. So that's one. There's a tempting

59:35.280 --> 59:41.920
 thing to think about. What are the possible trajectories? So, you know, Elon keeps talking

59:41.920 --> 59:49.120
 about multiplanetary, us becoming multiplanetary species. I mean, sure, Mars is a part of that,

59:49.120 --> 59:58.480
 but like the dream is to really expand outside the solar system. And it's not clear, just like

59:58.480 --> 1:00:04.480
 it, as you said, like what the actual scientific engineering steps that are required to take,

1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:10.800
 it seems like so daunting, so daunting. So like the smart thing seems to be to do the

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:17.040
 to do the most achievable near daunting task, even if there doesn't seem to be a commercial

1:00:17.040 --> 1:00:23.280
 application, which I think is colonizing Mars. But like from your perspective, is there some

1:00:24.480 --> 1:00:34.000
 Manhattan project style huge project in space that we might want to take on? And you've had roles,

1:00:34.640 --> 1:00:39.520
 you had scientists hat roles, and then you also had roles in terms of being on like committees

1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:46.640
 and stuff determining where funding goes and so on. So like, is there a huge like multi trillion

1:00:46.640 --> 1:00:51.280
 we've been throwing the T word around recently a lot, but these huge projects that we might want

1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:56.000
 to take on? Well, first of all, we want to find the planets like Earth first. Like just even finding

1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:01.360
 those Earth like planets is a billion dollar endeavor, billions of dollars endeavor. And that's

1:01:01.360 --> 1:01:08.000
 so hard because an Earth is so small, so less massive, and so faint compared to our sun. It's

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:14.160
 the proverbial needle in a haystack, but worse. And we need very sophisticated space based telescopes

1:01:14.160 --> 1:01:18.800
 to be able to find these planets and to look at them and see which ones have water and which

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:23.680
 ones have signs of life on them. Yeah, the the star shade project that you're part of. Star shade.

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:27.680
 Star shade, yeah, this probably was badass thing I've ever seen. Right. You know what's

1:01:27.680 --> 1:01:31.920
 interesting is describe what it is first. So what's amazing about star shade is it was first

1:01:31.920 --> 1:01:37.680
 conceived of in the 1960s. Imagine that and revisited every decade until now when we think we

1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:43.200
 can actually build it. And star shade is a giant specially shaped screen. It is about,

1:01:43.840 --> 1:01:48.560
 there's different versions of it, but think about 30 meters in diameter. So you're blocking out the

1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:53.760
 sun. You're effectively blocking out the star. Yeah. So that you can see the planet directly.

1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:58.720
 And star shade would have a spacecraft attached to it and it would fly in space far away from

1:01:58.720 --> 1:02:04.160
 Earth's gravity. And it would have to formation fly with a space telescope. So the idea is that

1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:09.520
 star shade blocks out the starlight in a very careful way. And it has to block that starlight out

1:02:10.080 --> 1:02:15.120
 so that the planet that is 10 billion times fainter than the star, that only the planet light

1:02:15.760 --> 1:02:23.600
 goes to the telescope. Yeah. So in formation, meaning the telescope flies and you've given

1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:31.040
 presentation on this, but like it would fly like and this is extremely high precision endeavor.

1:02:31.040 --> 1:02:35.600
 Yeah. We had this analogy like asking a friend to hold up a dime five miles away.

1:02:36.240 --> 1:02:38.560
 Perfectly. Like at the perfect line of sight with you.

1:02:40.160 --> 1:02:44.320
 And the shape of it is pretty cool. I mean, I don't know exactly what the physics of that,

1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:48.800
 like what the optics are that require that shape. I can tell you, it turns out that if you

1:02:48.800 --> 1:02:53.760
 block out a star, imagine blocking out a star with a circle, circularly or a square shape screen,

1:02:54.560 --> 1:02:59.280
 you wouldn't actually be blocking it because the star acts like a wave. The starlight can

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:04.560
 act like a wave and it would actually bend around the edges of the screen. And so instead of blocking

1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:09.520
 out the light, you're expecting to see nothing, you would see ripples. And the analogy that I

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:14.320
 love to give, it's like throwing a pebble in a pond. You get those ripples, you get these concentric

1:03:15.200 --> 1:03:19.120
 ripples and they go out and light would do something quite similar. You'd actually see

1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:24.560
 ripples of light and those ripples of light, they're actually way brighter than the planet we'd be

1:03:24.560 --> 1:03:30.480
 looking for. So they would introduce this noise that's... Yeah, noise. And so this star shade,

1:03:30.480 --> 1:03:36.080
 it's like a mathematical solution to the problem of diffraction, it's called. And this is what the

1:03:36.720 --> 1:03:40.800
 first person who thought about star shade in the 1960s worked out, the mathematical shape,

1:03:40.800 --> 1:03:46.400
 or one family of solutions. And the idea is that when the star shade, this very special

1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:52.480
 shape like a giant flower with petals, when it blocks out the light, the light bends around

1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:57.600
 the edges but interacts with itself in a way to give you a very, very dark image. It would be like

1:03:57.600 --> 1:04:03.360
 throwing a pebble in a pond. And instead of getting ripples, the pond would be perfectly smooth,

1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:08.960
 like incredibly smooth to one part in 10 billion. And all the waves would be on the outer edges,

1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:13.920
 far away from where you dropped that pebble. And so this camera would be able to... Oh,

1:04:13.920 --> 1:04:19.680
 this camera, this telescope would be able to get some signal from the planet then.

1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:23.120
 Yes. And it would be hard because the planet is so faint. But with the star out of the way,

1:04:23.120 --> 1:04:26.560
 the glare of that bright, bright, bright star, with that out of the way,

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:30.320
 then it becomes a much more manageable task.

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:34.000
 So how do we get that thing out there? We're still working with unlimited money.

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:38.000
 Okay, we're working with unlimited money. We have some more engineering problems to solve,

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:41.440
 but not too many more. We've been burning down our so called tall pole list.

1:04:42.240 --> 1:04:43.600
 And then we just... What kind of list?

1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:50.480
 We call it technology tall pole. It's the phrase where you have to figure out what are your hardest

1:04:50.480 --> 1:04:55.520
 problems and then break those down to solve. So the star shade, one of the really hard problems

1:04:55.520 --> 1:05:01.280
 was how to formation fly at tens of thousands of kilometers. It's like, wow, that is insane.

1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:06.560
 And the team broke that down actually into a sensing problem. Because of the star shade,

1:05:06.560 --> 1:05:11.520
 how do you see the star shade precisely enough to control it? Because if you're shining a flashlight,

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:16.400
 you know the beam spreads out. So the star shade has a beacon, an LED or a laser. It's going to

1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:21.280
 spread out so much by the time it gets to the telescope. The problem wasn't how do you tell

1:05:21.280 --> 1:05:25.200
 the star shade how to move around fast enough to stay in a straight line. The problem was how

1:05:25.200 --> 1:05:31.120
 are you able to sense it well enough? So problems like that were broken down and money that came

1:05:31.120 --> 1:05:35.840
 from NASA to solve problems is put towards solving it. So we've got through most of the

1:05:35.840 --> 1:05:40.800
 hard problems right now. Another one was that star shade, even though it's looking at a star,

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:46.560
 light from our own sun could hit the edges of the star shade and bounce off into the telescope,

1:05:46.560 --> 1:05:52.240
 believe it or not. And that would actually ruin it because we're trying to see this tiny,

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:56.000
 tiny signal. So then the question is, how do you make a razor thin edge? Like those pedal

1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:00.720
 edges would have to be like a razor. And what materials can you use? So there's a series of

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:06.640
 problems like that. Wow. So there's a materials problem in there? Some of them. Wow. And there's

1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:11.120
 one. So we almost finished solving all those problems. And then it's just a matter of

1:06:11.920 --> 1:06:17.840
 building one and testing it in a full scale size facility. And then building the telescope,

1:06:17.840 --> 1:06:22.960
 it's just a matter of time to build everything and get it, get it up for launch. So this is

1:06:22.960 --> 1:06:26.240
 an engineering? Close, engineering. Yeah, it's close. This is an engineering project.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:30.640
 It's a real engineering project. I actually can tell you about two other projects that are not mine.

1:06:30.640 --> 1:06:38.080
 I like to call, call star shade mine because it was my project that I helped make it mainstream

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:42.640
 where that line is constantly shifting. When I started, when I got this leadership role on

1:06:42.640 --> 1:06:46.880
 star shade, I remember telling people about it and it was definitely not on the mainstream

1:06:46.880 --> 1:06:51.600
 okay line. It was on the giggle factor side of the line. And people would just laugh like,

1:06:51.600 --> 1:06:55.760
 that's dead. Like you can never formation fly. Or they'd say, why are you working on that? That's

1:06:55.760 --> 1:07:00.240
 just so not, it's not. This is so awesome. There's a few things you've done in your life.

1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:06.000
 And that's when I first saw star shade. I was like, what, really? And then like it sinks in.

1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:11.840
 I mean, it's the same thing I felt with like Elon Musk or certain people who do crazy stuff.

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:18.160
 And then, and they get, they actually make it work. I mean, if you get star shade information

1:07:18.720 --> 1:07:24.640
 flying to like together, I mean, how awesome is that if you actually make that happen?

1:07:24.640 --> 1:07:30.320
 Even like from a robot, sorry, from the robotics perspective, even if it doesn't give us good

1:07:30.320 --> 1:07:34.320
 data, that's just like a cool thing to get out there. I mean, it's really exciting.

1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:38.000
 Really cool. So there's two other topics that aren't mine, but I still love them.

1:07:39.040 --> 1:07:42.560
 One of them, let's just talk about it briefly, because it's not a pro, but

1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:47.520
 it's the idea to send a telescope very far away to 500 times the earth's sun distance.

1:07:47.520 --> 1:07:52.000
 And this is way farther than the Voyager spacecrafts are right now. And to use our sun

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:57.200
 as a gravitational lens, to use our sun to magnify something that's behind it.

1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:00.160
 It's got to sink in for a minute.

1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:05.200
 Yeah, exactly. I mean, I don't know what the physics of that is, like how to use the sun.

1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:10.640
 In astronomy, and Einstein thought about this initially, we can use massive objects, bend

1:08:10.640 --> 1:08:16.240
 space. And so light that should be traveling like straight, it actually travels around the

1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:22.080
 warped space. And somehow you figure out a way to use that for magnification.

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:28.400
 You have a way to use that for magnification. That's right. There are galaxies that are

1:08:28.400 --> 1:08:33.280
 lens, so called gravitational lens, by intervening galaxy clusters, actually.

1:08:34.320 --> 1:08:40.960
 And there are microlensing events where stars get magnified as an unseen gravitational lens star

1:08:40.960 --> 1:08:44.880
 passes in between us and that very distant star. It's actually a real tool in astronomy.

1:08:44.880 --> 1:08:49.040
 Yeah, using gravitational lens to magnify, because it bends more

1:08:49.040 --> 1:08:51.840
 raised towards you than normally would normally see.

1:08:51.840 --> 1:08:58.720
 And again, we're trying to get more higher resolution images that are basically boiled

1:08:58.720 --> 1:09:04.240
 down to light. Well, it boils down to light. And then you can maybe get more information about...

1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:10.640
 Well, in this case, you would ask me, let's say, if this thing could get built, it would take

1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:16.240
 something like, they like to say 25 years to get from here to there, 25 years, and then it could

1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:20.640
 send some information back to us. And then you'd say, so, Sarah, how many pixels? And I wouldn't

1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:25.920
 say one or less than one. I'd say, you know, it could be like 10 by 10 pixels, could be 100 pixels,

1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:30.480
 which would be awesome. I mean, it's still crazy that we can get a lot of information from that.

1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:34.000
 Crazy, right. And it's crazy for a lot of other reasons, because again, you have to line up the

1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:39.760
 sun and your target. You only have one telescope per target, because every star is behind the sun

1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:45.520
 in a different way. So it's a lot of complicated things. But what about the second? The second one,

1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:53.040
 it's called Starshot. You know, Starshot means like big dreams. And it's an initiative by the

1:09:53.040 --> 1:10:02.080
 Breakthrough Foundation. And Starshot is the concept to send thousands of little tiny spacecraft,

1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:07.200
 which they now call StarChip. So instead of Starship, it's StarChip. And there's a little chip

1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:14.880
 and the Starship. So like thousands of little turtles being born, they're not all going to make it,

1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:20.800
 because they just send lots of them. And each of these Starships, once they're launched into,

1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:26.800
 I guess, low Earth orbit, they will deploy a solar sail that's a few meters in diameter.

1:10:27.680 --> 1:10:34.320
 And they'd use it on Earth, we would have a bank of... This one is still a bit on the other side

1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:41.360
 of the line, but we'd have a bank of telescopes with lasers that'd be like a gigawatt power.

1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:49.200
 And these lasers would momentarily shine upwards and accelerate. They'd hit these sails. They'd

1:10:49.200 --> 1:10:55.200
 be like a power source for the sail and would accelerate the sails to travel at about a 20th

1:10:55.200 --> 1:11:02.880
 the speed of light. Is that as crazy as it sounds? Well, like any good engineering project,

1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:07.440
 it has to be broken down into the crazy parts. And the breakthrough initiative, like to their huge

1:11:07.440 --> 1:11:14.640
 credit, is sponsoring getting over these... Actually, they've listed initially, they listed 19

1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:19.040
 challenges. This is broken down into concrete things. Like one of them is, well, you have to buy

1:11:19.040 --> 1:11:23.440
 the land and make sure the airspace is okay with you sending up that much power overhead.

1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:29.040
 Another one is you have to have material on the sail where the lasers won't just vaporize it.

1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:32.960
 And well, so there's a lot of issues. But anyway, these sails would be accelerated to

1:11:32.960 --> 1:11:38.400
 20th the speed of light. And their journey to the nearest star would no longer be tens of thousands

1:11:38.400 --> 1:11:47.840
 of years, but could be 20 years. Okay, 20. So it's not as bad as tens of thousands. And these

1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:53.040
 thousands or whatever, however many make it, they'll go by the nearest star system and snap

1:11:53.040 --> 1:11:57.440
 some images and radio the information back to Earth. Because they're traveling so fast,

1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:02.560
 they can't slow down, but they'll zoom by, take some photos, send it back. Hi, Rez. Yeah. But see,

1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:06.720
 just what I want you to pause on for a second is that just by making that a real concept,

1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:11.600
 and the money given won't make it happen, but what it's done is it's planted the seed.

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:16.800
 And it's shifted that line from what is crazy to what is a real project. It's shifted it just ever

1:12:16.800 --> 1:12:22.160
 so slightly enough, I think, to plant the seed that we have to find a way to somehow find a way

1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:27.680
 to get there. That is, again, to stay on that, that is so powerful. Take a big crazy idea

1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:36.640
 and break it down into smaller crazy ideas, order it in a list, and knock it out one at a time.

1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:43.360
 I don't know, I've never heard anything more inspiring from an engineering perspective,

1:12:43.360 --> 1:12:50.400
 because that's how you solve the impossible things. So you open your new book, Discussing

1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:59.840
 Rogue Planet, PSO J318, I never said this out loud, 0.522. So a rogue planet, which is just this

1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:07.760
 poetic, beautiful vision of a planet that, as you write, lurches across the galaxy,

1:13:07.760 --> 1:13:14.160
 like a rudderless ship wrapped in perpetual darkness, its surface swept by constant storms,

1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:22.800
 its black skies raining molten iron. Just like the vision of that, the scary, the darkness,

1:13:23.680 --> 1:13:31.520
 the, just how not pleasant it is for human life, just the intensity of that metaphor,

1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:40.480
 I don't know. And the reason you use that is to paint a feeling of loneliness,

1:13:40.480 --> 1:13:50.800
 I think, and despair. And why, maybe on the planet side, why does it feel,

1:13:52.080 --> 1:13:57.280
 maybe it's just me, why does it feel so profoundly lonely on that kind of planet?

1:14:01.520 --> 1:14:06.400
 I think it's because we all want to be a part of something, a part of a family or a part of a

1:14:06.400 --> 1:14:14.160
 community or a part of something. And so our solar system, and by the way, I only, it's sort of like a,

1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:20.880
 like when you treat yourself to like eating an entire tub of ice cream, like I sometimes treat

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:25.920
 myself to imagine things like this and not just be so cut and dried. But when you imagine that,

1:14:25.920 --> 1:14:29.600
 this planet's not, because I don't want to give emotions to a planet per se, but the planet's

1:14:29.600 --> 1:14:35.920
 not part of anything. It's somehow, it's just all on its own, just kind of out there without that warm

1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:39.760
 energy from its sun. It's just all alone out there.

1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:46.720
 To me, it was this little discovery that I actually feel pretty good being part of this solar system.

1:14:47.360 --> 1:14:53.440
 It felt like we have a sun, we have like a little family. And it felt like it sucked for the rogue

1:14:53.440 --> 1:15:02.000
 planet to just floating about, not floating, flying rudderless. By the way, how many rogue

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:07.280
 planets are there in your sun? We don't know totally. I mean, there's some rogue planets

1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:10.560
 that are just born on their own. I know that sounds really weird to be, how can you be born

1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:18.000
 an orphan? But they just are. Because most planets are born out of a disk of gas and dust around

1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:22.000
 a star. But some of these small planets are like totally failed stars. They're so failed,

1:15:22.000 --> 1:15:26.400
 they're just small planets on their own. But we think that there's probably, honestly,

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:31.120
 there's another path to a rogue planet. That's one that's been kicked out of its star system

1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:34.640
 by other planets, like a game of billiard balls. Something just gets kicked out.

1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:38.480
 We actually think there's probably as many rogue planets as stars.

1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:50.880
 No, flying out there fundamentally alone. So the book is a memoir. It's about your life and it

1:15:50.880 --> 1:16:01.520
 weaves both your fascination with planets outside the solar system and the path of your life.

1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:08.800
 And you lost your husband, which is a kind of central part of the book

1:16:10.880 --> 1:16:17.120
 that created a feeling of the rogue planet. By the way, what's the name of the book?

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:22.400
 The name of the book is the smallest lights in the universe. What's up with the title?

1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:26.640
 What's the meaning? The title has a double meaning. On the face of it, it's the search for other

1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:32.960
 Earths. Earths are so dim compared to the big, bright, massive star beside them. Searching for

1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:40.800
 the Earths is like searching for the smallest lights in the universe. It has this other meaning,

1:16:40.800 --> 1:16:47.520
 too. I really hope that you or the other people listening never get to the place where you're

1:16:48.720 --> 1:16:56.960
 falling off the cliff into this horrible place of huge despair. And once in a while,

1:16:56.960 --> 1:17:02.000
 you get a glimmer of a better life, of some kind of hope. And those are also the smallest

1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:08.960
 lights in the universe. Well, maybe we can tell the full story before we talk about the glimmer

1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:17.680
 of hope. What did it feel like to first find out that your husband, Mike, was sick?

1:17:17.680 --> 1:17:24.320
 It was incredibly frustrating. Lots of us have had some kind of problem that the doctors completely

1:17:24.320 --> 1:17:29.920
 ignore. Just that they kept blowing him off. It's nothing. Are they paid to just say it's

1:17:29.920 --> 1:17:36.000
 nothing? I mean, it's just insane. I was just so angry. And we finally got to a point where he

1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:42.560
 was really sick. He was in bed, not able to move, basically. And it turned out all the things they

1:17:42.560 --> 1:17:50.880
 ignored and not done any tests, he had a 100% blockage in his intestine. 100%. Nothing could

1:17:50.880 --> 1:17:56.320
 get out. Nothing could get in. And it was pretty, pretty shocking to even hear then that it could

1:17:56.320 --> 1:18:02.640
 be nothing. What was the progression of it in the context of maybe the medical system of the

1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:06.720
 doctors? I mean, what did it feel like? Did you feel like a human being?

1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:18.640
 I felt like a child. The doctors were trying to water down the real diagnosis or treat us like

1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:24.000
 we couldn't know the truth or they didn't know. I felt mixed. It's not a good situation if you

1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.800
 think the doctor either has no idea what he or she is doing or if the doctors purposely,

1:18:28.800 --> 1:18:32.160
 let's just say lying to you to sugarcoat it. I didn't know which one of it was,

1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:37.040
 but I knew it was one of those. What were the things he was suffering from?

1:18:37.760 --> 1:18:41.600
 Well, initially, he just had a random stomach ache. I hate to say that out loud because I know

1:18:41.600 --> 1:18:46.080
 a lot of people will have a random stomach ache. Yeah. But so he just had a bad stomach ache and

1:18:46.080 --> 1:18:50.160
 then, hmm, this is weird. A few days later, another bad stomach ache kind of gets worse,

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:55.040
 might go away for a few weeks, might come back. And at the time, all I knew was my dad had had

1:18:55.040 --> 1:18:59.680
 that same thing. Not the same identical system, but he had these really weird pains and he

1:18:59.680 --> 1:19:05.680
 ended up having the worst diagnosis. One of the worst diagnoses you can get from a random

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:10.880
 stomach ache is pancreatic cancer. Because the time, the pancreas, like you can't feel anything. So

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:15.840
 by the time you feel pain, it's too late. It's spread already. So I was just like, beside myself,

1:19:15.840 --> 1:19:20.800
 I'm like, this is like, wow, this guy, he's got a random stomach ache. All I know is another man

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:26.080
 I loved had a random stomach ache and it didn't end well. How did you deal with it emotionally,

1:19:26.080 --> 1:19:32.640
 psychologically, intellectually as a scientist? What was that like, that whole, because it's

1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:38.080
 not immediate. It's a long journey. It's a long journey. And you don't know where the diagnosis

1:19:38.080 --> 1:19:43.280
 is going. So anyone who's suffered from a major illness, there's like always branches on the road.

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:49.440
 So, you know, he had this intestinal blockage. I can't imagine someone in their 40s having that

1:19:49.440 --> 1:19:54.400
 and that be normal. But the doctor is like, it could be nothing. Could just cut it out. You

1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:57.840
 don't need most of your intestine. It's a repeating pattern. Just cut that out. It could be fine. But

1:19:57.840 --> 1:20:02.960
 it ended up not being fine and huge diagnosis being terminally ill. Well, it really changed my life

1:20:02.960 --> 1:20:08.400
 in a huge way. First of all, I remember immediately one summer, the summer when this happened,

1:20:08.960 --> 1:20:13.440
 I started asking everyone I knew, I would ask you, I know it's not my job to put you on the spot.

1:20:13.440 --> 1:20:19.840
 I'd say, you have one year to live or two or three. What will you do differently about your life now?

1:20:19.840 --> 1:20:23.600
 Lex, you have one year to live. What would you do?

1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:30.320
 I mean, it's hard. I don't know if you want to answer that. No, no, no. I think about it a lot.

1:20:30.320 --> 1:20:36.160
 I mean, that's a really good thing to meditate on. We can talk about maybe how,

1:20:37.520 --> 1:20:45.600
 why you bring that up, if it is or not a heavy question. But I get, I think about mortality

1:20:45.600 --> 1:20:55.600
 a lot. And for me, it feels like a really good way to focus in on is what you're doing today,

1:20:55.600 --> 1:21:04.960
 the people you have around you, the family you have. Does it bring you joy? Does it bring you

1:21:04.960 --> 1:21:20.160
 fulfillment? And basically, for me of long ago, try to be ready to die any day. So like today,

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:24.960
 you know, I kind of woke up, look if I was nervous about talking to you,

1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:31.200
 I've really admire your work and the book is very good and super exciting topic.

1:21:31.200 --> 1:21:37.760
 But then, you know, there's this also feeling like if this is the last conversation I have

1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:44.720
 in my life, you know, if I die today, will this be the right, like am I glad today happened?

1:21:44.720 --> 1:21:49.520
 And it is. And I am glad today happened. So that's the way.

1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:52.240
 And that's so unique. I never got that answer from a single person.

1:21:54.400 --> 1:21:59.600
 The busyness of life, there's goals, there's dreams, there's like planning.

1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:05.440
 And very few people make it happen. That's what I learned. And so a lot of these people...

1:22:05.440 --> 1:22:07.120
 Oh, like you run out of time?

1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:09.440
 It's not so much you run out of time, but I'd come back later and be like,

1:22:09.440 --> 1:22:13.840
 okay, why don't you do that? If that's what you would do, if you're going to die a year from now,

1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:20.000
 why don't you make it real? Simple things, spend more time with family. Like why don't you do that?

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:23.200
 And no one had an answer. It turns out unless you usually, unless you have,

1:22:24.400 --> 1:22:29.200
 you really do have a pressing end of life, people don't do their bucket list or try to

1:22:29.200 --> 1:22:32.640
 change their career. And some people can't. So we can't. Like for a lot of people,

1:22:32.640 --> 1:22:36.880
 they can't do anything about it. And that's, that's fine. But the ones who can take action

1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:42.400
 for some reason never do. And that was one of the ways that Mike's death or at the time,

1:22:42.400 --> 1:22:47.200
 his impending death really, really affected me. Because you know, for these sick people,

1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:50.720
 what I learned, he had a bucket list and he was able to do some of the bucket lists. It was awesome.

1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:57.200
 But he got sick pretty quickly. So if you do only have a year to live, it's ironic because you can't

1:22:57.200 --> 1:23:00.560
 do, you can't do the things you wanted to do because you get too sick too fast.

1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:05.680
 What were the bucket list things for you that you realized like, what am I doing with my life?

1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:12.240
 That was the major cons of him. After he died, I didn't know. Like I, I was just lost because

1:23:12.240 --> 1:23:17.920
 when something that profound happens, all the things I was doing, most of the things I was

1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:24.560
 doing were just meaningless. It was so tough to, to find an answer for that. And that's when I

1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:30.640
 settled on, I'm going to devote the rest of my life to trying to find another earth and to find

1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:39.840
 out to find that we're not alone. What is that longing for connection with others?

1:23:41.760 --> 1:23:45.360
 What's that about? What do you think? Why is that so full of meaning?

1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:50.160
 I don't know why. I mean, I think it's how we're hardwired. Like one of my friends some time ago,

1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:55.760
 actually when my dad died, he never heard someone say this before, but he's like, Sarah, you know,

1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:03.440
 why are we evolved to take death so harshly? Like what kind of society would we be if we just

1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:08.480
 didn't care people died? That would be a very different type of world. How would we as a species

1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:14.880
 have got to where we are? So I think that is tied hand in hand with why do we, why do we

1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:19.520
 seek connection? It's just that what we were talking about before, that subconsciousness

1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:26.240
 that we don't understand. Yeah, a couple, you know, the other side, the flip side of the coin of

1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:34.320
 connection and love is a fear of loss. It's like that was again, I don't know, it's what makes

1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:40.480
 you appreciate the moment is that the thing ends. Yeah, it's definitely a hard one. The thing ends,

1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:47.920
 but what, and it's hard to not you, you wouldn't want to limit like it's like my dog who I love so

1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:51.920
 much, I'll start to cry. Like I can't think about the end. I know he'll age much faster than I will

1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:56.960
 and someday it will end, right? But it's too sad to think of. But should I not have got a dog?

1:24:57.600 --> 1:24:58.080
 Right.

1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:02.000
 Should I have not brought this sort of joy into my life because I know it won't be forever?

1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:09.280
 It's, well, there's a, there's a philosopher who wrote a book, Denial of Death. I just,

1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:15.040
 and warm with the cores and there's another book talks about terror management theory,

1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:21.440
 Sheldon Solomon, I just talked to him a few weeks ago. He's a brilliant philosopher, psychologist

1:25:21.440 --> 1:25:29.280
 that their theory, whatever you make of it, is that the fear of death is at the core of

1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:37.520
 everything, everything we do. So like, you're, that you think you don't think about the mortality

1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:43.200
 of your dog, but you do. And that's what makes the experience rich. Like there's this kind of,

1:25:43.200 --> 1:25:52.160
 like in the shadows looks the, the knowledge that this won't last forever. And that makes every moment

1:25:52.160 --> 1:26:01.840
 just special in some kind of a weird way that it, the moments are special for us humans. I mean,

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:12.800
 I mean, sorry to use romantic terms like love, but what do you make, what did you learn about love

1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:20.480
 from, from losing it from losing your husband? Well, I learned to love the things I have more.

1:26:21.760 --> 1:26:29.040
 I learned to love the people that I have more and to not let the little things bother me as much.

1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:38.080
 What about the rediscovery or like the discovery of the little lights

1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:44.240
 in the darkness? So you, the book, I think you

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:56.560
 brilliantly describe the dark parts of your journey. But maybe, can you talk about how

1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:03.440
 you were able to rediscover the lights? They came in many ways. And the way like to think

1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:10.560
 about it is like grief is an ocean. It was tiny islands of the little, like, like the little

1:27:10.560 --> 1:27:15.280
 lights and eventually that ocean gets smaller and smaller and the islands like become continents

1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:21.920
 with lakes. So initially be like the children laughing one day or my colleagues at work who

1:27:21.920 --> 1:27:29.200
 rallied around me and would take me away from my darkness to work on a project. Later on,

1:27:29.200 --> 1:27:33.920
 it turned out to be a group of women my age, all widows, all with children in my town.

1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:37.600
 And it would be even though it was a bit morose getting together,

1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:44.480
 still very joyful at the same time. What was the journey of rediscovering love

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:53.920
 of like for you? So refinding. I mean, is there some by way of advice or insight about how to

1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:03.920
 how to rediscover the beauty of life? Of life. It's a hard one. I think you just have to stay

1:28:03.920 --> 1:28:11.600
 open to being positive and just to get out there. Do you still think, do you still think

1:28:11.600 --> 1:28:16.560
 about your own mortality? So you mentioned that that was the thing that you would meditate on

1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:23.840
 as a question when it was right there in front of you, but do you still think about it?

1:28:23.840 --> 1:28:28.800
 I think I will after talking to you. No, it's not really something I think about. I mean,

1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:35.440
 I do think about the search for another earth and will I get there? Will I be able to conclude

1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:43.280
 my search and is there one? I guess time goes by, that window to solve that problem gets smaller.

1:28:45.200 --> 1:28:52.000
 What would bring you, again, I apologize if this makes concrete the fact that life is finite,

1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:58.080
 but what would bring you joy if we discovered while you're still here?

1:28:58.080 --> 1:29:03.600
 What would bring me joy? Finding another earth, an earth like planet around a sunlike star,

1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:08.080
 knowing that there's at least one or more out there, being able to see water, that it has

1:29:08.800 --> 1:29:13.440
 signs of water and being able to see some gases that don't belong. So I know that the search

1:29:14.080 --> 1:29:17.680
 will continue after I'm gone, enough to fuel the next generation.

1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:22.480
 So just like opening the door and there's like this glimmer of hope.

1:29:23.840 --> 1:29:26.960
 What do you think it will take to realize that? I mean, we've talked about all these

1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:34.400
 interesting projects, Star Shade especially, but is there something that you're particularly kind of

1:29:34.400 --> 1:29:41.600
 hopeful about in the next 10, 20 years that might give us that exact glimmer of hope that

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:46.480
 there's earth like planets out there? I have to, I stand behind Star Shade in all cases.

1:29:47.120 --> 1:29:51.920
 But there is this other kind of field that I, that everyone is involved in, because Star Shade

1:29:51.920 --> 1:29:58.080
 is hard. Earths are hard. But there are, there's another category of planet star type that's

1:29:58.080 --> 1:30:03.840
 easier. And these are planets orbiting small red dwarf stars. They're not earth like at all,

1:30:03.840 --> 1:30:08.000
 think like earth cousin instead of earth twin. But there's a chance that we might establish

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.800
 that some of those have water and signs of life on them. That's nearer term than Star Shade and

1:30:12.800 --> 1:30:19.040
 we're all working hard on that too. Let me ask by way of recommendations. I think a lot of people

1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:25.120
 are curious about this kind of stuff. What three books, technical or fiction or philosophical or

1:30:25.120 --> 1:30:33.280
 anything really had an impact on your life and, and or you would recommend besides of course your

1:30:33.280 --> 1:30:40.160
 book. There's one book I wish everyone could read. I'm not sure if you've read it. It's actually a

1:30:40.160 --> 1:30:47.200
 children's book, like a young adult book. It's called The Giver. Yes. And it is the book that

1:30:47.200 --> 1:30:54.800
 kids in school read now. And I only, sorry. That's, that's, that's wow. Cause I've, sorry,

1:30:54.800 --> 1:30:59.680
 that, that caught me off guard. So when I first came to this country, I didn't speak much. It's

1:30:59.680 --> 1:31:05.920
 really what made me, it had a profound impact on my life. And I had a really important moment

1:31:05.920 --> 1:31:09.520
 because they, they give it to kids like, I think middle school, I think, or maybe elementary

1:31:09.520 --> 1:31:13.600
 or something like that. I'm so surprised you've even heard of this book. Yeah. So they gave it,

1:31:13.600 --> 1:31:17.440
 but like it's the value of giving the right book to a person at the right time.

1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:24.400
 It's very accessible. Do we want to share what the story is without spoiling it?

1:31:25.920 --> 1:31:30.160
 Yeah, you can without spoiling, right? It follows this boy in this very

1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:35.840
 utopic society that's like perfect. It's been all clean cut and made perfect actually. And as he

1:31:35.840 --> 1:31:42.160
 kind of comes of age, he starts realizing something's wrong with his world. And so it's part of that

1:31:42.160 --> 1:31:45.280
 question. Are we going to evolve this? I mean, this isn't what's there, but it made me wonder,

1:31:45.280 --> 1:31:49.120
 you know, are we evolving to a better place? Is there a day when we can eliminate, you know,

1:31:49.120 --> 1:31:55.040
 poverty and hunger and crime and sickness in this book they pretty much have in a society that the

1:31:55.040 --> 1:32:02.240
 boy's in and sort of follows him and he becomes a chosen one to be like a receiver that givers the

1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:08.320
 old wise man who retains some of the harshness of the outside world so that he can advise the people.

1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:12.160
 As the sort of boy comes of age and is chosen for the special role, he finds the world isn't what

1:32:12.160 --> 1:32:17.680
 he expects. And I don't know about you, but it was so profound for me because it jolts you out of

1:32:17.680 --> 1:32:22.640
 reality. It's like, oh my God, what am I doing here? I'm just going with the flow with my society.

1:32:22.640 --> 1:32:26.800
 How do I think outside the box and the confines of my society which surely carries negative

1:32:26.800 --> 1:32:32.880
 things with it that we don't realize today? Yeah, and also in the flip side of that is if you do

1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:41.280
 take a step outside the box on occasion, what's the psychological burden of that? Is that a

1:32:41.280 --> 1:32:46.400
 step you want to take? Is that a journey you want to take? What is that life like? I don't know. I

1:32:46.400 --> 1:32:51.600
 felt like from the book you have to take it. I found from the book. Now that you're saying it,

1:32:51.600 --> 1:32:55.200
 I see what you're saying. The burden is huge, but I always felt like the answer is yes,

1:32:55.200 --> 1:33:00.560
 you absolutely want to know what's outside, but you can't do that. It's hard to be objective

1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:07.040
 about your own reality. Yeah, I mean, it's a very human instinct, but it also the book kind of

1:33:07.040 --> 1:33:13.760
 shows that it has an effect on you. And it's a really interesting question about our society

1:33:13.760 --> 1:33:21.760
 taking a step out. It's by Lois Lowry, I think is how you pronounce it. I really do hope everyone

1:33:21.760 --> 1:33:25.200
 created it. And it is a young adult book, but it's still, it's incredibly, I'm really glad,

1:33:25.200 --> 1:33:28.960
 I only read it because my kids got it for school. I just thought, okay, well, why don't I just see

1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:35.360
 what this is about? And I just, wow. Yeah, I think it's also the value of education. I think,

1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:39.920
 I'm surprised you mentioned, I've never really mentioned to anybody. I'm sure a lot of people

1:33:40.640 --> 1:33:44.640
 had the similar experience like me and maybe. It's a generational thing though, because like

1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:49.840
 the book came out, I think in the 90s. So if you're older than me, that book didn't exist

1:33:49.840 --> 1:33:53.520
 when we were in middle school. So I just do think a lot of people won't have heard of it.

1:33:53.520 --> 1:34:00.480
 But it's an interesting question of like those books. I mean, I'm reminded often, I suppose

1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:06.800
 the same is true as all the subjects, but books are special. At the early age, like middle school,

1:34:06.800 --> 1:34:13.600
 maybe early high school, those can change like the direction of your life. And also certainly

1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:19.920
 teachers, they can change completely direction of life. There's so many stories about teachers

1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:26.240
 of mathematics, teachers of physics of any kind of subjects, basically changing the direction of

1:34:26.240 --> 1:34:34.240
 a human's life. That's like, not to get on the, the whole almost like a political thing, but

1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:41.840
 you know, we, we undervalue teachers. It's a special, it's a special position that they hold.

1:34:41.840 --> 1:34:47.200
 That's so true. Yeah. Well, I do have two other books or two other things. One is something I

1:34:47.200 --> 1:34:52.880
 came across just a few days ago, actually. It's actually a film called Picture a Scientist.

1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:59.920
 And when you picture a scientist, you probably don't picture the women and women of color in this

1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:06.720
 film. And it is a way to get outside your box. I really think everyone interested in science,

1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:12.320
 even just peripherally, should watch this because it is shocking and sobering at the same time.

1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:18.400
 And it talks about how, well, I think one of the messages across is, you know, we really are like,

1:35:19.200 --> 1:35:23.280
 I don't know if we're hardwired to just like people like ourselves, but we're excluding a lot of

1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:28.320
 people and therefore a lot of great ideas by not being able to think outside of how we're all

1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:33.360
 stereotyping each other. So it's, it's, it's hard to kind of convey that. And you can just say,

1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:37.920
 oh yeah, I want to be more diverse. I want to be more open, but it's a nearly impossible problem

1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:44.960
 to solve. And the movie really helps open people's eyes to it. This book I put third because unlike

1:35:44.960 --> 1:35:49.440
 the giver, people may not want to read it. It's not as relevant. But when I was in my early 20s,

1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:57.280
 I went to this big, this like 800 people large conference called, run by the Wilderness Canoe

1:35:57.280 --> 1:36:02.240
 Association in my hometown of Toronto. And there was a family friend there who I met.

1:36:02.240 --> 1:36:07.600
 And he said, read this book, it'll change your life. And it actually changed my life. And it

1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:13.680
 was a book called Sleeping Island by an author, PG Downs, who just coincidentally lived in this

1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:18.160
 area, lived in the Boston area. He was a teacher, I think at a private school. And every summer,

1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:24.240
 he would go to Canada with a canoe often by himself. And he wrote this book, maybe in the

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:30.240
 40s or 50s about a trip he took in the late 1930s. And it was, I was just shocked that even at that

1:36:30.240 --> 1:36:35.120
 time, although that was a long time ago, there were large parts of Canada that were untouched by

1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:40.640
 white people. And he went up there and interacted like with the natives. He called the book,

1:36:41.920 --> 1:36:47.120
 it had a subtitle that was called, there's something like Journey in the Baron Lands. And when

1:36:47.120 --> 1:36:50.880
 you go up north in Canada, you pass the tree line, just like on a mountain, if you hike up a mountain,

1:36:50.880 --> 1:36:55.120
 you get so far north there aren't any trees. And he wrote eloquently about the land and about

1:36:55.120 --> 1:37:01.040
 being out there. There weren't even any maps of the region in that time. And I just thought to

1:37:01.040 --> 1:37:06.000
 myself, wow, that you could just take the summer off and explore by canoe and go and see what's

1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:11.360
 out there. And it led to me just doing that, that very thing. Of course, it's different now,

1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:15.840
 but going out to where the road ends and putting the canoe in the water and just, well,

1:37:15.840 --> 1:37:20.880
 we had to have a plan. We didn't just explore, but go down this rivers with rapids and travel

1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:27.760
 over lakes and portages and just really live. So just really explore, screw it. That doesn't,

1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:31.680
 like it doesn't. Explore, just use from a topo map, from a topographical map

1:37:32.400 --> 1:37:36.960
 from the library in those days. That's scary. There were scary elements about of it,

1:37:36.960 --> 1:37:43.120
 out of it, but part of the excitement or the joy or the desire was to be scared,

1:37:43.120 --> 1:37:47.840
 like was to go out there and live on the edge. And persevere, yeah. And persevere, yeah.

1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:53.040
 Yeah. Do you have advice that you would give to a young person today

1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:01.440
 that would like to help you maybe on the planetary science side, discover exoplanets,

1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:06.160
 or maybe bigger picture, just succeed in life? I do have some advice just to succeed.

1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:11.680
 It's tough advice in a way, but it is to find something that you love doing that you're also

1:38:11.680 --> 1:38:17.280
 very good at. In some ways, the stars have to align because you've got to find that thing you're

1:38:17.280 --> 1:38:21.920
 good at or the range of things. And it actually has to overlap with something that actually you

1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:27.200
 love doing every day. So it's not a tedious job. That's the best way to succeed.

1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:33.440
 What were the signals that in your own life were there to make you realize you're good at something?

1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:43.680
 Like what were you good at that made you pursue a PhD and it made you pursue the search?

1:38:43.680 --> 1:38:48.880
 Yeah. I mean, that was the one sentence version. In my case, it was a long slog and there were a

1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:53.200
 lot of things I wasn't good at initially. But so initially, I was good at high school math,

1:38:53.200 --> 1:38:57.920
 I was good at high school science. I loved astronomy and I realized those could all fit

1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:02.240
 together. Like the day I realized you could be an astronomer for a job, it has to be one of my

1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:07.440
 top days of my life. I didn't know that you could be that for a job. And I was good at all those

1:39:07.440 --> 1:39:10.960
 things. And although my dad wanted me to do something more practical, where he could be

1:39:10.960 --> 1:39:15.840
 guaranteed I could support myself was another option. But initially, I wasn't that good at

1:39:15.840 --> 1:39:20.000
 physics. It was a slog to just get through school and grad schools a very, very long time.

1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:24.880
 But ultimately, when faced with a choice and I had the luxury of choosing,

1:39:25.760 --> 1:39:28.560
 knowing that I was good at something and also loved it, it really carried me through.

1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:34.160
 Now, I asked some of the smartest people in the world the most ridiculous question.

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:43.040
 We already talked about it a little bit, but let me ask again, why are we here? So I think you've

1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:47.920
 raised this question when your presentation says like one of the things that we kind of

1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:53.200
 assume is long to answer in the search for exoplanets is kind of part of that.

1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:57.040
 But what do you think is the meaning of it all, of life?

1:39:57.040 --> 1:39:58.480
 I wish I had a good answer for you.

1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:06.960
 I think you're the first person ever who refused to answer the question.

1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:10.880
 It's not so much refusing. I just, yeah, I mean, I wish I had a better answer.

1:40:10.880 --> 1:40:12.560
 It's why we're here.

1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:19.840
 It's almost like the meaning is wishing there was a meaning. Wishing we knew.

1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:24.160
 I love that. That's a great way to say it.

1:40:24.160 --> 1:40:29.840
 Sarah, like I said, the book is excellent. I admired your work from afar for a while.

1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:37.120
 And I think you're one of the great stars at MIT. It makes me proud to be part of the community.

1:40:38.800 --> 1:40:42.560
 Thank you so much for your work. Thank you for inspiring all of us. Thanks for talking to me.

1:40:42.560 --> 1:40:43.600

 with the tie in the thumbnail. And now let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan.

1:41:17.440 --> 1:41:25.440
 Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
