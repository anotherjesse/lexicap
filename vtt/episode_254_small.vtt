00:00.000 --> 00:02.920
 The following is a conversation with Jay Bhattakarya,

00:02.920 --> 00:05.200
 professor of medicine, health policy,

00:05.200 --> 00:08.180
 and economics at Stanford University.

00:08.180 --> 00:11.400
 Please allow me to say a few words about lockdowns

00:11.400 --> 00:14.400
 and the blinding destructive effects of arrogance

00:14.400 --> 00:19.400
 on leadership, especially in the space of policy and politics.

00:19.840 --> 00:21.800
 Jay Bhattakarya is the coauthor

00:21.800 --> 00:24.460
 of the now famous Great Barrington Declaration,

00:24.460 --> 00:27.880
 a one page document that in October, 2020,

00:27.880 --> 00:31.200
 made a case against the effectiveness of lockdowns.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.680
 Most of this podcast conversation is about the ideas

00:34.680 --> 00:36.360
 related to this document.

00:36.360 --> 00:39.000
 And so, let me say a few things here

00:39.000 --> 00:40.240
 about what troubles me.

00:41.560 --> 00:44.480
 Those who advocate for lockdowns as a policy

00:44.480 --> 00:47.320
 often ignore the quiet suffering of millions,

00:47.320 --> 00:50.160
 that it results in, which includes economic pain,

00:50.160 --> 00:52.560
 loss of jobs that give meaning and pride

00:52.560 --> 00:54.200
 in the face of uncertainty,

00:54.200 --> 00:57.300
 the increase in suicide and suicidal ideation,

00:57.300 --> 01:00.840
 and in general, the fear and anger that arises

01:00.840 --> 01:04.160
 from the powerlessness forced onto the populace

01:04.160 --> 01:07.080
 but the self proclaimed elites and experts.

01:08.120 --> 01:11.600
 Many folks whose job is unaffected by the lockdowns

01:11.600 --> 01:14.800
 talk down to the masses about which path forward is right

01:14.800 --> 01:16.600
 and which is wrong.

01:16.600 --> 01:20.040
 What troubles me most is this very lack of empathy

01:20.040 --> 01:22.880
 among the policy makers for the common man

01:22.880 --> 01:26.280
 and in general for people unlike themselves.

01:26.280 --> 01:28.560
 The landscape of suffering is vast

01:28.560 --> 01:31.880
 and must be fully considered in calculating the response

01:31.880 --> 01:34.520
 to the pandemic with humility

01:34.520 --> 01:39.320
 and with rigorous open minded scientific debate.

01:39.320 --> 01:42.080
 Jay and I talk about the email from Francis Collins

01:42.080 --> 01:46.440
 to Anthony Fauci that called Jay and his two coauthors,

01:46.440 --> 01:48.760
 fringe epidemiologists,

01:48.760 --> 01:51.560
 and also called for a devastating published takedown

01:51.560 --> 01:53.240
 of their ideas.

01:53.240 --> 01:57.160
 These words from Francis broke my heart.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.600
 I understand them.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.760
 I can even steel man them.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.920
 But nevertheless, unbalance,

02:02.920 --> 02:06.680
 they show to me a failure of leadership.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.040
 Leadership in a pandemic is hard,

02:09.040 --> 02:12.640
 which is why great leaders are remembered by history.

02:12.640 --> 02:14.400
 They are rare.

02:14.400 --> 02:18.480
 They stand out and they give me hope.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.560
 Also, this whole mess inspires me

02:21.560 --> 02:24.680
 on my small individual level to do the right thing

02:24.680 --> 02:28.240
 in the face of conformity, despite the long odds.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.440
 I talk to Francis Collins.

02:31.440 --> 02:34.160
 I talk to Albert Burla, Pfizer CEO.

02:34.160 --> 02:37.920
 I also talked and will continue to talk with people like Jay

02:37.920 --> 02:39.800
 and other dissenting voices

02:39.800 --> 02:42.000
 that challenge the mainstream narratives

02:42.000 --> 02:43.800
 and those in the seats of power.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.880
 I hope to highlight both the strengths and weaknesses

02:47.880 --> 02:50.640
 in their ideas with respect and empathy,

02:50.640 --> 02:53.160
 but also with guts and skill.

02:54.000 --> 02:57.800
 The skill part I hope to improve on over time.

02:57.800 --> 03:00.760
 And I do believe that conversation

03:00.760 --> 03:03.360
 and an open mind is the way out of this.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.960
 And finally, as I've said in the past,

03:06.960 --> 03:09.720
 I value love and integrity

03:09.720 --> 03:12.960
 far, far above money, fame and power.

03:12.960 --> 03:16.040
 Those latter three are all ephemeral.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.320
 They slip through the fingers

03:17.320 --> 03:19.000
 of anyone who tries to hold on

03:19.000 --> 03:23.280
 and leave behind an empty shell of a human being.

03:24.360 --> 03:27.120
 I prefer to die a man who lived by principles

03:27.120 --> 03:28.760
 that nobody could shake

03:28.760 --> 03:31.640
 and a man who added a bit of love to the world.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.880
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

03:34.880 --> 03:37.320
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

03:37.320 --> 03:38.520
 in the description.

03:38.520 --> 03:42.240
 And now here's my conversation with Jay Barakarya.

03:43.920 --> 03:48.520
 To our best understanding today, how deadly is COVID?

03:48.520 --> 03:52.720
 Do we have a good measure for this very question?

03:52.720 --> 03:55.200
 So the best evidence for COVID,

03:55.200 --> 03:58.040
 the deadliness of COVID comes from a whole series

03:58.040 --> 04:00.120
 of seroprevalence studies.

04:00.120 --> 04:01.600
 Seroprevalence studies are these studies

04:01.600 --> 04:04.880
 of antibody prevalence in the population at large.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.000
 I was part of the very first set of seroprevalence studies,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
 one in Santa Clara County, one in LA County,

04:11.000 --> 04:14.280
 and one with Major League Baseball around the US.

04:14.280 --> 04:16.200
 If I may just pause you for a second.

04:16.200 --> 04:20.720
 If people don't know what serology is in seroprevalence,

04:20.720 --> 04:23.080
 it does sound like you say zero prevalence.

04:23.080 --> 04:26.040
 It's not, it's sero and serologies antibodies.

04:26.040 --> 04:29.920
 So it's a survey that counts the number of antibodies.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.160
 Specific to COVID, yes.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.880
 People that have antibodies specific to COVID,

04:34.880 --> 04:37.040
 which perhaps shows an indication

04:37.040 --> 04:39.160
 that they likely have had COVID.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.680
 And therefore this is a way to study

04:41.680 --> 04:43.160
 how many people in the population

04:43.160 --> 04:45.440
 have been exposed to or have had COVID.

04:45.440 --> 04:46.840
 Exactly, yeah, exactly.

04:46.840 --> 04:51.840
 So the idea is that we don't know

04:51.840 --> 04:53.520
 exactly the number of people with COVID

04:53.520 --> 04:54.880
 just by counting the people

04:54.880 --> 04:57.760
 that present themselves with symptoms of COVID.

04:57.760 --> 04:58.960
 COVID has, it turns out,

04:58.960 --> 05:01.760
 a very wide range of symptoms possible,

05:01.760 --> 05:04.160
 ranging from no symptoms at all

05:04.160 --> 05:05.920
 to this deadly viral pneumonia

05:05.920 --> 05:07.480
 that's killed so many people.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.000
 And the problem is like in,

05:09.000 --> 05:10.440
 if you just count the number of cases,

05:10.440 --> 05:12.320
 the people who have very few symptoms

05:12.320 --> 05:14.560
 often don't show up for testing.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.160
 We just don't, they're outside of the can of public health.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.360
 And so it's really hard to know

05:20.360 --> 05:21.920
 the answer to your question

05:21.920 --> 05:24.200
 without understanding how many people are infected

05:24.200 --> 05:26.320
 because you can probably tell the number of deaths.

05:26.320 --> 05:28.400
 That's even though that there's some controversy over that.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.360
 But that, so the numerator is possible,

05:31.360 --> 05:33.120
 but the denominator is much harder.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.120
 How much controversy is there about the death?

05:35.120 --> 05:36.960
 We're gonna go on million tangents.

05:36.960 --> 05:39.120
 Is that, okay, we're gonna,

05:39.120 --> 05:40.160
 I have a million questions.

05:40.160 --> 05:43.560
 So one, I love data so much,

05:43.560 --> 05:45.520
 but I like almost tuned out

05:45.520 --> 05:47.440
 paying attention to COVID data

05:47.440 --> 05:50.040
 because I feel like I'm walking on shaky ground.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.200
 I don't know who to trust.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.440
 Maybe you can comment on different sources of data,

05:54.440 --> 05:56.000
 different kinds of data.

05:56.000 --> 05:59.200
 The death one, that seems like a really important one.

05:59.200 --> 06:03.280
 Can we trust the reported deaths associated with COVID

06:03.280 --> 06:06.120
 or is it just a giant, messy thing that mixed up?

06:06.120 --> 06:09.640
 And then there's this kind of stories about hospitals

06:09.640 --> 06:14.320
 being incentivized to report a death as COVID death.

06:14.320 --> 06:16.440
 So there's some truth in some of that.

06:16.440 --> 06:19.080
 Let me just talk about the incentives.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.480
 So in the United States,

06:21.480 --> 06:25.040
 we passed this CARES Act that was aimed at

06:25.040 --> 06:27.560
 making sure hospital assistance didn't go bankrupt

06:27.560 --> 06:29.520
 in the early days of the pandemic.

06:29.520 --> 06:30.440
 The couple of things they did,

06:30.440 --> 06:34.640
 one was they provided incentives to treat COVID patients,

06:34.640 --> 06:38.800
 tens of thousands of dollars extra per COVID patient.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.120
 And the other thing they did is

06:40.120 --> 06:42.440
 they gave a 20% bump to Medicare payments

06:42.440 --> 06:44.440
 for elderly patients who treat with COVID.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.360
 The idea is that there's more expensive to treat them

06:46.360 --> 06:48.360
 at the early days.

06:48.360 --> 06:49.520
 So that did provide an incentive

06:49.520 --> 06:52.560
 to sort of have a lot of COVID patients in the hospital

06:52.560 --> 06:55.800
 because your financial success of the hospital

06:55.800 --> 06:57.880
 or at least not lack of financial ruin

06:57.880 --> 07:00.600
 depended on having many COVID patients.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.120
 The other thing on the death certificates

07:02.120 --> 07:04.080
 is the reporting of deaths is a separate issue.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.520
 I don't know that there's a financial incentive there,

07:06.520 --> 07:08.920
 but there is this sort of like complicated,

07:08.920 --> 07:11.240
 you know, when you fill out a death certificate

07:11.240 --> 07:13.760
 for a patient with a lot of conditions,

07:13.760 --> 07:15.400
 like let's say a patient has diabetes,

07:15.400 --> 07:17.200
 a patient that while that diabetes

07:17.200 --> 07:20.040
 could lead to heart failure,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.080
 you know, you have a heart attack, heart failure,

07:22.080 --> 07:26.440
 your lungs fill up, then you get COVID and you die.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.200
 So what do you write on the death certificate?

07:28.200 --> 07:29.520
 Was it COVID that killed you?

07:29.520 --> 07:31.240
 Was it the lungs filling up?

07:31.240 --> 07:32.840
 Was it the heart failure?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.040
 Was it the diabetes?

07:34.040 --> 07:36.720
 It's really difficult to like disentangle.

07:37.640 --> 07:40.320
 And I think a lot of times what's happened is

07:40.320 --> 07:44.840
 they people have like aired on the side of signing COVID.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.120
 Now, what's the evidence of this?

07:46.120 --> 07:49.600
 There's been a couple of audits of death certificates

07:49.600 --> 07:51.000
 in places like Santa Clara County

07:51.000 --> 07:54.240
 where I live in Alameda County, California

07:54.240 --> 07:56.560
 where they carefully went through the death certificate

07:56.560 --> 07:57.920
 and said, okay, is this reasonable to say

07:57.920 --> 08:00.800
 this was actually COVID or was COVID incidental?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.480
 And they found that about 25%,

08:02.480 --> 08:06.280
 25% of the deaths were more likely incidental

08:06.280 --> 08:08.360
 than directly due to COVID.

08:08.360 --> 08:10.440
 I personally don't get too excited about this.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.240
 I mean, it's a philosophical question, right?

08:12.240 --> 08:15.640
 Like ultimately, what kills you?

08:15.640 --> 08:19.360
 Which is an odd thing to say if you're not in medicine,

08:19.360 --> 08:23.280
 but like really it's almost always multifactorial.

08:23.280 --> 08:25.120
 It's not always just the bus hits you.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.160
 The bus hits you, you get a brain bleed.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.680
 Was the brain bleed that killed you?

08:28.680 --> 08:29.640
 Would it have burst anyway?

08:29.640 --> 08:32.440
 I mean, you know, the bus hits you, killed you, right?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.120
 The way you die is a philosophical question,

08:34.120 --> 08:36.840
 but it's also a sociological and psychological question.

08:36.840 --> 08:40.360
 Cause it seems like every single person

08:40.360 --> 08:43.160
 who was passed away or the past couple of years,

08:43.160 --> 08:45.000
 kind of the first question that comes to mind.

08:45.000 --> 08:45.840
 Was it COVID?

08:45.840 --> 08:46.680
 Was it COVID?

08:46.680 --> 08:48.360
 Not just because you're trying to be political,

08:48.360 --> 08:49.400
 but just in your mind.

08:49.400 --> 08:51.920
 No, I think there's a psychological reason for this, right?

08:51.920 --> 08:55.520
 So, you know, we've spent the better part

08:55.520 --> 08:57.720
 of at least a half century in the United States

08:57.720 --> 09:01.280
 not worried too much about infectious diseases.

09:01.280 --> 09:03.800
 And the notion was we'd essentially conquered them.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.080
 It was something that happens in far away places

09:06.080 --> 09:07.840
 to other people.

09:07.840 --> 09:10.000
 And that's true for much of the developed world.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.960
 Life expectancy were going up for decades and decades.

09:13.960 --> 09:16.080
 And for the first time in living memory,

09:16.080 --> 09:18.360
 we have a disease that can kill us.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.320
 I mean, I think we're effectively evolved to fear that.

09:21.320 --> 09:23.360
 Like the panic centers of our brain,

09:23.360 --> 09:26.000
 the lizard part of our brain takes over.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.920
 And our central focus has been avoiding this one risk.

09:29.920 --> 09:32.400
 And so it's not surprising that people

09:32.400 --> 09:33.920
 when they're filling our death certificates

09:33.920 --> 09:36.600
 or thinking about what led to the death,

09:36.600 --> 09:38.960
 this most salient thing that's in the front

09:38.960 --> 09:41.220
 of everyone's brain would jump to the top.

09:42.360 --> 09:46.840
 And we can't ignore this very deep psychological thing

09:46.840 --> 09:51.000
 when we consider what people say on the internet,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.320
 what people say to each other,

09:52.320 --> 09:54.640
 what people write in scientific papers,

09:54.640 --> 09:55.720
 everything.

09:55.720 --> 10:00.720
 It feels like when COVID has been brought onto this world,

10:05.160 --> 10:09.320
 everything changed in the way people feel about each other.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.760
 It's just the way they communicate with each other.

10:11.760 --> 10:15.800
 I think the level of emotion involved,

10:15.800 --> 10:19.420
 I think in many people, it brought out the worst in them.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.240
 For sometimes short periods of time

10:22.240 --> 10:24.200
 and sometimes it was always therapeutic.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.720
 Like you were waiting to get out like the darkest parts

10:26.720 --> 10:28.480
 of you, just to say,

10:28.480 --> 10:30.240
 if you're angry at something in this world,

10:30.240 --> 10:31.720
 I'm going to say it now.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.440
 And I think that's probably talking to some deep primal

10:35.440 --> 10:40.440
 thing that fear we have for formalities

10:40.800 --> 10:41.800
 of all different kinds.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.960
 And then when that fear is aroused

10:43.960 --> 10:46.000
 and all the deepest emotions,

10:46.000 --> 10:49.880
 it's like a Freudian psychotherapy session,

10:49.880 --> 10:51.240
 but across the world.

10:51.240 --> 10:53.800
 Something that psychologists are gonna have

10:53.800 --> 10:56.480
 a field day with for generation, trying to understand.

10:56.480 --> 10:59.160
 I mean, I think what you say is right,

10:59.160 --> 11:02.520
 but piled on top of that is also this sort of,

11:04.200 --> 11:05.960
 this impetus to empathy,

11:05.960 --> 11:08.640
 to empathize compassion toward others,

11:08.640 --> 11:11.320
 essentially militarized, right?

11:11.320 --> 11:16.320
 So I'm protecting you by some actions.

11:16.520 --> 11:20.280
 And those actions, if I don't do them,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.120
 if you don't do them,

11:21.120 --> 11:24.400
 well, that must mean you hate me.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.400
 It's created this like social tension

11:26.400 --> 11:27.240
 that I've never seen before.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.960
 And we have started, we looked at each other

11:30.960 --> 11:35.640
 as if we were just simply sources of germs

11:35.640 --> 11:37.840
 rather than people to get to know,

11:37.840 --> 11:41.200
 people to enjoy, people to learn from.

11:41.200 --> 11:44.840
 It colored basically almost every human interaction

11:44.840 --> 11:47.200
 for every human on the planet.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.640
 Yeah, the basic common humanity.

11:49.640 --> 11:52.720
 It's like you can wear a mask, you can stand far away,

11:52.720 --> 11:54.720
 but the love you have for each other

11:54.720 --> 11:56.240
 when you're looking to each other's eyes,

11:56.240 --> 11:59.920
 that was dissipating by region too.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.960
 I've experienced having traveled quite a bit

12:01.960 --> 12:03.680
 throughout this time.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.360
 It was really sad, even people that are really close together,

12:08.360 --> 12:11.560
 just the way they stood, the way they looked at each other.

12:11.560 --> 12:14.280
 And it made me feel for a moment

12:15.560 --> 12:17.400
 that the fabric that connects all of us

12:17.400 --> 12:19.960
 is more fragile than I thought.

12:19.960 --> 12:21.280
 I mean, if you walk down the street,

12:21.280 --> 12:23.160
 or if you did this during COVID,

12:23.160 --> 12:25.400
 I'm sure you had this experience where you walk down the street

12:25.400 --> 12:27.680
 if you're not wearing a mask, or even if you are,

12:27.680 --> 12:31.920
 people will jump off the sidewalk that you walked past them

12:31.920 --> 12:35.600
 as if you're poison, even though the data

12:35.600 --> 12:37.880
 are that COVID spreads, you know,

12:37.880 --> 12:41.400
 indifferently outdoors, or if at all, really outdoors.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.440
 But it's not simply biological,

12:43.440 --> 12:45.400
 or in fact, it's a disease phenomenon,

12:45.400 --> 12:46.240
 or epidemiological phenomenon.

12:46.240 --> 12:50.680
 It is a change in the way he was treated to each other.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.800
 I hope temporary.

12:52.800 --> 12:54.800
 I do want to say on the flip side of that,

12:54.800 --> 12:58.200
 so it was mostly in Boston, Massachusetts,

12:58.200 --> 12:59.440
 when the pandemic broke out.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.440
 I think that's where I was, yeah.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.320
 And then I came here to Austin, Texas

13:04.320 --> 13:07.520
 to visit my now good friend, Joe Rogan,

13:07.520 --> 13:10.960
 and he was the first person without pause.

13:10.960 --> 13:13.400
 This wasn't a political statement, this was anything.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.560
 Just walked toward me and gave me a big hug

13:16.560 --> 13:18.280
 and say, it's great to see you.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.360
 And I can't tell you how great it felt

13:20.360 --> 13:22.760
 because I, in that moment, realized the absence

13:22.760 --> 13:24.240
 of that connection back in Boston

13:24.240 --> 13:26.840
 over just a couple of months.

13:26.840 --> 13:30.160
 And we'll talk about it more,

13:30.160 --> 13:34.200
 but it's tragic to think about that distancing,

13:34.200 --> 13:36.880
 that dissolution of common humanity at scale,

13:36.880 --> 13:39.400
 what kind of impact it has on society.

13:39.400 --> 13:43.200
 Just across the board, political division,

13:43.200 --> 13:45.400
 and just in the quiet of your own mind

13:45.400 --> 13:47.560
 and the privacy of your own home, the depression,

13:47.560 --> 13:51.200
 the sadness, the loneliness, at least the suicide,

13:51.200 --> 13:55.800
 and forget suicide, just low key suffering.

13:55.800 --> 13:58.400
 Yeah, no, I think that's the suffering,

13:58.400 --> 14:00.960
 that isolation, we're not meant to live alone.

14:00.960 --> 14:02.400
 We're not meant to live apart from one another.

14:02.400 --> 14:04.440
 I mean, that's, of course, the ideology of lockdown

14:04.440 --> 14:07.920
 is to make people live apart alone, isolated,

14:07.920 --> 14:10.320
 so that we don't spread diseases to each other, right?

14:10.320 --> 14:14.080
 But we're not actually designed as a species to live that way.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.680
 And that, what you're describing,

14:15.680 --> 14:18.080
 I think, if everyone's honest with themselves,

14:18.080 --> 14:21.400
 have felt, especially in places where lockdowns

14:21.400 --> 14:23.920
 have been sort of very militantly enforced,

14:23.920 --> 14:26.400
 has felt deep into their core.

14:26.400 --> 14:30.040
 Well, if I could just return to the question of deaths.

14:30.040 --> 14:31.560
 You said that the data isn't perfect

14:31.560 --> 14:35.440
 because we need these kind of seroprevalence surveys

14:35.440 --> 14:37.920
 to understand how many cases there were

14:37.920 --> 14:39.920
 to determine the rate of deaths.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.880
 And we need to have a strong footing in the number of deaths.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.760
 But if we assume that the number of deaths

14:45.760 --> 14:49.240
 is approximately correct, like what's your sense,

14:49.240 --> 14:51.680
 what kind of statements can we say

14:51.680 --> 14:53.160
 about the deadliness of COVID

14:53.160 --> 14:55.880
 across different demographics?

14:55.880 --> 14:58.800
 Maybe not in a political way or in the current way,

14:58.800 --> 15:03.320
 but when history looks back at this moment of time,

15:03.320 --> 15:05.200
 50 years from now, 100 years from now,

15:05.200 --> 15:09.480
 the way we look at the pandemic 100 years ago,

15:09.480 --> 15:12.480
 what will they say about the deadliness of COVID?

15:12.480 --> 15:14.960
 I think the deadliness of COVID depends on

15:14.960 --> 15:18.440
 not just the virus itself, but who it infects.

15:18.440 --> 15:20.320
 So probably the most important thing about it,

15:20.320 --> 15:24.360
 about the deadliness of COVID is this steep age gradient

15:24.360 --> 15:26.240
 in the mortality rate.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.840
 So according to these seroprevalence studies

15:28.840 --> 15:31.640
 that have been done, now hundreds of them,

15:32.680 --> 15:34.320
 mostly from before vaccination,

15:34.320 --> 15:37.720
 because vaccination also reduces the mortality risk of COVID,

15:37.720 --> 15:39.960
 the seroprevalence studies suggest

15:39.960 --> 15:44.640
 that the risk of death, if you say over the age of 70,

15:44.640 --> 15:49.640
 is very high, you know, 5% if you get COVID.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.960
 If you're under the age of 70, it's lower, 0.05.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.280
 But there's not a single sharp cutoff.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.440
 It's more like, I have a rule of thumb that I use.

15:59.440 --> 16:03.320
 So if you're 50, say, the infection fatality rate

16:03.320 --> 16:07.440
 from COVID is 0.2%, according to the seroprevalence data,

16:07.440 --> 16:11.400
 that means 99.8% survival if you're 50.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.520
 And for every seven years of age above that, double it.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.960
 Every seven years of age below that, have it.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.880
 So a 57 year old would have a 0.4%.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.640
 Mortality, a 64 year old would have a 0.8% and so on.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.600
 And if you have a severe chronic disease like diabetes

16:27.600 --> 16:29.440
 or if you're morbidly obese,

16:29.440 --> 16:32.360
 it's like adding seven years to your life.

16:32.360 --> 16:35.000
 And this is for unvaccinated folks.

16:35.000 --> 16:38.920
 This is unvaccinated before Delta also.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.680
 Are there a lot of people that will be listening to this

16:41.680 --> 16:43.920
 with PhDs at the end of their name

16:43.920 --> 16:47.440
 that would disagree with the 99.8, would you say?

16:47.440 --> 16:49.920
 So I think there's some disagreement over this.

16:49.920 --> 16:52.960
 And the disagreement is about the quality

16:52.960 --> 16:56.240
 of the seroprevalence studies that were conducted.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.880
 So as I said earlier, I was a senior investigator

16:58.880 --> 17:00.600
 in three different seroprevalence studies

17:00.600 --> 17:02.040
 very early in the epidemic.

17:02.040 --> 17:05.120
 I view them as very high quality studies.

17:07.120 --> 17:10.760
 In Santa Clara County, what we did is we used a test kit

17:11.880 --> 17:15.560
 to, that we obtained from someone

17:15.560 --> 17:18.080
 who works in Major League Baseball actually.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.360
 He'd ordered these test kits very early in March, 2020

17:21.360 --> 17:26.000
 that measures, very accurately measures antibody levels,

17:26.000 --> 17:28.040
 antibodies in the bloodstream.

17:28.880 --> 17:31.760
 These test kits were proven by the,

17:31.760 --> 17:36.040
 had a EUA by the emergency use authorization by the FDA

17:36.040 --> 17:37.800
 sort of shortly after we did this.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.280
 And it had a very low false positive rate.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.560
 False positive means if you don't have

17:43.560 --> 17:46.120
 these COVID antibodies in your bloodstream,

17:46.120 --> 17:47.840
 the kit shows up positive anyways.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.480
 That turns out to happen about 0.5% of the time.

17:52.600 --> 17:56.080
 And based on studies, a very large number of studies

17:56.080 --> 18:00.560
 looking at blood from 2018, you try it against this kit

18:00.560 --> 18:03.360
 and 0.5% of the time, 2018,

18:03.360 --> 18:04.560
 there shouldn't be antibodies there.

18:04.560 --> 18:06.720
 So for COVID, if it turns positive,

18:06.720 --> 18:09.000
 it's a false positive, it's 0.5% of the time.

18:10.120 --> 18:13.920
 And then, like a false negative rate, about 10%,

18:13.920 --> 18:16.760
 12%, something like that, I don't remember the exact number.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.960
 But the false positive rates,

18:17.960 --> 18:18.960
 the important thing there, right?

18:18.960 --> 18:22.400
 So you have a population in March, 2020 or April, 2020

18:22.400 --> 18:26.280
 with very low fraction of patients having been exposed

18:26.280 --> 18:28.800
 to COVID, you don't know how much, but low,

18:28.800 --> 18:30.400
 even a small false positive rate

18:30.400 --> 18:33.440
 could end up biasing your study quite a bit.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.000
 But there's a formula to adjust for that.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.520
 You can adjust for the false positive rate,

18:37.520 --> 18:40.160
 false negative rate, we did that adjustment.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.440
 And those studies found in a community population,

18:43.440 --> 18:45.120
 so leaving aside people in nursing homes

18:45.120 --> 18:47.120
 who have a higher death rate from COVID,

18:48.000 --> 18:52.080
 that the death rate was 0.2% in Santa Clara County

18:52.080 --> 18:53.440
 and in LA County.

18:53.440 --> 18:56.080
 Across all these groups in a community,

18:56.080 --> 18:58.320
 community meaning just like regular folks.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.200
 Yeah, so that's actually a real important question too.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.160
 So the Santa Clara study,

19:02.160 --> 19:04.400
 we did this Facebook sampling scheme,

19:05.800 --> 19:08.040
 which is, I mean, not the ideal thing,

19:08.040 --> 19:11.240
 but it was very difficult to get a random sample

19:11.240 --> 19:16.240
 during lockdown, where we put out an ad on Facebook

19:17.080 --> 19:19.880
 soliciting people to volunteer for the study,

19:19.880 --> 19:22.240
 a randomly selected set of people.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.120
 We were hoping to get a random selection of people

19:24.120 --> 19:26.320
 from Santa Clara County, but it tended to,

19:26.320 --> 19:27.560
 the people who tended to volunteer

19:27.560 --> 19:28.920
 were from the richer parts of the county.

19:28.920 --> 19:30.920
 Like I had Stanford professors

19:30.920 --> 19:32.240
 begging to be in the study

19:32.240 --> 19:34.160
 because they wanted to know their antibody levels.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.200
 So we did some adjustment for that.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.320
 In LA County, we hired a firm

19:38.320 --> 19:42.480
 that had a preexisting representative sample of LA County.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.000
 So, but it didn't include nursing homes,

19:46.000 --> 19:47.600
 it didn't include people in jail,

19:47.600 --> 19:49.720
 things like that, didn't include the homeless populations.

19:49.720 --> 19:53.840
 So it's representative of a community dwelling population,

19:53.840 --> 19:54.920
 both of those.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.880
 And there we found that both in LA County

19:57.880 --> 20:00.320
 and Santa Clara County in April, 2020,

20:00.320 --> 20:04.200
 something like 40 to 50 times more infections

20:04.200 --> 20:06.720
 than cases in both places.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.160
 So for every case that had been reported

20:09.160 --> 20:10.880
 to the public health authorities,

20:10.880 --> 20:15.280
 we found 40 or 50 other infections,

20:15.280 --> 20:17.880
 people with antibodies in their blood

20:17.880 --> 20:20.200
 that suggested that they'd had COVID and recovered.

20:20.200 --> 20:22.520
 So people were not reporting or severe,

20:22.520 --> 20:24.960
 at least in those days, under reporting?

20:24.960 --> 20:26.880
 Yeah, I mean, there was, you know, there's testing problem.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.000
 I mean, there weren't so many tests available.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.200
 People didn't know.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.720
 A lot of them, we asked a set of questions

20:32.720 --> 20:34.840
 about the symptoms they'd faced.

20:34.840 --> 20:36.320
 And most of them said they faced no symptoms,

20:36.320 --> 20:39.360
 or the most, 30, 40% of them said they faced no symptoms.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.200
 I mean, even in these days,

20:42.200 --> 20:44.280
 how many people report that they get COVID

20:44.280 --> 20:45.120
 when they get COVID?

20:45.120 --> 20:49.120
 Okay, I'll have those numbers that point to 2%.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.400
 Has that approximately held up over time?

20:51.400 --> 20:53.400
 That is, so if Professor Johnny Inides,

20:53.400 --> 20:55.200
 who's a colleague of mine at Stanford,

20:55.200 --> 20:56.920
 who's a world expert in meta analysis,

20:56.920 --> 21:00.120
 one of the most cited scientists on earth, I think,

21:00.120 --> 21:04.800
 at least living, he did a meta analysis of now 100 or more

21:04.800 --> 21:06.520
 of these seroprevalence studies.

21:08.040 --> 21:11.600
 And what he found was that that 0.2%

21:11.600 --> 21:13.840
 is roughly the worldwide number.

21:13.840 --> 21:17.400
 I mean, in fact, I think he cites us lower number, 0.15%,

21:17.400 --> 21:20.640
 as the median infection fatality rate worldwide.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.920
 So we did these studies,

21:21.920 --> 21:25.240
 and it generated an enormous amount of blowback

21:25.240 --> 21:26.720
 by people who thought that the infection

21:26.720 --> 21:28.480
 of the high rate is much higher.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.440
 And there's some controversy over the quality

21:30.440 --> 21:32.400
 of some of the other studies that are done.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.520
 And so there are some people who look at this same literature

21:35.520 --> 21:37.840
 and say, well, the lower quality studies

21:37.840 --> 21:40.680
 tend to have lower IFRs, the higher quality studies.

21:40.680 --> 21:41.520
 IFR?

21:41.520 --> 21:42.520
 Oh, infection fatality, right?

21:42.520 --> 21:43.400
 I apologize.

21:43.400 --> 21:45.760
 I do this in lectures too, I apologize.

21:45.760 --> 21:47.640
 And I'm going to rudely interrupt you

21:48.640 --> 21:51.720
 and ask for the basics sometimes if it's okay.

21:51.720 --> 21:52.560
 No, of course.

21:52.560 --> 21:54.480
 So these higher quality studies,

21:54.480 --> 21:56.680
 they say are pretending to produce higher,

21:56.680 --> 21:58.480
 but the problem is that

21:58.480 --> 22:00.920
 if you want a global infection fatality rate,

22:00.920 --> 22:04.440
 you need to get seroprevalence studies from everywhere,

22:04.440 --> 22:06.160
 even in places that don't necessarily have

22:06.160 --> 22:07.600
 the infrastructure set up to produce

22:07.600 --> 22:09.680
 very, very high quality studies.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.000
 And in poor places in the world,

22:14.800 --> 22:15.920
 places like Africa,

22:15.920 --> 22:18.320
 the infection fatality rate is incredibly low.

22:18.320 --> 22:23.320
 And in some richer places like New York City,

22:23.560 --> 22:25.840
 the infection fatality rate is much higher.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.800
 There's a range of IFRs in a single number.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.640
 This sometimes surprises people

22:32.640 --> 22:34.160
 because they think, well, it's a virus,

22:34.160 --> 22:36.800
 it should have the same properties no matter where it goes.

22:36.800 --> 22:41.800
 But the virus kills or infects or hurts

22:42.160 --> 22:44.760
 in interaction with the host.

22:44.760 --> 22:47.840
 And the properties of both the host and the virus

22:47.840 --> 22:50.160
 combine to produce the outcome.

22:50.160 --> 22:52.960
 But you also mentioned the environment too?

22:52.960 --> 22:55.600
 Well, I'm thinking mainly just about the person.

22:55.600 --> 22:56.640
 Like if I'm gonna think about it,

22:56.640 --> 22:58.840
 like the most simplest way to think about it is age.

22:58.840 --> 23:01.240
 Age is the single most important risk factor.

23:01.240 --> 23:06.000
 So older places are going to have a higher IFR

23:06.000 --> 23:07.040
 than younger places.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.160
 Africa, 3% of Africa is over 65.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.640
 So in some sense, it's not surprising

23:12.640 --> 23:15.400
 that they have a low infection fatality rate.

23:15.400 --> 23:17.320
 So that's one way you would explain the difference

23:17.320 --> 23:18.960
 between Africa and New York City

23:18.960 --> 23:22.080
 in terms of the fatality rate is the age, the average age.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.840
 Yeah, and especially in the early days of the epidemic

23:24.840 --> 23:29.840
 in New York City, the older populations living

23:30.240 --> 23:33.400
 in nursing homes were differentially infected

23:33.400 --> 23:35.920
 based on because of policies that were adopted, right?

23:35.920 --> 23:39.120
 To send COVID infected patients back to nursing homes

23:39.120 --> 23:40.360
 to keep hospitals empty.

23:40.360 --> 23:42.920
 What do you mean by differentially infected?

23:42.920 --> 23:45.880
 The policy that you adopt determines

23:45.880 --> 23:47.400
 who is most exposed.

23:47.400 --> 23:48.240
 Right.

23:48.240 --> 23:49.080
 Okay.

23:49.080 --> 23:49.920
 So that's what I mean by differentially.

23:49.920 --> 23:52.840
 The policy, it's the person that matters.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.160
 I mean, it's not like the virus just kind of doesn't care.

23:56.160 --> 23:59.400
 I mean, the policy determines the nature of the interaction.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.680
 There's also, I mean, there is some contribution

24:01.680 --> 24:04.920
 from the environment, different regions

24:04.920 --> 24:08.320
 of different proximity, maybe of people interacting

24:08.320 --> 24:10.160
 or the dynamics of the way they interact.

24:10.160 --> 24:11.000
 The head of your head.

24:11.000 --> 24:12.760
 I'm like, if you have situations

24:12.760 --> 24:17.280
 where there's lots of intergenerational interactions,

24:17.280 --> 24:19.520
 then you have a very different risk profile

24:19.520 --> 24:22.960
 than if you have societies where generations

24:22.960 --> 24:24.680
 are more separated from one another.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.680
 Okay, so let me just finish, we're real fast about this.

24:27.680 --> 24:32.680
 So you had in New York, you have a population

24:32.840 --> 24:34.240
 that was infected in the early days

24:34.240 --> 24:37.040
 that was very likely going to die,

24:37.040 --> 24:40.160
 had a much higher likelihood of dying if infected.

24:40.160 --> 24:43.240
 And so New York City had a higher IFR,

24:43.240 --> 24:48.240
 especially in the early days than Africa has had.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.920
 The other thing is treatment, right?

24:50.920 --> 24:52.960
 So the treatments that we adopted

24:52.960 --> 24:54.040
 in the early days of the epidemic,

24:54.040 --> 24:57.560
 I think actually may have exacerbated the risk of death.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.080
 Which treatments?

25:00.080 --> 25:02.600
 So like using ventilators, like the over reliance

25:02.600 --> 25:04.600
 on ventilators is what I'm primarily thinking of,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.520
 but I can think of other things.

25:06.520 --> 25:09.600
 But that also we've learned over time

25:09.600 --> 25:12.720
 how better to manage patients with the disease.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.720
 So you have all those things combined.

25:14.720 --> 25:18.120
 So that's where the controversy over this number is.

25:18.120 --> 25:23.120
 I mean, New York City also is a central hub

25:23.680 --> 25:28.680
 for those who tweet and those who write powerful stories

25:29.240 --> 25:31.760
 and narratives in article form.

25:31.760 --> 25:34.720
 And I remember there was quite dramatic stories

25:34.720 --> 25:36.520
 about sort of doctors in the hospitals

25:36.520 --> 25:37.400
 and these kinds of things.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.520
 I mean, there's very serious, very dramatic,

25:40.520 --> 25:44.840
 very tragic deaths going on always in hospitals.

25:44.840 --> 25:49.840
 Those stories, loved ones losing each other on a death bed,

25:50.880 --> 25:52.320
 that's always tragic.

25:52.320 --> 25:54.680
 And you can always write a hell of a good story

25:54.680 --> 25:58.200
 about that, and you should, about the loss of loved ones.

25:58.200 --> 26:01.840
 But they were doing it pretty well, I would say,

26:01.840 --> 26:04.040
 over this kind of dramatic deaths.

26:04.040 --> 26:09.040
 And so in response to that, it's very unpleasant to hear,

26:09.240 --> 26:13.080
 even to consider the possibility that the death rate

26:13.080 --> 26:17.520
 is not as high as you might feel.

26:17.520 --> 26:20.600
 Yeah, I was surprised by the reaction,

26:20.600 --> 26:23.840
 both by regular people and also the scientific community

26:23.840 --> 26:25.680
 in response to those studies,

26:25.680 --> 26:28.240
 those early studies in April of 2020.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.640
 To me, they were studies.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.280
 I mean, they're the kinds of, not exactly

26:34.280 --> 26:35.640
 the kinds of work I've worked on all my life,

26:35.640 --> 26:39.760
 but kind of like the kind of, you write a paper

26:39.760 --> 26:42.880
 and you get responses from your fellow scientists

26:42.880 --> 26:45.120
 and you change the paper to improve it,

26:45.120 --> 26:47.280
 you hopefully learn something from it.

26:47.280 --> 26:50.520
 Well, but to push back, it's just a study,

26:50.520 --> 26:53.280
 but there are some studies, and this is kind of interesting

26:53.280 --> 26:57.240
 because I've received similar pushback on other topics.

26:57.240 --> 27:02.240
 There's some studies that if wrong

27:04.400 --> 27:09.400
 might have a wide ranging detrimental effects on society.

27:09.720 --> 27:12.000
 So that's the way they would perceive the studies.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.920
 If you say the death rate is lower

27:13.920 --> 27:16.480
 and you end up, as you often do in science,

27:16.480 --> 27:19.920
 realizing that nope, there was a flaw

27:19.920 --> 27:21.120
 in the way the study was conducted

27:21.120 --> 27:23.880
 or we're just not representative of a broader population,

27:23.880 --> 27:26.040
 and then you realize the death rate is much higher,

27:26.040 --> 27:29.600
 that might be very damaging in people's view.

27:29.600 --> 27:33.520
 So that's probably where the scientific community,

27:33.520 --> 27:36.640
 sort of just steel man the kind of response

27:36.640 --> 27:41.280
 is that's where they felt like there's some findings

27:41.280 --> 27:43.440
 where you better be damn sure

27:43.440 --> 27:45.880
 before you kind of report them.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.400
 Yeah, I mean, we were pretty sure we were right

27:47.400 --> 27:48.520
 and it turns out we were right.

27:48.520 --> 27:53.520
 So like when we, so we released the Santa Clara study

27:53.520 --> 27:56.800
 via this open science process

27:56.800 --> 27:59.240
 and this server called Med Archive,

27:59.240 --> 28:02.240
 it's designed for releasing studies

28:02.240 --> 28:03.880
 have not yet been peer reviewed

28:03.880 --> 28:06.520
 in order to garner comment from the scientists

28:06.520 --> 28:07.600
 before peer review.

28:08.560 --> 28:09.880
 The LA County study,

28:09.880 --> 28:12.400
 we went through the traditional peer review process

28:12.400 --> 28:13.640
 and got it published in the journal

28:13.640 --> 28:16.560
 or medical medical association sometime in like July,

28:16.560 --> 28:19.040
 I think, I forget the date of 2020.

28:19.040 --> 28:22.000
 The Santa Clara study released in April of 2020

28:22.000 --> 28:25.120
 in this sort of working paper archive.

28:25.120 --> 28:28.200
 The reason was that we felt we had an obligation,

28:28.200 --> 28:31.960
 we had a result that was, we thought was quite important

28:31.960 --> 28:35.040
 and we wanted to tell the scientific community about it

28:35.040 --> 28:36.720
 and also tell the world about it.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.120
 And it wasn't, we wanted to get feedback.

28:38.120 --> 28:39.840
 I mean, that's the part of the purpose

28:39.840 --> 28:42.280
 of sending it to these kinds of places.

28:42.280 --> 28:45.480
 I think a lot of the problem is that

28:45.480 --> 28:47.880
 when people think about published science,

28:47.880 --> 28:50.360
 they think of it as automatically true.

28:50.360 --> 28:52.320
 And if it goes through peer review, it's automatically true.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.280
 If it hasn't gone through peer review,

28:53.280 --> 28:54.920
 it's not automatically true.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.520
 And especially in medicine,

28:56.520 --> 28:59.840
 when we're not used to having this access

28:59.840 --> 29:03.360
 to pre peer reviewed work.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.840
 I mean, in economics, actually, that's quite normal.

29:05.840 --> 29:07.920
 You take years to get something published.

29:07.920 --> 29:11.240
 So there's a very active debate over or discussion

29:11.240 --> 29:13.440
 about papers before they're peer reviewed

29:13.440 --> 29:16.240
 in this sort of working paper way.

29:16.240 --> 29:20.440
 Much less normal or much newer in medicine.

29:20.440 --> 29:21.520
 And so I think part of that,

29:21.520 --> 29:26.080
 the perception about what process happens in open science

29:26.080 --> 29:29.360
 when you release a study, that got people confused.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.480
 And you're right, it was a very important result

29:31.480 --> 29:33.800
 because we had just locked the world down

29:33.800 --> 29:38.720
 in middle of March with, I think, catastrophic results.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.960
 And if that study was right, if our study was right,

29:41.960 --> 29:44.040
 that meant we'd made a mistake.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.840
 And not because of the death rate was low,

29:45.840 --> 29:47.840
 that's actually not the key thing there.

29:47.840 --> 29:51.640
 The key thing is that we had adopted these policies,

29:51.640 --> 29:54.280
 these test and trace policies, these policies,

29:54.280 --> 29:57.040
 these lockdown policies aimed at suppressing

29:57.040 --> 30:00.080
 the virus level to close to zero.

30:00.080 --> 30:01.920
 That was essentially the idea.

30:01.920 --> 30:04.840
 If we can just get the virus to go away,

30:04.840 --> 30:07.480
 we won't have to ever worry about it again.

30:07.480 --> 30:10.360
 The main problem with our result, as far as that strategy

30:10.360 --> 30:11.640
 was concerned, wasn't the death rate.

30:11.640 --> 30:14.880
 It was the 40 to 50 times more infections than cases.

30:14.880 --> 30:19.600
 It was the 2.5% or 3% or 4% prevalence rate

30:19.600 --> 30:23.080
 that we identified of the antibodies in the population.

30:23.080 --> 30:25.840
 If that number is right, it's too late.

30:25.840 --> 30:28.160
 The virus is not going to go to zero.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.320
 And no matter how much we test and trace and isolate,

30:30.320 --> 30:32.880
 we're not going to get the viral level down to zero.

30:34.040 --> 30:36.880
 So we're gonna have to let the virus go through

30:36.880 --> 30:39.200
 the entire population in some way or in some way.

30:39.200 --> 30:41.200
 Well, we can talk about that in a bit.

30:41.200 --> 30:42.480
 That's the Great Barrington Declaration.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.280
 You don't have to let the virus go through the population.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.880
 You can shield preferentially.

30:46.920 --> 30:50.080
 The policy we chose was to shield preferentially

30:50.080 --> 30:53.520
 the laptop class, the set of people who could work

30:53.520 --> 30:56.720
 from home without losing their job.

30:56.720 --> 30:59.440
 And we did a very good job at protecting them.

30:59.440 --> 31:04.120
 Well, let me take a small tangent.

31:04.120 --> 31:06.640
 We're gonna jump around in time,

31:06.640 --> 31:09.280
 which I think will be the best way to tell the story.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.600
 So that was the beginning.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.440
 Yeah.

31:11.440 --> 31:13.960
 Actually, can I go back one more thing for that?

31:13.960 --> 31:14.800
 Because that's really important

31:14.800 --> 31:16.560
 and I should have started with this.

31:17.560 --> 31:22.040
 What led me to do those studies was a paper

31:22.040 --> 31:23.760
 that I had remembered seeing

31:23.760 --> 31:26.440
 from the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009.

31:26.440 --> 31:28.360
 This is where I've been much less active

31:28.360 --> 31:29.200
 in writing about that.

31:29.200 --> 31:32.920
 I had written up like a paper or two about that in 2009.

31:34.080 --> 31:38.840
 There was actually the same debate over the mortality rate,

31:38.840 --> 31:41.720
 except it unfolded over the course of three years,

31:41.720 --> 31:43.280
 two or three years.

31:43.280 --> 31:48.040
 The early studies of the mortality rate in H1N1

31:48.040 --> 31:52.280
 counted the number of cases in the denominator,

31:52.280 --> 31:53.720
 kind of the number of deaths in the numerator.

31:53.720 --> 31:56.640
 Cases meaning people identified as having H1N1

31:56.640 --> 31:59.480
 showing up the doctor tested to have it.

32:00.520 --> 32:04.080
 And the early estimates of the H1N1 mortality

32:04.080 --> 32:08.020
 were like 4%, 3%, really, really high.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.320
 Over the course of a couple of more years,

32:11.320 --> 32:12.960
 a whole bunch of seroprevalence studies,

32:12.960 --> 32:15.800
 seroprevalence studies of H1N1 flu came out.

32:15.800 --> 32:20.280
 And it turned out that there were 100 or more times

32:20.280 --> 32:22.200
 of people infected per case.

32:23.280 --> 32:27.520
 And so the mortality rate was actually something like 0.02%

32:27.520 --> 32:30.440
 for H1N1, not the three episodes,

32:30.440 --> 32:32.080
 like a hundred full difference.

32:32.080 --> 32:35.240
 So this made you think, okay, it took us a couple

32:35.240 --> 32:37.240
 of two or three years to discover the truth

32:37.240 --> 32:41.800
 behind the actual infections for H1N1.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.920
 And then what's the truth here

32:43.920 --> 32:45.040
 and can we get there faster?

32:45.040 --> 32:47.640
 Yeah, and it spreads in a similar way

32:47.640 --> 32:49.160
 as the H1N1 flu did.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.320
 I mean, it spreads via solidization via,

32:52.320 --> 32:55.480
 so person to person breathing, kind of contact up.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.160
 It may be some by foam ice,

32:57.160 --> 32:59.240
 but seems like that's less likely now.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.740
 In any case, it seemed really important to me

33:01.740 --> 33:04.000
 to speed up the process of having

33:04.000 --> 33:07.240
 those seroprevalence studies so that we can better understand

33:07.240 --> 33:12.240
 who was at risk and what the right strategy ought to be.

33:12.280 --> 33:17.280
 This might be a good place to kind of compare influenza,

33:17.320 --> 33:21.000
 the flu and COVID in the context of the discussion

33:21.000 --> 33:24.400
 we just had, which is how deadly is COVID?

33:24.400 --> 33:26.800
 So you mentioned COVID is a very particular kind

33:26.800 --> 33:31.800
 of steepness where the X axis is age.

33:32.160 --> 33:36.280
 So in that context, could you maybe compare influenza

33:36.280 --> 33:41.280
 and COVID because a lot of people outside of the folks

33:41.520 --> 33:45.120
 who suggest that the lizards who run the world

33:45.120 --> 33:48.440
 have completely fabricated and invented COVID,

33:48.440 --> 33:51.880
 outside of those folks, kind of the natural process

33:51.880 --> 33:54.640
 by which you dismiss the threat of COVID is say,

33:54.640 --> 33:55.880
 what's just like the flu?

33:55.880 --> 33:58.760
 The flu is a very serious thing actually.

33:58.760 --> 34:03.600
 So in that comparison, where does COVID stand?

34:03.600 --> 34:04.960
 Yeah, the flu is a very serious thing.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.960
 It kills 50, 60,000 people a year,

34:07.960 --> 34:08.880
 something I found that order,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.360
 depending on the particular strain that goes around.

34:11.360 --> 34:12.760
 That's in the United States.

34:12.760 --> 34:15.840
 The primary difference to me, there's lots of differences,

34:15.840 --> 34:17.360
 but one of the most salient differences

34:17.360 --> 34:20.120
 is the age gradient and mortality risk for the flu.

34:21.420 --> 34:26.420
 So the flu is more deadly for two children than COVID is.

34:26.680 --> 34:29.320
 There's no controversy about that.

34:29.320 --> 34:34.320
 Children, thank God, have much less severe reactions

34:35.760 --> 34:39.960
 to COVID infection than due to flu infections.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.880
 And rate of fatalities and stuff like that.

34:41.880 --> 34:42.840
 Rate of fatality, all of that.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.520
 I think you mentioned, I mean, it's interesting

34:45.520 --> 34:46.960
 to maybe also comment on,

34:46.960 --> 34:48.800
 I think in another conversation you mentioned,

34:48.800 --> 34:53.800
 there's a U shape to the flu curve.

34:54.480 --> 34:56.920
 So meaning like, there's actually quite a large number

34:56.920 --> 34:59.200
 of kids that die from flu.

34:59.200 --> 35:00.040
 Yeah.

35:00.040 --> 35:04.160
 I mean, the 1918 flu, the H1N1 flu that the Spanish flu

35:04.160 --> 35:08.120
 in the U.S. killed millions of younger people.

35:09.480 --> 35:12.360
 And that is not the case with COVID.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.840
 More than, I'm gonna get the number wrong,

35:16.840 --> 35:19.280
 but something like 70, 80% of the deaths

35:19.280 --> 35:21.440
 are people over the age of 60.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.960
 Well, we've talking about the fear the whole time, really.

35:24.960 --> 35:27.960
 But my interaction with folks,

35:27.960 --> 35:30.280
 now I wanna have a family, I wanna have kids,

35:30.280 --> 35:32.840
 but I don't have that real first hand experience.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.880
 But my interaction with folks is at the core of fear

35:35.880 --> 35:39.920
 that folks had is for their children.

35:39.920 --> 35:44.920
 Like that somehow, I don't wanna get infected

35:46.080 --> 35:47.880
 because of the kids.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.760
 Cause God forbid something happens to the kids.

35:50.760 --> 35:54.520
 And I think that, obviously that makes a lot of sense,

35:54.520 --> 35:56.880
 this kind of, the kids come first,

35:56.880 --> 35:58.680
 no matter what, that's their own priority.

35:58.680 --> 36:02.000
 But for this particular virus,

36:02.000 --> 36:05.880
 that reasoning was not grounded in data, it seems like,

36:05.880 --> 36:08.600
 or that emotion and feeling was not grounded in data.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.440
 It wasn't.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.440
 But at the same time,

36:10.440 --> 36:13.520
 this is way more deadly than the flu just overall,

36:13.520 --> 36:15.520
 and especially to older people.

36:15.520 --> 36:16.520
 Yes.

36:16.520 --> 36:17.360
 Right, so.

36:17.360 --> 36:21.160
 The numbers, when the stories all said and done,

36:21.160 --> 36:24.080
 COVID would take many more lives.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.040
 Yeah.

36:25.040 --> 36:27.360
 So, I mean, point two is, sounds like a small number,

36:27.360 --> 36:29.640
 but it's not a small number worldwide.

36:29.640 --> 36:32.600
 What do you think that number will be by the,

36:32.600 --> 36:35.440
 that's not like me, but would we cross,

36:35.440 --> 36:37.240
 I think it's in the United States,

36:37.240 --> 36:40.680
 it's the way the deaths that currently report

36:40.680 --> 36:42.720
 is like 800,000, something like that.

36:42.720 --> 36:44.480
 Do you think we'll cross a million?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.320
 Seems likely.

36:46.320 --> 36:47.160
 Yeah.

36:47.160 --> 36:49.080
 Do you think it's something that might continue

36:49.080 --> 36:50.360
 with different variants?

36:50.360 --> 36:51.200
 What?

36:51.200 --> 36:53.520
 Well, I think, so we can talk about the end state of COVID.

36:53.520 --> 36:56.040
 The end state of COVID is it's here forever.

36:56.040 --> 37:01.040
 I think that there is good evidence of immunity

37:01.480 --> 37:05.720
 after infection, such that you're protected

37:05.720 --> 37:07.400
 both against reinfection,

37:07.400 --> 37:11.360
 and also against severe disease upon reinfection.

37:11.360 --> 37:12.920
 So the second time you get it,

37:12.920 --> 37:13.960
 it's not true for everyone,

37:13.960 --> 37:15.680
 for many people the second time you get it

37:15.680 --> 37:18.680
 will be milder, much milder than the first time you get it.

37:18.680 --> 37:22.760
 With the long, like that lasts for a long time.

37:22.760 --> 37:23.600
 Yeah.

37:23.600 --> 37:26.120
 So just their studies that follow course

37:26.120 --> 37:28.360
 of people who were infected for a year.

37:28.360 --> 37:30.440
 And the reinfection rate is something like

37:30.440 --> 37:32.760
 somewhere between 0.3 and 1%.

37:32.760 --> 37:33.840
 Yeah.

37:33.840 --> 37:36.280
 And like a pretty fantastic study out of Italy

37:36.280 --> 37:38.800
 has found that there's one in Sweden, I think.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.840
 There's a few studies that found this similar things.

37:41.840 --> 37:46.840
 And the reinfections tend to produce much milder disease,

37:46.960 --> 37:48.440
 much less likely to end up in the hospital,

37:48.440 --> 37:50.120
 much less likely to die.

37:50.120 --> 37:52.560
 So what the end state of COVID is,

37:52.560 --> 37:54.600
 it's circulating the population forever

37:54.600 --> 37:56.520
 and you get it multiple times.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.680
 Yeah.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.000
 And then there's, I think studies and discussions

38:01.000 --> 38:04.320
 like the best protection would be to get it

38:04.320 --> 38:06.240
 and then also to get vaccinated.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.760
 And then a lot of people push back against that

38:08.760 --> 38:10.720
 for the obvious reasons from both sides

38:10.720 --> 38:13.080
 because somehow this course has become

38:13.080 --> 38:14.840
 less scientific and more political.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.560
 Well, I think you wanna,

38:16.560 --> 38:18.120
 the first time you meet it

38:18.120 --> 38:20.320
 is gonna be the most deadly for you.

38:20.320 --> 38:21.560
 And so the first time you meet it

38:21.560 --> 38:22.800
 is just wise to be vaccinated.

38:22.800 --> 38:25.440
 The vaccine reduces severe disease.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.280
 Yeah.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.720
 Well, we'll talk about the vaccine

38:27.720 --> 38:30.120
 because I wanna make sure I address it carefully

38:30.120 --> 38:32.760
 and properly in full context.

38:35.040 --> 38:38.080
 But yes, sort of to add to the context,

38:38.080 --> 38:40.400
 a lot of the fascinating discussions we're having

38:40.400 --> 38:43.080
 is in the early days of COVID

38:43.080 --> 38:46.480
 and now for people who are unvaccinated.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.120
 That's where the interesting story is.

38:49.120 --> 38:52.760
 And the policy story, the sociological story and so on.

38:52.760 --> 38:55.960
 But let me go to something really fascinating

38:55.960 --> 38:57.960
 just because of the people involved,

38:57.960 --> 38:59.280
 the human beings involved

38:59.280 --> 39:03.040
 and because of how deeply I care about science

39:03.040 --> 39:07.680
 and also kindness, respect and love and human things.

39:07.680 --> 39:12.400
 Francis Collins wrote a letter in October, 2020

39:12.400 --> 39:15.000
 to Anthony Fauci, I think somebody else.

39:15.000 --> 39:20.000
 I have the letter, it's not a letter, email, I apologize.

39:22.600 --> 39:27.600
 Hi, Tony and Cliff, cgbdeclaration.org.

39:29.520 --> 39:32.960
 This proposal, this is the Great Barrington Declaration

39:32.960 --> 39:34.960
 that you're a coauthor on.

39:34.960 --> 39:38.680
 This proposal from the three fringe epidemiologists

39:38.680 --> 39:40.160
 who met with the secretary

39:40.160 --> 39:42.240
 seemed to be getting a lot of attention

39:42.240 --> 39:45.960
 and even a co signature from Nobel Prize winner,

39:45.960 --> 39:48.720
 Mike Levitt at Stanford.

39:48.720 --> 39:52.080
 There needs to be a quick and devastating published

39:52.080 --> 39:54.800
 take down of its premises.

39:54.800 --> 39:58.000
 I don't see anything like that online yet.

39:58.000 --> 39:59.040
 Is it underway?

39:59.040 --> 40:00.480
 Question mark, Francis.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.320
 Francis Collins, director of the NIH,

40:03.320 --> 40:06.160
 somebody I talked to on this podcast recently.

40:06.160 --> 40:09.680
 Okay, a million questions I wanna ask,

40:09.680 --> 40:12.640
 but first, how did that make you feel

40:12.640 --> 40:17.640
 when you first saw this email come to light?

40:18.320 --> 40:20.960
 Which when did it come to light?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.920
 This week, actually, I think, or last week.

40:22.920 --> 40:26.400
 Okay, so this is because of freedom of information.

40:26.400 --> 40:30.240
 Which by the way, sort of maybe,

40:30.240 --> 40:32.160
 because I do wanna add positive stuff

40:32.160 --> 40:34.120
 on the side of Francis here.

40:36.280 --> 40:37.880
 Boy, when I see stuff like that,

40:37.880 --> 40:41.080
 I wonder if all my emails leaked.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.040
 How much embarrassing stuff.

40:43.040 --> 40:45.160
 Like, I think I'm a good person,

40:45.160 --> 40:49.360
 but I don't, I haven't read my old emails.

40:49.360 --> 40:53.320
 Maybe I'm pretty sure sometimes I could be an asshole.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.040
 Well, I mean, look, he's a Christian

40:55.040 --> 40:57.080
 and I'm a Christian, I'm supposed to forgive, right?

40:57.080 --> 41:00.960
 I mean, I think he was looking at this.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.600
 Gee, a Great Barrington Declaration

41:02.600 --> 41:05.320
 as a political problem to be solved

41:05.320 --> 41:08.560
 as opposed to a serious alternative approach

41:08.560 --> 41:10.040
 to the epidemic.

41:10.040 --> 41:12.320
 So maybe we'll talk about it in more detail,

41:12.320 --> 41:15.040
 but just in case people are not familiar,

41:15.040 --> 41:18.920
 Great Barrington Declaration was a document

41:18.920 --> 41:22.320
 that you coauthored that basically argues

41:22.320 --> 41:26.240
 against this idea of lockdown as a solution to COVID

41:26.240 --> 41:29.440
 and you propose another solution that we'll talk about.

41:29.440 --> 41:34.440
 But the point is, it's not that dramatic of a document.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.440
 It is just a document that criticizes

41:36.440 --> 41:38.640
 one policy solution that was proposed.

41:38.640 --> 41:40.760
 But it was the policy solution that had been put forward

41:40.760 --> 41:44.440
 by Dr. Collins and by Tony Fauci

41:44.440 --> 41:46.640
 and a few other scientists.

41:46.640 --> 41:49.200
 I mean, I think a relatively small number of scientists

41:49.200 --> 41:53.880
 and epidemiologists in charge of the advice

41:53.880 --> 41:55.320
 given to governments worldwide.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.640
 And it was a challenge to that policy

41:59.640 --> 42:02.560
 that said that, look, there is an alternate path

42:02.560 --> 42:05.680
 that the path we've chosen, this path of lockdown

42:05.680 --> 42:08.640
 with an aim to suppress the virus to zero effectively,

42:08.640 --> 42:12.000
 I mean, that was unstated, cannot work

42:12.000 --> 42:14.240
 and is causing catastrophic harm

42:14.240 --> 42:17.440
 to large numbers of poor and vulnerable people worldwide.

42:18.920 --> 42:23.120
 We put this out in October 4th, I think, of 2020.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.360
 And it went viral.

42:25.360 --> 42:26.760
 I mean, I've never actually been involved

42:26.760 --> 42:28.560
 with anything like this,

42:28.560 --> 42:31.240
 where I just put the document on the web

42:31.240 --> 42:34.000
 and tens of thousands of doctors signed on,

42:34.000 --> 42:36.880
 hundreds of thousands of regular people signed on.

42:36.880 --> 42:39.880
 It really struck a chord of people,

42:39.880 --> 42:41.600
 because I think even by October of 2020,

42:41.600 --> 42:44.840
 people had this sense that there was something really wrong

42:44.840 --> 42:46.800
 with the COVID policy that we've been following.

42:47.880 --> 42:51.800
 And they were looking for reasonable people

42:51.800 --> 42:52.640
 to give an alternative.

42:52.640 --> 42:55.800
 I mean, we're not arguing that COVID isn't a serious thing.

42:55.800 --> 42:57.280
 I mean, it is a very serious thing.

42:57.280 --> 43:01.080
 This is why we had a policy that aimed at addressing it.

43:01.080 --> 43:05.720
 But we were saying that the policy we're following

43:05.720 --> 43:06.960
 is not the right one.

43:08.240 --> 43:12.920
 So how does a democratic government deal with that challenge?

43:13.960 --> 43:15.920
 So to me, that, you asked me how I felt.

43:15.920 --> 43:18.840
 I was actually, frankly, I suspected

43:18.840 --> 43:20.920
 there'd been some email exchanges like that,

43:20.920 --> 43:22.960
 not necessarily from Francis Collins,

43:22.960 --> 43:26.000
 around the government, around this time.

43:26.000 --> 43:29.080
 I mean, I felt the full brunt of a propaganda campaign,

43:29.080 --> 43:32.440
 almost immediately after we published it,

43:32.440 --> 43:35.080
 where newspapers mischaracterized it

43:35.080 --> 43:38.000
 in the same way over and over and over again.

43:39.280 --> 43:44.120
 And sought to characterize me as sort of a marginal,

43:44.120 --> 43:45.800
 fringe figure or whatnot.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.600
 And Sunetra Gupta, Martin Kuldor,

43:47.600 --> 43:50.360
 for the tens of thousands of other people that signed it.

43:50.360 --> 43:53.560
 I felt the brunt of that all year long.

43:53.560 --> 43:56.240
 So to see this in black and white,

43:56.240 --> 43:59.280
 in the handwriting, essentially, I mean,

43:59.280 --> 44:01.040
 the metaphorical handwriting of Francis Collins

44:01.040 --> 44:02.320
 was actually, frankly, disappointment,

44:02.320 --> 44:05.320
 because I've looked up to him for years.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.360
 Yeah, I've looked up to him as well.

44:09.600 --> 44:12.160
 I mean, I look for the best in people

44:12.160 --> 44:15.320
 and I still look up to him.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.280
 What troubles me, several things.

44:19.560 --> 44:22.920
 The reason I said about the asshole emails

44:22.920 --> 44:27.920
 I sent late at night is I can understand this email.

44:29.920 --> 44:33.320
 It's fear, it's panic, not being sure.

44:34.160 --> 44:37.480
 The fringe, three fringe epidemiologists.

44:37.480 --> 44:40.560
 Plus Mike Levitt, who won a Nobel Prize, I mean.

44:40.560 --> 44:45.440
 But using fringe, maybe in my private thoughts,

44:45.440 --> 44:47.960
 I have said things like that about others,

44:47.960 --> 44:50.400
 like a little bit too unkind.

44:50.400 --> 44:52.360
 Like you don't really mean it.

44:52.360 --> 44:56.160
 Now, add to that, he recently, this week,

44:56.160 --> 45:00.320
 whatever, doubled down on the fringe.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.520
 This is really troubling to me.

45:02.520 --> 45:05.000
 That, like, I can excuse the email,

45:05.000 --> 45:10.000
 but the arrogance there, that Francis, honestly,

45:10.000 --> 45:12.760
 I mean, broke my heart a little bit there.

45:12.760 --> 45:16.160
 This was an opportunity to, like, especially at this stage,

45:16.160 --> 45:18.920
 to say, just like I told him,

45:18.920 --> 45:23.720
 to say I was wrong to use those words in that email.

45:23.720 --> 45:27.360
 I was wrong to not be open to ideas.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.960
 I still believe that this is not, like,

45:29.960 --> 45:33.720
 say, like, actually argue with the policy,

45:33.720 --> 45:36.240
 with the policy of the proposed solution.

45:36.240 --> 45:40.880
 Also, the devastating, published,

45:40.880 --> 45:45.880
 take devastating takedown, devastating takedown.

45:45.880 --> 45:50.880
 As you say, somebody who's sitting on billions of dollars

45:51.400 --> 45:54.680
 that they're giving to scientists,

45:54.680 --> 45:58.120
 some of whom are often not their best human beings

45:58.120 --> 46:00.680
 because they're fighting with each other over money.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.480
 Not being cognizant of the fact

46:02.480 --> 46:06.640
 that you're challenging the integrity.

46:06.640 --> 46:08.840
 You're corrupting the integrity of scientists

46:08.840 --> 46:10.840
 by allocating the money.

46:10.840 --> 46:13.480
 You're now playing with that,

46:13.480 --> 46:15.960
 by saying devastating takedown.

46:15.960 --> 46:19.600
 Where do you think the published takedown will come from?

46:19.600 --> 46:21.560
 It will come from those scientists

46:21.560 --> 46:23.320
 to whom you're giving money.

46:23.320 --> 46:25.400
 What kind of example would they give

46:25.400 --> 46:28.760
 to the academic community that thrives on freedom?

46:28.760 --> 46:33.760
 Like, this is, I believe Francis Collins is a great man.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.680
 One of the things I was troubled by

46:36.680 --> 46:38.920
 is the negative response to him

46:38.920 --> 46:40.800
 from people that don't understand

46:40.800 --> 46:44.040
 the positive impact that NIH has had on society,

46:44.040 --> 46:45.840
 how many people has helped.

46:45.840 --> 46:50.000
 But this is exactly the, so he's not just a scientist.

46:50.000 --> 46:53.440
 He's not just a bureaucrat who distributes money.

46:53.440 --> 46:55.720
 He's also a scientific leader

46:55.720 --> 46:58.760
 that in difficult times we live in,

46:58.760 --> 47:01.360
 is supposed to inspire us with trust,

47:01.360 --> 47:04.880
 with love, with the freedom of thought.

47:04.880 --> 47:08.680
 He's supposed to, you know those fringe epidemiologists?

47:08.680 --> 47:10.880
 Those are the heroes of science.

47:10.880 --> 47:13.400
 When you look at the long arc of history,

47:13.400 --> 47:15.560
 we love those people.

47:15.560 --> 47:18.400
 We love ideas, even when they get proven wrong.

47:18.400 --> 47:20.240
 That's what always attracted me to science.

47:20.240 --> 47:23.760
 Like somebody, the lone voice saying,

47:23.760 --> 47:26.960
 oh no, the moon of Jupiter does move.

47:28.320 --> 47:30.440
 I mean, you know, but the funny thing is,

47:30.440 --> 47:32.760
 you know, Galileo is saying something truly revolutionary.

47:32.760 --> 47:34.920
 We were saying that what we proposed

47:34.920 --> 47:35.880
 in the great branch of declaration

47:35.880 --> 47:38.920
 was actually just the old pandemic plan.

47:38.920 --> 47:42.160
 It wasn't anything really fundamentally novel.

47:43.160 --> 47:46.360
 In fact, there were plans like this

47:46.360 --> 47:49.720
 that lockdown scientists had written

47:49.720 --> 47:52.720
 in late February, early March of 2020.

47:52.720 --> 47:54.440
 So we were not saying anything radical.

47:54.440 --> 47:57.160
 We were just calling for a debate effectively

47:57.160 --> 47:59.800
 over the existing lockdown policy.

48:00.920 --> 48:02.640
 And this is a disappointment,

48:02.640 --> 48:04.760
 a really, truly a big disappointment

48:04.760 --> 48:08.400
 because by doing this, you were absolutely right Lex.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.280
 He sent a signal to so many other scientists

48:12.280 --> 48:15.160
 to just stay silent, even if you had reservations.

48:15.160 --> 48:18.360
 Yeah, devastating take down that people,

48:18.360 --> 48:21.280
 you know how many people wrote to me privately,

48:21.280 --> 48:26.280
 like Stanford, MIT, how amazing the conversation

48:26.280 --> 48:30.680
 with Francis Collins was, there's a kind of admiration

48:30.680 --> 48:36.000
 because, okay, how do I put it?

48:36.000 --> 48:38.480
 A lot of people get into science

48:38.480 --> 48:40.520
 because they want to help the world.

48:40.520 --> 48:42.320
 They get excited by the ideas

48:42.320 --> 48:46.280
 and they really are working hard to help

48:46.280 --> 48:48.080
 in whatever the discipline is.

48:48.080 --> 48:50.760
 And then there is sources of funding

48:50.760 --> 48:53.360
 which help you do help at a larger scale.

48:53.360 --> 48:58.280
 So you admire the people that are distributing the money

48:58.280 --> 49:01.360
 because they're often, at least on the surface,

49:01.360 --> 49:02.800
 are really also good people.

49:02.800 --> 49:04.800
 Oftentimes they're great scientists.

49:04.800 --> 49:06.840
 So it's amazing.

49:06.840 --> 49:12.160
 That's why I'm sort of, like sometimes people from outside

49:12.160 --> 49:14.520
 think academia has broken some kind of,

49:14.520 --> 49:16.320
 no, it's a beautiful thing.

49:16.320 --> 49:17.960
 It really is a beautiful thing.

49:17.960 --> 49:19.840
 And that's why it's so deeply heartbreaking

49:19.840 --> 49:26.440
 where this person is, I don't think this is malevolence.

49:26.440 --> 49:31.160
 I think he's just incompetence of communication twice.

49:31.160 --> 49:33.600
 I think there's also arrogance at the bottom of it too.

49:33.600 --> 49:35.800
 Yes, but all of us have arrogance at the bottom.

49:35.800 --> 49:37.960
 Yes, but there's a particular kind of arrogance.

49:37.960 --> 49:40.800
 So here it's of the same kind of arrogance

49:40.800 --> 49:43.240
 that you see when Tony Fauci gets on TV

49:43.240 --> 49:46.560
 and says that if you criticize me,

49:46.560 --> 49:48.440
 you're not simply criticizing a man,

49:48.440 --> 49:51.080
 you're criticizing science itself.

49:51.080 --> 49:55.000
 That is at the heart also of this email.

49:55.000 --> 49:59.440
 The certainty that the policies that they were recommending,

49:59.440 --> 50:01.040
 Collins and Fauci were recommending

50:01.040 --> 50:03.480
 to the president of the United States were right.

50:03.480 --> 50:06.480
 Not just right, but right so far right

50:06.480 --> 50:11.000
 that any challenge whatsoever to it is dangerous.

50:11.000 --> 50:13.680
 And I think that is really the heart of that email.

50:13.680 --> 50:19.800
 It's this idea that my position is unchallengeable.

50:19.800 --> 50:24.520
 Now, to be as charitable as I can be to this,

50:24.520 --> 50:25.760
 I believe they thought that.

50:25.760 --> 50:27.800
 I believe some of them still think that.

50:27.800 --> 50:31.880
 That there was only one true policy possible

50:31.880 --> 50:32.720
 in response to COVID.

50:32.720 --> 50:35.160
 Every other policy was immoral.

50:36.280 --> 50:37.880
 And if you come from that position,

50:37.880 --> 50:39.200
 then you write an email like that.

50:39.200 --> 50:42.640
 You go on TV, you say effectively la science cimois, right?

50:42.640 --> 50:45.520
 I mean, that is what happens when you have

50:45.520 --> 50:47.760
 this sort of unchallengeable arrogance

50:47.760 --> 50:50.080
 that the policy you're following is correct.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.280
 I mean, when we wrote the Great Bank Declaration,

50:52.280 --> 50:55.760
 what I was hoping for was a discussion

50:55.760 --> 50:57.760
 about how to protect the vulnerable.

50:57.760 --> 50:59.400
 I mean, that was the key idea to me

50:59.400 --> 51:01.840
 and the whole thing was better protection

51:01.840 --> 51:04.960
 of the older population who really at really serious risk

51:04.960 --> 51:06.320
 if infected with COVID.

51:06.320 --> 51:08.680
 And we had been doing a very poor job, I thought,

51:08.680 --> 51:11.240
 to date in many places in protecting the vulnerable.

51:12.360 --> 51:16.600
 And what I wanted was a discussion by local public health

51:16.600 --> 51:18.840
 about better methods, better policies

51:18.840 --> 51:20.040
 to protect the vulnerable.

51:20.040 --> 51:25.040
 So when we were met with instead a series

51:26.120 --> 51:28.360
 of essentially propagandist lies about it.

51:28.360 --> 51:31.520
 So for instance, I kept hearing from reporters

51:31.520 --> 51:34.440
 in those days, why do you want to let the virus rip?

51:34.440 --> 51:35.520
 Let it rip, let it rip.

51:35.520 --> 51:38.960
 The words let it rip does not appear

51:38.960 --> 51:41.320
 in the Great Bank Declaration.

51:41.320 --> 51:43.720
 The goal isn't to let the virus rip.

51:43.720 --> 51:46.040
 The goal is to protect the vulnerable,

51:46.040 --> 51:50.360
 to let society go as open schools and do other things

51:50.360 --> 51:52.200
 that function as best it can

51:52.200 --> 51:53.320
 in the midst of a terrible pandemic.

51:53.320 --> 51:56.880
 Yes, but not let the virus rip

51:56.880 --> 51:59.560
 where the most vulnerable are protected.

51:59.560 --> 52:01.200
 The goal was to protect the vulnerable.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.480
 So why let it rip?

52:02.480 --> 52:04.560
 Because it was a propaganda term

52:04.560 --> 52:07.600
 to hit the fear centers of people's brains.

52:07.600 --> 52:09.040
 Oh, these people are immoral.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.680
 They just want to let the virus go through society

52:10.680 --> 52:11.960
 and hurt everybody.

52:11.960 --> 52:14.040
 That was the idea.

52:14.040 --> 52:16.360
 It was a way to preclude a discussion

52:16.360 --> 52:19.960
 and precluded debate about the existing policy.

52:19.960 --> 52:23.720
 So I have this app called Clubhouse.

52:25.200 --> 52:29.440
 I've gone back on it recently to practice Russian,

52:29.440 --> 52:33.080
 unrelated for a few big Russian conversations coming up.

52:33.080 --> 52:34.440
 Anyway, it's a great way to talk

52:34.440 --> 52:35.960
 to regular people in Russian.

52:35.960 --> 52:38.400
 But I also, I was nervous,

52:38.400 --> 52:40.760
 I was preparing for a Pfizer CEO conversation

52:40.760 --> 52:42.520
 and there was a vaccine room.

52:42.520 --> 52:47.520
 And so I joined it and there's a pro science room.

52:48.160 --> 52:50.080
 These are like scientists

52:50.080 --> 52:52.720
 that were calling each other pro science.

52:52.720 --> 52:55.400
 The whole thing was like theater to me.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.200
 I mean, I haven't thoroughly researched

52:57.200 --> 52:58.240
 but looking at the resume,

52:58.240 --> 53:03.240
 they were like pretty solid researchers and doctors

53:04.040 --> 53:09.040
 and they were mocking everybody who was at all.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.840
 I mean, it doesn't matter what they stood for,

53:11.840 --> 53:13.240
 but they were just mocking people

53:13.240 --> 53:15.880
 and the arrogance was overwhelming.

53:15.880 --> 53:17.760
 I had to shut off

53:17.760 --> 53:20.040
 because I couldn't handle the human beings

53:20.040 --> 53:21.440
 can be like this to each other.

53:21.440 --> 53:24.480
 And then I went back just to double check.

53:24.480 --> 53:25.480
 Is this really happening?

53:25.480 --> 53:26.920
 How many people are here?

53:26.920 --> 53:28.440
 Is this theater?

53:28.440 --> 53:31.600
 And then I asked to come on stage on Clubhouse

53:31.600 --> 53:32.720
 to make a couple of comments.

53:32.720 --> 53:34.480
 And then as I opened my mouth,

53:34.480 --> 53:36.240
 I said, thank you so much.

53:36.240 --> 53:37.960
 This is a great room,

53:37.960 --> 53:39.920
 sort of the usual civil politeness,

53:39.920 --> 53:41.720
 all that kind of stuff.

53:41.720 --> 53:46.720
 And I said, I'm worried that the kind of arrogance

53:47.760 --> 53:51.520
 with which things are being discussed here

53:51.520 --> 53:55.400
 will further divide us, not unite us.

53:55.400 --> 54:00.400
 And before I said even the unite us, further divide us,

54:00.440 --> 54:02.280
 I was thrown off stage.

54:02.280 --> 54:04.320
 Now, this isn't where I mentioned platform,

54:04.320 --> 54:09.000
 but like I am like Lex Friedman, MIT,

54:09.000 --> 54:12.800
 also, which is something those people seem to sometimes care

54:12.800 --> 54:15.760
 about the followers and stuff like that.

54:15.760 --> 54:18.200
 Like, did you just do that?

54:18.200 --> 54:21.080
 And then they said, enough of that nonsense.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.760
 Enough of that nonsense.

54:22.760 --> 54:27.400
 They said to me, enough of that nonsense.

54:27.400 --> 54:31.520
 Somebody who is obviously interviewed Francis Collins

54:31.520 --> 54:35.040
 is the Pfizer CEO.

54:35.040 --> 54:37.760
 You're bringing on French epidemiologist also.

54:37.760 --> 54:38.760
 Yeah, exactly.

54:38.760 --> 54:40.760
 But this broke my heart, the arrogance.

54:40.760 --> 54:43.160
 And this is echoes of that arrogance

54:43.160 --> 54:44.520
 is something you see in the email.

54:44.520 --> 54:47.000
 And I really would love to have a million things

54:47.000 --> 54:48.600
 to talk about to try to figure out

54:48.600 --> 54:50.440
 how can we find a path forward?

54:50.440 --> 54:54.280
 I think a lot of the problems we've seen

54:54.280 --> 54:57.080
 in the discussion over COVID,

54:57.080 --> 54:59.120
 especially in the scientific community,

54:59.120 --> 55:02.400
 you know, there's two ways to look at science, I think,

55:02.400 --> 55:05.160
 that have been competing with each other for a while now.

55:05.160 --> 55:08.160
 One way, and this is the way that I view science

55:08.160 --> 55:10.160
 and why I've always found it so attractive,

55:10.160 --> 55:13.160
 is an invitation to a structured discussion

55:13.160 --> 55:18.160
 where the discussion is tempered by evidence, by data,

55:18.160 --> 55:21.160
 by reasoning and logic, right?

55:21.160 --> 55:24.160
 So it's a dialectical process where if I believe A

55:24.160 --> 55:29.160
 and you believe B, well, we talk about it.

55:29.160 --> 55:30.160
 We come up with an experiment

55:30.160 --> 55:32.160
 that distinguishes between the two.

55:32.160 --> 55:34.160
 And while, you know, B turns out to be right,

55:34.160 --> 55:36.160
 I'm all frustrated by buy you dinner,

55:36.160 --> 55:38.160
 and I say, no, no, no, no, no, C.

55:38.160 --> 55:40.160
 And then we go on from there, right?

55:40.160 --> 55:43.160
 That's what science is at its best.

55:43.160 --> 55:46.160
 It's this process of using data in discussion.

55:46.160 --> 55:48.160
 It's a human activity, right?

55:48.160 --> 55:53.160
 To learn, to have the truth unfold itself before us.

55:53.160 --> 55:56.160
 On the other hand, there are,

55:56.160 --> 55:58.160
 there's another way that people have used science

55:58.160 --> 56:03.160
 or thought about science as truth in and of itself, right?

56:03.160 --> 56:07.160
 This like, if it's science, therefore, it's true automatically.

56:07.160 --> 56:10.160
 And there are, you know, what does the science say to do?

56:10.160 --> 56:12.160
 Well, the science never says to do anything.

56:12.160 --> 56:14.160
 The science says, here's what's true.

56:14.160 --> 56:17.160
 And then we have to apply our human values to say,

56:17.160 --> 56:21.160
 okay, well, if we do this, well, this is likely to happen.

56:21.160 --> 56:23.160
 That's what the science says.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.160
 If we do that, then that is likely to happen.

56:25.160 --> 56:27.160
 Well, we'd rather have this than that, right?

56:27.160 --> 56:29.160
 And, but it doesn't, does science doesn't tell us

56:29.160 --> 56:30.160
 that we'd rather have this than that.

56:30.160 --> 56:31.160
 Is there human values that tell us

56:31.160 --> 56:32.160
 that we'd rather have this than that?

56:32.160 --> 56:35.160
 Science plays a role, but it's not the only thing.

56:35.160 --> 56:36.160
 It's not the only role.

56:36.160 --> 56:39.160
 It's like, it helps understand the constraints we face,

56:39.160 --> 56:42.160
 but it doesn't tell us what to do in face of those constraints.

56:42.160 --> 56:45.160
 But underneath it, at the individual level,

56:45.160 --> 56:50.160
 at the institutional level, it seems like arrogance

56:50.160 --> 56:52.160
 is really destructive.

56:52.160 --> 56:55.160
 So the flip side of that, the productive thing is humility.

56:55.160 --> 57:02.160
 So sort of always not being sure that you're right.

57:02.160 --> 57:06.160
 This is actually kind of, Stuart Russell talks about this

57:06.160 --> 57:07.160
 for AI research.

57:07.160 --> 57:10.160
 How do you make sure that AI, super intelligent AI

57:10.160 --> 57:11.160
 doesn't destroy us?

57:11.160 --> 57:15.160
 You built in a sort of module within it

57:15.160 --> 57:18.160
 that it always doubts its actions.

57:18.160 --> 57:21.160
 Like it's not sure, like I know it says

57:21.160 --> 57:24.160
 I'm supposed to destroy all humans, but maybe I'm wrong.

57:24.160 --> 57:27.160
 And that maybe I'm wrong is essential for progress,

57:27.160 --> 57:30.160
 for actually doing in the long arc of history,

57:30.160 --> 57:33.160
 not the perfect thing, but better and better and better and better.

57:33.160 --> 57:37.160
 I mean, the question I have here for you is this,

57:37.160 --> 57:41.160
 this email so clearly captures some, maybe echo,

57:41.160 --> 57:43.160
 but maybe a core to the problem.

57:43.160 --> 57:46.160
 Do you put responsibility of this email,

57:46.160 --> 57:49.160
 of the shortcomings and failures

57:49.160 --> 57:51.160
 on individuals or institutions?

57:51.160 --> 57:54.160
 No, this is an institutional failure, right?

57:54.160 --> 57:58.160
 So the NIH, so I've had two decades of NIH funding,

57:58.160 --> 58:00.160
 I've sat on NIH review panels.

58:00.160 --> 58:03.160
 The purpose of the NIH is what you said earlier, Lex.

58:03.160 --> 58:07.160
 The purpose of the NIH is to support the work of scientists.

58:07.160 --> 58:10.160
 To some extent, it's also to help scientists,

58:10.160 --> 58:13.160
 direct scientists to work on things that are very important

58:13.160 --> 58:16.160
 for public health or for the health of the public.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.160
 So, and the way you do that is you say,

58:18.160 --> 58:22.160
 okay, we're gonna put $50 million on the research

58:22.160 --> 58:24.160
 in Alzheimer's disease this year,

58:24.160 --> 58:27.160
 $70 million on HIV or whatever it is, right?

58:27.160 --> 58:31.160
 And that pot of money then scientists compete with each other

58:31.160 --> 58:35.160
 for the best ideas to use it to address that problem.

58:35.160 --> 58:40.160
 So it's essentially an endeavor to support the work of scientists.

58:40.160 --> 58:44.160
 It is not in and of itself a policy organ.

58:44.160 --> 58:48.160
 It doesn't say what public health policy should be.

58:48.160 --> 58:51.160
 For that, you have the CDC.

58:51.160 --> 58:58.160
 And what happened during the pandemic is that people in the NIH

58:58.160 --> 59:04.160
 were called upon to contribute to public health policymaking.

59:04.160 --> 59:08.160
 And that created the conflict of interest you see in that email, right?

59:08.160 --> 59:13.160
 So now you have the head of the NIH in effect saying

59:13.160 --> 59:17.160
 to all scientists, you must agree with me in the policy

59:17.160 --> 59:23.160
 that I've recommended or else you're a fringe.

59:23.160 --> 59:25.160
 That is a deep conflict of interest.

59:25.160 --> 59:27.160
 It's deep because first, he's conflicted.

59:27.160 --> 59:31.160
 He has this dual role as the head of the NIH supporter

59:31.160 --> 59:35.160
 of scientific funding and then also inappropriately called

59:35.160 --> 59:39.160
 to set or help set pandemic policy.

59:39.160 --> 59:40.160
 That should never have happened.

59:40.160 --> 59:44.160
 There should be a bright line between those two roles.

59:44.160 --> 59:46.160
 Let me ask you about just Francis Collins.

59:46.160 --> 59:49.160
 I don't know if you had a chance to talk to him on the podcast.

59:49.160 --> 59:52.160
 I don't know if you maybe by chance gotten chance to hear a few words.

59:52.160 --> 59:53.160
 I heard some of it.

59:53.160 --> 59:56.160
 Well, I have a kind of a question to that

59:56.160 --> 1:00:02.160
 because a lot of people wrote to me quite negative things about Francis Collins.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:06.160
 And like I said, I still believe he's a great man, a great scientist.

1:00:06.160 --> 1:00:14.160
 One of the things when I talked to him off mic about the vaccine,

1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:20.160
 the excitement he had about when we were recollecting,

1:00:20.160 --> 1:00:26.160
 when they first got an inkling that it's actually going to be possible to get a vaccine.

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:28.160
 He wasn't messaging.

1:00:28.160 --> 1:00:32.160
 Just in the private or of our own conversation, he was really excited.

1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:36.160
 And why was he excited? Because he gets to help a lot of people.

1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:40.160
 This is a man that really wants to help people.

1:00:40.160 --> 1:00:44.160
 And there could be some institutional self delusion, the arrogance,

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:47.160
 all those kinds of things that lead to this kind of email.

1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:51.160
 But ultimately the goal is this will I don't think people quite realize this.

1:00:51.160 --> 1:00:54.160
 The reason you call you a fringe epidemiologist,

1:00:54.160 --> 1:00:58.160
 the reason there needs to be a devastating published takedown.

1:00:58.160 --> 1:01:04.160
 He, I believe, really believes that this could be very dangerous.

1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:09.160
 And it's a lot of burden to carry on his shoulders.

1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:13.160
 Because like you said, in his role where he defines some of the public policy,

1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:18.160
 depending on how he thinks about the world,

1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:22.160
 millions of people could die because of one decision he make.

1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:24.160
 And that's a lot of burden to walk with.

1:01:24.160 --> 1:01:29.160
 Yeah. No, I think that's right. I don't think that he has bad intentions.

1:01:29.160 --> 1:01:34.160
 I think that he was basically put, was put or maybe put himself in a position

1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:42.160
 where this kind of conflict of interest was going to create this kind of reaction.

1:01:42.160 --> 1:01:45.160
 The kind of humility that you're calling for is almost impossible

1:01:45.160 --> 1:01:51.160
 when you have that dual role that you shouldn't have as funder of science

1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:53.160
 and also setter of scientific policy.

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:55.160
 I agree with everything you just said except the last part.

1:01:55.160 --> 1:01:59.160
 The humility is almost impossible.

1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:01.160
 Humility is always difficult.

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:06.160
 I think there's a huge incentive for humility in that position.

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:08.160
 Look at history.

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:14.160
 Great leaders that have humility are popular as hell.

1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:19.160
 So if you like being popular, if you like having impact, legacy,

1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:23.160
 these descendants of Vapes seem to care about legacies,

1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:25.160
 but as they get older in these high positions,

1:02:25.160 --> 1:02:28.160
 I think the incentive for humility is pretty high.

1:02:28.160 --> 1:02:32.160
 The thing is, there's a lot that he has to be proud of in his career.

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:36.160
 The Human Genome Project wouldn't have happened without him.

1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:39.160
 He is a great man and a great scientist,

1:02:39.160 --> 1:02:44.160
 but so it is tragic to me that his career has ended in this particular way.

1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:50.160
 Can I ask you a question about my podcast conversation with him?

1:02:50.160 --> 1:02:54.160
 By way of advice or maybe criticism,

1:02:54.160 --> 1:02:58.160
 there's a lot of people that wrote to me kind words of support

1:02:58.160 --> 1:03:03.160
 and a lot of people that wrote to me respectful, constructive criticism.

1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:08.160
 How would you suggest to have conversations with folks like that?

1:03:08.160 --> 1:03:14.160
 Maybe I have other conversations like this, including I was debating

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:17.160
 whether to talk to Anthony Fauci.

1:03:17.160 --> 1:03:19.160
 He wanted to talk.

1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:22.160
 So what kind of conversation do you have?

1:03:22.160 --> 1:03:24.160
 I'm sorry to take this on a tangent,

1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:29.160
 but almost from an interview perspective of how to inspire humility

1:03:29.160 --> 1:03:31.160
 and inspire trust in science,

1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:34.160
 or maybe give hope that we know what the heck we're doing

1:03:34.160 --> 1:03:36.160
 and we're going to figure this out?

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:40.160
 I've been interviewed by many people.

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:44.160
 I think the style you have really works well, Lex.

1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:48.160
 I don't think you're going to be ever an attack dog

1:03:48.160 --> 1:03:54.160
 trying to go after somebody and force them to admit that they were wrong

1:03:54.160 --> 1:03:56.160
 or whatever about them.

1:03:56.160 --> 1:04:00.160
 I also actually find that form of journalism and podcasting really off putting.

1:04:00.160 --> 1:04:02.160
 It's hard to watch.

1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:04.160
 It's a whole lot of the tangent.

1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:05.160
 Is that actually effective?

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:06.160
 I don't think so.

1:04:06.160 --> 1:04:09.160
 Do you want to ask Hitler?

1:04:09.160 --> 1:04:11.160
 I think about this a lot, actually interviewing Hitler.

1:04:11.160 --> 1:04:15.160
 I've been studying a lot about the rise and fall of the Third Reich.

1:04:15.160 --> 1:04:17.160
 I think about interviewing Stalin.

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:19.160
 I put myself in that mindset.

1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:24.160
 How do you have conversations with people to understand who they are

1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:28.160
 so you can sit there and yell at them,

1:04:28.160 --> 1:04:32.160
 but to understand who they are so that you can inspire a very large number of people

1:04:32.160 --> 1:04:36.160
 to be the best version of themselves and to avoid the mistakes of the past?

1:04:36.160 --> 1:04:41.160
 I believe that everyone that's involved in this debate has good intentions.

1:04:41.160 --> 1:04:44.160
 They're coming at it from their points of view.

1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:48.160
 They have their weaknesses.

1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:51.160
 If you can paint a picture in your questioning,

1:04:51.160 --> 1:04:55.160
 by sympathetic questioning of those strengths and weaknesses

1:04:55.160 --> 1:04:57.160
 and their point of view, you've done a service.

1:04:57.160 --> 1:05:01.160
 That's really all I personally like to see in those kinds of interviews.

1:05:01.160 --> 1:05:06.160
 I don't think a gotcha moment is really the key thing there.

1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:09.160
 The key thing is understanding where they're coming from,

1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:12.160
 understanding their thinking, understanding the constraints they faced

1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:14.160
 and how did they manage them.

1:05:14.160 --> 1:05:16.160
 That's going to provide a much...

1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:19.160
 I mean, for me, that's what I look for when I listen to podcasts like yours,

1:05:19.160 --> 1:05:26.160
 is an understanding of that person and the moment and how they dealt with it.

1:05:26.160 --> 1:05:31.160
 I mean, I guess the hope is to discover in a sympathetic way a flaw

1:05:31.160 --> 1:05:34.160
 in a person's thinking together.

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:37.160
 As opposed to discovering the positive thing together,

1:05:37.160 --> 1:05:39.160
 you discover the thing...

1:05:39.160 --> 1:05:41.160
 Well, I didn't really think about that.

1:05:41.160 --> 1:05:43.160
 That's how science is, right?

1:05:43.160 --> 1:05:46.160
 That's why we find it so attractive.

1:05:46.160 --> 1:05:51.160
 I like it when a student shows me I'm thinking incorrectly.

1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:54.160
 I'm really grateful to that student

1:05:54.160 --> 1:05:57.160
 because now I have an opportunity to change my mind about it

1:05:57.160 --> 1:06:00.160
 and then start thinking even more correctly.

1:06:00.160 --> 1:06:03.160
 There are moments when...

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:08.160
 This is probably a good time to say what I think I got wrong during the pandemic.

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:11.160
 For instance, you said Francis Collins had a moment

1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:16.160
 when he learned that there was quite possible to get a vaccine going.

1:06:16.160 --> 1:06:19.160
 He must have learned that quite early.

1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:22.160
 I didn't learn that early.

1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:24.160
 I didn't know...

1:06:24.160 --> 1:06:28.160
 In March of 2020, in my experience with vaccine development,

1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:32.160
 I thought it would take a decade or more to get a vaccine.

1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:35.160
 That was wrong, right?

1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:40.160
 I was so happy when I started to see the preliminary numbers

1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:46.160
 in the Pfizer trial that strongly suggested it was going to work.

1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:48.160
 Yeah.

1:06:48.160 --> 1:06:51.160
 I mean, like a very few times in my life, I'm so happy to be wrong.

1:06:51.160 --> 1:06:54.160
 And it changes kind of...

1:06:54.160 --> 1:06:58.160
 I think I've heard you mention that a lockdown is still a bad idea

1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:01.160
 unless the vaccine comes out in tomorrow.

1:07:01.160 --> 1:07:05.160
 There's still suffering and economic pain.

1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:13.160
 All kinds of pain can still happen in even just a scale of weeks versus months.

1:07:13.160 --> 1:07:14.160
 Yeah.

1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:16.160
 Well, let's talk about the vaccine.

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:21.160
 What are your thoughts on the safety and efficacy of COVID vaccines at the individual

1:07:21.160 --> 1:07:23.160
 and the societal level?

1:07:23.160 --> 1:07:26.160
 So, for the vaccine safety data,

1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:31.160
 it's actually challenging to convey to the public how this is normally done.

1:07:31.160 --> 1:07:34.160
 Like, normally you would do this in the context of the trial.

1:07:34.160 --> 1:07:38.160
 You'd have a long trial with roughly large numbers of people.

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:40.160
 You'd follow them over a long time.

1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:44.160
 And the trial would give you some indication of the safety of the vaccine.

1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:46.160
 You'd see it.

1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:50.160
 I mean, but the trial, the way it was constructed,

1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:53.160
 when it came out that it was protective against COVID,

1:07:53.160 --> 1:07:56.160
 it was no longer ethical to have a placebo arm.

1:07:56.160 --> 1:08:00.160
 And so that placebo arm was vaccinated, large part of it.

1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:02.160
 And so that meant that from the trial,

1:08:02.160 --> 1:08:09.160
 you were not going to be able to get data on the long term safety profiles of the vaccine.

1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:11.160
 And also the other thing about trials,

1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:14.160
 there's tens of thousands of people enrolled, that's still not enough to get.

1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:18.160
 When you deploy a vaccine at population scale,

1:08:18.160 --> 1:08:22.160
 you're going to see things that weren't in the trial, guaranteed.

1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:25.160
 Populations of people that weren't represented well in the trial

1:08:25.160 --> 1:08:27.160
 are going to be given the vaccine,

1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:32.160
 and then they're going to have things that happen to them that you didn't anticipate.

1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:36.160
 So, I wasn't surprised when people were a little bit skeptical

1:08:36.160 --> 1:08:38.160
 when the trial was done about the safety profile.

1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:42.160
 Just the way, the nature of the thing was going to make it so that it was going to be hard

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:45.160
 to get a complete picture from the trials itself.

1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:49.160
 And the trials showed they were pretty safe and quite effective,

1:08:49.160 --> 1:08:52.160
 preventing both you from getting COVID.

1:08:52.160 --> 1:08:57.160
 I think the main endpoint of the trial itself was symptomatic COVID.

1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:03.160
 So that was, I mean, it was really, to me,

1:09:03.160 --> 1:09:08.160
 about as amazing achievement as anything, organizing a trial of that scale

1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:10.160
 and running it so quickly.

1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:14.160
 And the final results being so surprisingly high.

1:09:14.160 --> 1:09:15.160
 So good, right?

1:09:15.160 --> 1:09:16.160
 Yeah.

1:09:16.160 --> 1:09:22.160
 But the problem then was, normally, it would take a long time.

1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:26.160
 The FDA would tell Pfizer to go back and try it in this subgroup.

1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:28.160
 They'd work more on dosing.

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:31.160
 They do all these kinds of things that kind of didn't,

1:09:31.160 --> 1:09:34.160
 we really didn't have time for in the middle of the pandemic.

1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:40.160
 So you have a basis for approval that it's less full

1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:44.160
 than normally you would have for a population scale vaccine.

1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.160
 But the results were good.

1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:47.160
 The results looked really good.

1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:49.160
 And actually, I should say, for the most part,

1:09:49.160 --> 1:09:52.160
 that's been borne out when we've given the vaccine at scale

1:09:52.160 --> 1:09:55.160
 in terms of protection against severe disease.

1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:56.160
 Yeah.

1:09:56.160 --> 1:10:00.160
 So people who have got the vaccine for a very long time

1:10:00.160 --> 1:10:04.160
 after they've had the full vaccination have had great protection

1:10:04.160 --> 1:10:08.160
 against being hospitalized and dying if they get COVID.

1:10:08.160 --> 1:10:12.160
 Let's separate, because this seems to be,

1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:16.160
 there's critics of both categories, but different.

1:10:16.160 --> 1:10:21.160
 Kids and not older people.

1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:24.160
 Let's say five years old and above or something,

1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:26.160
 or 13 years old and above.

1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:33.160
 So for those, it seems like the reduction of the rate

1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:37.160
 of fatalities and serious illness seems to be something

1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:38.160
 like 10x.

1:10:38.160 --> 1:10:42.160
 I mean, for older people, it is a godsend, this vaccine.

1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:47.160
 It transforms the problem of focus protection

1:10:47.160 --> 1:10:50.160
 from something that's quite challenging, possible,

1:10:50.160 --> 1:10:51.160
 I believe, but quite challenging to something

1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:53.160
 that's much, much more manageable.

1:10:53.160 --> 1:10:56.160
 Because the vaccine in and of itself, when deployed

1:10:56.160 --> 1:10:59.160
 in older populations is a form of focus protection.

1:10:59.160 --> 1:11:00.160
 Yes.

1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:04.160
 By the way, we'll talk about the focus protection in one segment

1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:06.160
 because it's such a brilliant idea for this pandemic,

1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:08.160
 of future pandemics.

1:11:08.160 --> 1:11:11.160
 I thought the sociological, psychological discussion

1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:14.160
 about the letter from Francis Collins is,

1:11:14.160 --> 1:11:17.160
 because it was so recent, it was been so troubling to me.

1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:20.160
 So I'm glad we talked about that first.

1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:27.160
 But so there seems to be the vaccines work to reduce deaths.

1:11:27.160 --> 1:11:28.160
 Yes.

1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:31.160
 And that has especially the most transformative effects

1:11:31.160 --> 1:11:32.160
 for the older folks.

1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:34.160
 So can I let me give you, I've told you one thing

1:11:34.160 --> 1:11:35.160
 that I got wrong in the pandemic.

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:37.160
 Let me tell you the second thing I got wrong for sure

1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:38.160
 in the pandemic.

1:11:38.160 --> 1:11:43.160
 In January of this year, 2021,

1:11:43.160 --> 1:11:48.160
 I thought that the vaccines would stop infection.

1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:49.160
 Yes.

1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:51.160
 It would make it so that you were much less likely

1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:53.160
 to be infected at all.

1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:56.160
 Because the antibodies that were produced by the vaccines

1:11:56.160 --> 1:11:58.160
 looked like they are neutralizing antibodies

1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:03.160
 that would essentially block you from being infected at all.

1:12:03.160 --> 1:12:06.160
 That turned out to be wrong, right?

1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:11.160
 So I think it became clear as data came out from Israel,

1:12:11.160 --> 1:12:13.160
 which vaccinated very early, that they were seeing

1:12:13.160 --> 1:12:17.160
 surges of infection, even in a very highly vaccinated population,

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:21.160
 that the vaccine does not stop infection.

1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:25.160
 So you're a used car salesman and you're selling the vaccine.

1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:28.160
 And the features you thought a vaccine would have,

1:12:28.160 --> 1:12:31.160
 I mean, I have a similar kind of sense when the vaccine came out.

1:12:31.160 --> 1:12:37.160
 Vaccine would reduce, if you somehow were able to get it,

1:12:37.160 --> 1:12:40.160
 it would reduce rate of death and all those kinds of things.

1:12:40.160 --> 1:12:44.160
 But it would also reduce the chance of you getting it.

1:12:44.160 --> 1:12:47.160
 And if you do get it, the chance of you transmitting it

1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:49.160
 to somebody else.

1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:52.160
 And it turns out that those latter two things

1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:54.160
 are not as definitive.

1:12:54.160 --> 1:12:57.160
 Or in fact, I mean, I don't know to which degree

1:12:57.160 --> 1:12:58.160
 they're not at all.

1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:00.160
 I think it's a little complicated because I think

1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:02.160
 the first two or three months after you're fully vaccinated

1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:08.160
 after the second dose, you have 60, 70% efficacy peak

1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:12.160
 against infection, which is pretty good.

1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:16.160
 But by six, seven, eight months, that drops to 20%.

1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:19.160
 Some studies, like there's a study out of Sweden

1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:21.160
 that suggests it might even drop to zero.

1:13:21.160 --> 1:13:24.160
 And then you're also infectious for some period of time

1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:26.160
 if you do get it, even though you're vaccinated.

1:13:26.160 --> 1:13:27.160
 Correct.

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:29.160
 Although there seems to be loose data

1:13:29.160 --> 1:13:31.160
 that the period of time you're infectious is shorter.

1:13:31.160 --> 1:13:36.160
 It's shorter, but the infectivity per day is about as high.

1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:39.160
 So the point is that the vaccine might reduce

1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:42.160
 some risk of infecting others, but it's not

1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:44.160
 a categorical difference.

1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:49.160
 So it's not safe to be in the presence

1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:51.160
 of just vaccinated people.

1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:53.160
 You can still get infected.

1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:54.160
 Right.

1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:56.160
 So, I mean, there's a million things I want to ask here,

1:13:56.160 --> 1:14:03.160
 but is there in some sense because the vaccine really helps

1:14:03.160 --> 1:14:08.160
 on the worst part of this pandemic, which is killing people?

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:09.160
 Yes.

1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:15.160
 Doesn't that mean where does the vaccine hesitancy come from

1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:18.160
 in terms of it seems like obviously a vaccine

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:22.160
 is a powerful solution to let us open this thing up?

1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:23.160
 Yeah.

1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:25.160
 So I wrote a Wall Street Journal op ed with Sinatra Gupta

1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:29.160
 in December of last year with a very naive title

1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:32.160
 which says we can end the lockdowns in a month.

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:33.160
 And the idea was very simple.

1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:38.160
 Vaccinate all vulnerable people.

1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.160
 And then open up.

1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:41.160
 Open up.

1:14:41.160 --> 1:14:42.160
 Right.

1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:45.160
 And the idea was that the lockdown harms is related.

1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:47.160
 This is directly related to the Great Barrington Declaration.

1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:49.160
 The Great Barrington Declaration said the lockdown harms

1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:53.160
 are devastating to the population at large.

1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:57.160
 There's this considerable segment of people that are vulnerable.

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:58.160
 Protect them.

1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:00.160
 Well, with the vaccine, we have a perfect tool

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:02.160
 to protect the vulnerable, which I still believe.

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:03.160
 I mean, it's true.

1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:04.160
 Right.

1:15:04.160 --> 1:15:06.160
 You vaccinate the vulnerable, the older population.

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:10.160
 And as you said, it's a tenfold decrease in the mortality risk

1:15:10.160 --> 1:15:14.160
 from getting infected, which is, I mean, amazing.

1:15:14.160 --> 1:15:16.160
 So that was the strategy we outlined.

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:20.160
 What happened is that the vaccine debate got transformed.

1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:22.160
 So first there's, so you're asking about vaccine hesitancy.

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:24.160
 I think there's, there's first, there's like, there's,

1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:28.160
 there's the inherent limitations of how to measure vaccine safety.

1:15:28.160 --> 1:15:29.160
 Right.

1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:32.160
 So we talked about a little bit about the trial, but also after the trial,

1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:35.160
 there's a, there's a, there's a mechanism.

1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:38.160
 And this is the work I've been involved with before COVID on,

1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:43.160
 on tracking and identifying and checking whether the vaccines actually are safe.

1:15:43.160 --> 1:15:46.160
 And the central challenge is one of causality.

1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:50.160
 So you no longer have the randomized trial, but,

1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:57.160
 but you want to know, is the vaccine when it's deployed at scale causing adverse events?

1:15:57.160 --> 1:16:01.160
 Well, you can't just look at people who are vaccinated and see what adverse events happen.

1:16:01.160 --> 1:16:06.160
 Cause you don't know what would have happened if the person had not been vaccinated.

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:09.160
 So you have to have some control group.

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:14.160
 Now what happened is there's several systems to do, to check this in that the CDC uses.

1:16:14.160 --> 1:16:18.160
 One, one very, very, very commonly known one now is called VAERS,

1:16:18.160 --> 1:16:20.160
 the vaccine adverse event reporting system.

1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:23.160
 There, anyone who has an adverse event that either,

1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:26.160
 either a regular person or a doctor can just go report.

1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:30.160
 Look, I had the vaccine and two days later I had a headache or whatever it is.

1:16:30.160 --> 1:16:34.160
 The person died a day after that, the vaccine, right?

1:16:34.160 --> 1:16:38.160
 Now you're vaccinated, the vaccine was rolled out to older people first

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:42.160
 and older people die sometimes with or without the vaccine.

1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:46.160
 So sometimes you'll see someone's vaccinated into a few days later, they die.

1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:50.160
 Did the vaccine cause it or something else? Cause it's really difficult to tell.

1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:53.160
 In order to tell you need a control group.

1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:58.160
 For that, there are other systems the FDA and CDC have.

1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:02.160
 Like there's one called VSD, Vaccine Safety Data Link.

1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:07.160
 There's another system called BEST, I forget what the acronym is,

1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:13.160
 to essentially to track cohorts of people vaccinated versus unvaccinated

1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:15.160
 with as careful a matching as you can do.

1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:22.160
 It's not randomized, but and see if you have safety signals that pop up

1:17:22.160 --> 1:17:26.160
 in the vaccinated relative to the control group unvaccinated.

1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:32.160
 And so that's for instance how the myocarditis risk was picked up in young,

1:17:32.160 --> 1:17:34.160
 especially young men.

1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:40.160
 It's also how the higher risk of blood clots in Middle Asian and older women

1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:43.160
 with the J&J vaccine was picked up.

1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:50.160
 There what you have is our situations where the baseline risk of these outcomes are so low

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:54.160
 that if you see them in the in the vaccinated arm at all,

1:17:54.160 --> 1:17:57.160
 then it's not hard to understand that the vaccine did this, right?

1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:00.160
 Young men should not be having myocarditis.

1:18:00.160 --> 1:18:04.160
 Middle aged women should not be having huge blood clots in the brain, right?

1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:06.160
 So when you see that, you can say it's linked.

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:07.160
 Now, the rates are low.

1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:11.160
 So young men, maybe one in 5,000, one in 10,000 of the vaccine,

1:18:11.160 --> 1:18:15.160
 vaccine related myocarditis, pericarditis.

1:18:15.160 --> 1:18:18.160
 Young women, middle aged women, I don't know.

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:20.160
 I'm not sure what the right number might be, but like I'd say,

1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:26.160
 it's like in the one in hundreds of thousands, something like that.

1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:30.160
 So these are rare outcomes, but they are vaccine linked outcomes.

1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:33.160
 How do you deal with that as a messaging thing?

1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:35.160
 I think you just tell people.

1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:36.160
 You tell people here are the risks.

1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:38.160
 You transparently tell them.

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:41.160
 So they're not getting into something that they don't know.

1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:50.160
 And don't treat people like they're children and need to be told lies because they won't understand the full complexity of the truth.

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:59.160
 People, I think, are pretty good at, or actually, people with time are good at understanding data,

1:18:59.160 --> 1:19:08.160
 but better than anything, they're extremely good at detecting arrogance and bullshit.

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:11.160
 And give them either one of those.

1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:16.160
 I'll give you one that's where I think it's greatly undermined vaccine has greatly undermined the demand for the vaccine.

1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:24.160
 Is this weird denial that if you recover from COVID, you have extremely good immunity,

1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:27.160
 both against infection and actually, that's really strange.

1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:35.160
 And that denial leads to people distrusting the message given by like the CDC director, for instance, in favor of the vaccine.

1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:39.160
 Why would you deny a thing that's such an obvious fact?

1:19:39.160 --> 1:19:49.160
 You can look at the data and it just pops out at you that people that are COVID recovered are not getting infected again at very high rates, much lower rates.

1:19:49.160 --> 1:20:00.160
 After these kinds of conversations, I'm sure after this very conversation, I often get a number of messages from Joe, Joe Rogan, and from Sam Harris,

1:20:00.160 --> 1:20:06.160
 who to me are people I admire, I think are really intelligent, thoughtful human beings.

1:20:06.160 --> 1:20:08.160
 They also have a platform.

1:20:08.160 --> 1:20:19.160
 And I believe, at least in my mind about this COVID set of topics, they represent a group of people.

1:20:19.160 --> 1:20:27.160
 Each group has smart, thoughtful, well intentioned human beings.

1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:37.160
 And I don't know who is right, but I do know that they're kind of tribal a little bit of those groups.

1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:55.160
 And so the question I want to ask is like, what do you think about these two groups and this kind of tension over the vaccine that sometimes it just keeps finding different topics on which to focus on,

1:20:55.160 --> 1:21:04.160
 like whether kids should get vaccinated or not, whether there should be vaccine mandates or not, which seem to be often very kind of specific policy kinds of questions.

1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:06.160
 That's the bigger picture.

1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:10.160
 I think it's a symptom of the distrust that people have in public health.

1:21:10.160 --> 1:21:18.160
 I think this kind of schism over the vaccine does not happen in places where the public health authorities have been much more trustworthy.

1:21:18.160 --> 1:21:23.160
 So you don't see this vaccine hesitancy in Sweden, for instance.

1:21:23.160 --> 1:21:37.160
 What's happened in the United States is the vaccine has become first because of politics, but then also because of the scientific arrogance, this sort of touchstone issue, and people line up on both sides of it.

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:41.160
 And the different language you're hearing is structured around that.

1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:49.160
 So before the election, for instance, I did a testimony in the House on measurement of vaccine safety.

1:21:49.160 --> 1:22:00.160
 And I was invited by the Republicans, there were, I think, four other experts invited by the Democrats or three other experts invited by Democrats, each of whom had a lot of experience in measuring vaccine safety.

1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:12.160
 I was really surprised to hear them each doubt whether the FDA would do a reasonable job in assessing vaccine safety, including by people who have long records of working with the FDA.

1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:23.160
 I mean, these are professionals, great scientists whose main goal in life is to make sure that unsafe vaccines don't get released into the world.

1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:25.160
 And if they are, they get pulled.

1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:32.160
 And they're casting doubt on the vaccine, the ability to track vaccine safety before the election.

1:22:32.160 --> 1:22:38.160
 And then after the election, the rhetoric switched on a dime.

1:22:38.160 --> 1:22:43.160
 All of a sudden, it's Republicans that are cast as if they're vaccine hesitant.

1:22:43.160 --> 1:22:47.160
 That kind of political shift, the public notices.

1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:55.160
 If all it takes is an election to change how people talk about the safety of the vaccine, well, we're not talking science anymore, many people think, right?

1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:58.160
 I think that created its hesitancy.

1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:13.160
 The other thing I think the hesitancy, some politicians viewed it as a political, as sort of like a political opportunity to sort of demonize people who are hesitant.

1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:17.160
 And that itself fueled hesitancy, right?

1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:24.160
 Like if you're telling me I'm a Rube that just doesn't want the vaccine because I want everyone to die, well, I'm going to react really negatively.

1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:34.160
 And if you're talking down to me about my legitimate, you know, sort of concerns about whether this vaccine is safe to take.

1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:39.160
 I mean, I've heard from women who are thinking about getting pregnant. Should I take the vaccine? I don't know.

1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:47.160
 I mean, there are all kinds of questions, legitimate questions that I think should have good data to answer, that we don't necessarily have good data to answer.

1:23:47.160 --> 1:23:49.160
 So what do you do in the face of that?

1:23:49.160 --> 1:24:00.160
 Well, one reaction is to pretend like we know for a fact that it's safe when we don't have the data to know for a fact in that particular group with that particular set of clinical circumstances, you know.

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:05.160
 And that, I think, breeds hesitancy. People can detect that bullshit.

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:08.160
 Whereas if you just tell people, you know, I don't know.

1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:10.160
 Yeah, leave with humility.

1:24:10.160 --> 1:24:13.160
 Yeah, you'll end up with a better result.

1:24:13.160 --> 1:24:19.160
 Let me ask you about, I've recently had a conversation with the Pfizer CEO.

1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:29.160
 This is part therapy session, part advice, because again, I really want us to get through this together.

1:24:29.160 --> 1:24:34.160
 And it feels like the division is a thing that prevents us from getting through this together.

1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:48.160
 And once again, just like with Francis Collins, a lot of people wrote to me words of support and a lot of people wrote to me words of criticism.

1:24:48.160 --> 1:24:52.160
 I'm trying to understand the nature of the criticism.

1:24:52.160 --> 1:25:01.160
 So some of the criticism had to do with against the vaccine and those kinds of things that I have a better understanding of.

1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:07.160
 But some kind of deep distrust of Pfizer.

1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:22.160
 So actually looking at Big Pharma broadly, I'm trying to understand, am I so naive that I just don't see it?

1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:29.160
 Because yes, there's corrupt people and they, they're greedy, they're flawed in all walks of life.

1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:39.160
 But companies do quite an incredible job of taking a good idea at the scale and making some money with that idea.

1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:43.160
 But they are the ones that achieve scale on a good idea.

1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:46.160
 I don't know, it's not obvious to me.

1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:49.160
 I don't see where the manipulation is.

1:25:49.160 --> 1:25:55.160
 So the fear that people have and I talked to Joe about this quite a bit.

1:25:55.160 --> 1:26:04.160
 I think this is a legitimate fear and a fear you should often have that money has influence, this proportional influence, especially in politics.

1:26:04.160 --> 1:26:17.160
 So the fear is that the policy of the vaccine was connected to the fact that lots of money could be made by manufacturing the vaccine.

1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:19.160
 And I understand that.

1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:24.160
 And it's actually quite a heck of a difficult task to alleviate that concern.

1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:32.160
 Like you really have to be a great man or woman or leader to convince people that you're not full of shit, that you're not just playing a game on them.

1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:35.160
 I don't know, it's a difficult task.

1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:44.160
 But at the same time, I really don't like the natural distrust every billionaire, distrust everybody who's trying to make money.

1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:57.160
 Because it feels like under a capitalistic system at least, the way to do a lot of good at scale in the world is by being at least in part motivated by profit.

1:26:57.160 --> 1:26:59.160
 I mean, I share your ambivalence, right?

1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:13.160
 So on the one hand, you have a fantastic achievement, the discovery of the vaccine and then the manufacturing at scale so that billions of people can take the vaccine in a relatively short time.

1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:20.160
 That is a remarkable achievement that could not have happened without companies like Pfizer.

1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:25.160
 On the other hand, there is this sort of corrupting influence of that money.

1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:38.160
 Just to give you one example, there's an enormous controversy over whether relatively inexpensive repurposed drugs can be used to treat the disease.

1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:43.160
 None of, no company like Pfizer has any interest whatsoever in evaluating it.

1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:54.160
 Even Merck, I think it was Merck, that had the patent on ivermectin now expired, has no interest at all in checking to see if it works.

1:27:54.160 --> 1:28:04.160
 Not only do they not have interest, they have a way of talking about people who might have a little bit of interest.

1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:09.160
 That's again fringe, full of arrogance.

1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:12.160
 And that is what troubles me.

1:28:12.160 --> 1:28:15.160
 It's back to the play of science.

1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:17.160
 They're not a bit of curiosity.

1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:23.160
 One, the natural curiosity of a human being that should always be there and an open mind is.

1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:33.160
 And second, in the case of ivermectin and other things like that, you have to acknowledge that there's a very large number of people who care about this topic.

1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:39.160
 And this is a way to inspire them to also play in the space of science, to inspire them with science.

1:28:39.160 --> 1:28:45.160
 You can't just dismiss everybody that, you can't just dismiss people, period.

1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:46.160
 Yeah.

1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:48.160
 Well, I mean, I think here take ivermectin, right?

1:28:48.160 --> 1:29:02.160
 There's actually a study funded by the NIH, by Tony Fauci's NIAID and the NIH called Active Six, that's a randomized trial of ivermectin.

1:29:02.160 --> 1:29:06.160
 It's due to be completed in March 2023.

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:18.160
 So normally, when you have private actors like these big drug companies that have no interest in conducting some kind of scientific experiment that would have some public benefit.

1:29:18.160 --> 1:29:24.160
 It's the job of the government, and in this case, the NIH to fund that kind of work.

1:29:24.160 --> 1:29:32.160
 The NIH has been incredibly slow in its evaluations of these repurpose drugs.

1:29:32.160 --> 1:29:39.160
 And it's been left to lots of other private activities of uneven quality.

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:42.160
 And hence, that's why you have these big fights.

1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:45.160
 Because the data are not solid, you're going to have these big fights.

1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:46.160
 Yeah.

1:29:46.160 --> 1:29:55.160
 But also, okay, forget the process of science here, the studies, not enough effort being put into the studies, just the way it's being communicated about.

1:29:55.160 --> 1:29:56.160
 Yeah, no, like horse paced.

1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:57.160
 I mean, come on.

1:29:57.160 --> 1:30:06.160
 The FDA put a tweet out telling people who are like, they're taking ivermectin because they've heard good things about it and they're sick and they're desperate.

1:30:06.160 --> 1:30:09.160
 And to call it horse paced was just, that was terrible.

1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:11.160
 That was deeply responsible.

1:30:11.160 --> 1:30:16.160
 My hope is grounded in the fact that young people see the bullshit of this.

1:30:16.160 --> 1:30:29.160
 Young PhD students, graduate students, young students in college, they see the less than stellar way that our scientific leaders and our political leaders are behaving.

1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:33.160
 And then the new generation will not repeat the mistakes of the past.

1:30:33.160 --> 1:30:34.160
 That is my hope.

1:30:34.160 --> 1:30:43.160
 Because that's the cool thing I see about young people is they're good at detecting bullshit and they don't want to be part of that.

1:30:43.160 --> 1:30:46.160
 That's my hope in the space of science.

1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:50.160
 Let me return to this idea of the Great Barrington Declaration.

1:30:50.160 --> 1:30:52.160
 Return to the beginning.

1:30:52.160 --> 1:30:54.160
 So what are the basics?

1:30:54.160 --> 1:30:57.160
 Can you describe what the Great Barrington Declaration is?

1:30:57.160 --> 1:30:58.160
 What are some of the ideas in it?

1:30:58.160 --> 1:31:01.160
 You mentioned focus protection.

1:31:01.160 --> 1:31:04.160
 What are your concerns about lockdowns?

1:31:04.160 --> 1:31:07.160
 Just paint the picture of this early proposal.

1:31:07.160 --> 1:31:08.160
 Sure.

1:31:08.160 --> 1:31:11.160
 So the Great Barrington Declaration, first, why is it called Great Barrington Declaration?

1:31:11.160 --> 1:31:13.160
 It's such a great name.

1:31:13.160 --> 1:31:16.160
 I mean, it's just such an epic name.

1:31:16.160 --> 1:31:20.160
 But the reason why it's called that is way less than epic.

1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:28.160
 It was because the conference, which is organized by Martin Kuldorf, who was a professor at Harvard University by a statistician.

1:31:28.160 --> 1:31:38.160
 He actually designed the safety system, the statistical system that the FDA uses for tracking vaccine safety.

1:31:38.160 --> 1:31:44.160
 He and I had met previously just the summer before that summer.

1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:55.160
 And he invited me to come to this small conference where he was inviting me and Sunetra Gupta, who was a professor of theoretical epidemiology at Oxford University.

1:31:55.160 --> 1:32:06.160
 And I mean, I jumped at the chance because I knew that Martin and Sunetra were both smarter than me and it would be fun to like talk about what the right strategy would be.

1:32:06.160 --> 1:32:10.160
 On the drive in, I didn't know what the name of the town was.

1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:13.160
 And I asked, they said it was Great Barrington.

1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:15.160
 I had it in the back of my head.

1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:20.160
 Martin and I arrived a little early and we were writing an op ed about some of the ideas.

1:32:20.160 --> 1:32:25.160
 Hopefully we'll get to talk about very soon about focus protection and the right strategy.

1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:33.160
 And when Sunetra arrived, we realized we'd actually come basically to the same place about the right way to deal with the epidemic.

1:32:33.160 --> 1:32:39.160
 And I thought, well, why don't we write something like the Port Huron statement.

1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:41.160
 It was what I had in the back of my head.

1:32:41.160 --> 1:32:43.160
 And I'm like, well, what's the name of this town again?

1:32:43.160 --> 1:32:44.160
 It was Great Barrington.

1:32:44.160 --> 1:32:45.160
 Yeah.

1:32:45.160 --> 1:32:46.160
 So it's not Barrington.

1:32:46.160 --> 1:32:47.160
 It's Great Barrington.

1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:49.160
 Which is fantastic, right?

1:32:49.160 --> 1:32:50.160
 Right.

1:32:50.160 --> 1:32:53.160
 It's so over the top that it's perfect.

1:32:53.160 --> 1:32:55.160
 It's literally like the Big Bang.

1:32:55.160 --> 1:33:00.160
 There's something about these over the top fun titles that just really deliver them.

1:33:00.160 --> 1:33:05.160
 So that's my main contribution was the title, the name Great Barrington Decorate.

1:33:05.160 --> 1:33:11.160
 But yeah, so it was kind of, and the idea is actually, while the title is great,

1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:17.160
 and I think that it was written in a very stylish way, it's less than a page.

1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:19.160
 You can go look online and read it.

1:33:19.160 --> 1:33:24.160
 It's written for, not for scientists, but for the general public so that people can

1:33:24.160 --> 1:33:27.160
 understand the ideas really simply.

1:33:27.160 --> 1:33:30.160
 But it is not actually a radical set of ideas.

1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:36.160
 It actually represents the old pandemic plans that we've used for a century dealing with

1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:39.160
 other similar pandemics.

1:33:39.160 --> 1:33:41.160
 And it's twofold.

1:33:41.160 --> 1:33:45.160
 First, let me talk about the science it rests on, and then I'll talk about the plan.

1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:49.160
 The science actually, some of what we already talked about, there's this massive age gradient

1:33:49.160 --> 1:33:52.160
 in the risk of COVID infection.

1:33:52.160 --> 1:33:55.160
 Older people face much higher risk than younger people.

1:33:55.160 --> 1:33:59.160
 The second bit of science is all, that's not controversial, right?

1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:06.160
 Even if you think the IFR is 0.7 or 0.2, no matter what, everyone agrees on this age gradient.

1:34:06.160 --> 1:34:10.160
 The second bit of science is also not controversial.

1:34:10.160 --> 1:34:16.160
 The lockdown focused policies that we followed have absolutely devastating consequences on

1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:20.160
 the health of the population.

1:34:20.160 --> 1:34:22.160
 Let me just give you some examples.

1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:25.160
 And this was known in October of 2020, we wrote it, right?

1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:33.160
 So the UN was sounding alarms that there would be tens of millions of people who would starve

1:34:33.160 --> 1:34:37.160
 as a consequence of the economic dislocation caused by the lockdowns.

1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:39.160
 And that's come to pass.

1:34:39.160 --> 1:34:46.160
 Hundreds of thousands of children in places like South Asia dead from starvation as a consequence

1:34:46.160 --> 1:34:49.160
 of lockdowns.

1:34:49.160 --> 1:34:59.160
 The priorities like the treatment of patients with tuberculosis in poor countries stopped

1:34:59.160 --> 1:35:02.160
 because of lockdowns.

1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:09.160
 Childhood vaccinations of measles, mumps, rubella, DPT, diphtheria, so on, pertussis, tetanus,

1:35:09.160 --> 1:35:13.160
 all those standard vaccination campaigns stopped.

1:35:13.160 --> 1:35:20.160
 Tens of millions of children skipping these doses for diseases that are actually deadly for them.

1:35:20.160 --> 1:35:27.160
 Is there, just on a small tangent, is it well understood to you what are the mechanisms that

1:35:27.160 --> 1:35:29.160
 stop all those things because of lockdowns?

1:35:29.160 --> 1:35:32.160
 Is it some aspect of supply chain?

1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:35.160
 Is it just literally because hospital doors are closed?

1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:41.160
 Is it because there's a disincentive to go outside by people even when they deeply need help?

1:35:41.160 --> 1:35:43.160
 It's all of the above.

1:35:43.160 --> 1:35:48.160
 But a lot of those efforts, especially those like vaccination efforts are funded and run

1:35:48.160 --> 1:35:50.160
 by Western efforts.

1:35:50.160 --> 1:35:56.160
 Like GAVI is a, I think it's a Gates funded thing actually that provides vaccines for

1:35:56.160 --> 1:35:58.160
 millions of kids worldwide.

1:35:58.160 --> 1:36:01.160
 And those efforts were scaled back.

1:36:01.160 --> 1:36:03.160
 Malaria prevention efforts.

1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:08.160
 So in the developing world, it was a devastating effect, these lockdowns.

1:36:08.160 --> 1:36:09.160
 There was also direct effects.

1:36:09.160 --> 1:36:15.160
 Like in India, the lockdowns, when they first instituted, there was an order that 10 million

1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:20.160
 migrant workers who live in big cities and they live hand to mouth.

1:36:20.160 --> 1:36:25.160
 They buy coconuts, they sell the coconuts with the money, they buy food for themselves

1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:27.160
 and coconuts for the next day to sell.

1:36:27.160 --> 1:36:33.160
 They walk back to their villages or go back to their villages overnight.

1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:38.160
 So 10 million people walking back to their villages or taking a train back, 1,000 died

1:36:38.160 --> 1:36:42.160
 en route over crowded trains, dying essentially on the side of the road.

1:36:42.160 --> 1:36:46.160
 I mean, it was absolutely inhumane policy.

1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:53.160
 And the lockdowns there, it's kind of like what's happened in the West as well, but it

1:36:53.160 --> 1:36:55.160
 was so severe.

1:36:55.160 --> 1:37:00.160
 There was a seroprevalence study done in Mumbai by a friend of mine at the University of

1:37:00.160 --> 1:37:01.160
 Chicago.

1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:06.160
 What he found was that in the slums of Mumbai, there were 70% seroprevalence in July or

1:37:06.160 --> 1:37:11.160
 August of 2020, whereas in the rest of Mumbai, it was 20%.

1:37:11.160 --> 1:37:12.160
 Right?

1:37:12.160 --> 1:37:14.160
 So it was incredibly unequal.

1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:22.160
 The lockdowns protected the relatively well off and spread the disease among the poor.

1:37:22.160 --> 1:37:25.160
 So that's in the developing world.

1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:30.160
 In the developed world, the health effects of lockdowns were also quite bad.

1:37:30.160 --> 1:37:31.160
 Right?

1:37:31.160 --> 1:37:34.160
 So we've talked already about isolation and depression.

1:37:34.160 --> 1:37:41.160
 There was a study done in July of 2020 that found that one in four young adults seriously

1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:43.160
 considered suicide.

1:37:43.160 --> 1:37:50.160
 Now, suicide rates haven't spiked up so much, but the depths of despair that would lead

1:37:50.160 --> 1:37:56.160
 somebody to seriously consider suicide itself should be a source of great concern in public

1:37:56.160 --> 1:37:57.160
 health.

1:37:57.160 --> 1:37:58.160
 Yeah.

1:37:58.160 --> 1:38:03.160
 This is one of the troubling things about measuring well beings.

1:38:03.160 --> 1:38:06.160
 We're okay at measuring death and suicide.

1:38:06.160 --> 1:38:09.160
 We're not so good at measuring suffering.

1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:18.160
 It's like people talk about maybe even Holodomor in the under Stalin or the concentration camps

1:38:18.160 --> 1:38:19.160
 with Hitler.

1:38:19.160 --> 1:38:26.160
 We talk about deaths, but we don't talk about the suffering over periods of years by people

1:38:26.160 --> 1:38:33.160
 living in fear, by people starving, psychological trauma that lasts a lifetime, all of those

1:38:33.160 --> 1:38:34.160
 things.

1:38:34.160 --> 1:38:38.160
 I mean, and just to get back to that point, we close schools, especially in blue states,

1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:40.160
 we close schools.

1:38:40.160 --> 1:38:44.160
 Now, richer parents could send their kids to private schools, many of which stayed open,

1:38:44.160 --> 1:38:45.160
 even in the blue states.

1:38:45.160 --> 1:38:46.160
 They could get pods.

1:38:46.160 --> 1:38:47.160
 They could get tutors.

1:38:47.160 --> 1:38:52.320
 That's not true for poorer and middle class parents.

1:38:52.320 --> 1:38:56.160
 As a result, what we did is we took away life opportunities for kids.

1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:03.660
 We tried to teach five year olds to read via Zoom in kindergarten.

1:39:03.660 --> 1:39:07.200
 The consequence actually, you think, okay, we can just make it up, but it's really difficult

1:39:07.200 --> 1:39:09.240
 to make that up.

1:39:09.240 --> 1:39:16.720
 There's a literature in health economics that shows that even relatively small disruptions

1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:22.720
 in schooling can have lifelong consequences, negative consequences for kids.

1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:30.400
 They end up growing up poorer, they lead shorter lives and less healthy lives as a consequence.

1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:34.880
 That's what the literature now shows is likely to happen with the interruptions of schooling

1:39:34.880 --> 1:39:36.880
 that we had in the United States.

1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:39.240
 Many European countries actually managed to avoid this.

1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:43.320
 There were in the early days, the epidemic, great indications that children first were

1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:49.400
 not severely at risk from COVID itself, nor are they super spreaders.

1:39:49.400 --> 1:39:52.000
 Schools were not the source of community spread.

1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:57.840
 Community spread the disease to schools, not the other way around.

1:39:57.840 --> 1:40:01.680
 We can talk about the scientific base of that if you'd like, but that was pretty well known

1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:04.640
 even in October.

1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:11.360
 We closed hospitals in order to keep them available to COVID patients, but as a result,

1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:14.280
 men skipped breast cancer screening.

1:40:14.280 --> 1:40:18.000
 As a result, they are showing up with late stage breast cancer that should have been

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:19.880
 picked up last year.

1:40:19.880 --> 1:40:23.960
 Men and women skipped colon cancer screening, again, with later stage disease that should

1:40:23.960 --> 1:40:26.320
 have been picked up last year with earlier stage.

1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:31.880
 For patients with diabetes, it's very important to have regular screening for blood sugar

1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:38.440
 levels and sort of counseling for lifestyle improvement, and we skipped that.

1:40:38.440 --> 1:40:42.360
 People stayed home with heart attacks and died at home with heart attacks.

1:40:42.360 --> 1:40:52.080
 You had this wide range of medical and psychological harms that were being utterly ignored as a

1:40:52.080 --> 1:40:53.600
 result of the lockdowns.

1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:57.960
 Plus, there's the economic pain.

1:40:57.960 --> 1:41:04.120
 Like you said, the whatever is a good term for the nonlaptop class, people would lose

1:41:04.120 --> 1:41:05.120
 their jobs.

1:41:05.120 --> 1:41:10.560
 Yes, there might be in the Western world support for them financially, but the big

1:41:10.560 --> 1:41:17.960
 loss there that is perhaps correlated with the depression and suicide is loss of meaning,

1:41:17.960 --> 1:41:24.520
 loss of hope for the future, loss of a sense of stability, all the pride you have in being

1:41:24.520 --> 1:41:34.120
 able to make money that allows you to pave your own way in the world, and yes, just having

1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:38.080
 less money than you're used to, so your family, your kids are suffering, all those kinds of

1:41:38.080 --> 1:41:39.080
 things.

1:41:39.080 --> 1:41:43.640
 There's, again, an economics literature on this, on deaths of despair, it was called.

1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:45.960
 2009, there was the Great Recession.

1:41:45.960 --> 1:41:53.960
 It led to an enormous uptake in overdose from drugs, suicidality, depression as a result

1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:57.040
 of the job losses that happened during the Great Recession.

1:41:57.040 --> 1:42:04.080
 Well, that's happening again, like an enormous increase in drug overdoses.

1:42:04.080 --> 1:42:06.720
 That's not an accident.

1:42:06.720 --> 1:42:08.280
 That's a lockdown harm, right?

1:42:08.280 --> 1:42:10.520
 Same thing with the job losses.

1:42:10.520 --> 1:42:15.200
 The job losses, by the way, are like, it's so interesting because the states that stayed

1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:20.800
 open have had much, much lower unemployment than the states that stayed closed.

1:42:20.800 --> 1:42:23.640
 The labor force participation rates declined by 3%.

1:42:23.640 --> 1:42:28.680
 It's women that separated because they stayed home with their kids.

1:42:28.680 --> 1:42:37.160
 We've reversed a generation of women, improving women's participation in the labor force.

1:42:37.160 --> 1:42:43.800
 Do you think it has to do with the institutions that we mentioned that there was so much priority

1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:52.600
 given or so much power given to maybe NIH versus other civilian leaders, or do people

1:42:52.600 --> 1:42:54.440
 just not care about the economic pain?

1:42:54.440 --> 1:42:55.440
 The leaders.

1:42:55.440 --> 1:42:59.240
 Because to me, it was obvious.

1:42:59.240 --> 1:43:03.880
 I mean, probably it's just studying history.

1:43:03.880 --> 1:43:11.800
 Whenever I listened to people on Twitter, on mainstream news, or just anything, I realized

1:43:11.800 --> 1:43:14.640
 that's the very top.

1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:20.440
 The people that have a voice represent a tiny selection of people, and so whenever there's

1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:28.440
 hard times, I always kind of think about the quiet, the voiceless, the quiet suffering

1:43:28.440 --> 1:43:35.480
 of the tens of millions, of the hundreds of millions, to the political leaders not just

1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:36.480
 give a damn.

1:43:36.480 --> 1:43:41.360
 I mean, I think it was actually a very odd ethical thing at the beginning of the pandemic,

1:43:41.360 --> 1:43:47.680
 where if you brought up economic harms at all, you were seen as callous.

1:43:47.680 --> 1:43:51.920
 So I had a reporter call me up, almost at the very beginning of the epidemic, asking

1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:57.000
 me about a very particular phenomenon.

1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:01.800
 So he was anticipating a rise in child abuse, because children were going to be staying

1:44:01.800 --> 1:44:02.800
 at home.

1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:06.600
 Child abuse is generally picked up at school, and that actually happened.

1:44:06.600 --> 1:44:12.800
 The report to child abuse dropped, but actual child abuse increased, because normally you

1:44:12.800 --> 1:44:16.160
 pick up the child abuse at school and then you have the intervention, right?

1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:19.240
 So yeah, I started talking about like, well, there's going to be some economic harms, and

1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:21.880
 they're going to have health consequences, but the economic harms matter.

1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:28.320
 But he counseled me, and I think he had my best interest at heart, like if you were to

1:44:28.320 --> 1:44:35.360
 put that in the story, I would be, I'd essentially be canceled, because the narrative that arose

1:44:35.360 --> 1:44:41.840
 in March of 2020 is if you care about money at all, you're evil and crass, you must only

1:44:41.840 --> 1:44:43.960
 care about lives.

1:44:43.960 --> 1:44:49.040
 The problem with that narrative is that that money, which we're talking about, is actually

1:44:49.040 --> 1:44:51.680
 lives of poor people, right?

1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:57.720
 When you throw 100 million people around the world into poverty, you're going to see enormous

1:44:57.720 --> 1:45:01.360
 harm to their health, enormous increases in their mortality.

1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:06.240
 It is not immoral to think about that and worry about that in the context of this pandemic

1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:07.400
 response.

1:45:07.400 --> 1:45:12.440
 Our mind focused so much on COVID that it forgot that there are so many other public

1:45:12.440 --> 1:45:16.600
 health priorities as well that need our attention desperately.

1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:21.880
 This is the thing I sensed about San Francisco when I visited.

1:45:21.880 --> 1:45:24.720
 I was thinking of moving there for a startup.

1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:30.520
 This is the thing I'm really afraid of, especially if I have any effect on the world through

1:45:30.520 --> 1:45:34.640
 a startup, is losing touch in this kind of way.

1:45:34.640 --> 1:45:40.240
 That you mentioned the laptop class, living in this world where you're only concerned

1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:49.240
 about this particular class of people, and also, perhaps early on in the pandemic, amongst

1:45:49.240 --> 1:45:52.320
 the laptop class, there was a legitimate concern for health.

1:45:52.320 --> 1:45:56.120
 You're not sure how deadly this virus is.

1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:59.080
 You're not sure who to listen to, so there's a real concern.

1:45:59.080 --> 1:46:03.880
 Then at a certain point when the data starts coming in, you start becoming more and more

1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:05.160
 detached from the data.

1:46:05.160 --> 1:46:10.880
 You don't start caring less and less, and you start just swimming in the space of narratives,

1:46:10.880 --> 1:46:15.520
 like existing in the space of narratives, and you have this narrative in San Francisco,

1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:21.360
 in the laptop class, that you're just very proud that you know the truth.

1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:23.000
 You're the sole possessors of the truth.

1:46:23.000 --> 1:46:28.560
 You congratulate yourself on it, and you don't care what actually gigantic detrimental

1:46:28.560 --> 1:46:34.440
 effect it has on society, because you're mostly fine.

1:46:34.440 --> 1:46:36.680
 I'm so terrified of that.

1:46:36.680 --> 1:46:39.840
 Well, I think the answer to that is just to remember.

1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:40.840
 You remember.

1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:41.840
 Yeah.

1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:46.520
 I don't think, remember where you came from, and remember who you're doing this for.

1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:50.120
 The back of your head should always be, what's the purpose?

1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:51.120
 Why am I here?

1:46:51.120 --> 1:46:53.000
 What's the purpose of this?

1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:58.560
 If the purpose is simply self aggrandizement, then you should rethink, because it'll just

1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:01.280
 end up being a hollow life.

1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:05.200
 All of us will be forgotten in the end.

1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:08.680
 Focus protection, the idea, the policy.

1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:09.680
 What is focus protection?

1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:10.680
 Right.

1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:13.200
 So, I was saying that there's two scientific bases, right?

1:47:13.200 --> 1:47:17.120
 So one is this steep age gradient, and the second is the existence of locked arms.

1:47:17.120 --> 1:47:22.480
 Again, I think there's not very little disagreement, and the scientific can be both of those facts.

1:47:22.480 --> 1:47:28.440
 If you put those facts together, the obvious policy is to protect the people who are at

1:47:28.440 --> 1:47:33.200
 the most severe risk from the disease itself, and that's the idea of focus protection.

1:47:33.200 --> 1:47:35.280
 That's the general principle of it.

1:47:35.280 --> 1:47:40.280
 The actual implementation of it depends on the living circumstances of the people that

1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:47.080
 are at risk, the resources that are available in the community, the technology that's available

1:47:47.080 --> 1:47:49.600
 to do this.

1:47:49.600 --> 1:47:54.360
 And so it's almost always going to be, in fact, it'll always be a local thing, because

1:47:54.360 --> 1:48:00.560
 it'll depend on all of those things which are all local in nature, right?

1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:06.640
 So one very, very obvious thing in a country like ours, where so many older people live

1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:12.520
 in institutionalized settings, in nursing home settings, and that's where older, really

1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:17.960
 vulnerable, chronically ill patients often live, and you know this disease affects that

1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:23.760
 group most commonly, it is absolutely vital to protect that group.

1:48:23.760 --> 1:48:30.480
 We should have known that in February 2020 from just from the Chinese data.

1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:38.120
 And we should have thought about that group as the key constraint in our policymaking.

1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:45.320
 Instead, we thought about in February and March 2020 as hospital beds as the key constraint.

1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:52.320
 Hospital beds and ventilator shortages, and so we ran around trying to address that constraint,

1:48:52.320 --> 1:48:55.760
 like a linear programming problem, you figure out which constraint is binding and you address

1:48:55.760 --> 1:48:58.920
 that one thing and you go on to the next one, right?

1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:04.600
 If that one constraint, we said, okay, the constraint is hospital beds.

1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:11.040
 That led to the decision in many of the Northeast states to send COVID infected patients who

1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:17.400
 were on the verge of, or looked like they were about to recover, back to nursing homes,

1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:20.600
 who then spread the disease all through there, because they wanted to preserve the hospital

1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:21.600
 beds.

1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:28.200
 Well, for somebody who loves numerical optimization, I love the way you frame this.

1:49:28.200 --> 1:49:30.480
 But those are kind of connected, right?

1:49:30.480 --> 1:49:38.560
 If you actually focus on protecting the vulnerable, you will also have the effect of not hitting

1:49:38.560 --> 1:49:41.000
 the ceiling of the available hospital beds.

1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:42.000
 That's the irony.

1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:47.240
 If we protected the vulnerable, the vulnerable are the most likely to be hospitalized.

1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:52.040
 And so by protecting the hospital, by protecting the vulnerable, we would also have addressed

1:49:52.040 --> 1:49:53.920
 the shortage of hospital beds more effectively.

1:49:53.920 --> 1:49:57.480
 So that little shift in priority would have had a big impact.

1:49:57.480 --> 1:50:03.920
 Okay, but specifically, the idea is to, and we can talk about different ideas of how to

1:50:03.920 --> 1:50:11.600
 actually do this, but you basically do a lockdown or something like that on a very small set

1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:12.600
 of people.

1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:15.840
 I mean, you may have to do that if its community spread is very high, but generally, I think

1:50:15.840 --> 1:50:20.520
 it would depend on, again, the living circumstances.

1:50:20.520 --> 1:50:25.680
 So for instance, if you are in a, if you have a, here's a very simple idea that doesn't

1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:30.120
 require a lockdown forced on them, I don't actually generally, I'm not in favor of that

1:50:30.120 --> 1:50:34.080
 kind of forced lockdown because you just won't get cooperation.

1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:38.120
 But what you could do is provide resources to that group of people.

1:50:38.120 --> 1:50:44.960
 So imagine you live next door to somebody, an older couple, and there's high community

1:50:44.960 --> 1:50:45.960
 spread.

1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:49.040
 Well, they have to go grocery shopping.

1:50:49.040 --> 1:50:53.880
 We did like some of these, some communities did these like senior only grocery hour, right?

1:50:53.880 --> 1:50:57.500
 But they have to still have to go out and they might get exposed in when they're shopping

1:50:57.500 --> 1:50:59.000
 amongst other seniors.

1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:03.480
 Well, why not organize home delivery of groceries to them?

1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:06.720
 We did that for the laptop class, right?

1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:10.160
 Or it can even just as a volunteer effort, you know, the older people living next door

1:51:10.160 --> 1:51:13.600
 just call them up and say, can I help you get, go out and go shopping for you.

1:51:13.600 --> 1:51:17.280
 And so you would have potentially federal support of that kind of thing.

1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:19.320
 So these kinds of efforts.

1:51:19.320 --> 1:51:22.320
 And identify where the vulnerable people live.

1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:25.720
 It's really challenging in multi generational homes, LA County, for instance, there's a

1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:32.480
 lot of older people living together with younger people in relatively crowded, they're there.

1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:35.840
 It's really quite a challenge, but there again, you can use resources.

1:51:35.840 --> 1:51:42.160
 So if grandma is worried that grandson has come home, but is potentially being exposed,

1:51:42.160 --> 1:51:45.480
 grandson calls grandma says, I mean, I might have been at a party where I might do that

1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:50.040
 where COVID was grandma calls public health, public health then says, okay, you can have

1:51:50.040 --> 1:51:54.440
 this hotel room for a couple of days until you check to turn negative.

1:51:54.440 --> 1:52:02.120
 In case it wasn't clear, the idea of focus protection is the people that are vulnerable

1:52:02.120 --> 1:52:08.400
 protect them and everybody else goes on with their lives, open up the economy, just do

1:52:08.400 --> 1:52:09.400
 as it was before.

1:52:09.400 --> 1:52:13.240
 And there was still fear abroad, so there still would be some restrictions people would

1:52:13.240 --> 1:52:16.840
 pose on themselves, they probably would go to parties less, the grandsons probably wouldn't

1:52:16.840 --> 1:52:19.480
 go so many parties, right?

1:52:19.480 --> 1:52:23.640
 There would be less participation in big gatherings.

1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:27.720
 You may even say like big gatherings in order to restrict community spread again, I'm not

1:52:27.720 --> 1:52:29.600
 against any of that.

1:52:29.600 --> 1:52:34.080
 But you shouldn't be closing businesses, you shouldn't be closing churches and synagogues,

1:52:34.080 --> 1:52:38.640
 you shouldn't be closing, you shouldn't be forcing people to not go to school.

1:52:38.640 --> 1:52:45.000
 You should not be shuttering businesses, you should just allow society to go on, some disease

1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:46.000
 will spread.

1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:49.800
 But as we've seen, the lockdown didn't stop the disease from spreading anyways.

1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:50.960
 Right.

1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:58.800
 So what do you make of the criticism that this idea like all good ideas cannot actually

1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:03.560
 be implemented in a heterogeneous society where there's a lot of people intermixing

1:53:03.560 --> 1:53:10.120
 and once you open it up, people like the younger people will just forget that this is even

1:53:10.120 --> 1:53:14.520
 existing and they'll stop caring about the older people and mess up the whole thing and

1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:16.920
 the government will not want to fund.

1:53:16.920 --> 1:53:20.840
 And you kind of the great efforts you're talking about about food delivery and then food delivery

1:53:20.840 --> 1:53:24.720
 services, be like, why the heck am I helping out on this anyway?

1:53:24.720 --> 1:53:26.960
 Because like it's not making me much money.

1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:30.640
 And so therefore like all good ideas, it will collapse.

1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:31.640
 That might be true.

1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:34.080
 But I think it's always a risk with policy.

1:53:34.080 --> 1:53:39.600
 But I think back to the moment, we actually felt like we were in this together to some

1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:40.600
 extent.

1:53:40.600 --> 1:53:41.600
 Yes.

1:53:41.600 --> 1:53:42.600
 Right.

1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:49.160
 I think that that empathy that we had that was used to like tell people to stay in and

1:53:49.160 --> 1:53:55.880
 like happily, not really happily, but like stay in to like wear a mask or to do all these

1:53:55.880 --> 1:54:00.880
 things that we thought would help other people could have been redirected to actually helping

1:54:00.880 --> 1:54:02.920
 the people who most needed to be helped.

1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:11.200
 Especially, I do remember March, so this is even way before Barrington, all that kind

1:54:11.200 --> 1:54:19.960
 of stuff, March, April, May, there was a feeling like if we all just work together, we'll solve

1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:20.960
 this.

1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:21.960
 Right.

1:54:21.960 --> 1:54:24.280
 And that may be started to, when did that start breaking down?

1:54:24.280 --> 1:54:31.040
 I mean, unfortunately, the election is mixed into this, that it became politicized.

1:54:31.040 --> 1:54:32.880
 But I think it lasted quite a long time.

1:54:32.880 --> 1:54:37.640
 I think into the summer, I think there was some of that sense, I don't know, obviously

1:54:37.640 --> 1:54:42.560
 varied among different people, but I think that it's true, it would have been challenging.

1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:47.000
 It's also true that it's heterogeneous, exactly the way you said.

1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:50.760
 But what that means is you need a local response, a response.

1:54:50.760 --> 1:54:57.040
 Also like my vision of a public health officer is someone that understands their community,

1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:01.320
 not necessarily the nation at large, but their community, and then works within their community

1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:07.040
 to figure out how to deploy the resources that are available to do the kind of protection

1:55:07.040 --> 1:55:08.640
 policies we're talking about.

1:55:08.640 --> 1:55:10.120
 That's what should have happened.

1:55:10.120 --> 1:55:15.960
 Instead, they spent a huge amount of efforts closing, making sure businesses stayed closed.

1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:21.000
 Things that, I mean, there are like hardware stores that closed.

1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:25.080
 What good did closing a hardware store do for the spread of COVID?

1:55:25.080 --> 1:55:28.440
 If it had an effect on spread, COVID spread, I mean, it's going to be more checking to

1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:33.200
 make sure that Plexiglas was put up everywhere, which now in retrospect turns out to probably

1:55:33.200 --> 1:55:37.680
 made the disease worse.

1:55:37.680 --> 1:55:42.420
 Masking enforcement, so shaming around mask, I mean, a huge amount of effort on things

1:55:42.420 --> 1:55:47.160
 that were only tangentially related to focus protection.

1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:53.760
 What if we turned our energy, that enormous energy put into that, instead into focus protection

1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:54.760
 of the vulnerable?

1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:57.280
 That's essentially the conversation I was calling for.

1:55:57.280 --> 1:56:00.960
 And it wasn't, I mean, I didn't think of it as we had every single idea.

1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:05.720
 I mean, we gave some concrete proposals, but the criticism we got was that those concrete

1:56:05.720 --> 1:56:08.320
 proposals weren't enough.

1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:10.280
 And the answer to that is that's true.

1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:11.280
 They weren't enough.

1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:12.640
 I wasn't thinking of them as enough.

1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:16.960
 I was thinking that they would, I wanted to involve an enormous number of people in local

1:56:16.960 --> 1:56:23.400
 public health to help think about how to do focus protection in their communities.

1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:29.360
 The question that's interesting here is about the future too.

1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:34.960
 So COVID has very specific characteristics, like you mentioned, about the curve of the

1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:40.520
 death rate based on the, like it's, it seems like with COVID, it's a little bit easier

1:56:40.520 --> 1:56:45.760
 to actually identify a group of people that you need to protect.

1:56:45.760 --> 1:56:48.060
 So other viruses may not be this way.

1:56:48.060 --> 1:56:51.680
 So might lockdown be a good idea?

1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:58.600
 Like hardcore lockdown for a future virus that's 10 times deadlier, but spreads at the same

1:56:58.600 --> 1:56:59.600
 rate as COVID?

1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:04.440
 Or maybe another way to ask that is imagine a virus that's 10 times deadlier.

1:57:04.440 --> 1:57:05.440
 What's the right response?

1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:11.040
 I mean, I think it's always going to be focus protection, but the group that needs the focus

1:57:11.040 --> 1:57:14.440
 protection may change depending on the biology of the virus, right?

1:57:14.440 --> 1:57:21.240
 So the polio epidemic in the 40s and 50s in the U.S., the great, the people at most risk

1:57:21.240 --> 1:57:23.280
 were children.

1:57:23.280 --> 1:57:27.160
 We didn't know really at the beginning there was this fecal oral spread.

1:57:27.160 --> 1:57:33.480
 And so we did all kinds of crazy things, including like spreading, spraying DDT in communities

1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:37.240
 which was something I was supposed to get rid of polio.

1:57:37.240 --> 1:57:42.160
 But the focus was on whenever there was an outbreak, they would close the school down.

1:57:42.160 --> 1:57:48.640
 And that was the right thing to do because that group that needed protection was children

1:57:48.640 --> 1:57:53.600
 and the disease was spread, we thought, in schools.

1:57:53.600 --> 1:57:57.920
 I don't think there's a single formula that works, but there's a single principle that

1:57:57.920 --> 1:57:58.920
 works, right?

1:57:58.920 --> 1:58:05.000
 No matter, I can't, it's hard to imagine a disease that's uniformly deadly across every

1:58:05.000 --> 1:58:07.360
 group in every single person.

1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:13.800
 There's always going to be some group that's differentially harmed.

1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:17.160
 There's always going to be some group that's differentially protected and that may change

1:58:17.160 --> 1:58:18.160
 over time, right?

1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:26.080
 So like in this disease, in this epidemic, as people got infected and recovered, we now

1:58:26.080 --> 1:58:31.080
 had a class of people that were pretty well protected against the disease.

1:58:31.080 --> 1:58:36.120
 They should be, like instead of ostracizing them because they don't want a vaccine, we

1:58:36.120 --> 1:58:37.840
 should be allowing them to work.

1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:43.560
 I mean, we're having staffing shortages in hospitals now because we forgot that principle.

1:58:43.560 --> 1:58:46.680
 It's quite a bit of this technology problem.

1:58:46.680 --> 1:58:54.000
 So being able to, how much of it is this sociological problem?

1:58:54.000 --> 1:58:56.960
 How much of it is a technology problem?

1:58:56.960 --> 1:59:03.320
 Where do you put the blame sort of on why this didn't go so great and how it can go great

1:59:03.320 --> 1:59:04.320
 in the beginning?

1:59:04.320 --> 1:59:05.880
 I mean, think about lockdowns.

1:59:05.880 --> 1:59:09.520
 If we didn't have Zoom, we wouldn't have lockdowns.

1:59:09.520 --> 1:59:11.520
 There's a reason in 2009 we didn't lock down.

1:59:11.520 --> 1:59:18.000
 I mean, we didn't have the technology to replace work with this remote technology.

1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:21.480
 So we had good lockdown technology in Zoom.

1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:25.040
 We didn't have good focus protection technology.

1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:26.040
 Yeah.

1:59:26.040 --> 1:59:28.040
 I mean, focus protection is always going to be complicated, especially for something

1:59:28.040 --> 1:59:31.120
 like this that spreads so easily, it's going to be complicated.

1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:35.560
 And I'm very, I'm the last person to say it would have been perfect.

1:59:35.560 --> 1:59:39.080
 There would have been people that would have gotten sick, but they got sick anyways.

1:59:39.080 --> 1:59:44.660
 The hope was that if we suppress community spread low enough, we can protect the vulnerable.

1:59:44.660 --> 1:59:47.280
 That was the hope by lockdown.

1:59:47.280 --> 1:59:51.800
 The reality was that only a certain class of people were able to benefit from lockdown.

1:59:51.800 --> 1:59:54.920
 The rest of society, we'd call them essential workers, had to keep working and they got

1:59:54.920 --> 1:59:55.920
 sick.

1:59:55.920 --> 1:59:56.920
 Yeah.

1:59:56.920 --> 1:59:58.240
 And so the disease kept spreading.

1:59:58.240 --> 2:00:06.120
 It didn't actually have a substantial effect on community spread in nonlaptop class populations.

2:00:06.120 --> 2:00:10.440
 And also we should probably expand the class of people we call vulnerable to those who

2:00:10.440 --> 2:00:19.280
 would suffer, who have the capacity to suffer, given the policies that you're weighing.

2:00:19.280 --> 2:00:25.280
 It's very disingenuous to call the vulnerable just the people, obviously we had the very

2:00:25.280 --> 2:00:33.040
 specific meaning, but broadly speaking, vulnerable should include anybody who can suffer based

2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:36.160
 on the policies you take in response to a virus.

2:00:36.160 --> 2:00:40.760
 That principle we just said, I completely agree with, is something I think has been

2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:44.360
 lost and unfortunately lost.

2:00:44.360 --> 2:00:51.960
 So the policies themselves, if they have harm, those are real and we shouldn't pretend

2:00:51.960 --> 2:00:59.200
 like they're not and essentially demonize the people that suffer them or pretend, I

2:00:59.200 --> 2:01:03.960
 mean, like a lot of times, like the depression that we've been talking about, that's thought

2:01:03.960 --> 2:01:08.600
 of as not so important, but it's important.

2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:14.400
 And especially the harm to the people in poor countries, it's like been out of sight, out

2:01:14.400 --> 2:01:17.160
 of mind in much of the rich parts of the world.

2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:22.800
 Once again, I've hoped that we, seeing this, learning the lessons of history with the communications

2:01:22.800 --> 2:01:24.440
 those who have now will learn this.

2:01:24.440 --> 2:01:30.000
 It's like going to another country and bombing targeted terrorist locations and there's going

2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:38.080
 to be some civilians who die pretending that the child who watches their dad die is not

2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:42.240
 going to grow up, first of all, traumatized, but second of all, potentially bring more

2:01:42.240 --> 2:01:47.720
 hate to the world than the hate that you were allegedly fighting in the first place.

2:01:47.720 --> 2:01:54.080
 That's another sort of considering only one kind of harm and not the full range of harms

2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:55.840
 that are being caused by your policies.

2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:00.840
 You know, like to a good return to focus protection, we still should be following the policy now

2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:03.160
 for COVID and we're not, right?

2:02:03.160 --> 2:02:06.880
 So the vaccines, there's a great shortage in vaccines.

2:02:06.880 --> 2:02:10.640
 You wouldn't know it in the United States and the rich parts of the world, but there's

2:02:10.640 --> 2:02:11.640
 a great shortage of vaccines.

2:02:11.640 --> 2:02:16.560
 We're not going to be able to vaccinate the most of the, like the entire set of elderly

2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:21.360
 at least or larger groups until late 2022.

2:02:21.360 --> 2:02:26.840
 Huge numbers of older people around the world in poor countries that have not had, not COVID

2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:27.840
 recovered yet.

2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:31.640
 So they're still quite vulnerable, have not had the vaccine and yet we're talking about

2:02:31.640 --> 2:02:38.320
 vaccinating five year olds who benefit, if at all from the vaccine, just a very little

2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:41.960
 bit because they face such a low risk of harm from COVID.

2:02:41.960 --> 2:02:49.400
 Well, something that's a little bit near and dear to our specific, the two of our hearts.

2:02:49.400 --> 2:02:51.440
 So you're at Stanford.

2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:56.960
 So Stanford recently announced that they're going back to virtual, at least for some period

2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:01.280
 of time in response to the escalate, maybe you can clarify, but I think it's in response

2:03:01.280 --> 2:03:10.120
 to the escalated, how would they phrase it's related to Omicron and a few other universities

2:03:10.120 --> 2:03:16.640
 that kind of like considering back and forth in my perspective, as somebody who loves in

2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:26.960
 person lectures, who sees the value of that to students, to young minds, also looking

2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:38.760
 at the data seems the risk of version in university policies around this, given how healthy the

2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:44.120
 student population is, seems not well calibrated.

2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:45.120
 Let's put it this way.

2:03:45.120 --> 2:03:50.000
 So pathological pathological is one way to put it, given that I believe, depending on

2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:55.400
 the university, but I think many universities require that the student body is vaccinated

2:03:55.400 --> 2:03:57.200
 at this point.

2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:01.520
 So I think it's a big mistake by Stanford to do this.

2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:08.560
 And I'd like to say that because I just hope MIT doesn't, but what are your thoughts about

2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:09.560
 Stanford?

2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:10.560
 I agree with you.

2:04:10.560 --> 2:04:11.560
 I completely agree with you.

2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:19.280
 I think we have failed in our mission to educate our students by this decision.

2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:23.480
 And I think more broadly, I think we failed generally over the course of the last year

2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:28.000
 and a half in living up to our educational mission.

2:04:28.000 --> 2:04:32.280
 In person teaching is vital.

2:04:32.280 --> 2:04:37.520
 Now I can understand, if you have older faculty, the principle of focus protection says provide

2:04:37.520 --> 2:04:42.720
 some alternative teaching arrangements for them, that makes sense to me.

2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:47.560
 From the kid's point of view, they're more harmed by not getting the education we promised

2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:51.560
 them than by COVID.

2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:58.240
 So applying this principle of this focus protection, let young professors teach in person.

2:04:58.240 --> 2:05:01.120
 This is before the vaccine, after the vaccine, let everyone teach in person.

2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:07.840
 Yeah, this is the part I don't understand the discussion we're even having because, okay,

2:05:07.840 --> 2:05:12.960
 let's leave focus protection aside here because that's a brilliant policy for perhaps for

2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:15.920
 the future when there's no vaccine.

2:05:15.920 --> 2:05:22.640
 Now with the vaccine, I'm misunderstanding something here because we're now in a space

2:05:22.640 --> 2:05:30.720
 that's psychological, it's no longer about biology because with the booster shots, which

2:05:30.720 --> 2:05:37.280
 I believe MIT is now requiring before January, with the booster shots, the data shows no

2:05:37.280 --> 2:05:45.400
 matter how old you are, the risks are very low for ending up in a hospital relative to

2:05:45.400 --> 2:05:49.480
 all the other risks you face when you're older.

2:05:49.480 --> 2:05:57.840
 I don't understand, can you explain the policy around closing a university, but also just

2:05:57.840 --> 2:06:06.120
 a policy about just being so scared still in the university setting?

2:06:06.120 --> 2:06:11.640
 I think the university's, the great university has done great harm by modeling this kind

2:06:11.640 --> 2:06:12.640
 of behavior.

2:06:12.640 --> 2:06:17.800
 Yes, to me, decided to keep interrupting, but to me, the university should be the beacon

2:06:17.800 --> 2:06:26.560
 of great behavior, not the beacon of like scared conservative, let's not mess up, let's

2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:31.080
 not make it pathological, let's not make anybody angry.

2:06:31.080 --> 2:06:34.760
 It should be a place to play in the space of ideas.

2:06:34.760 --> 2:06:39.760
 So I think the central problem is actually related to the central problem of COVID policy

2:06:39.760 --> 2:06:41.480
 more generally.

2:06:41.480 --> 2:06:48.880
 The goal seems to be to stop the disease from spreading rather than to reduce the harm from

2:06:48.880 --> 2:06:52.200
 the disease.

2:06:52.200 --> 2:06:58.320
 If the goal is to stop the disease from spreading, the sad fact is we have no technology to accomplish

2:06:58.320 --> 2:06:59.320
 that.

2:06:59.320 --> 2:07:00.840
 At this point, yes.

2:07:00.840 --> 2:07:04.720
 Because like it's already deeply integrated into the human civilization.

2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:07.120
 Well, I mean, it's here forever, right?

2:07:07.120 --> 2:07:10.680
 There's a zero survey of whitetail deer in the US.

2:07:10.680 --> 2:07:16.080
 It turns out 80% of whitetail deer in the US have COVID antibodies.

2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:18.120
 Dogs get it, cats get it.

2:07:18.120 --> 2:07:26.000
 There's almost certainly human animal transmission of it, I mean, I've heard bats get it apparently.

2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:32.480
 So you have a situation where you have this disease is here to stay and the vaccines don't

2:07:32.480 --> 2:07:34.640
 stop the spread of it, the lockdowns don't stop the spread of it.

2:07:34.640 --> 2:07:38.680
 We have no technology to stop the spread of it.

2:07:38.680 --> 2:07:43.360
 And so we're burning the earth trying to stop, do something that's impossible rather

2:07:43.360 --> 2:07:47.840
 than working on what's possible.

2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:53.600
 And so like letting regular college happen, that's a great good.

2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:59.400
 Universities are a wonderful invention and it's contributed so much to society to decide

2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:04.160
 to shut it down that the universities should be fighting tooth and nail to not be shut

2:08:04.160 --> 2:08:07.480
 down, not the other way around.

2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:12.680
 Whatever the mechanisms that results in universities doing that, that's probably, this is me talking,

2:08:12.680 --> 2:08:16.080
 it probably has to do with certain incentives for the administration, probably has to do

2:08:16.080 --> 2:08:21.280
 with lawyers and legal kinds of things to avoid legal trouble.

2:08:21.280 --> 2:08:27.240
 But once again, it's when the administration has too much power and too much definition

2:08:27.240 --> 2:08:30.840
 of what the policy is for the university, that's when you get into trouble.

2:08:30.840 --> 2:08:37.160
 The beauty, the power of the university should be about the faculty and the students.

2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:40.480
 Administration just gets in the way.

2:08:40.480 --> 2:08:41.480
 Get out of the way.

2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:43.360
 I mean, they can help organize things.

2:08:43.360 --> 2:08:47.240
 They play some important role, but they certainly do, but they need to remember what the mission

2:08:47.240 --> 2:08:48.240
 is.

2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:50.240
 The mission is not safety.

2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:57.200
 The mission actually, universities should be dangerous places for ideas and whatnot.

2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:59.280
 What is the role of fear in a pandemic?

2:08:59.280 --> 2:09:00.800
 We've been dancing around it.

2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:01.800
 Is it useful?

2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:03.320
 Is it destructive?

2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:06.080
 Or is there sort of a complicated story here?

2:09:06.080 --> 2:09:11.520
 Because sort of taking us back into January 2020, there was so much uncertainty.

2:09:11.520 --> 2:09:17.880
 This could have been a pandemic that is black death, the bubonic plague.

2:09:17.880 --> 2:09:21.160
 It could have killed hundreds of millions of people.

2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:23.080
 We don't know that.

2:09:23.080 --> 2:09:24.080
 We're very new to this.

2:09:24.080 --> 2:09:25.080
 It's been a while.

2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:26.640
 We're rusty.

2:09:26.640 --> 2:09:31.320
 So there is some value to fear so that you don't do the stupid thing.

2:09:31.320 --> 2:09:33.040
 You don't just go on living.

2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:36.680
 I guess where I come from, I think it's almost entirely counterproductive.

2:09:36.680 --> 2:09:44.160
 I think fear should never be used as a tactic to manipulate human behavior by public health.

2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:49.880
 So the fear on the individual level, that feeling of fear, you should be very hesitant

2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:54.040
 about that feeling because it could be easily manipulated by the powerful.

2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:55.040
 Exactly.

2:09:55.040 --> 2:10:03.880
 So I think that fear is natural and it's not something that you have to stoke to get when

2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:07.120
 the facts on the ground suggest it.

2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:14.320
 In fact, the tendency for humans in the face of threats from infectious disease is to exaggerate

2:10:14.320 --> 2:10:20.120
 the fear in their own minds of being contaminated by the environment and by others.

2:10:20.120 --> 2:10:22.840
 That's just natural to humans.

2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:29.000
 And the role of public health is not necessarily to eradicate the fear, but obviously technological

2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.000
 advances can help eradicate the fear.

2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:39.320
 But it's really to help manage that fear and help people put the sort of incentives that

2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:44.640
 come out of that to useful things as opposed to harmful things.

2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:49.960
 What's happened in this pandemic is that there's been a deliberate policy to stoke the fear,

2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:54.280
 to help make people think that the disease is worse than it actually is.

2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:56.800
 In survey after survey, you see this.

2:10:56.800 --> 2:10:59.000
 And that's been incredibly damaging.

2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:05.520
 So young people have readily given away their willingness to participate in regular life

2:11:05.520 --> 2:11:10.080
 because A, they fear COVID more than they ought.

2:11:10.080 --> 2:11:15.400
 And B, they fear that they're going to harm the vulnerable in their lives.

2:11:15.400 --> 2:11:18.920
 You put those two together and you get this powerful demand for lockdowns.

2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:21.160
 You see this all over the world.

2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:26.120
 Broadly speaking, you have a powerful demand for irrational policies, irrational policies.

2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:29.160
 Because I would like to mention the flip side of that.

2:11:29.160 --> 2:11:38.720
 I've been saddened to see how much money there is to be made by the martyrs, the people,

2:11:38.720 --> 2:11:46.600
 the conspiracy theorists that tell you, you should be afraid of the government.

2:11:46.600 --> 2:11:49.280
 You should be afraid of the man.

2:11:49.280 --> 2:11:51.680
 It feels like fear is the problem.

2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:56.440
 I think there's some guy that once said something about, we should fear fear itself.

2:11:56.440 --> 2:11:59.920
 He was a president or something.

2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:01.840
 I vaguely remember that.

2:12:01.840 --> 2:12:05.960
 So I'm worried about both sides here, that...

2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:12.040
 Well, I think the general principle is that should not be a tool of public policy.

2:12:12.040 --> 2:12:15.480
 The public policy should attempt, and public health policy in particular should attempt

2:12:15.480 --> 2:12:18.400
 to address that fear.

2:12:18.400 --> 2:12:22.920
 It's not that you should tell people lies, of course not.

2:12:22.920 --> 2:12:26.720
 Tell people accurately what the risk is.

2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:34.400
 Give people tools that have evidence that they can address their risk with and level

2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:36.120
 with people when we don't know.

2:12:36.120 --> 2:12:40.800
 I think that is the right adult way to deal with this pandemic from a public health point

2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:41.800
 of view.

2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:44.680
 And that is not the policy we have followed.

2:12:44.680 --> 2:12:49.120
 Instead, public health has intentionally stoked the fear in order to gain compliance with

2:12:49.120 --> 2:12:50.720
 its edicts.

2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:56.760
 And I think the consequence of that is people distrust public health.

2:12:56.760 --> 2:12:58.600
 What you're talking about is distrust of government.

2:12:58.600 --> 2:13:00.960
 I think it's partly a consequence of that.

2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:05.920
 That movement, which is much smaller once upon a time, is much larger now because of

2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:11.640
 essentially people look at what public health has done and said, they've lied to me a whole

2:13:11.640 --> 2:13:16.200
 bunch of times and a whole bunch of things is the general sense, and there are consequences

2:13:16.200 --> 2:13:17.200
 to that.

2:13:17.200 --> 2:13:21.200
 We're going to have to work in public health for a long time to try to regain the trust

2:13:21.200 --> 2:13:22.200
 of the public.

2:13:22.200 --> 2:13:27.880
 Throughout all of this, you've been inspiring to me to a lot of people.

2:13:27.880 --> 2:13:37.280
 You've been fearless, bold, in these kind of challenging the policies and not in a

2:13:37.280 --> 2:13:43.960
 martyr kind of way because you're walking the line gracefully and beautifully, I would

2:13:43.960 --> 2:13:44.960
 say.

2:13:44.960 --> 2:13:51.480
 And looking at that, I think you're an inspiration to a lot of young people, so I have to ask,

2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:57.400
 what advice would you give them if they're thinking of going into science, if they're

2:13:57.400 --> 2:13:59.600
 thinking of having an impact in the world?

2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:06.120
 What advice would you give them about their career and maybe about their life, thinking

2:14:06.120 --> 2:14:09.560
 about somebody in high school, maybe in undergraduate college?

2:14:09.560 --> 2:14:11.360
 I'd say a few things.

2:14:11.360 --> 2:14:13.240
 This is a wonderful profession.

2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:19.600
 You have an opportunity to improve the lives of so many and do it by having fun, the kind

2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:21.040
 of play we're talking about.

2:14:21.040 --> 2:14:27.320
 It's an absolute privilege to be able to work in this kind of area.

2:14:27.320 --> 2:14:33.440
 And to young people looking to say that have some gifts or desire for this area, I'd say,

2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:36.240
 go for it, do what you can.

2:14:36.240 --> 2:14:37.720
 So, this area of science broadly.

2:14:37.720 --> 2:14:38.720
 Yeah.

2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:46.520
 I mean, I don't have any gifts in AI, but in health or in medicine or whatever, whatever

2:14:46.520 --> 2:14:50.200
 your gifts lie, develop them, work hard and develop them because it's worth it.

2:14:50.200 --> 2:14:57.200
 It's worth it not just because you get some status or because the journey is fun and the

2:14:57.200 --> 2:15:00.680
 result is improvements to the lives of so many.

2:15:00.680 --> 2:15:03.480
 So, I think that is the encouragement I give.

2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:09.280
 I'd also say, if you're looking at this ugliness of this debate that's happened over the pandemic,

2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:14.040
 I'd say to young people, we need you to come in and help transform it.

2:15:14.040 --> 2:15:18.440
 Many of the people who've seen this debate that behave poorly, I ask you forgive them.

2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:26.600
 I've done my best to try because many of them are acting out of their own sense that they

2:15:26.600 --> 2:15:32.600
 need to do good, but the mistake they've made is in this arrogance and this power.

2:15:32.600 --> 2:15:37.080
 When you come in, remember that example as a negative example and so that when you join

2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:42.600
 the debate, you'll join it in a spirit of humility, in a spirit of trying to learn while

2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:48.560
 keeping that love that led you to enter the field in the first place.

2:15:48.560 --> 2:15:54.600
 And yeah, choose forgiveness versus like derision.

2:15:54.600 --> 2:16:01.880
 Like the people that have messed up, give them a pass because it feels like that's how

2:16:01.880 --> 2:16:02.880
 improvement starts.

2:16:02.880 --> 2:16:07.000
 Funny, I've been thinking this is like, I told you I'm Christian, right?

2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:12.320
 So, like God has given me many opportunities to forgive people, learned to practice how

2:16:12.320 --> 2:16:13.320
 to do that.

2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:14.320
 Gave you a gift.

2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:15.640
 It's a very humbling thing, I guess.

2:16:15.640 --> 2:16:21.840
 Is there a memory from when you were young that was very formative to you?

2:16:21.840 --> 2:16:24.640
 So, you just gave advice to some young people.

2:16:24.640 --> 2:16:32.200
 Is there something that stands out to you that a decision you made, an event that happened

2:16:32.200 --> 2:16:35.480
 that made you the man you are today?

2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:38.280
 I actually grew up in a relatively poor environment.

2:16:38.280 --> 2:16:42.800
 Like I was born in India and I moved when I was four.

2:16:42.800 --> 2:16:48.600
 My dad had eight brothers and sisters and my mom had four brothers and sisters.

2:16:48.600 --> 2:16:52.120
 She grew up in the slum in Calcutta.

2:16:52.120 --> 2:16:56.880
 My dad, his dad died when he was young and he supported his family, his brothers and

2:16:56.880 --> 2:16:59.320
 sisters with the university scholarship money.

2:16:59.320 --> 2:17:04.280
 Came to the U.S. and my dad worked in a McDonald's even though he's an electrical engineer, couldn't

2:17:04.280 --> 2:17:06.800
 find a job in 1971.

2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:09.360
 And so, he worked at McDonald's.

2:17:09.360 --> 2:17:17.240
 We lived in a, like this, basically the housing port like development in Cambridge, just like

2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:21.640
 this middle building on the 17th floor of this housing development.

2:17:21.640 --> 2:17:25.000
 I mean, I think that was transformative for me.

2:17:25.000 --> 2:17:31.800
 Like, I didn't realize so much at the time how that experience of being essentially like

2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:36.440
 poor, lower middle class, what effect it had on my outlook.

2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:40.760
 You mentioned to me offline that you listened to a conversation that I had with my dad.

2:17:40.760 --> 2:17:42.800
 What impact did your dad have on your life?

2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:45.160
 What memories do you have about him?

2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:47.720
 He was a rocket scientist, actually.

2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:50.920
 He helped design rocket guidance systems.

2:17:50.920 --> 2:17:55.440
 He died when I was 20 and I still miss him to this day.

2:17:55.440 --> 2:18:04.520
 And I think that experience of seeing him sacrifice himself for his family, a brilliant

2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:09.600
 man, but in many ways frustrated with like the, his opportunities in the world was partly

2:18:09.600 --> 2:18:13.040
 what led him to come to the U.S. in the first place.

2:18:13.040 --> 2:18:16.320
 That's transformed, that's had a transformative effect on me.

2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:21.760
 And I wish I could tell him that looking back.

2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.360
 Do you think about your own mortality?

2:18:25.360 --> 2:18:27.040
 Do you think about your death?

2:18:27.040 --> 2:18:29.560
 Your dad is no longer with us.

2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:34.160
 You're the old wise sage that represents.

2:18:34.160 --> 2:18:40.160
 I feel like it's funny that I've only worried about death once in this pandemic, although

2:18:40.160 --> 2:18:47.320
 I've had two of my cousins who's 73 and my uncle who's 74 die in India during the pandemic

2:18:47.320 --> 2:18:52.920
 and I grieve them, both from COVID.

2:18:52.920 --> 2:18:57.440
 Like the fear of COVID really has only hit me only really once during this.

2:18:57.440 --> 2:18:59.440
 It wasn't from me.

2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:01.200
 And I recognize it as irrational.

2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:07.880
 So on the eve of the Santa Clara County seroprevalence study, it was a really interesting thing

2:19:07.880 --> 2:19:11.440
 because so many people volunteered to help.

2:19:11.440 --> 2:19:18.120
 And my daughter, who's 20, I guess was 19 at the time and my wife also volunteered to

2:19:18.120 --> 2:19:21.160
 help with like various aspects of the study.

2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:24.240
 And so the eve of the study, they were going to go out in public.

2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:28.080
 And I didn't know what the death rate was because we hadn't done the study.

2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:31.680
 And I suspected it was lower than people were saying, but I didn't know.

2:19:31.680 --> 2:19:37.080
 I knew about the age gradient because I'd seen the Chinese data and my daughter's young,

2:19:37.080 --> 2:19:41.120
 but my wife is my age and I didn't know the death rate.

2:19:41.120 --> 2:19:43.720
 And I couldn't sleep the night before.

2:19:43.720 --> 2:19:49.480
 Like what if I'm putting my family, my kid, my daughter and my wife at risk because of

2:19:49.480 --> 2:19:52.280
 some activity that I'm doing.

2:19:52.280 --> 2:19:53.280
 It was kind of, I don't know.

2:19:53.280 --> 2:19:54.280
 I mean, it was actually.

2:19:54.280 --> 2:20:00.480
 So it was worried about the well being and of others when you look in the mirror.

2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:01.480
 If I die, I die.

2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:06.320
 I mean, like I just, it's not, again, I'm Christian, so I don't, death is not the end for me.

2:20:06.320 --> 2:20:07.320
 I believe.

2:20:07.320 --> 2:20:13.680
 And so I don't, I don't particularly worried about my own death, but I do, I mean, I just,

2:20:13.680 --> 2:20:17.680
 I think we can't help but worry about the well being of our loved ones.

2:20:17.680 --> 2:20:24.320
 So from the perspective of God, then let me ask you, what do you think is the meaning

2:20:24.320 --> 2:20:25.800
 of this whole journey we're on?

2:20:25.800 --> 2:20:27.520
 What do you think is the meaning of life?

2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:29.280
 No, it's very simple.

2:20:29.280 --> 2:20:30.280
 Love one another.

2:20:30.280 --> 2:20:32.680
 Treat your neighbor as yourself.

2:20:32.680 --> 2:20:33.680
 It's love.

2:20:33.680 --> 2:20:34.680
 Yeah.

2:20:34.680 --> 2:20:35.680
 As simple as that.

2:20:35.680 --> 2:20:40.080
 Well, I'd love to see a little bit more of that in this pandemic.

2:20:40.080 --> 2:20:44.440
 It's an opportunity for the best of our nature to shine.

2:20:44.440 --> 2:20:50.000
 It's, I've seen some of the worst, but I think some of that is just good therapy.

2:20:50.000 --> 2:20:55.040
 And I'm hoping in the end, what we have here is, is love.

2:20:55.040 --> 2:21:01.560
 At the very least, make your dad proud with some incredible rockets that we're launching

2:21:01.560 --> 2:21:02.560
 out there.

2:21:02.560 --> 2:21:04.520
 I think you get along well with my dad, Lex.

2:21:04.520 --> 2:21:06.080
 I definitely would.

2:21:06.080 --> 2:21:07.080
 Thank you so much.

2:21:07.080 --> 2:21:08.960
 This is an incredible honor to talk to you, Jay.

2:21:08.960 --> 2:21:13.520
 You've been an inspiration to so many people and keep fighting the good fight.

2:21:13.520 --> 2:21:16.200
 Thank you so much for spending your valuable time with me today.

2:21:16.200 --> 2:21:17.200
 Thank you for having me here.

2:21:17.200 --> 2:21:18.700
 I appreciate it.

2:21:18.700 --> 2:21:21.520
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jay Badakaria.

2:21:21.520 --> 2:21:26.200
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:21:26.200 --> 2:21:30.440
 And now let me leave you with some words from Alice Walker.

2:21:30.440 --> 2:21:36.520
 The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.

2:21:36.520 --> 2:22:04.080
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
