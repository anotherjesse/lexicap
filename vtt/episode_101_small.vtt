00:00.000 --> 00:05.520
 The following is a conversation with Yosha Bach, VP of Research at the AI Foundation

00:05.520 --> 00:08.720
 with a history of research positions at MIT and Harvard.

00:09.440 --> 00:15.120
 Yosha is one of the most unique and brilliant people in the artificial intelligence community,

00:15.680 --> 00:21.360
 exploring the workings of the human mind, intelligence, consciousness, life on earth,

00:21.360 --> 00:24.560
 and the possibly simulated fabric of our universe.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.640
 I can see myself talking to Yosha many times in the future.

00:28.640 --> 00:36.400

 on Twitter at Lex Freedman. Since this comes up more often than I ever would have imagined,

01:03.440 --> 01:08.480
 I challenge you to try to figure out how to spell my last name without using the letter E.

01:09.600 --> 01:14.720
 And it'll probably be the correct way. As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now

01:14.720 --> 01:17.760
 and never in yads in the middle that can break the flow of the conversation.

01:18.960 --> 01:25.120

01:30.720 --> 01:37.840
 I've been using ExpressVPN for many years. I love it. I think ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there.

01:38.480 --> 01:44.480
 They told me to say it, but I think it actually happens to be true. It doesn't log your data,

01:44.480 --> 01:49.360
 it's crazy fast, and it's easy to use literally just one big power on button.

01:49.360 --> 01:54.400
 Again, for obvious reasons, it's really important that they don't log your data.

01:54.960 --> 02:00.000
 It works on Linux and everywhere else too. Shout out to my favorite flavor of Linux,

02:00.000 --> 02:07.200
 Ubuntu Mate 2004. Once again, get it at expressvpn.com slash lexpod,

02:07.200 --> 02:13.200

02:14.240 --> 02:18.800
 This show is presented by Cash App, the number one finance app in the App Store.

02:18.800 --> 02:25.360
 When you get it, use code lexpodcast. Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

02:25.360 --> 02:31.200
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1. Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

02:31.200 --> 02:36.960
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction

02:36.960 --> 02:42.480
 of the fractional orders is an algorithmic marvel. So big props to the Cash App engineers

02:42.480 --> 02:46.240
 for taking a step up to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,

02:46.240 --> 02:51.120
 making trading more accessible for new investors and diversification much easier.

02:51.760 --> 02:57.200
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store, Google Play and use the code lexpodcast,

02:57.760 --> 03:04.240
 you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to first, an organization that is helping advance

03:04.240 --> 03:11.440
 robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now here's my conversation

03:11.440 --> 03:18.560
 with Yosha Bach. As you've said, you grew up in a forest in East Germany, just as what we're talking

03:18.560 --> 03:25.200
 about off mic to parents who are artists. And now I think, at least to me, you've become one of the

03:25.200 --> 03:30.480
 most unique thinkers in the AI world. So can we try to reverse engineer your mind a little bit?

03:31.520 --> 03:38.320
 What were the key philosophers, scientists, ideas, maybe even movies, or just realizations

03:38.320 --> 03:44.560
 that impact on you when you're growing up that kind of led to the trajectory or were the key

03:44.560 --> 03:47.920
 sort of crossroads in the trajectory of your intellectual development?

03:49.600 --> 03:56.560
 My father came from a long tradition of architects, a distant branch of the Bach family.

03:57.200 --> 04:04.400
 And so basically, he was technically a nerd. And nerds need to interface in society with

04:04.400 --> 04:09.920
 nonstandard ways. Sometimes I define a nerd as somebody who thinks that the purpose of

04:09.920 --> 04:16.560
 communication is to submit your ideas to peer review. And normal people understand that the

04:16.560 --> 04:22.640
 primary purpose of communication is to negotiate alignment. And these purposes tend to conflict,

04:22.640 --> 04:26.000
 which means that nerds have to learn how to interact with society at large.

04:27.120 --> 04:32.080
 Who is the reviewer in the nerd's view of communication?

04:32.080 --> 04:37.680
 Everybody who you consider to be a peer. So whatever happens as individual is around,

04:37.680 --> 04:41.360
 well, you would try to make him or her the gift of information.

04:43.200 --> 04:48.640
 Okay. So you're not, by the way, my research will malinform me. So you're

04:50.080 --> 04:57.200
 architect or artist? So he did study architecture. But basically, my grandfather made the wrong

04:57.200 --> 05:05.520
 decision. He married an aristocrat and was drawn into the war. And he came back after 15 years.

05:05.520 --> 05:13.680
 So basically, my father was not parented by a nerd, by somebody who tried to tell him what to do

05:13.680 --> 05:20.240
 and expected him to do what he was told. And he was unable to. He's unable to do things if

05:20.240 --> 05:25.440
 he's not intrinsically motivated. So in some sense, my grandmother broke her son. And her son

05:25.440 --> 05:32.080
 responded when he became an architect to become an artist. So he built 100 Wasser architecture.

05:32.080 --> 05:37.280
 He built houses without right angles. He'd built lots of things that didn't work in the more brutalist

05:37.280 --> 05:43.280
 traditions of Eastern Germany. And so he bought an old watermill, moved out to the countryside,

05:43.280 --> 05:48.400
 and did only what he wanted to do, which was art. Eastern Germany was perfect for Bohem,

05:48.400 --> 05:53.760
 because you had complete material safety. Putt was heavily subsidized, Haskell was free.

05:53.760 --> 05:58.240
 You didn't have to worry about rent or pensions or anything. So it's a socialized communist side

05:58.240 --> 06:02.240
 of the country. Yes. And the other thing is it was almost impossible not to be in political

06:02.240 --> 06:06.160
 disagreement with your government, which is very productive for artists. So everything that you

06:06.160 --> 06:11.680
 do is intrinsically meaningful, because it will always touch on the deeper currents of society,

06:11.680 --> 06:15.840
 of culture, and being conflict with it, and tension with it. And you will always have to

06:15.840 --> 06:22.720
 define yourself with respect to this. So what impact did your father, this outside of the box

06:22.720 --> 06:28.480
 thinker against the government, against the world artists? He was actually not a thinker. He was

06:28.480 --> 06:33.440
 somebody who only got self aware to the degree that he needed to make himself functional.

06:33.440 --> 06:41.120
 So in some sense, he was also in the late 1960s, and he was in some sense a hippie. So he became

06:41.120 --> 06:46.160
 a one person cult. He lived out there in his kingdom. He built big sculpture gardens and

06:46.160 --> 06:54.080
 started many avenues of art and so on, and convinced a woman to live with him. She was

06:54.080 --> 06:59.680
 also an architect, and she adored him and decided to share her life with him. And I basically grew

06:59.680 --> 07:06.400
 up in a big cave full of books. I'm almost feral. And I was bored out there. It was very, very

07:06.400 --> 07:12.480
 beautiful, very quiet, and quite lonely. So I started to read. And by the time I came to school,

07:12.480 --> 07:17.760
 I've read everything until fourth grade and then some. And there was not a real way for me to relate

07:17.760 --> 07:23.360
 to the outside world. And I couldn't quite put my finger on why. And today I know it was because I

07:23.360 --> 07:28.400
 was a nerd, obviously. And it was the only nerd around. So there were no other kids like me.

07:28.960 --> 07:33.920
 And there was nobody interested in physics or computing or mathematics and so on.

07:34.560 --> 07:40.240
 And this village school that I went to, basically a nice school. Kids were nice to me. I was not

07:40.240 --> 07:45.120
 beaten up, but I also didn't make many friends or build deep relationships. They only happened in

07:45.120 --> 07:48.480
 starting from ninth grade when I went into a school for mathematics and physics.

07:49.280 --> 07:54.320
 Do you remember any key books from this moment? I basically read everything. So I went to the

07:54.320 --> 07:59.920
 library and I worked my way through the children's and young adult sections. And then I read a lot

07:59.920 --> 08:05.440
 of science fiction. For instance, Danislav Lem, basically the great author of cybernetics,

08:05.440 --> 08:09.600
 has influenced me back then. I didn't see him as a big influence because everything that he wrote

08:09.600 --> 08:14.720
 seemed to be so natural to me. And it's only later that I contrasted it with what other people wrote.

08:15.920 --> 08:19.680
 Another thing that was very influential on me were the classical philosophers

08:19.680 --> 08:26.880
 and also the literature of romanticism. So German poetry and art, Dr. Hilzhoff and

08:26.880 --> 08:34.880
 Heine up to Hesse and so on. I love Hesse. So at which point do the classical philosophers end?

08:34.880 --> 08:40.400
 At this point, or in the 21st century, what's the latest classical philosopher? Does this stretch

08:40.400 --> 08:45.840
 through even as far as Nietzsche or is this, are we talking about Plato and Aristotle?

08:45.840 --> 08:49.120
 I think that Nietzsche is the classical equivalent of a shit poster.

08:52.720 --> 08:57.920
 He's very smart and easy to read. But he's not so much trolling others. He's trolling himself

08:57.920 --> 09:02.480
 because he was at odds with the world. Largely, his romantic relationships didn't work out.

09:02.480 --> 09:09.760
 He got angry and he basically became a nihilist. Isn't that a beautiful way to be as an intellectual

09:09.760 --> 09:14.960
 is to constantly be trolling yourself, to be in that conflict, in that tension?

09:14.960 --> 09:18.800
 I think it's a lack of self awareness. At some point, you have to understand the

09:18.800 --> 09:23.840
 comedy of your own situation. If you take yourself seriously and you are not functional,

09:23.840 --> 09:28.880
 it ends in tragedy as it did for Nietzsche. I think you think he took himself too seriously in that

09:28.880 --> 09:34.080
 tension. And if you find the same thing in Hesse and so on, the Steppenwolf syndrome is classic

09:34.080 --> 09:38.720
 adolescence, where you basically feel misunderstood by the world and you don't understand that all

09:38.720 --> 09:44.000
 the misunderstandings are the result of your own lack of self awareness. Because you think that you

09:44.000 --> 09:48.880
 are a prototypical human and the others around you should behave the same way as you expect them

09:48.880 --> 09:53.520
 based on your innate instincts and it doesn't work out. And you become a transcendentalist

09:53.520 --> 09:59.040
 to deal with that. So it's very, very understandable and have great sympathies for this to the degree

09:59.040 --> 10:03.760
 that I can have sympathy for my own intellectual history. But you have to grow out of it.

10:04.640 --> 10:09.600
 So as an intellectual, a life well lived, a journey well traveled is one where you don't

10:09.600 --> 10:16.000
 take yourself seriously. No, I think that you are neither serious or not serious yourself,

10:16.000 --> 10:22.240
 because you need to become unimportant as a subject. That is, if you are a philosopher,

10:22.240 --> 10:27.360
 belief is not a verb. You don't do this for the audience, you don't do it for yourself,

10:27.360 --> 10:32.240
 you have to submit to the things that are possibly true. And you have to follow wherever

10:32.240 --> 10:36.080
 your career leads. But it's not about you, it has nothing to do with you.

10:36.080 --> 10:42.080
 So do you think then people like Ayn Rand believed sort of an idea of there's objective

10:42.080 --> 10:47.920
 truth. So what's your sense in the philosophical, if you remove yourself that's objective from

10:47.920 --> 10:52.560
 the picture, you think it's possible to actually discover ideas that are true? Or are we just

10:52.560 --> 10:57.840
 in a mesh of relative concepts that are neither true nor false? It's just a giant mess.

10:57.840 --> 11:02.720
 You cannot define objective truth without understanding the nature of truth in the first

11:02.720 --> 11:08.480
 place. So what does the brain mean by saying that it's cover something as truth? So for instance,

11:08.480 --> 11:14.560
 a model can be predictive or not predictive. Then there can be a sense in which a mathematical

11:14.560 --> 11:19.600
 statement can be true because it's defined as true under certain conditions. So it's basically

11:19.600 --> 11:27.120
 a particular state that a variable can have in a simple game. And then you can have a correspondence

11:27.120 --> 11:31.440
 between systems and talk about truth, which is again a type of model correspondence. And there

11:31.440 --> 11:36.080
 also seems to be a particular kind of ground truth. So for instance, you're confronted with the

11:36.080 --> 11:42.160
 enormity of something existing at all, right? That's stunning when you realize something exists

11:42.160 --> 11:47.840
 rather than nothing. And this seems to be true, right? There's an absolute truth in the fact

11:47.840 --> 11:52.880
 that something seems to be happening. Yeah, that to me is a showstopper. I could just think about

11:52.880 --> 11:58.240
 that idea and be amazed by that idea for the rest of my life and not go any farther, because I don't

11:58.240 --> 12:02.800
 even know the answer to that. Why does anything exist at all? Well, the easiest answer is existence

12:02.800 --> 12:06.800
 is the default, right? So this is the lowest number of bits that you would need to encode this.

12:06.800 --> 12:11.280
 Whose answer? The simplest answer to this is that existence is the default.

12:11.280 --> 12:16.400
 What about non existence? I mean, that seems non existence might not be a meaningful notion in

12:16.400 --> 12:21.280
 this sense. So in some sense, if everything that can exist exists for something to exist,

12:21.280 --> 12:26.000
 it probably needs to be implementable. The only thing that can be implemented is finite

12:26.000 --> 12:30.560
 automata. So maybe the whole of existence is the superposition of all finite automata. And

12:30.560 --> 12:34.000
 we are in some region of the fractal that has the properties that it can contain us.

12:34.000 --> 12:41.600
 What does it mean to be a superposition of finite? So any superposition of all like all

12:41.600 --> 12:46.800
 possible rules? Imagine that every automaton is basically an operator that acts on some

12:46.800 --> 12:51.280
 substrate. And as a result, you get emergent patterns. What's the substrate?

12:52.640 --> 12:57.680
 I have no idea to know. So it's basically some substrate. It's something that can store information.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.680
 Something that can store information. There's a time. Something that can hold state.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.760
 Still, doesn't make sense to me the why that exists at all. I could just sit there with a

13:06.800 --> 13:11.520
 beer or a vodka and just enjoy the fact, pondering the why.

13:11.520 --> 13:16.960
 May not have a why. This might be the wrong direction to ask into this. So there could be no

13:16.960 --> 13:22.800
 relation in the y direction without asking for a purpose or for a cause. It doesn't mean that

13:22.800 --> 13:28.480
 everything has to have a purpose or a cause, right? So we mentioned some philosophers in that

13:28.480 --> 13:33.760
 early just taking a brief step back into that. Okay, so we asked ourselves when did classical

13:33.760 --> 13:39.040
 philosophy end? I think for Germany, it largely ended with the first revolution. That's basically

13:39.040 --> 13:45.120
 when we... Which one was that? This was when we ended the monarchy and started a democracy. And at

13:45.120 --> 13:50.640
 this point, we basically came up with a new form of government that didn't have a good sense of

13:50.640 --> 13:56.080
 this new organism that society wanted to be and in a way it decapitated the universities.

13:56.080 --> 14:00.640
 So the universities went on through modernism like a headless chicken. At the same time,

14:00.640 --> 14:06.240
 democracy failed in Germany and we got fascism as a result. And it burned down things in a similar

14:06.240 --> 14:11.040
 way as Stalinism burned down intellectual traditions in Russia. And Germany, both

14:11.040 --> 14:16.320
 Germanies have not recovered from this. Eastern Germany had this Valger dialectic materialism

14:16.320 --> 14:21.040
 and Western Germany didn't get much more edgy than Habermas. So in some sense,

14:21.040 --> 14:25.120
 both countries lost their intellectual traditions and killing off and driving out the Jews didn't

14:25.120 --> 14:32.560
 have. Yeah, so that was the end. That was the end of really rigorous what you would say is

14:32.560 --> 14:38.800
 classical philosophy. There's also this thing that in some sense, the low hanging foods in

14:38.800 --> 14:46.560
 philosophy were mostly wrapped. And the last big things that we discovered was the constructivist

14:46.560 --> 14:52.160
 turn in mathematics. So to understand that the parts of mathematics that work are computation.

14:52.160 --> 14:57.760
 There was a very significant discovery in the first half of the 20th century. And it hasn't

14:57.760 --> 15:03.120
 fully permeated philosophy and even physics yet. Physicists checked out the code libraries

15:03.120 --> 15:09.280
 for mathematics before constructivism became universal. What's constructivism? What are you

15:09.280 --> 15:11.840
 referring to girls and completeness there and that kind of those kinds of ideas?

15:11.840 --> 15:17.360
 So basically, Gödel himself, I think, didn't get it yet. Hilbert could get it. Hilbert saw that,

15:17.360 --> 15:21.920
 for instance, countries set theoretical experiments and mathematics led into contradictions.

15:21.920 --> 15:27.920
 And he noticed that with the current semantics, we cannot build a computer in mathematics that

15:27.920 --> 15:34.080
 runs mathematics without crashing. And Gödel could prove this. And so what Gödel could show is using

15:34.080 --> 15:38.800
 classical mathematical semantics, you run into contradictions. And because Gödel strongly

15:38.800 --> 15:44.240
 believed in these semantics and more than in what he could observe and so on, he was shocked.

15:44.240 --> 15:48.560
 It basically shook his world to the core, because in some sense, he felt that the world has to be

15:48.560 --> 15:54.080
 implemented in classical mathematics. And for Turing, it wasn't quite so bad. I think that

15:54.080 --> 15:59.200
 Turing could see that the solution is to understand that quantum mathematics was computation all

15:59.200 --> 16:05.920
 along, which means you, for instance, pi in classical mathematics is a value. It's also a

16:05.920 --> 16:11.040
 function, but it's the same thing. And in computation, a function is only a value when

16:11.040 --> 16:15.440
 you can compute it. And if you cannot compute the last digit of pi, you only have a function.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.520
 You can plug this function into your local sun. You let it run until the sun burns out.

16:19.520 --> 16:24.240
 This is it. This is the last digit of pi you will know. But it also means there can be no process

16:24.240 --> 16:29.120
 in the physical universe or in any physically realized computer that depends on having known

16:29.120 --> 16:34.880
 the last digit of pi. Which means there are parts of physics that are defined in such a way that

16:34.880 --> 16:39.120
 cannot strictly be true, because assuming that this could be true leads into contradictions.

16:39.120 --> 16:44.960
 So I think putting computation at the center of the world view is actually the right way to think

16:44.960 --> 16:50.560
 about it. Yes. And Wittgenstein could see it. And Wittgenstein basically preempted the logitist

16:50.560 --> 16:56.320
 program of AI that Minsky started later, like 30 years later. Turing was actually a pupil of

16:56.320 --> 17:00.480
 Wittgenstein. Really? So I didn't know there's any connection between Turing and Wittgenstein.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.840
 And Wittgenstein even canceled some classes when Turing was not present, because he thought it was

17:03.840 --> 17:09.680
 not worth spending the time on with the others. If you read the attractardos, it's a very beautiful

17:09.680 --> 17:15.280
 book, basically one thought on 75 pages. It's very nontipical for philosophy, because it doesn't have

17:16.400 --> 17:21.600
 arguments in it, and it doesn't have references in it. It's just one thought that is not intending

17:21.600 --> 17:26.320
 to convince anybody. This says it's mostly for people that have the same insight as me.

17:26.320 --> 17:32.400
 Just spell it out. And this insight is there is a way in which mathematics and philosophy ought to

17:32.400 --> 17:37.600
 meet. Mathematics tries to understand the domain of all languages by starting with those that

17:37.600 --> 17:42.000
 are so formalizable that you can prove all the properties of the statements that you make.

17:42.560 --> 17:47.040
 But the price that you pay is that your language is very, very simple. So it's very hard to say

17:47.040 --> 17:51.760
 something meaningful in mathematics. And it looks complicated to people, but it's far less

17:51.760 --> 17:56.000
 complicated than what our brain is casually doing all the time, and it makes sense of reality.

17:56.720 --> 18:02.400
 And philosophy is coming from the top. So it's mostly starting from natural languages with vaguely

18:02.400 --> 18:07.680
 defined concepts. And the hope is that mathematics and philosophy can meet at some point. And

18:07.680 --> 18:11.120
 Wittgenstein was trying to make them meet. And he already understood that, for instance,

18:11.120 --> 18:15.600
 you could express everything with the nant calculus, that you could reduce the entire logic

18:15.600 --> 18:20.320
 to nant gates as we do in our modern computers. So in some sense, he already understood Turing

18:20.320 --> 18:24.880
 universality before Turing spelled it out. I think when he wrote the tractatus, he didn't

18:24.880 --> 18:29.520
 understand yet that the idea was so important and significant. And as I suspect then, when Turing

18:29.520 --> 18:35.200
 wrote it out, nobody cared that much. Turing was not that famous. When he lived, it was mostly his

18:35.200 --> 18:41.680
 work in decrypting the German quotes that made him famous or gave him some notoriety. But

18:41.680 --> 18:46.080
 the same status that he has to computer science right now, and yeah, I something that I think

18:46.080 --> 18:51.120
 he'll acquire later. That's kind of interesting. Do you think of computation and computer science?

18:51.120 --> 18:56.400
 And you kind of represent that to me is maybe that's the modern day. You, in a sense, are the

18:56.400 --> 19:03.840
 new philosopher by sort of the computer scientist who dares to ask the bigger questions that

19:03.840 --> 19:09.280
 philosophy originally started. Is the new philosopher? Certainly not me, I think. I'm

19:09.280 --> 19:14.240
 mostly still this child that grows up in a very beautiful valley and looks at the world from

19:14.240 --> 19:18.640
 the outside and tries to understand what's going on. And my teachers tell me things and they largely

19:18.640 --> 19:23.440
 don't make sense. So I have to make my own models. I have to discover the foundations of what the

19:23.440 --> 19:27.840
 others are saying. I have to try to fix them to be charitable. I try to understand what they must

19:27.840 --> 19:32.640
 have thought originally over their teachers or their teacher's teachers must have thought until

19:32.640 --> 19:36.800
 everything got lost in translation and how to make sense of the reality that we are in.

19:36.800 --> 19:42.080
 And whenever I have an original idea, I'm usually late to the party by say 400 years. And the only

19:42.080 --> 19:46.320
 thing that's good is that the parties get smaller and smaller the older I get and the more I explore.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.840
 The parties get smaller and more exclusive.

19:49.840 --> 19:56.160
 And more exclusive. So it seems like one of the key qualities of your upbringing was that you

19:56.160 --> 20:02.320
 were not tethered, whether it's because of your parents or in general, maybe you're something

20:02.320 --> 20:08.640
 within your mind, some genetic material, they were not tethered to the ideas of the general

20:08.640 --> 20:15.680
 populace, which is actually a unique property where kind of the education system and whatever,

20:15.680 --> 20:21.120
 not education system, just existing in this world forces certain sets of ideas onto you.

20:21.120 --> 20:28.480
 Can you disentangle that? Why are you not so tethered? Even in your work today,

20:28.480 --> 20:38.400
 you seem to not care about perhaps a best paper in Europe, right? Being tethered to particular

20:38.400 --> 20:44.960
 things that current today in this year, people seem to value as a thing you put on your CV and

20:44.960 --> 20:50.160
 resume. You're a little bit more outside of that world, outside of the world of ideas that people

20:50.160 --> 20:56.240
 are especially focusing the benchmarks of today, the things. Can you disentangle that? Because

20:56.240 --> 21:00.720
 I think that's inspiring. And if there were more people like that, we might be able to solve some

21:00.720 --> 21:07.360
 of the bigger problems that sort of AI dreams to solve. And there's a big danger in this,

21:07.360 --> 21:13.520
 because in a way you are expected to marry into an intellectual tradition and visit this tradition

21:13.520 --> 21:18.560
 into a particular school. If everybody comes up with their own paradigms, the whole thing is not

21:18.560 --> 21:22.960
 cumulative as an enterprise, right? So in some sense, you need a healthy balance,

21:22.960 --> 21:27.760
 you need paradigmatic thinkers, and you need people that work within given paradigms. Basically,

21:27.760 --> 21:33.040
 scientists today define themselves largely by methods. And it's almost a disease that we think

21:33.040 --> 21:39.280
 as a scientist, somebody who was convinced by their guidance counselor that they should join

21:39.280 --> 21:43.040
 a particular discipline, and then they find a good mentor to learn the right methods. And then

21:43.040 --> 21:48.160
 they are lucky enough and privileged enough to join the right team. And then their name will

21:48.160 --> 21:53.600
 show up on influential papers. But we also see that there are diminishing returns with this approach.

21:54.160 --> 22:00.240
 And when our field computer science and AI started, most of the people that joined this field

22:00.240 --> 22:06.240
 had interesting opinions. And today's thinkers in AI either don't have interesting opinions at all,

22:06.240 --> 22:09.840
 or these opinions are inconsequential for what they're actually doing. Because what they're

22:09.840 --> 22:16.880
 doing is they apply the state of the art methods with a small epsilon. And this is often a good

22:16.880 --> 22:22.400
 idea if you think that this is the best way to make progress. And for me, it's first of all,

22:22.400 --> 22:28.160
 very boring. If somebody else can do it, why should I do it? If the current methods of machine

22:28.160 --> 22:33.760
 learning lead to strong AI, why should I be doing it? Well, just wait until they're done and wait

22:33.760 --> 22:41.120
 until they do this on the beach or read interesting books or write some and have fun. But if you don't

22:41.120 --> 22:46.320
 think that we are currently doing the right thing, if we are missing some perspectives,

22:46.320 --> 22:52.400
 then it's required to think outside of the box. It's also required to understand the boxes.

22:53.280 --> 22:59.200
 But it's necessary to understand what worked and what didn't work and for what reasons.

22:59.200 --> 23:04.240
 So you have to be willing to ask new questions and design new methods whenever you want to answer

23:04.240 --> 23:09.280
 them. And you have to be willing to dismiss the existing methods if you think that they're not

23:09.280 --> 23:16.960
 going to yield the right answers. It's very bad career advice to do that. So maybe to briefly

23:16.960 --> 23:23.440
 stay for one more time in the early days, when would you say for you was the dream

23:23.440 --> 23:29.680
 before we dive into the discussions that we just almost started? When was the dream to understand

23:29.680 --> 23:37.840
 or maybe to create human level intelligence born for you? I think that you can see AI largely today

23:37.840 --> 23:45.680
 as advanced information processing. If you would change the acronym of AI into that, most people

23:45.680 --> 23:49.840
 in the field would be happy. It would not change anything what they're doing. We're automating

23:49.840 --> 23:56.720
 statistics. And many of the statistical models are more advanced than what statisticians had in

23:56.720 --> 24:03.040
 the past. And it's pretty good work. It's very productive. And the other aspect of AI is philosophical

24:03.040 --> 24:08.640
 project. And this philosophical project is very risky. And very few people work on it. And it's

24:08.640 --> 24:15.360
 not clear if it succeeds. So first of all, you keep throwing a lot of really interesting ideas.

24:15.360 --> 24:21.920
 And I have to pick which ones we go with. But first of all, you use the term information

24:21.920 --> 24:30.960
 processing, just information processing, as if it's the mere, it's the muck of existence,

24:30.960 --> 24:37.200
 as if it's the epitome that the entirety of the universe might be information processing,

24:37.200 --> 24:40.400
 the consciousness, the intelligence might be information processing. So that maybe you can

24:40.400 --> 24:49.520
 comment on if the advanced information processing is a limiting round of ideas. And then the other

24:49.520 --> 24:55.440
 one is, what do you mean by the philosophical project? So I suspect that general intelligence is

24:55.440 --> 25:02.160
 the result of trying to solve general problems. So intelligence, I think, is the ability to model.

25:02.160 --> 25:07.280
 It's not necessarily goal directed rationality or something. Many intelligent people are bad at this.

25:07.280 --> 25:13.440
 But it's the ability to be presented with a number of patterns and see a structure in those

25:13.440 --> 25:20.560
 patterns and be able to predict the next set of patterns to make sense of things. And some problems

25:20.560 --> 25:25.120
 are very general. Usually intelligence serves control. So you make these models for a particular

25:25.120 --> 25:30.880
 purpose of interacting as an agent with the world and getting certain results. But the intelligence

25:30.880 --> 25:35.520
 itself is in the sense instrumental to something. But by itself, it's just the ability to make models.

25:35.520 --> 25:40.000
 And some of the problems are so general that the system that makes them needs to understand

25:40.000 --> 25:44.800
 what itself is and how it relates to the environment. So as a child, for instance,

25:44.800 --> 25:50.320
 you notice you do certain things despite you perceiving yourself as wanting different things.

25:50.320 --> 25:55.600
 So you become aware of your own psychology. You become aware of the fact that you have

25:55.600 --> 25:59.760
 complex structure in yourself and you need to model yourself, to reverse engineer yourself,

25:59.760 --> 26:04.560
 to be able to predict how you will react to certain situations and how you deal with yourself

26:04.560 --> 26:09.760
 in relationship to your environment. And this process, if this project, if you reverse engineer

26:09.760 --> 26:14.160
 yourself in your relationship to reality in the nature of a universe that can contain you,

26:14.160 --> 26:19.280
 if you go all the way, this is basically the project of AI or you could say the project of AI

26:19.280 --> 26:24.640
 is a very important component in it. The true Turing test in a way is you ask a system,

26:24.640 --> 26:30.640
 what is intelligence? If that system is able to explain what it is, how it works,

26:30.640 --> 26:36.640
 then you should assign it the property of being intelligent in this general sense. So the test

26:36.640 --> 26:41.200
 that Turing was administering in a way, I don't think that he couldn't see it, but he didn't

26:41.200 --> 26:47.760
 express it yet in the original 1950 paper, is that he was trying to find out whether he was

26:47.760 --> 26:51.280
 generally intelligent. Because in order to take this test, the rub is, of course,

26:51.280 --> 26:55.120
 you need to be able to understand what the system is saying. And we don't yet know if we

26:55.120 --> 26:59.840
 can build an AI. We don't yet know if we are generally intelligent. Basically, you win the

26:59.840 --> 27:06.720
 Turing test by building an AI. Yes. So in a sense, hidden within the Turing test is a kind of recursive

27:06.720 --> 27:12.480
 test. Yes, it's a test on us. The Turing test is basically a test of the conjecture whether people

27:12.480 --> 27:18.080
 are intelligent enough to understand themselves. Okay, but you also mentioned a little bit of a

27:18.080 --> 27:23.200
 self awareness. And then the project of AI, do you think this kind of emergent self awareness

27:23.200 --> 27:30.640
 is one of the fundamental aspects of intelligence? So as opposed to goal oriented, as you said,

27:30.640 --> 27:38.560
 kind of puzzle solving, is coming to grips with the idea that you're an agent in the world.

27:39.440 --> 27:44.560
 Find that many highly intelligent people are not very self aware, right? So self awareness

27:44.560 --> 27:48.880
 and intelligence are not the same thing. And you can also be self aware if you have good

27:48.880 --> 27:54.000
 priorities, especially without being especially intelligent. So you don't need to be very good

27:54.000 --> 27:58.080
 at solving puzzles if the system that you are already implements the solution.

27:58.800 --> 28:06.320
 But I do find intelligence, you kind of mentioned children, right? Is that the fundamental project

28:06.320 --> 28:14.000
 of AI is to create the learning system that's able to exist in the world. So you kind of drew a

28:14.000 --> 28:21.600
 difference in self awareness and intelligence. And yet you said that the self awareness seems

28:21.600 --> 28:27.440
 to be important for children. So I call this ability to make sense of the world and your own

28:27.440 --> 28:32.240
 place in it. So to make you able to understand what you're doing in this world, sentience.

28:32.240 --> 28:35.920
 And I would distinguish sentience from intelligence because sentience is

28:37.040 --> 28:41.680
 possessing certain classes of models. And intelligence is a way to get to these models

28:41.680 --> 28:50.000
 if you don't already have them. I see. So can you maybe pause a bit and try to

28:51.680 --> 28:57.120
 answer the question that we just said we may not be able to answer? And it might be a recursive

28:57.120 --> 29:02.960
 meta question of what is intelligence? I think that intelligence is the ability to make models.

29:03.840 --> 29:09.920
 So models, I think it's useful as examples, very popular now, neural networks,

29:09.920 --> 29:19.520
 form representations of large scale data set. They form models of those data sets.

29:20.080 --> 29:24.960
 When you say models and look at today's neural networks, what are the difference of how you're

29:24.960 --> 29:30.800
 thinking about what is intelligent in saying that intelligence is the process of making models?

29:31.520 --> 29:37.040
 Two aspects to this question. One is the representation as the representation adequate

29:37.040 --> 29:42.880
 for the domain that we want to represent. And the other one is the type of the model that you

29:42.880 --> 29:49.600
 arrive at adequate. So basically, are you modeling the correct domain? And I think in both of these

29:50.240 --> 29:55.040
 cases, modern AI is lacking still. And I think that I'm not saying anything new here. I'm not

29:55.040 --> 30:02.400
 criticizing the field. Most of the people that design our paradigms are aware of that. And so one

30:02.400 --> 30:07.600
 aspect that we are missing is unified learning. When we learn, we at some point discover that

30:07.600 --> 30:13.200
 everything that we sense is part of the same object, which means we learn it all into one model.

30:13.200 --> 30:17.040
 And we call this model the universe. So an experience of the world that we are embedded on

30:17.040 --> 30:22.320
 is not a secret direct wire to physical reality. Physical reality is a weird quantum graph that

30:22.320 --> 30:27.840
 we can never experience or get access to. But it has these properties that it can create certain

30:27.840 --> 30:32.720
 patterns that our systemic interface to the world. And we make sense of these patterns and the relationship

30:32.720 --> 30:37.520
 between the patterns that we discover is what we call the physical universe. So at some point in

30:37.520 --> 30:45.680
 our development as a nervous system, we discover that everything that we relate to in the world

30:45.680 --> 30:50.800
 can be mapped to a region in the same three dimensional space by and large. We now know

30:50.800 --> 30:54.640
 in physics that this is not quite true. The world is not actually three dimensional,

30:54.640 --> 30:58.880
 but the world that we are entangled with at the level which we are entangled with is largely

30:58.880 --> 31:04.960
 a flat three dimensional space. And so this is the model that our brain is intuitively making.

31:04.960 --> 31:10.400
 And this is, I think, what gave rise to this intuition of res extensor of this material world,

31:10.400 --> 31:14.160
 this material domain. It's one of the mental domains, but it's just the class of all models

31:14.160 --> 31:18.640
 that relate to this environment, this three dimensional physics engine in which we are

31:18.640 --> 31:28.240
 embedded physics engine, which we're embedded. I love that, right? Just slowly pause. So the

31:28.240 --> 31:34.400
 quantum graph, I think you called it, which is the real world, which you can never get access to,

31:34.400 --> 31:40.560
 there's a bunch of questions I want to sort of disentangle that, but maybe one useful one,

31:40.560 --> 31:44.640
 one of your recent talks I looked at, can you just describe the basics? Can you talk about

31:44.640 --> 31:50.000
 what is dualism, what is idealism, what is materialism, what is functionalism, and what connects

31:50.000 --> 31:53.920
 with you most in terms of, because you just mentioned, there's a reality we don't have access to,

31:53.920 --> 32:00.800
 okay? What does that even mean? And why don't we get access to it? Are we part of that reality?

32:00.800 --> 32:06.160
 Why can't we access it? So the particular trajectory that mostly exists in the West

32:06.160 --> 32:11.360
 is the result of our indoctrination by a cult for 2000 years. A cult, which one?

32:11.360 --> 32:18.400
 Yes, the Catholic cult mostly. And for better or worse, it has created or defined many of

32:18.400 --> 32:23.120
 the modes of interaction that we have that has created this society, but it has also in some

32:23.120 --> 32:32.400
 sense scarred our rationality. And the intuition that exists, if you would translate the mythology

32:32.400 --> 32:37.680
 of the Catholic Church into the modern world is that the world in which you and me interact

32:37.680 --> 32:42.880
 is something like a multiplayer roleplaying adventure. And the money and the objects that

32:42.880 --> 32:49.280
 we have in this world, this is all not real. Eastern philosophers would say it's Maya. It's

32:49.280 --> 32:55.280
 just stuff that appears to be meaningful, and this embedding in this meaning, and if you believe

32:55.280 --> 33:00.880
 in it, it's Samsara. It's basically the identification with the needs of the mundane,

33:00.880 --> 33:07.600
 secular everyday existence. And the Catholics also introduced the notion of higher meaning,

33:07.600 --> 33:13.280
 the sacred. And this existed before, but eventually the natural shape of God is the

33:13.280 --> 33:17.280
 platonic form of the civilization that you're part of. It's basically the superorganism that is

33:17.280 --> 33:24.000
 formed by the individuals as an intentional agent. And basically, the Catholics used a relatively

33:24.000 --> 33:29.280
 crude mythology to implement software on the minds of people and get the software synchronized to

33:29.280 --> 33:36.560
 make them walk on lockstep to basically get this God online and to make it efficient and effective.

33:36.560 --> 33:42.480
 And I think God technically is just a self that spends multiple brains as opposed to your and

33:42.480 --> 33:47.760
 myself, which mostly exists just on one brain, right? And so in some sense, you can construct a

33:47.760 --> 33:53.680
 self functionally as a function that is implemented by brains that exists across brains. And this is

33:53.680 --> 33:58.640
 a God with a small g. That's one of the, if you have all Harari kind of talking about,

33:59.920 --> 34:04.560
 this is one of the nice features of our brains, it seems to that we can all download the same

34:04.560 --> 34:09.280
 piece of software like God in this case and kind of share it. Yeah. So basically, you give everybody

34:09.280 --> 34:16.560
 a spec and the mathematical constraints that are intrinsic to information processing make sure

34:16.560 --> 34:21.600
 that given the same spec, you come up with a compatible structure. Okay. So that's, there's

34:21.600 --> 34:27.200
 the space of ideas that we'll share. And we think that's kind of the mind. But that's separate from

34:27.200 --> 34:35.200
 the idea is from Christianity, from religion is that there's a separate thing between the mind.

34:35.200 --> 34:40.160
 There is a real world. And this real world is the world in which God exists. God is the

34:40.160 --> 34:45.280
 quarter of the multiplayer adventure, so to speak. And we are all players in this game.

34:45.920 --> 34:51.200
 And that's dualism, you would say. But the dualism aspect is because the mental realm

34:51.200 --> 34:57.200
 exists in a different implementation than a physical realm. And the mental realm is real.

34:57.200 --> 35:01.440
 And a lot of people have this intuition that there is this real room in which you and me

35:01.440 --> 35:07.760
 talk and speak right now, then comes a layer of physics and abstract rules and so on. And then

35:07.760 --> 35:12.720
 comes another real room where our souls are. And our true form isn't a thing that gives us

35:12.720 --> 35:17.120
 phenomenal experience. And this is, of course, a very confused notion that you would get.

35:17.120 --> 35:24.640
 And it's basically the result of connecting materialism and idealism in the wrong way.

35:24.640 --> 35:31.840
 So, okay. I apologize, but I think it's really helpful if we just try to define terms. What

35:31.840 --> 35:34.880
 is dualism? What is idealism? What is materialism for people who don't know?

35:34.880 --> 35:39.520
 So, the idea of dualism in our cultural tradition is that there are two substances,

35:39.520 --> 35:45.600
 a mental substance and a physical substance. And they interact by different rules. And the

35:45.600 --> 35:51.600
 physical world is basically causally closed and is built on a low level causal structure. So,

35:51.600 --> 35:55.520
 they're basically a bottom level that is causally closed that's entirely mechanical

35:56.160 --> 36:00.240
 and mechanical in the widest sense. So, it's computational. There's basically a physical

36:00.240 --> 36:05.200
 world in which information flows around and physics describes the laws of how information

36:05.200 --> 36:09.680
 flows around in this world. Would you compare it to like a computer where you have a hardware

36:09.680 --> 36:14.080
 and software? The computer is a generalization of information flowing around basically,

36:14.080 --> 36:19.360
 but you won't discover that there is a universal principle. You can define this universal machine

36:20.240 --> 36:25.200
 that is able to perform all the computations. So, all these machines have the same power.

36:25.200 --> 36:29.120
 This means that you can always define a translation between them as long as they have

36:29.120 --> 36:34.320
 unlimited memory to be able to perform each other's computations.

36:34.320 --> 36:39.760
 So, would you then say that materialism is this whole world is just the hardware and idealism

36:39.760 --> 36:44.480
 is this whole world is just the software? Not quite. I think that most idealists don't have

36:44.480 --> 36:48.560
 a notion of software yet because software also comes down to information processing.

36:49.520 --> 36:54.560
 So, what you notice is the only thing that is real to you and me is this experiential world in

36:54.560 --> 36:59.040
 which things matter, in which things have taste, in which things have color, phenomenal content,

36:59.040 --> 37:01.840
 and so on. And you realize that. You are bringing up consciousness, okay.

37:01.840 --> 37:07.840
 And this is distinct from the physical world in which things have values in only in an abstract

37:07.840 --> 37:15.520
 sense. And you only look at cold patterns moving around. So, how does anything feel like something?

37:15.520 --> 37:19.200
 And this connection between the two things is very puzzling to a lot of people,

37:19.200 --> 37:23.360
 of course, too many philosophers. So, idealism starts out with the notion that mind is primary.

37:23.360 --> 37:30.480
 Materialism thinks that matter is primary. And so, for the idealist, the material patterns that we

37:30.480 --> 37:37.280
 say are playing out are part of the dream that the mind is dreaming. And we exist in mind on a

37:37.280 --> 37:43.920
 higher plane of existence, if you want. And for the materialist, there is only this material

37:43.920 --> 37:50.160
 thing and that generates some models and we are the result of these models. And in some sense,

37:50.160 --> 37:54.720
 I don't think that we should understand, if you understand it properly, materialism and

37:55.440 --> 37:59.760
 idealism is a dichotomy, but there's two different aspects of the same thing.

37:59.760 --> 38:04.000
 So, the weird thing is we don't exist in the physical world. We do exist inside of a story

38:04.000 --> 38:14.240
 that the brain tells itself. Okay. Let me, my information processing, take that in.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.080
 We don't exist in the physical world. We exist in the narrative.

38:18.080 --> 38:22.160
 Basically, a brain cannot feel anything. A New Yorker cannot feel anything. They're physical

38:22.160 --> 38:26.720
 things. Physical systems are unable to experience anything. But it would be very useful for the

38:26.720 --> 38:30.960
 brain or for the organism to know what it would be like to be a person and to feel something.

38:31.600 --> 38:36.880
 So, the brain creates a simulacrum of such a person that it uses to model the interactions of

38:36.880 --> 38:41.840
 the person. It's the best model of what that brain, this organism thinks it is in relationship to

38:41.840 --> 38:46.160
 its environment. So, it creates that model. It's a story, a multimedia novel that the brain is

38:46.160 --> 38:51.520
 continuously writing and updating. But you also kind of said that, you said that we kind of exist

38:51.520 --> 39:05.040
 in that story. What is real in any of this? So, again, these terms are, you kind of said there's

39:05.040 --> 39:12.400
 a quantum graph. I mean, what is this whole thing running on then? Is this story, and is it completely,

39:12.400 --> 39:17.280
 fundamentally impossible to get access to it? Because isn't the story supposed to,

39:17.280 --> 39:24.240
 isn't the brain in something existing in some kind of context?

39:24.240 --> 39:30.480
 So, what we can identify as computer scientists, we can engineer systems and test our theories

39:30.480 --> 39:36.560
 this way that might have the necessary insufficient properties to produce the phenomena that we are

39:36.560 --> 39:42.000
 observing, which is there is a self in a virtual world that is generated in somebody's New York

39:42.000 --> 39:47.760
 cortex that is contained in the skull of this primate here. And when I point at this, this

39:47.760 --> 39:54.640
 indexicality is of course wrong. But I do create something that is likely to give rise to patterns

39:54.640 --> 40:00.000
 on your retina that allow you to interpret what I'm saying. But we both know that the world that

40:00.000 --> 40:04.800
 you and me are seeing is not the real physical world. What we are seeing is a virtual reality

40:04.800 --> 40:08.000
 generated in your brain to explain the patterns on your retina.

40:08.000 --> 40:15.600
 How close is it to the real world? That's kind of the question. When you have people like

40:15.600 --> 40:21.200
 Donald Hoffman, let's say that you're really far away. The thing we're seeing, you and I now,

40:21.200 --> 40:26.640
 that interface we have is very far away from anything. We don't even have anything close

40:26.640 --> 40:32.000
 like to the sense of what the real world is. Or is it a very surface piece of architecture?

40:32.000 --> 40:37.040
 Imagine you look at the Mandelbrot fractal, right? This famous thing that when Mandelbrot

40:37.040 --> 40:43.040
 is covered, you see an overall shape in there, right? But if you truly understand it,

40:43.040 --> 40:50.080
 you know it's two lines of code. It's basically in a series that is being tested for complex

40:50.080 --> 40:55.520
 numbers in the complex number plane for every point. And for those where the series is diverging,

40:56.320 --> 41:04.160
 you paint this black. And where it's converging, you don't. And you get the intermediate colors

41:04.160 --> 41:13.040
 by taking how far it diverges. This gives you this shape of this fractal. But imagine you live

41:13.040 --> 41:18.160
 inside of this fractal and you don't have access to where you are in the fractal. Or you have not

41:18.160 --> 41:23.520
 discovered the generator function even. So what you see is all I can see right now is this viral.

41:23.520 --> 41:27.280
 And this viral moves a little bit to the right. Is this an accurate model of reality? Yes,

41:27.280 --> 41:33.360
 it is. It is an adequate description. You know that there is actually no spiral in the Mandelbrot

41:33.360 --> 41:38.640
 fractal. It only appears like this to an observer that is interpreting things as a two dimensional

41:38.640 --> 41:43.440
 space and then defines certain regularities in there at a certain scale that it currently

41:43.440 --> 41:46.880
 observes. Because if you zoom in, the spiral might disappear and turn out to be something

41:46.880 --> 41:50.880
 different at a different resolution, right? So at this level, you have the spiral and then you

41:50.880 --> 41:55.280
 discover the spiral moves to the right and at some point it disappears. So you have a singularity.

41:55.280 --> 42:00.320
 At this point, your model is no longer valid. You cannot predict what happens beyond the singularity.

42:00.320 --> 42:04.640
 But you can observe again and you will see it hit another spiral and at this point it

42:04.640 --> 42:09.280
 disappeared. So maybe now have a second order law. And if you make 30 layers of these laws,

42:09.280 --> 42:13.280
 then you have a description of the world that is similar to the one that we come up with when we

42:13.280 --> 42:18.400
 describe the reality around us. It's reasonably predictive. It does not cut to the core of it.

42:18.400 --> 42:23.520
 So you explain how it's being generated, how it actually works. But it's relatively good to

42:23.520 --> 42:27.040
 explain the universe that we are entangled with. But you don't think the tools of computer science

42:27.040 --> 42:33.120
 or the tools of physics could step outside, see the whole drawing and get at the basic

42:33.120 --> 42:39.280
 mechanism of how the spiral is generated. Imagine you would find yourself embedded

42:39.280 --> 42:43.280
 into a motherboard fractal and you try to figure out what works. And you have somehow of a Turing

42:43.280 --> 42:49.920
 machine with enough memory to think. And as a result, you come to this idea, it must be some

42:49.920 --> 42:54.320
 kind of automaton. And maybe you just enumerate all the possible automata until you get to the

42:54.320 --> 42:59.280
 one that produces your reality. So you can identify necessary and sufficient condition.

42:59.280 --> 43:04.800
 For instance, we discover that mathematics itself is the domain of all languages. And then we see

43:04.800 --> 43:09.520
 that most of the domains of mathematics that we have discovered are in some sense describing

43:09.520 --> 43:13.600
 the same fractals. This is what category theory is obsessed about, that you can map these different

43:13.600 --> 43:18.720
 domains to each other. So they're not that many fractals. And some of these have interesting

43:18.720 --> 43:25.600
 structure and symmetry breaks. And so you can discover what region of this global fractal

43:25.600 --> 43:29.680
 you might be embedded in from first principles. But the only way you can get there is from

43:29.680 --> 43:34.320
 first principles. So basically, your understanding of the universe has to start with automata and

43:34.320 --> 43:39.280
 then number theory and then spaces and so on. Yeah, I think like Stephen Wolfram still dreams

43:39.280 --> 43:45.760
 that he'll be able to arrive at the fundamental rules of the cellular automata or the generalization

43:45.760 --> 43:54.160
 of which is behind our universe. You've said on this topic, you said in a recent conversation

43:54.160 --> 44:00.560
 that quote, some people think that a simulation can't be conscious and only a physical system can.

44:00.560 --> 44:05.840
 But they got it completely backward. A physical system cannot be conscious. Only a simulation

44:05.840 --> 44:11.920
 can be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property, the simulated self. Just like you said,

44:11.920 --> 44:18.480
 the mind is kind of the we call it story narrative. There's a simulation or so our mind is essentially

44:18.480 --> 44:25.520
 a simulation. Usually, I try to use the terminology so that the mind is basically a principles

44:25.520 --> 44:30.480
 that produce the simulation. It's the software that is implemented by your brain. And the mind

44:30.480 --> 44:37.200
 is creating both the universe that we are in and the self, the idea of a person that is on the other

44:37.200 --> 44:43.120
 side of attention and is embedded in this world. Why is that important, that idea of a self?

44:43.120 --> 44:49.760
 Why is that an important feature in the simulation? It's basically a result of the purpose that the

44:49.760 --> 44:54.560
 mind has. It's a tool for modeling. We are not actually monkeys. We are side effects of the

44:54.560 --> 45:02.320
 regulation needs of monkeys. And what the monkey has to regulate is the relationship of an organism

45:02.320 --> 45:09.280
 to an outside world that is in large part also consisting of other organisms. And as a result,

45:09.280 --> 45:13.920
 it basically has regulation targets that it tries to get to. These regulation targets start with

45:13.920 --> 45:18.160
 priors. They're basically like unconditional reflexes that we are more or less born with.

45:18.160 --> 45:22.640
 And then we can reverse engineer them to make them more consistent. And then we get more detailed

45:22.640 --> 45:27.600
 models about how the world works and how to interact with it. And so these priors that you

45:27.600 --> 45:33.600
 commit to are largely target values that our needs should approach, set points. And this deviation

45:33.600 --> 45:39.840
 to the set point creates some urge, some tension. And we find ourselves living inside of feedback

45:39.840 --> 45:44.960
 loops, right? Consciousness emerges over dimensions of disagreements with the universe. Things where

45:44.960 --> 45:50.320
 you care, things are not the way they should be, but you need to regulate. And so in some sense,

45:50.320 --> 45:54.960
 the sense itself is the result of all the identifications that you're having. And identification

45:54.960 --> 45:59.600
 is a regulation target that you're committing to. It's a dimension that you care about. What you

45:59.600 --> 46:05.280
 think is important. And this is also what locks you in. If you let go of these commitments of

46:05.280 --> 46:10.480
 these identifications, you get free. There's nothing that you have to do anymore. And if you

46:10.480 --> 46:14.080
 let go of all of them, you're completely free and you can enter Nirvana because you're done.

46:15.280 --> 46:20.480
 And actually, this is a good time to pause and say thank you to a sort of friend of mine,

46:20.480 --> 46:25.600
 Gustav Sorastrum, who introduced me to your work. I want to give him a shout out. He's a

46:25.600 --> 46:30.000
 brilliant guy. And I think the AI community is actually quite amazing. And Gustav is a good

46:30.000 --> 46:34.800
 representative of that. You are as well. So I'm glad, first of all, I'm glad the internet exists,

46:34.800 --> 46:41.200
 the YouTube exists, where I can watch your talks and then get to your book and study your writing

46:41.200 --> 46:47.600
 and think about, you know, that's amazing. Okay, but you've kind of described instead of this

46:47.600 --> 46:53.200
 emergent phenomenon of consciousness from the simulation. So what about the hard problem of

46:53.200 --> 47:03.120
 consciousness? Can you just linger on it? Like, why does it still feel like I understand you're

47:03.120 --> 47:09.040
 kind of the self is an important part of the simulation. But why does the simulation feel

47:09.040 --> 47:14.960
 like something? So if you look at a book by say, George R. R. Martin, where the characters have

47:14.960 --> 47:19.920
 plausible psychology, and they stand on a hill, because they want to conquer the city below the

47:19.920 --> 47:23.520
 hill, and they're done in it, and they look at the color of the sky, and they are apprehensive,

47:24.080 --> 47:27.840
 and feel empowered and all these things. Why do they have these emotions? It's because it's

47:27.840 --> 47:31.920
 written into the story, right? And it's written to the story because it's an adequate model of

47:31.920 --> 47:37.360
 the person that predicts what they're going to do next. And the same thing has happened too far.

47:37.360 --> 47:41.680
 So it's basically a story that our brain is writing. It's not written in words. It's written

47:41.680 --> 47:48.160
 in perceptual content, basically multimedia content. And it's a model of what the person

47:48.160 --> 47:54.800
 would feel if it existed. So it's a virtual person. And you and me happen to be this virtual person.

47:54.800 --> 47:59.760
 So this virtual person gets access to the language center and talks about the sky being blue.

48:00.400 --> 48:05.520
 And this is us. But hold on a second. Do I exist in your simulation?

48:05.520 --> 48:13.760
 You do exist in an almost similar way as me. So there are internal states that are less accessible

48:14.640 --> 48:20.640
 for me that you have, and so on. And my model might not be completely adequate.

48:20.640 --> 48:25.120
 There are also things that I might perceive about you that you don't perceive. But in some sense,

48:25.120 --> 48:31.520
 both you and me are some puppets, two puppets that enact this play in my mind. And I identify with

48:31.520 --> 48:36.960
 one of them because I can control one of the puppet directly. And with the other one, I can

48:36.960 --> 48:41.760
 create things in between. So for instance, we can go on an interaction that even leads to a

48:41.760 --> 48:47.120
 coupling to a feedback loop. So we can sync things together in a certain way or feel things together.

48:47.120 --> 48:51.680
 But this coupling itself is not a physical phenomenon. It's entirely a software phenomenon.

48:51.680 --> 48:54.960
 It's the result of two different implementations interacting with each other.

48:54.960 --> 49:02.080
 So that's interesting. So are you suggesting, like the way you think about it, is the entirety

49:02.080 --> 49:07.520
 of existence, the simulation, and where kind of each mind is a little sub simulation?

49:08.640 --> 49:17.840
 That like, why don't you, why doesn't your mind have access to my mind's full state?

49:18.560 --> 49:22.880
 Like, for the same reason that my mind doesn't have access to its own full state.

49:22.880 --> 49:30.800
 There is no trick involved. So basically, when I know something about myself, it's because I

49:30.800 --> 49:35.760
 made a model. So what part of your brain is tasked with modeling what other parts of your brain are

49:35.760 --> 49:41.600
 doing? Yes. But there seems to be an incredible consistency about this world in the physical

49:41.600 --> 49:47.600
 sense that there's repeatable experiments and so on. How does that fit into our silly

49:47.600 --> 49:53.120
 the center of the ape's simulation of the world? So why is everything so repeatable?

49:53.120 --> 49:58.080
 And not everything. There's a lot of fundamental physics experiments that are repeatable

49:59.600 --> 50:05.040
 for a long time, all over the place, and so on. The laws of physics. How does that fit in?

50:05.040 --> 50:09.680
 It seems that the parts of the world that are not deterministic are not long lived.

50:10.400 --> 50:17.120
 So if you build a system, any kind of automaton, so if you build simulations of something,

50:17.120 --> 50:22.880
 you'll notice that the phenomena that endure are those that give rise to stable dynamics.

50:23.520 --> 50:27.200
 So basically, if you see anything that is complex in the world, it's the result of

50:27.200 --> 50:31.920
 usually of some control of some feedback that keeps it stable around certain attractors.

50:31.920 --> 50:36.640
 And the things that are not stable that don't give rise to certain harmonic patterns and so on,

50:36.640 --> 50:42.720
 they tend to get weeded out over time. So if we are in a region of the universe that

50:42.720 --> 50:49.120
 sustains complexity, which is required to implement minds like ours, this is going to be a region of

50:49.120 --> 50:54.240
 the universe that is very tightly controlled and controllable. So it's going to have lots of

50:54.240 --> 50:59.280
 interesting symmetries and also symmetry breaks that allow to the creation of structure.

51:00.480 --> 51:04.960
 But they exist where? So there's such an interesting idea that our mind is simulation

51:04.960 --> 51:14.240
 that's constructing the narrative. My question is just to try to understand how that fits with the

51:14.240 --> 51:18.400
 entirety of the universe. You're saying that there's a region of this universe that allows

51:18.400 --> 51:25.200
 enough complexity to create creatures like us. But what's the connection between the brain,

51:25.200 --> 51:30.400
 the mind, and the broader universe? Which comes first, which is more fundamental?

51:30.400 --> 51:35.520
 Is the mind the starting point, the universe is emergent? Is the universe the starting point,

51:35.520 --> 51:41.600
 the minds are emergent? I think quite clearly the latter. That's at least a much easier explanation

51:41.600 --> 51:46.720
 because it allows us to make causal models. And I don't see any way to construct an inverse

51:46.720 --> 51:53.760
 causality. So what happens when you die to your mind's simulation? My implementation ceases. So

51:53.760 --> 51:58.560
 basically the thing that implements myself will no longer be present, which means if I am not

51:58.560 --> 52:04.160
 implemented on the minds of other people, the thing that I identify with. The weird thing is I

52:04.160 --> 52:09.680
 don't actually have an identity beyond the identity that I construct. If I was the Dalai Lama,

52:10.400 --> 52:16.000
 he identifies as a form of government. So basically the Dalai Lama gets reborn, not because he's

52:16.000 --> 52:23.360
 confused, but because he is not identifying as a human being. He runs on a human being. He's

52:23.360 --> 52:28.960
 basically a governmental software that is instantiated in every new generation and you. So his

52:28.960 --> 52:34.000
 advice is to pick someone who does this in the next generation. So if you identify with this,

52:34.000 --> 52:38.960
 you are no longer a human and you don't die in the sense that what dies is only the body of the

52:38.960 --> 52:45.120
 human that you run on. To kill the Dalai Lama, you would have to kill his tradition. And if we

52:45.120 --> 52:49.520
 look at ourselves, we realize that we are to a small part like this, most of us. So for instance,

52:49.520 --> 52:54.880
 if you have children, you realize something lives on in them. Or if you spark an idea in the world,

52:54.880 --> 53:00.000
 something lives on. Or if you identify with a society around you, because you are in part that,

53:00.000 --> 53:04.880
 you're not just this human being. Yeah. So in a sense, you are kind of like a Dalai Lama.

53:04.880 --> 53:11.440
 In a sense that you, Joshua Bach, is just a collection of ideas. So you have this operating

53:11.440 --> 53:16.640
 system on which a bunch of ideas live and interact. And then once you die, some of them

53:16.640 --> 53:22.640
 jump off the ship. You put it the other way. Identity is a software state. It's a construction.

53:22.640 --> 53:28.720
 It's not physically real. Identity is not a physical concept. It's basically a representation

53:28.720 --> 53:36.960
 of different objects on the same world line. But identity lives and dies. Are you attached?

53:36.960 --> 53:43.440
 What's the fundamental thing? Is it the ideas that come together to form identity? Or is each

53:43.440 --> 53:47.440
 individual identity actually a fundamental thing? It's a representation that you can get

53:47.440 --> 53:52.320
 agency over if you care. So basically, you can choose what you identify with if you want to.

53:52.320 --> 54:03.920
 No, but it just seems, if the mind is not real, that the birth and death is not a crucial part

54:03.920 --> 54:15.360
 of it. Well, maybe I'm silly. Maybe I'm attached to this whole biological organism, but it seems

54:15.360 --> 54:22.480
 that the physical being a physical object in this world is an important aspect of birth

54:22.480 --> 54:28.640
 and death. It feels like it has to be physical to die. It feels like simulations don't have to die.

54:28.640 --> 54:33.360
 The physics that we experience is not the real physics. There is no color and sound in the real

54:33.360 --> 54:39.280
 world. Color and sound are types of representations that you get if you want to model reality with

54:39.280 --> 54:44.480
 oscillators. So colors and sound in some sense have octaves. And it's because they are represented

54:44.480 --> 54:50.960
 probably with oscillators. So that's why colors form a circle of use. And colors have harmonics,

54:50.960 --> 54:56.720
 sounds have harmonics as a result of synchronizing oscillators in the brain. So the world that we

54:56.720 --> 55:02.160
 subjectively interact with is fundamentally the result of the representation mechanisms in our

55:02.160 --> 55:06.640
 brain. They are mathematically to some degree universal. There are certain regularities that

55:06.640 --> 55:11.440
 you can discover in the patterns and not others. But the patterns that we get, this is not the real

55:11.440 --> 55:16.960
 world. The world that we interact with is always made of too many parts to count. So when you look

55:16.960 --> 55:22.160
 at this table and so on, it's consisting of so many molecules and atoms that you cannot count

55:22.160 --> 55:27.840
 them. So you only look at the aggregate dynamics, at limit dynamics. If you had almost infinitely

55:27.840 --> 55:32.880
 many particles, what would be the dynamics of the table? And this is roughly what you get.

55:32.880 --> 55:37.760
 So geometry that we are interacting with is the result of discovering those operators that

55:38.320 --> 55:43.120
 work in the limit that you get by building an infinite series that converges. For those parts

55:43.120 --> 55:47.280
 where it converges is geometry. For those parts where it doesn't converge, it's chaos.

55:47.280 --> 55:53.920
 Right. And then so all of that is filtered through the consciousness that's emergent in our

55:53.920 --> 55:59.040
 narrative. So the consciousness gives it color, gives it feeling, gives it flavor.

55:59.040 --> 56:05.120
 So I think the feeling, flavor and so on is given by the relationship that a feature has

56:05.120 --> 56:10.800
 to all the other features. It's basically a giant relational graph that is our subjective universe.

56:10.800 --> 56:15.920
 The color is given by those aspects of the representation or this experiential

56:15.920 --> 56:20.640
 color where you care about, where you have identifications, where something means something,

56:20.640 --> 56:25.120
 where you are the inside of a feedback loop and the dimensions of caring are basically

56:25.120 --> 56:28.560
 dimensions of this motivational system that we emerge over.

56:28.560 --> 56:33.840
 The meaning of the relations, the graph, can you elaborate that a little bit?

56:33.840 --> 56:39.840
 Like where does the, maybe we can even step back and ask the question of what is consciousness

56:39.840 --> 56:46.160
 to be more systematically? What do you, how do you think about consciousness?

56:46.160 --> 56:49.760
 I think that consciousness is largely a model of the contents of your attention.

56:49.760 --> 56:54.000
 It's a mechanism that has evolved for a certain type of learning.

56:54.000 --> 57:00.240
 At the moment, our machine learning systems largely work by building chains of weighted

57:00.240 --> 57:08.160
 sums of real numbers with some nonlinearity. And you learn by piping an error signal through

57:08.160 --> 57:14.320
 these different chained layers and adjusting the weights in these weighted sums.

57:14.320 --> 57:19.680
 And you can approximate most polynomials with this if you have enough training data.

57:19.680 --> 57:25.360
 But the price is you need to change a lot of these weights. Basically, the error is piped

57:25.360 --> 57:29.440
 backwards into the system until it accumulates at certain junctures in the network.

57:29.440 --> 57:33.760
 And everything else evens out statistically. And only at these junctures, this is where

57:33.760 --> 57:36.400
 you had the actual error in the network, you make the change there.

57:36.400 --> 57:40.880
 This is a very slow process. And our brains don't have enough time for that because we

57:40.880 --> 57:44.720
 don't get old enough to play go the way that our machines learn to play go.

57:44.720 --> 57:49.200
 So instead, what we do is an attention based learning. We pinpoint the probable region

57:49.200 --> 57:56.320
 in the network where we can make an improvement. And then we store this binding state together

57:56.320 --> 58:00.640
 with the expected outcome in a protocol. And this ability to make indexed memories

58:00.640 --> 58:04.480
 for the purpose of learning to revisit these commitments later.

58:04.480 --> 58:10.400
 This requires a memory of the contents of our attention. Another aspect is when I construct

58:10.400 --> 58:15.600
 my reality and make mistakes. So I see things that turn out to be reflections or shadows

58:15.600 --> 58:20.080
 and so on, which means I have to be able to point out which features of my perception

58:20.080 --> 58:25.920
 gave rise to the present construction of reality. So the system needs to pay attention

58:25.920 --> 58:31.920
 to the features that are currently in its focus. And it also needs to pay attention to

58:31.920 --> 58:35.280
 whether it pays attention itself, in part because the attentional system gets trained

58:35.280 --> 58:39.680
 with the same mechanism, so it's reflexive, but also in part because your attention lapses

58:39.680 --> 58:44.160
 if you don't pay attention to the attention itself. So it's the thing that I'm currently

58:44.160 --> 58:49.760
 seeing just a dream that my brain has spun off into some kind of daydream, or am I still

58:49.760 --> 58:54.160
 paying attention to my percept? So you have to periodically go back and see whether you're

58:54.160 --> 58:58.160
 still paying attention. And if you have this loop and you make it tight enough between the

58:58.160 --> 59:02.400
 system becoming aware of the contents of its attention and the fact that it's paying

59:02.400 --> 59:06.960
 attention itself and makes the object of its attention, I think this is the loop over which

59:06.960 --> 59:14.080
 we wake up. So there's this attentional mechanism that's somehow self referential that's fundamental

59:14.080 --> 59:20.400
 to what consciousness is. So just to ask you a question, I don't know how much you're familiar

59:20.400 --> 59:24.720
 with the recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. They use attentional mechanisms,

59:24.720 --> 59:35.040
 they use something called transformers to learn patterns and sentences by allowing them at work

59:35.040 --> 59:41.440
 to focus its attention to particular parts of the sentence at each individual. So parametrize

59:41.440 --> 59:49.120
 and make it learnable the dynamics of a sentence by having a little window into the sentence.

59:49.120 --> 59:56.080
 Do you think that's like a little step towards that eventually will take us to the

59:56.640 --> 59:59.520
 intentional mechanisms from which consciousness can emerge?

1:00:00.240 --> 1:00:05.920
 Not quite. I think it models only one aspect of attention. In the early days of automated

1:00:06.560 --> 1:00:11.200
 language translation, there was an example that I found particularly funny, where somebody

1:00:11.200 --> 1:00:16.080
 tried to translate a text from English into German and it was a bet broke the window.

1:00:16.080 --> 1:00:20.320
 And the translation in German was

1:00:20.320 --> 1:00:27.040
 eine Fliedermaus zerbracht das Fenster mit einem baseball Schläger. So to translate back into

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:34.400
 a bet, this flying mammal broke the window with a baseball bet. And it seemed to be the most

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:39.760
 similar to this program because it somehow maximized the possibility of translating

1:00:39.760 --> 1:00:44.400
 the concept bet into German in the same sentence. And this is some mistake that the

1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:49.200
 transformer model is not doing because it's tracking identity. And the attentional mechanism

1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:53.920
 in the transformer model is basically putting its finger on individual concepts and make sure

1:00:53.920 --> 1:01:00.320
 that these concepts pop up later in the text. And tracks basically the individuals through

1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:05.520
 the text. And this is why the system can learn things that other systems couldn't before it,

1:01:05.520 --> 1:01:09.520
 which makes it, for instance, possible to write a text where it talks about the scientist,

1:01:09.520 --> 1:01:15.200
 then the scientist has a name and has a pronoun, and it gets a consistent story about that thing.

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:19.520
 What it does not do, it doesn't fully integrate this. So this meaning falls apart at some point.

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:24.400
 It loses track of this context. It does not yet understand that everything that it says has to

1:01:24.400 --> 1:01:30.240
 refer to the same universe. And this is where this thing falls apart. But the attention in a

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:34.800
 transformer model does not go beyond tracking identity. And tracking identity is an important

1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:39.920
 part of attention. But it's a different, very specific attentional mechanism. And it's not

1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:42.480
 the one that gives rise to the type of consciousness that we have.

1:01:42.480 --> 1:01:46.640
 Okay, just to link on, what do you mean by identity in the context of language?

1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:52.480
 So when you talk about language, we have different words that can refer to the same concept.

1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:53.520
 Got it. And in the sense that...

1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:54.960
 It's a space of concepts.

1:01:54.960 --> 1:02:01.360
 Yes. And it can also be in a nominal sense or in an inexical sense that you say

1:02:01.360 --> 1:02:06.880
 where this word does not only refer to this class of objects, but it refers to a definite

1:02:06.880 --> 1:02:13.360
 object to some kind of agent that waves their way through the story and is only referred by

1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:19.440
 different ways in the language. So the language is basically a projection from a conceptual

1:02:19.440 --> 1:02:25.520
 representation from a scene that is evolving into a discrete string of symbols. And what

1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:31.280
 the transformer is able to do, it learns aspects of this projection mechanism that other models

1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:37.040
 couldn't learn. So have you ever seen an artificial intelligence or any kind of construction idea

1:02:37.040 --> 1:02:42.320
 that allows for unlike neural networks or perhaps within neural networks that's able to form

1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:49.760
 something where the space of concepts continues to be integrated? So what you're describing,

1:02:49.760 --> 1:02:56.640
 building a knowledge base, building this consistent larger and larger sets of ideas that would then

1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:02.720
 allow for a deeper understanding? Wittgenstein thought that we can build everything from language,

1:03:02.720 --> 1:03:07.440
 from basically a logical grammatical construct. And I think to some degree,

1:03:07.440 --> 1:03:12.560
 this was also what Minsky believed. So that's why he focused so much on common sense reasoning and

1:03:12.560 --> 1:03:18.880
 so on. And a project that was inspired by him was psych. That was basically...

1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:19.600
 That's still going on.

1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:23.680
 Yes. Of course, ideas don't die. Only people die.

1:03:23.680 --> 1:03:30.640
 Okay. That's true. And out psych is a productive project. It's just probably not one that is

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:35.520
 going to converge to general intelligence. The thing that Wittgenstein couldn't solve,

1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:40.160
 and he looked at this in his book at the end of his life, Philosophical Investigations,

1:03:40.160 --> 1:03:45.040
 was the notion of images. So images play an important role in tractatus. The tractatus

1:03:45.040 --> 1:03:49.040
 is an attempt to basically turn philosophy into logical probing language to design a

1:03:49.040 --> 1:03:53.760
 logical language in which you can do actual philosophy that's rich enough for doing this.

1:03:53.760 --> 1:04:00.000
 And the difficulty was to deal with perceptual content. And eventually, I think he decided

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:05.840
 that he was not able to solve it. And I think this preempted the failure of the logitist program

1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:10.800
 in AI. And the solution, as we see it today, is we need more general function approximation.

1:04:10.800 --> 1:04:15.360
 There are functions, geometric functions, that we learn to approximate that cannot be

1:04:15.360 --> 1:04:20.240
 efficiently expressed and computed in a grammatical language. We can, of course, build automata that

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:25.200
 go via number theory and so on, to learn in algebra, and then compute an approximation

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:31.760
 of this geometry. But to equate language and geometry is not an efficient way to think about it.

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:36.320
 So function where you kind of just said that neural networks are sort of,

1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:43.200
 the approach that neural networks takes is actually more general than what can be expressed

1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:50.080
 through language. Yes. So what can be efficiently expressed through language at the data rates

1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:55.600
 at which we process grammatical language? Okay, so you don't think languages, so you

1:04:55.600 --> 1:05:00.560
 just agree with Wittgenstein that language is not fundamental too? I agree with Wittgenstein.

1:05:00.560 --> 1:05:07.600
 I just agree with the late Wittgenstein. And I also agree with the beauty of the early Wittgenstein.

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:11.840
 I think that the Traktatus itself is probably the most beautiful philosophical text that was

1:05:11.840 --> 1:05:17.600
 written in the 20th century. But language is not fundamental to cognition and intelligence

1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:22.800
 and consciousness. So I think that language is a particular way, or the natural language that

1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:27.360
 we're using is a particular level of abstraction that we use to communicate with each other.

1:05:27.360 --> 1:05:33.760
 But the languages in which we express geometry are not grammatical languages in the same sense.

1:05:33.760 --> 1:05:37.440
 So they work slightly different. They're more general expressions of functions.

1:05:37.440 --> 1:05:42.400
 And I think the general nature of a model is you have a bunch of parameters.

1:05:43.440 --> 1:05:48.240
 These have a range. These are the variances of the world. And you have relationships between

1:05:48.240 --> 1:05:52.400
 them, which are constraints, which say if certain parameters have these values,

1:05:52.400 --> 1:05:58.880
 then other parameters have to have the following values. And this is a very early insight in

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:03.520
 computer science. And I think some of the earliest formulations is the Boltzmann machine.

1:06:03.520 --> 1:06:07.520
 And the problem with the Boltzmann machine is that while it has a measure of whether it's good,

1:06:07.520 --> 1:06:11.120
 this is basically the energy on the system, the amount of tension that you have left in the

1:06:11.120 --> 1:06:16.640
 constraints where the constraints don't quite match. It's very difficult to, despite having this

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:22.720
 global measure, to train it. Because as soon as you add more than trivially few elements,

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:26.880
 parameters into the system, it's very difficult to get it settled in the right architecture.

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:34.880
 And so the solution that Hinton and Zanowski found was to use a restricted Boltzmann machine,

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:39.520
 which uses the hidden links, the internal links in the Boltzmann machine and only

1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:44.560
 has basically input and output layer. But this limits the expressivity of the Boltzmann machine.

1:06:44.560 --> 1:06:48.960
 So now he builds a network of small of these primitive Boltzmann machines. And in some sense,

1:06:48.960 --> 1:06:53.440
 you can see almost continuous development from this to the deep learning models that we're using

1:06:53.440 --> 1:06:58.400
 today, even though we don't use Boltzmann machines at this point. But the idea of the Boltzmann

1:06:58.400 --> 1:07:02.640
 machine is you take this model, you clamp some of the values to perception, and this forces

1:07:02.640 --> 1:07:06.240
 the entire machine to go into a state that is compatible with the states that you currently

1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:12.560
 perceive. And this state is your model of the world. So I think it's a very general way of

1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:18.480
 thinking about models. But we have to use a different approach to make it work. And this is,

1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:23.040
 we have to find different networks that train the Boltzmann machine. So the mechanism that

1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:27.360
 trains the Boltzmann machine and the mechanism that makes the Boltzmann machine settle into its

1:07:27.360 --> 1:07:31.680
 state are distinct from the constrained architecture of the Boltzmann machine itself.

1:07:33.840 --> 1:07:36.400
 The kind of mechanism that we want to develop, you're saying?

1:07:36.400 --> 1:07:41.920
 Yes. So there's the direction in which I think our research is going to go. It's going to,

1:07:41.920 --> 1:07:46.800
 for instance, what you notice in perception is our perceptual models of the world are not

1:07:46.800 --> 1:07:51.680
 probabilistic, but possibilistic, which means you should be able to perceive things that are

1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:58.560
 improbable but possible. Perceptual state is valid, not if it's probable, but if it's possible,

1:07:58.560 --> 1:08:03.440
 if it's coherent. So if you see a tiger coming after you should be able to see this, even if

1:08:03.440 --> 1:08:10.560
 it's unlikely. And the probability is necessary for convergence of the model. So given the state

1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:16.880
 of possibilities that is very, very large and a set of perceptual features, how should you

1:08:16.880 --> 1:08:24.000
 change the states of the model to get it to converge with your perception? But the space of

1:08:25.280 --> 1:08:32.480
 ideas that are coherent with the context that you're sensing is perhaps not as large. That's

1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:38.240
 perhaps pretty small. The degree of coherence that you need to achieve depends, of course,

1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:44.000
 how deep your models go. For instance, politics is very simple when you know very little about

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.320
 game theory and human nature. So the younger you are, the more obvious it is how politics

1:08:48.320 --> 1:08:54.800
 should work, right? Because you get in a coherent aesthetics from relatively few inputs. And the

1:08:54.800 --> 1:09:00.400
 more layers you model, the more layers you model reality, the harder it gets to satisfy all the

1:09:00.400 --> 1:09:07.040
 constraints. So the current neural networks are a fundamentally supervised learning system with

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:12.240
 a feed forward neural network is back propagation to learn. What's your intuition about what kind

1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:19.920
 of mechanisms might we move towards to improve the learning procedure? I think one big aspect

1:09:19.920 --> 1:09:24.880
 is going to be meta learning. And architecture search starts in this direction. In some sense,

1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:29.600
 the first wave of AI, classical AI, work by identifying a problem and a possible solution

1:09:29.600 --> 1:09:34.640
 and implementing the solution, right? Program that plays chess. And right now, we are in the second

1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:39.600
 wave of AI. So instead of writing the algorithm that implements the solution, we write an algorithm

1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:45.360
 that automatically searches for an algorithm that implements the solution. So the learning system

1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:50.160
 in some sense is an algorithm that itself discovers the algorithm that solves the problem,

1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:54.880
 like go goes too hard to implement it by the solution by hand. But we can implement an

1:09:54.880 --> 1:09:59.680
 algorithm that finds the solution. So now let's move to the third stage, right? The third stage

1:09:59.680 --> 1:10:04.400
 would be meta learning. Find an algorithm that discovers a learning algorithm for the given

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:09.440
 domain. Our brain is probably not a learning system, but a meta learning system. This is

1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:14.080
 one way of looking at what we are doing. There is another way, if you look at the way our brain

1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:18.320
 has, for instance, implemented, there is no central control that tells all the neurons how to

1:10:18.320 --> 1:10:23.920
 wire up. Instead, every neuron is an individual reinforcement learning agent. Every neuron is

1:10:23.920 --> 1:10:28.160
 a single celled organism that is quite complicated and in some sense quite motivated to get fed.

1:10:28.960 --> 1:10:36.160
 And it gets fed if it fires on average at the right time. And the right time depends on the

1:10:36.160 --> 1:10:42.080
 context that the neuron exists in, which is the electrical and chemical environment that it has.

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:48.320
 So it basically has to learn a function over its environment that tells us when to fire to get fed.

1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:52.240
 Or if you see it as a reinforcement learning agent, every neuron is in some sense

1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:57.040
 making a hypothesis when it sends a signal and tries to pipe a signal through the universe

1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:02.000
 and tries to get positive feedback for it. And the entire thing is set up in such a way that it's

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:07.200
 robustly self organizing into a brain, which means you start out with different neuron types

1:11:07.200 --> 1:11:12.720
 that have different priors on which hypothesis to test and how to get its reward. And you put

1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:18.480
 them into different concentrations in a certain spatial alignment. And then you train it in a

1:11:18.480 --> 1:11:23.840
 particular order. And as a result, you get a well organized brain. Yeah, so okay, so the brain is a

1:11:23.840 --> 1:11:33.760
 meta learning system with a bunch of reinforcement learning agents. And what, I think you said,

1:11:33.760 --> 1:11:40.560
 but just to clarify, where do the, there's no centralized government that tells you,

1:11:41.200 --> 1:11:45.120
 here's a loss function, here's a loss function, here's a loss function, like what,

1:11:46.880 --> 1:11:48.720
 who is, who says what's the objective?

1:11:48.720 --> 1:11:53.360
 Also governments which impose loss functions on different parts of the brain. So we have

1:11:53.360 --> 1:11:58.080
 differential attention, some areas in your brain get especially rewarded when you look at faces.

1:11:58.080 --> 1:12:03.120
 If you don't have that, you will get prosopagnosia, which basically mean the inability to tell people

1:12:03.120 --> 1:12:08.960
 apart by their faces. And the reason that happens is because it was had an evolutionary

1:12:08.960 --> 1:12:13.120
 advantage. So like evolution comes into play here about it's basically an extraordinary

1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:17.360
 attention that we have for faces. I don't think that people with a prosopagnosia have a

1:12:17.360 --> 1:12:22.240
 perceived defective brain, the brain just has an average attention for faces. So people with

1:12:22.240 --> 1:12:27.040
 prosopagnosia don't look at faces more than they look at cups. So the level at which they resolve

1:12:27.040 --> 1:12:32.240
 the geometry of faces is not higher than the one that, than for cups. And people that don't have

1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:38.080
 prosopagnosia look obsessively at faces, right? For me, it's impossible to move through a crowd

1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:43.440
 without scanning the faces. And as a result, we make insanely detailed models of faces that allow

1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:49.840
 us to discern mental states of people. So obviously we don't know 99% of the details

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:56.000
 of this meta learning system. That's our mind. Okay. But still we took a leap from something

1:12:56.000 --> 1:13:02.480
 much dumber to that from off through the evolutionary process. Can you first of all,

1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:10.400
 maybe say how hard, how big of a leap is that from our brain, from our eight ancestors to

1:13:10.400 --> 1:13:20.480
 multi cell organisms? And is there something we can think about? As we start to think about how to

1:13:20.480 --> 1:13:27.360
 engineer intelligence, is there something we can learn from evolution? In some sense, life exists

1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:32.960
 because of the market opportunity of controlled chemical reactions. We compete with dump chemical

1:13:32.960 --> 1:13:38.960
 reactions. And we win in some areas against this dump combustion, because we can harness those

1:13:38.960 --> 1:13:43.120
 entropy gradients where you need to add a little bit of energy in a specific way to harvest more

1:13:43.120 --> 1:13:48.080
 energy. So we all competed combustion. Yes, in many regions we do. We try very hard because

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:54.320
 when we are in direct competition, we lose, right? Yeah. So because the combustion is going to

1:13:54.320 --> 1:14:00.080
 close the entropy gradients much faster than we can run. Yeah, that's quite compelling.

1:14:00.080 --> 1:14:04.080
 Yeah. So basically we do this because every cell has a Turing machine built into it.

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:11.440
 It's like literally a read write head on a tape. And so everything that's more complicated than a

1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:19.200
 molecule that just is a vortex around attractors, that needs a Turing machine for its regulation.

1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:24.400
 And then you bind cells together and you get next level organizational organism where the cells

1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:30.960
 together implement some kind of software. And for me, a very interesting discovery in the last

1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:35.760
 year was the word spirit. Because I realized that what spirit actually means, it's an operating

1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:40.640
 system for an autonomous robot. And when the word was invented, people needed this word.

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:44.720
 But they didn't have robots that they built themselves. Yeah, the only autonomous robots

1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:49.440
 that were known were people, animals, plants, ecosystems, cities and so on. And they all had

1:14:49.440 --> 1:14:54.240
 spirits. And it makes sense to say that the plant is an operating system, right? If you pinch the

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:58.960
 plant in one area, then this is going to have repercussions throughout the plant. Everything

1:14:58.960 --> 1:15:03.600
 in the plant is in some sense connected into some global aesthetics like in other organisms.

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:08.480
 An organism is not a collection of cells, it's a function that tells cells how to behave.

1:15:09.200 --> 1:15:13.600
 And this function is not implemented as some kind of supernatural thing,

1:15:14.240 --> 1:15:19.040
 like some morphogenetic field. It is an emergent result of the interactions of the

1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:27.280
 each cell with each other cell, right? Oh, guys. So what you're saying is the organism is a function

1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:37.120
 that tells what to do and the function emerges from the interaction of the cells.

1:15:38.560 --> 1:15:43.040
 So it's basically a description of what the plant is doing in terms of macro states.

1:15:43.920 --> 1:15:48.800
 And the micro states, the physical implementation are too many of them to describe them. So the

1:15:49.440 --> 1:15:54.320
 software that we use to describe what the plant is doing, the spirit of the plant is the software,

1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:59.520
 the operating system of the plant, right? This is a way in which we, the observers,

1:15:59.520 --> 1:16:04.000
 make sense of the plant. And the same is true for people. So people have spirits,

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:08.640
 which is their operating system in a way, right? And there's aspects of that operating system that

1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:12.880
 relate to how your body functions and others, how you socially interact, how you interact with

1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:19.600
 yourself and so on. And we make models of that spirit. And we think it's a loaded term because

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:25.840
 it's from a pre scientific age. But it took the scientific age a long time to rediscover a term

1:16:25.840 --> 1:16:30.720
 that is pretty much the same thing. And I suspect that the differences that we still see between

1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:34.400
 the old word and the new word are translation errors that have been over the centuries.

1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:39.760
 Can you actually linger on that? Like, why do you say that spirit, just to clarify,

1:16:39.760 --> 1:16:45.120
 because I'm a little bit confused. So the word spirit is a powerful thing. But why did you say

1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:50.160
 in the last year or so that you discovered this? Do you mean the same old traditional idea of a

1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:54.880
 spirit? Or do you mean? I tried to find out what people mean by spirit. When people say

1:16:54.880 --> 1:16:59.840
 spirituality in the US, it usually refers to the phantom limb that they develop in the absence of

1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:06.320
 culture. And a culture is in some sense, you could say the spirit of a society that is long game.

1:17:07.120 --> 1:17:12.720
 This thing that is becomes self aware at a level above the individuals where you say,

1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:17.120
 if you don't do the following things, then the grand grand grandchildren of our children will

1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:22.800
 not have nothing to eat. So if you take this long scope, where you try to maximize the length of

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:27.040
 the game that you are playing as a species, you realize that you're part of a larger thing that

1:17:27.040 --> 1:17:32.080
 you cannot fully control, you probably need to submit to the ecosphere instead of trying to

1:17:32.080 --> 1:17:38.480
 completely control it. There needs to be a certain level at which we can exist as a species if you

1:17:38.480 --> 1:17:44.400
 want to endure. And our culture is not sustaining this anymore. We basically made this bet with

1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:48.320
 the industrial revolution that we can control everything. And the modernist societies with

1:17:48.320 --> 1:17:54.800
 basically unfettered growth led to a situation in which we depend on the ability to control the

1:17:54.800 --> 1:18:01.520
 entire planet. And since we are not able to do that, as it seems, this culture will die.

1:18:02.320 --> 1:18:06.480
 We realize that it doesn't have a future. We call our children generation Z.

1:18:06.480 --> 1:18:09.280
 That's sort of our optimistic thing to do.

1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:16.320
 Yeah. So you have this kind of intuition that our civilization, you said culture,

1:18:16.320 --> 1:18:22.800
 but you really mean the spirit of the civilization, the entirety of the civilization

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:30.720
 may not exist for long. Can you untangle that? What's your intuition behind that? So

1:18:30.720 --> 1:18:36.480
 you kind of offline mentioned to me that the industrial revolution was kind of the moment we

1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:44.240
 agreed to accept the offer, sign on the paper, on the dotted line with the industrial revolution,

1:18:44.240 --> 1:18:46.320
 we doomed ourselves. Can you elaborate on that?

1:18:47.280 --> 1:18:52.080
 This is suspicion. I of course don't know how it plays out, but it seems to me that

1:18:53.280 --> 1:18:58.800
 in a society in which you leverage yourself very far over an entropic abyss,

1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:03.680
 without land on the other side, it's relatively clear that your cantilever is at some point

1:19:03.680 --> 1:19:08.320
 going to break down into this entropic abyss. And you have to pay the bill.

1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:12.400
 Okay. Russia is my first language. And I'm also an idiot.

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:23.360
 This is just two apes instead of playing with the banana trying to have fun by talking. Okay.

1:19:23.360 --> 1:19:29.520
 Okay. Anthropic what? And what's anthropic? Entropic. Entropic. So entropic in the sense

1:19:29.520 --> 1:19:34.320
 of entropy. Oh, entropic, guys. Yes. And entropic, what was the other word? Abyss.

1:19:35.040 --> 1:19:41.520
 What's that? It's a big gorge. Oh, abyss. Abyss, yes. Entropic abyss. So many of the things you

1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:49.040
 say are poetic, it's hurting my brain. It's amazing, right? It's mispronouncing, which makes

1:19:49.040 --> 1:19:57.440
 you do more poetic. Because Wittgenstein would be proud. So entropic abyss. Okay, let's rewind,

1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:03.680
 then, the Industrial Revolution. So how does that get us into the entropic abyss?

1:20:05.200 --> 1:20:10.480
 So in some sense, we burned 100 million years worth of trees to get everybody plumbing.

1:20:10.480 --> 1:20:15.600
 Yes. And the society that we had before that had a very limited number of people. So basically,

1:20:15.600 --> 1:20:24.240
 since zero BC, we hovered between 300 and 400 million people. And this only changed with the

1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:30.000
 Enlightenment and the subsequent Industrial Revolution. And in some sense, the Enlightenment

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:35.360
 freed our rationality and also freed our norms from the preexisting order gradually.

1:20:35.360 --> 1:20:40.080
 And it was a process that basically happened in feedback loops, so it was not that just one

1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:46.080
 caused the other. It was a dynamic that started. And the dynamic worked by basically increasing

1:20:46.080 --> 1:20:53.440
 productivity to such a degree that we could feed all our children. And I think the definition of

1:20:54.480 --> 1:21:00.400
 poverty is that you have as many children as you can feed before they die, which is in some sense

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:06.240
 the state that all animals on earth are in. The definition of poverty is having enough.

1:21:06.240 --> 1:21:11.520
 So you can have only so many children as you can feed, and if you have more, they die. And in our

1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:14.960
 societies, you can basically have as many children as you want, and they don't die.

1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:21.920
 So the reason why we don't have as many children as we want is because we also have to pay a price

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:26.240
 in terms of we have to insert ourselves in the lower source of dread if we have too many.

1:21:26.240 --> 1:21:32.320
 So basically, everybody in the under middle and lower upper class has only a limited number of

1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:37.440
 children because having more of them would mean a big economic hit to their individual families.

1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:43.040
 Because children, especially in the US, super expensive to have. And you only are taken out

1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:47.440
 of this if you are basically super rich or if you are super poor. If you're super poor, it doesn't

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:51.920
 matter how many kids you have because your status is not going to change. And these children are

1:21:51.920 --> 1:21:57.920
 largely not going to die of hunger. So how does this lead to self destruction? So there's a lot

1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:02.800
 of unpleasant properties about this process. So basically what we try to do is we try to

1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:10.240
 let our children survive even if they have diseases. Like I would have died before my

1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:16.320
 mid 20s without modern medicine. And most of my friends would have as well. So many of us wouldn't

1:22:16.320 --> 1:22:23.600
 live without the advantages of modern medicine and modern industrialized society. We get our

1:22:23.600 --> 1:22:30.160
 protein largely by doing the entirety of nature. Imagine there would be some very clever microbe

1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:36.880
 that would live in our organisms and would completely harvest them and change them into

1:22:36.880 --> 1:22:42.640
 a thing that is necessary to sustain itself. And it would discover that for instance,

1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:47.440
 brain cells are kind of edible, but they're not quite nice. So you need to have more fat in them

1:22:47.440 --> 1:22:52.400
 and you turn them into more fat cells. And basically this big organism would become a vegetable

1:22:52.400 --> 1:22:56.480
 that is barely alive and it's going to be very brittle and not resilient when the environment

1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:02.080
 changes. Yeah, but the some part of that organism, the one that's actually doing all the using of

1:23:02.080 --> 1:23:09.440
 the, there'll still be somebody thriving. So it relates back to this original question. I suspect

1:23:09.440 --> 1:23:15.360
 that we are not the smartest thing on this planet. I suspect that basically every complex system has

1:23:15.360 --> 1:23:22.880
 to have some complex regulation if it depends on feedback loops. And so for instance, it's likely

1:23:23.920 --> 1:23:28.640
 that we should describe a certain degree of intelligence to plants. The problem is that

1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:32.880
 plants don't have a nervous system. So they don't have a way to telegraph messages over

1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:38.640
 large distances almost instantly in the plant. And instead they will rely on chemicals between

1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:44.320
 adjacent cells, which means the signal processing speed depends on the signal processing with a

1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:50.720
 rate of a few millimeters per second. And as a result, if the plant is intelligent, it's not

1:23:50.720 --> 1:23:55.920
 going to be intelligent at similar timescales. Yeah, the ability to put the timescale is different.

1:23:55.920 --> 1:24:02.480
 So you suspect we might not be the most intelligent, but we're the most intelligent

1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:08.080
 and this spatial scale in our timescale. So basically if you would zoom out very far,

1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:12.160
 we might discover that there have been intelligent ecosystems on the planet

1:24:12.160 --> 1:24:17.760
 that existed for thousands of years in an almost undisturbed state. And it could be that these

1:24:17.760 --> 1:24:22.880
 ecosystems actively related their environment. So basically change the course of the evolution

1:24:22.880 --> 1:24:25.760
 vision this ecosystem to make it more efficient and less brittle.

1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:30.560
 So it's possible something like plants is actually a set of living organisms,

1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:35.200
 an ecosystem of living organisms that are just operating a different timescale and are far

1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:39.760
 superior in intelligence to human beings. And then human beings will die out and plants will

1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:45.040
 still be there and they'll be there. Yeah, there's an evolutionary adaptation

1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:49.200
 playing a role at all of these levels. For instance, if mice don't get enough food

1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:52.960
 and get stressed, the next generation of mice will be more sparse and more scrawny.

1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:58.080
 And the reason for this is because in a natural environment, the mice have probably

1:24:58.080 --> 1:25:02.880
 hidden a drought or something else. And if they're overgrays, then all the things that

1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:08.560
 sustain them might go extinct. And there will be no mice a few generations from now. So to make

1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:13.760
 sure that there will be mice in five generations from now, basically the mice scale back. And

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:17.440
 a similar thing happens with the predators of mice, they should make sure that the mice don't

1:25:17.440 --> 1:25:22.800
 completely go extinct. So in some sense, if the predators are smart enough, they will be tasked

1:25:22.800 --> 1:25:29.120
 with shepherding their food supply. And maybe the reason why lions have much larger brains

1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:34.240
 than antelopes is not so much because it's so hard to catch an antelope as opposed to run away

1:25:34.240 --> 1:25:39.760
 from the lion. But the lions need to make complex models of their environment, more complex than

1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:45.040
 the antelopes. So first of all, just describing that there's a bunch of complex systems and human

1:25:45.040 --> 1:25:49.360
 beings may not even be the most special or intelligent of those complex systems, even on earth,

1:25:50.240 --> 1:25:54.080
 makes me feel a little better about the extinction of human species that we're talking about.

1:25:54.080 --> 1:25:57.360
 Yes, maybe we're just guy as ploy to put the carbon back into the atmosphere.

1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:00.000
 Yeah, this is just a nice, we tried it out.

1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:05.120
 The big stain on evolution is not as it was trees. Earth evolved trees before they could

1:26:05.120 --> 1:26:08.560
 be digested again, right? There were no insects that could break all of them apart.

1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:14.720
 Saludos is so robust that you cannot get all of it with microorganisms. So many of these

1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:19.520
 trees fell into swamps. And all this carbon became inert and could no longer be recycled into

1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:23.520
 organisms. And we are the species that is destined to take care of that.

1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:28.640
 So this is kind of to get out of the ground, put it back into the atmosphere and the earth is

1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:33.920
 already greening. So within a million years or so when the ecosystems have recovered from the

1:26:33.920 --> 1:26:39.120
 rapid changes that they're not compatible with right now, there's going to be awesome again.

1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:41.920
 And there won't be even a memory of us little apes.

1:26:41.920 --> 1:26:46.080
 I think there will be memories of us. I suspect we are the first generally intelligent species

1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:50.640
 in this sense. We are the first species within industrial society because we will leave more

1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:59.520
 phones than bones in the stratosphere. I like it. But then let me push back. You've kind of

1:26:59.520 --> 1:27:08.800
 suggested that we have a very narrow definition of why aren't trees a higher level of general

1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:13.280
 intelligence? If trees were intelligent, then they would be at different time scales, which

1:27:13.280 --> 1:27:17.520
 means within a hundred years, the tree is probably not going to make models that are as complex as

1:27:17.520 --> 1:27:23.200
 the ones that we make in 10 years. But maybe the trees are the ones that made the phones, right?

1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:31.360
 We could say the entirety of life did it. The first cell never died. The first cell only

1:27:31.360 --> 1:27:36.480
 split, right? And every divided. And every cell in our body is still an instance of the first cell

1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:40.480
 that split off from that very first cell. There was only one cell on this planet as far as we know.

1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:46.880
 And so the cell is not just a building block of life. It's a hypoorganism, right? And we are part

1:27:46.880 --> 1:27:56.000
 of this hypoorganism. So nevertheless, this hypoorganism, no, this little particular branch of

1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:01.200
 it, which is us humans, because of the industrial revolution, and maybe the exponential growth of

1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:07.840
 technology might somehow destroy ourselves. So what do you think is the most likely way we might

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.200
 destroy ourselves? So some people worry about genetic manipulation. Some people, as we've

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:18.400
 talked about, worry about either dumb artificial intelligence or super intelligent artificial

1:28:18.400 --> 1:28:25.200
 intelligence destroying us. Some people worry about nuclear weapons and weapons of war in

1:28:25.200 --> 1:28:30.320
 general. What do you think? If you were a betting man, what would you bet on in terms of self

1:28:30.320 --> 1:28:36.160
 destruction? And then would it be higher than 50%? Would it be higher than 50%? So it's very likely

1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:41.920
 that nothing that we bet on matters after we win our bets. So I don't think that bets are

1:28:41.920 --> 1:28:46.480
 literally the right way to go about this. I mean, once you're dead, it doesn't, you won't be there

1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:53.120
 to collect. So it's also not clear if we as a species go extinct. But I think that our present

1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:57.520
 civilization is not sustainable. So the thing that will change is there will be probably fewer

1:28:57.520 --> 1:29:02.880
 people on the planet than are today. And even if not, then still most of people that are alive

1:29:02.880 --> 1:29:07.680
 today will not have offspring in 100 years from now because of the geographic changes and so on

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:13.440
 and the changes in the food supply. It's quite likely that many areas of the planet will only

1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:18.880
 be livable with a close cooling chain in 100 years from now. So many of the areas around the equator

1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:26.320
 and in sub tropical climates that are now quite pleasant to live in will stop to be inhabitable

1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:32.240
 without air conditioning. So you honestly, wow, cooling chain, close knit cooling chain communities.

1:29:32.240 --> 1:29:38.000
 So you think you have a strong worry about the effects of global warming that we see?

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:42.800
 By itself, it's not the big issue. If you live in Arizona right now, you have basically three months

1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:47.840
 in the summer in which you cannot be outside. And so you have a close cooling chain, you have air

1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:51.680
 conditioning in your car and in your home and you're fine. And if the air conditioning would stop

1:29:52.400 --> 1:29:56.720
 for a few days, then in many areas, you would not be able to survive, right?

1:29:56.720 --> 1:30:01.760
 Can we just pause for a second? You say so many brilliant, poetic things like,

1:30:01.760 --> 1:30:05.920
 what is a close? Do people use that term closed cooling chain?

1:30:05.920 --> 1:30:10.960
 I imagine that people use it when they describe how they get meat into a supermarket, right?

1:30:10.960 --> 1:30:14.880
 If you break the cooling chain and this thing starts to thaw, you're in trouble and you have

1:30:14.880 --> 1:30:22.000
 to throw it away. That's such a beautiful way to put it. It's like calling a city a closed

1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:26.160
 social chain or something like that. I mean, that's right. I mean, the locality of it is really

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:29.920
 important. It basically means you wake up in a climatized room, you go to work in a climatized

1:30:29.920 --> 1:30:35.120
 car, you work in a closed office, you shop in a climatized supermarket. And in between, you

1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:39.040
 have very short distance in which you run from your car to the supermarket, but you have to make

1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:44.240
 sure that your temperature does not approach the temperature of the environment. The crucial thing

1:30:44.240 --> 1:30:48.800
 is the wet bulb temperature. The what? The wet bulb temperature. It's what you get when you take

1:30:49.760 --> 1:30:55.360
 wet clothes and you put it around your thermometer and then you will move it very quickly through

1:30:55.360 --> 1:31:03.280
 the air. So you get the evaporation heat. And as soon as you can no longer cool your body temperature

1:31:03.280 --> 1:31:11.440
 via evaporation to a temperature below something like, I think, 35 degrees, you die. And which

1:31:11.440 --> 1:31:17.840
 means if the outside world is dry, you can still cool yourself down by sweating. But if it has a

1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:21.760
 certain degree of humidity or if it goes over a certain temperature, then sweating will not save

1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:27.920
 you. And this means even if you're a healthy, fit individual within a few hours, even if you try to

1:31:27.920 --> 1:31:34.960
 be in the shade and so on, you'll die unless you have some climatizing equipment. And this itself,

1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:39.280
 if you as long as you maintain civilization and you have energy supply and you have food trucks

1:31:39.280 --> 1:31:44.320
 coming to your home that are climatized, everything is fine. But what if you lose a large scale open

1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:49.840
 agriculture at the same time? So basically you run into food insecurity because climate becomes very

1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:53.840
 irregular or weather becomes very irregular. And you have a lot of extreme weather events.

1:31:55.120 --> 1:32:00.640
 So you need to roll most of your food maybe indoor or you need to import your food from

1:32:00.640 --> 1:32:05.760
 certain regions. And maybe you're not able to maintain the civilization throughout the planet

1:32:05.760 --> 1:32:08.560
 to get the infrastructure to get the food to your home.

1:32:09.440 --> 1:32:13.920
 But there could be there could be significant impacts in the sense that people begin to suffer.

1:32:13.920 --> 1:32:20.320
 There could be wars over resources and so on. But ultimately, do you do you not have a not a

1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:26.800
 faith? But what do you make of the capacity of technology to technological innovation

1:32:27.520 --> 1:32:36.640
 to help us prevent some of the worst damages that this condition can create? So as an example,

1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:42.160
 as a almost out there example is the work that SpaceX and Elon Musk is doing of trying to

1:32:42.160 --> 1:32:50.480
 also consider our propagation throughout the universe in deep space to colonize other planets.

1:32:50.480 --> 1:32:55.600
 That's one technological step. But of course, what Elon Musk is trying on Mars is not to

1:32:55.600 --> 1:33:00.640
 save us from global warming, because Mars looks much worse than Earth will look like after the

1:33:00.640 --> 1:33:06.880
 worst outcomes of global warming imaginable, right? Yeah, Mars is essentially not habitable.

1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:11.280
 It's exceptionally harsh environment. Yes. But what he is doing, what a lot of people

1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:15.680
 throughout history since the industrial revolution are doing, are just doing a lot of different

1:33:15.680 --> 1:33:20.320
 technological innovation with some kind of target. And when ends up happening is totally

1:33:20.320 --> 1:33:27.440
 unexpected new things come up. So trying to trying to terraform or trying to colonize Mars,

1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:34.560
 extremely harsh environment, might give us totally new ideas of how to expand the or increase the

1:33:34.560 --> 1:33:43.600
 power of this closed cooling circuit that empowers the community. So like, it seems like there's

1:33:43.600 --> 1:33:53.360
 a little bit of a race between our open ended technological innovation of this communal operating

1:33:53.360 --> 1:34:02.080
 system that we have and our general tendency to want to overuse resources and thereby destroy

1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:08.240
 ourselves. You don't think technology can win that race? I think the probability is relatively low,

1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:14.880
 given that our technology is, for instance, the US is stagnating since the 1970s, roughly,

1:34:14.880 --> 1:34:19.840
 in terms of technology. Most of the things that we do are the result of incremental processes.

1:34:19.840 --> 1:34:23.840
 What about Intel? What about Moore's law? It's basically it's very incremental,

1:34:23.840 --> 1:34:28.720
 the things that we're doing is so after the invention of the microprocessor was a major

1:34:28.720 --> 1:34:36.960
 thing, right? The miniaturization of transistors was really major. But the things that we did

1:34:36.960 --> 1:34:44.800
 afterwards, largely, were not that innovative. So we had gradual changes of scaling things

1:34:44.800 --> 1:34:51.760
 into from GPUs into from CPUs into GPUs and things like that. But I don't think that there are

1:34:52.800 --> 1:34:57.840
 basically not many things if you take a person that died in the 70s and was at the top of their game,

1:34:57.840 --> 1:35:01.200
 they would not need to read that many books to be current again.

1:35:01.200 --> 1:35:06.720
 But it's all about books. Who cares about books? There might be things that are beyond books might

1:35:06.720 --> 1:35:10.880
 be a very... Or say papers or... No, papers. Forget papers. There might be things that are...

1:35:10.880 --> 1:35:16.240
 So papers and books and knowledge, that's a concept of a time when you were sitting there by

1:35:16.240 --> 1:35:21.360
 candlelight and individual consumers of knowledge. What about the impact that we're not in the middle

1:35:21.360 --> 1:35:28.240
 of might not be understanding of Twitter, of YouTube. The reason you and I are sitting here today

1:35:28.240 --> 1:35:35.040
 is because of Twitter and YouTube. So the ripple effect and there's two minds,

1:35:35.040 --> 1:35:41.520
 sort of two dumb apes are coming up with a new, perhaps a new clean insights. And there's 200

1:35:41.520 --> 1:35:47.920
 other apes listening right now, 200,000 other apes listening right now. And that effect,

1:35:47.920 --> 1:35:51.440
 it's very difficult to understand what that effect will have. That might be bigger than

1:35:51.440 --> 1:35:55.360
 any of the advancement of the microprocessor or any of the industrial revolution,

1:35:55.360 --> 1:36:06.880
 the ability of spread knowledge. And that knowledge, it allows good ideas to reach millions

1:36:06.880 --> 1:36:11.920
 much faster. And the effect of that, that might be the new, that might be the 21st century,

1:36:11.920 --> 1:36:18.560
 is the multiplying of ideas of good ideas. Because if you say one good thing today,

1:36:19.200 --> 1:36:25.040
 that will multiply across huge amounts of people. And then they will say something and then they

1:36:25.040 --> 1:36:29.520
 will have another podcast and they'll say something and then they'll write a paper. That could be a

1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:35.360
 huge... You don't think that... Yeah, we should have billions of von Neumanns right now in

1:36:35.360 --> 1:36:39.760
 two rings and we don't for some reason. I suspect the reason is that we destroy our

1:36:39.760 --> 1:36:44.400
 attention span. Also the incentives, of course, different. Yeah, we have some Kardashians, yeah.

1:36:44.400 --> 1:36:48.480
 So the reason why we are sitting here and doing this as a YouTube video is because you and me

1:36:48.480 --> 1:36:52.320
 don't have the attention span to write a book together right now. And you guys probably don't

1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:56.320
 have the attention span to read it. So let me tell you... But I guarantee they're still listening.

1:36:56.320 --> 1:37:02.560
 It's bursting care of your attention. It's very short. But we're an hour and 40 minutes in and

1:37:02.560 --> 1:37:07.360
 I guarantee you that 80% of the people are still listening. So there is an attention span. It's

1:37:07.360 --> 1:37:14.000
 just the form. Who said that the book is the optimal way to transfer information? This is still

1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:17.440
 an open question. I mean, that's what we're... Something that social media could be doing,

1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:21.680
 that other forms could not be doing. I think the end game of social media is a global brain.

1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:25.920
 And Twitter is, in some sense, a global brain that is completely hooked on dopamine,

1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:29.840
 doesn't have any kind of inhibition and as a result is caught in a permanent seizure.

1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:36.560
 It's also, in some sense, a multiplayer role playing game. And people use it to play an avatar

1:37:36.560 --> 1:37:40.400
 that is not like them as they were in the sane world and they look through the world to the

1:37:40.400 --> 1:37:43.920
 lens of their phones and think it's the real world. But it's the Twitter world that is

1:37:43.920 --> 1:37:50.560
 distorted by the popularity incentives of Twitter. Yeah, the incentives and just our natural biological,

1:37:51.120 --> 1:38:01.120
 the dopamine rush of a like, no matter how... I try to be very kind of zen like and minimalist and

1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:05.520
 not be influenced by likes and so on. But it's probably very difficult to avoid that to some

1:38:05.520 --> 1:38:16.080
 degree. Speaking of a small tangent of Twitter, what... How can Twitter be done better? I think

1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:20.960
 it's an incredible mechanism that has a huge impact on society by doing exactly what you're

1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:25.040
 doing. Oh, sorry, doing exactly what you described, which is having this...

1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:33.440
 We're like, is this some kind of game and we're kind of our individual RL agents in this game

1:38:33.440 --> 1:38:37.280
 and it's uncontrollable because there's not really a centralized control. Neither Jack Dorsey

1:38:37.280 --> 1:38:44.880
 nor the engineers at Twitter seem to be able to control this game. Or can they? That's sort of

1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:50.160
 a question. Is there any advice you would give on how to control this game? I would give advice

1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:57.360
 because I am certainly not an expert, but I can give my thoughts on this. And our brain has solved

1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:02.320
 this problem to some degree, right? Our brain has lots of individual agents that manage to play

1:39:02.320 --> 1:39:08.160
 together in a way. And we have also many contexts in which other organisms have found ways to solve

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:15.520
 the problems of cooperation that we don't solve on Twitter. And maybe the solution is to go for

1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:22.480
 an evolutionary approach. So imagine that you have something like Reddit or something like Facebook

1:39:22.480 --> 1:39:26.400
 and something like Twitter. And you think about what they have in common, what they have in common,

1:39:26.400 --> 1:39:32.720
 they are companies that in some sense own a protocol. And this protocol is imposed on a community.

1:39:32.720 --> 1:39:38.640
 And the protocol has different components for monetization, for user management, for user

1:39:38.640 --> 1:39:43.760
 display, for rating, for anonymity, for import of other content and so on. And now imagine that

1:39:43.760 --> 1:39:50.160
 you take these components of the protocol apart and you do it in some sense like communities,

1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:55.280
 visit this social network. And these communities are allowed to mix and match their protocols and

1:39:55.280 --> 1:40:01.600
 design new ones. So for instance, the UI and the UX can be defined by the community. The rules for

1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:06.960
 sharing content across communities can be defined. The monetization can be redefined. The way you

1:40:06.960 --> 1:40:12.800
 reward individual users for what can be redefined, the way users can represent themselves and to

1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:18.720
 each other can redefine. Who could be the redefiner? So can individual human beings build enough

1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:22.800
 intuition to redefine those things? It self can become part of the protocol. So for instance,

1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:27.600
 it could be in some communities, it will be a single person that comes up with these things.

1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:32.480
 And others, it's a group of friends. Some might implement a voting scheme that has some interesting

1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:36.640
 weighted voting. Who knows? Who knows what will be the best self organizing principle for this.

1:40:36.640 --> 1:40:42.000
 But the process can be automated. I mean, it seems like the brain can be automated so people can

1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:48.400
 write software for this. And eventually, the idea is, let's not make an assumption about this thing

1:40:48.400 --> 1:40:52.320
 if you don't know what the right solution is. And those areas that you have no idea

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:56.960
 whether the right solution will be people designing this ad hoc or machines doing this,

1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:03.440
 whether you want to enforce compliance by social norms like Wikipedia or with software solutions

1:41:03.440 --> 1:41:08.320
 or with AI that goes through the posts of people or with a legal principle and so on.

1:41:08.320 --> 1:41:13.680
 This is something maybe you need to find out. And so the idea would be if you let the communities

1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:19.440
 evolve, and you just control it in such a way that you are incentivizing the most sentient

1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:26.880
 communities, the ones that produce the most interesting behaviors that allow you to interact

1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:31.280
 in the most helpful ways to the individuals. You have a network that gives you information

1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:36.320
 that is relevant to you. It helps you to maintain relationships to others in healthy ways. It

1:41:36.320 --> 1:41:40.800
 allows you to build teams. It allows you to basically bring the best of you into this thing

1:41:40.800 --> 1:41:45.360
 and goes into a coupling into a relationship with others in which you produce things that

1:41:45.360 --> 1:41:51.600
 you would be unable to produce alone. Yes, beautifully put. But the key process of that

1:41:51.600 --> 1:42:00.560
 with incentives and evolution is things that don't adopt themselves to effectively get the

1:42:00.560 --> 1:42:07.120
 incentives have to die. And the thing about social media is communities that are unhealthy or

1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:11.920
 whatever you want to define as the incentives really don't like dying. One of the things that

1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:17.840
 people really get aggressive protest aggressively is when they're censored, especially in America.

1:42:17.840 --> 1:42:22.240
 I don't know. I don't know much about the rest of the world, but the idea of freedom of speech,

1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:34.880
 the idea of censorship is really painful in America. And so what do you think about that

1:42:34.880 --> 1:42:42.000
 having grown up in East Germany? Do you think censorship is an important tool in our brain,

1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:49.440
 in the intelligence, and in the social networks? So basically, if you're not a good member

1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:55.280
 of the entirety of the system, they should be blocked away, well, locked away, blocked.

1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:00.400
 An important thing is who decides that you are a good member? Who? Is it distributed?

1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:06.400
 Or what is the outcome of the process that decides it, both for the individual and for society at

1:43:06.400 --> 1:43:11.760
 large? For instance, if you have a high trust society, you don't need a lot of surveillance.

1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:18.480
 And the surveillance is even in some sense undermining trust, because it's basically punishing

1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:24.960
 people that look suspicious when surveyed, but do the right thing anyway. And the opposite,

1:43:24.960 --> 1:43:28.720
 if you have a low trust society, then surveillance can be a better trade off.

1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:32.640
 And the US is currently making a transition from a relatively high trust or mixed trust

1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:38.080
 society to a low trust society. So surveillance will increase. Another thing is that beliefs are

1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:41.920
 not just inert representations. There are implementations that run code on your brain

1:43:42.560 --> 1:43:46.240
 and change your reality and change the way you interact with each other at some level.

1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:53.360
 And some of the beliefs are just public opinions that we use to display our alignment. So for

1:43:53.360 --> 1:43:59.440
 instance, people might say all cultures are the same and equally good, but still they prefer

1:43:59.440 --> 1:44:04.160
 to live in some cultures over others, very, very strongly so. And it turns out that the

1:44:04.160 --> 1:44:08.240
 cultures are defined by certain rules of interaction. And these rules of interaction

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:12.720
 lead to different results when you implement them. So if you adhere to certain rules,

1:44:12.720 --> 1:44:18.720
 you get different outcomes in different societies. And this all leads to very tricky

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:24.080
 situations when people do not have a commitment to shared purpose. And our societies probably need

1:44:24.080 --> 1:44:29.440
 to rediscover what it means to have a shared purpose and how to make this compatible with

1:44:29.440 --> 1:44:38.000
 a non totalitarian view. So in some sense, the US is caught in a conundrum between totalitarianism

1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:44.320
 and diversity. And it doesn't need to how to resolve this and the solutions that the US has

1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:48.480
 found so far very crude because it's a very young society that is also under a lot of

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:51.520
 tension. It seems to me that the US will have to reinvent itself.

1:44:52.240 --> 1:45:01.120
 What do you think? Just philosophizing, what kind of mechanisms of government do you think

1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:05.440
 we as a species should be involved with US or broadly? What do you think will work well

1:45:07.200 --> 1:45:12.080
 as a system? Of course, we don't know. It all seems to work pretty crappily. Some things worse

1:45:12.080 --> 1:45:17.760
 than others. Some people argue that communism is the best. Others say, yeah, look at the Soviet

1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:24.160
 Union. Some people argue that anarchy is the best and then completely discarding the positive

1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:32.240
 effects of government. There's a lot of arguments. US seems to be doing pretty damn well in the span

1:45:32.240 --> 1:45:37.440
 of history. There's respect for human rights, which seems to be a nice feature, not a bug.

1:45:38.080 --> 1:45:41.520
 And economically, a lot of growth, a lot of technological development.

1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:48.720
 And people seem to be relatively kind on the grand scheme of things. What lessons do you draw

1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:52.320
 from that? What kind of government system do you think is good?

1:45:54.320 --> 1:46:00.480
 Ideally, government should not be perceivable. It should be frictionless. The more you notice

1:46:00.480 --> 1:46:05.680
 the influence of the government, the more friction you experience, the less effective

1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:10.800
 and efficient the government probably is. A government, game theoretically, is an agent

1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:19.040
 that imposes an offset on your payout matrix to make your Nash equilibrium compatible with the

1:46:19.040 --> 1:46:24.720
 common good. So you have these situations where people act on the local incentives.

1:46:24.720 --> 1:46:28.720
 And these local incentives, everybody does the thing that's locally the best for them,

1:46:28.720 --> 1:46:32.880
 but the global outcome is not good. And this is even the case when people care about the global

1:46:32.880 --> 1:46:37.760
 outcome, because a regulation mechanism exists that creates a causal relationship between what

1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:42.320
 I want to have for the global good and what I do. So for instance, if I think that we should fly less

1:46:42.320 --> 1:46:47.360
 and I stay at home, there's not a single plane that is going to not start because of me, right?

1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:52.560
 It's not going to have an influence, but I don't get from A to B. So the way to implement this would

1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:58.160
 basically to have a government that is sharing this idea that we should fly less and is then

1:46:58.160 --> 1:47:03.920
 imposing a regulation that, for instance, makes flying more expensive and gives incentives for

1:47:03.920 --> 1:47:10.880
 inventing other forms of transportation that are less putting that strain on the environment, for

1:47:10.880 --> 1:47:16.240
 instance. So there's so much optimism and so many things you describe. And yet there's the

1:47:16.240 --> 1:47:21.840
 pessimism of you think our civilization is going to come to an end. So that's not 100% probability,

1:47:21.840 --> 1:47:29.600
 nothing in this world is. So what's the trajectory out of self destruction, do you think?

1:47:29.600 --> 1:47:34.400
 I suspect that in some sense, we are both too smart and not smart enough, which means we are

1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:39.680
 very good at solving near term problems. And at the same time, we are unwilling to submit to the

1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:48.320
 imperatives that we would have to follow and if you want to stick around. So that makes it difficult.

1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:52.480
 If you were unable to solve everything technologically, you can probably understand how

1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:57.840
 high the child mortality needs to be to absorb the mutation rate. And how either mutation rate

1:47:57.840 --> 1:48:03.200
 needs to be to adapt to a slowly changing ecosystem environment. So you could in principle

1:48:03.200 --> 1:48:09.600
 compute all these things game theoretically and adapt to it. But if you cannot do this,

1:48:09.600 --> 1:48:13.520
 because you are like me and you have children, you don't want them to die, you will use any kind

1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:19.760
 of medical information to keep child mortality low. Even if it means that our visit in the

1:48:19.760 --> 1:48:24.560
 future generations, we have enormous genetic drift. And most of us have allergies as a result of not

1:48:24.560 --> 1:48:29.280
 being adapted to the changes that we made to our food supply. That's for now, I say technologically

1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:34.880
 speaking, we're just a very young, 300 years industrial revolution. We're very new to this

1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:39.280
 idea. So you're attached to your kids being alive and not being murdered for the good of

1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:45.760
 good of society. But that might be a very temporary moment of time that we might evolve in our

1:48:45.760 --> 1:48:51.520
 thinking. So like you said, when we're both smart and not smart enough. We are probably not this

1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:57.520
 first human civilization that has discovered technology that allows to efficiently overgrace

1:48:57.520 --> 1:49:03.120
 our resources. And this overgracing is, at some point, we think we can compensate this because

1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:08.960
 if we have eaten all the grass, we will find a way to grow mushrooms. But it could also be that

1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:13.760
 the ecosystems tip. And so what really concerns me is not so much the end of the civilization,

1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:20.400
 because we will invent a new one. But what concerns me is the fact that, for instance,

1:49:20.400 --> 1:49:25.760
 the oceans might tip. So for instance, maybe the plankton dies because of ocean acidification

1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:31.280
 and cyanobacteria takeover. And as a result, we can no longer breathe the atmosphere. This would

1:49:31.280 --> 1:49:36.560
 be really concerning. So basically a major reboot of most complex organisms on Earth. And I think

1:49:36.560 --> 1:49:42.480
 this is a possibility. I don't know what the percentage for this possibility is, but it doesn't

1:49:42.480 --> 1:49:46.320
 seem to be outlandish to me if you look at the scale of the changes that we've already triggered on

1:49:46.320 --> 1:49:51.680
 this planet. And so Danny Hiller suggests that, for instance, we may be able to put chalk into

1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:56.720
 the stratosphere to limit solar radiation. Maybe it works. Maybe this is sufficient to

1:49:56.720 --> 1:50:01.680
 counter the effects of what we've done. Maybe it won't be. Maybe we won't be able to implement it

1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:07.200
 by the time it's prevalent. I have no idea how the future is going to play out in this regard.

1:50:08.480 --> 1:50:12.560
 I think it's quite likely that we cannot continue like this. All our cousin species,

1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:19.200
 the other hominids are gone. So the right step would be to what? To rewind

1:50:21.280 --> 1:50:28.880
 towards the industrial revolution and slow the... So try to contain the technological process that

1:50:28.880 --> 1:50:34.640
 leads to the overconsumption of resources? Imagine you get to choose. You have one lifetime.

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:41.120
 Yes. You get born into a sustainable agricultural civilization, 300, maybe 400 million people on

1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:48.240
 the planet tops. Or before this, some kind of nomadic species with like a million or two million.

1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:54.000
 And so you don't meet new people unless you give birth to them. You cannot travel to other places

1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:58.160
 in the world. There is no internet. There is no interesting intellectual tradition that reaches

1:50:58.160 --> 1:51:01.840
 considerably deep. So you would not discover tumor incompleteness probably and so on.

1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:07.120
 We wouldn't exist. And the alternative is you get born into an insane world.

1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:12.240
 One that is doomed to die because it has just burned 100 million years of trees in a single

1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:17.440
 century. Which one do you like? I think I like this one. It's a very weird thing that when you

1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:21.840
 find yourself on a Titanic and you see this iceberg and it looks like we are not going to

1:51:21.840 --> 1:51:26.320
 miss it. And a lot of people are in denial and most of the counterarguments sound like denial

1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:31.520
 to me. There don't seem to be rational arguments. And the other thing is we are born on this Titanic.

1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:35.120
 Without this Titanic, we wouldn't have been born. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't be talking. We

1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:40.560
 wouldn't be on the internet. We wouldn't do all the things that we enjoy. And we are not responsible

1:51:40.560 --> 1:51:46.640
 for this happening. It's basically if we had the choice, we would probably try to prevent it.

1:51:46.640 --> 1:51:51.440
 But when we were born, we were never asked when we want to be born, in which society we want to

1:51:51.440 --> 1:51:56.480
 be born, what incentive structures we want to be exposed to. We have relatively little agency

1:51:56.480 --> 1:52:00.480
 in the entire thing. Humanity has relatively little agency in the whole thing. It's basically a

1:52:00.480 --> 1:52:04.960
 giant machine that's tumbling down a hill and everybody is fantastically trying to push some

1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:09.920
 buttons. Nobody knows what these buttons are meaning, what they connect to. And most of them

1:52:09.920 --> 1:52:15.200
 are not stopping this tumbling down the hill. As possible, the artificial intelligence will

1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:24.640
 give us an escape latch somehow. So there's a lot of worry about existential threats of

1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:31.200
 artificial intelligence. But what AI also allows in general forms of automation allows

1:52:32.560 --> 1:52:39.200
 the potential of extreme productivity growth that will also perhaps in a positive way transform

1:52:39.200 --> 1:52:51.680
 society that may allow us to inadvertently to return to the more, to the same kind of ideals

1:52:51.680 --> 1:52:59.280
 of closer to nature that's represented in hunter gatherer societies, that's not destroying the

1:52:59.280 --> 1:53:04.240
 planet, that's not doing overconsumption and so on. I mean, generally speaking, do you have hope

1:53:04.240 --> 1:53:11.120
 that AI can help somehow? I think it is not fun to be very close to nature until you completely

1:53:11.120 --> 1:53:17.520
 subdue nature. So our idea of being close to nature means being close to agriculture,

1:53:17.520 --> 1:53:21.840
 basically forests that don't have anything in them that eats us.

1:53:22.480 --> 1:53:29.040
 See, I mean, I want to disagree with that. I think the niceness of being close to nature

1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:38.160
 is to being fully present and in like, when survival becomes your primary, not just your goal,

1:53:38.160 --> 1:53:48.560
 but your whole existence. I'm not just romanticizing, I can just speak for myself.

1:53:48.560 --> 1:53:55.920
 I am self aware enough that that is a fulfilling existence. That's one that's very true.

1:53:55.920 --> 1:54:00.080
 I prefer to be in nature while I'm not fighting for my survival. I think fighting for your

1:54:00.080 --> 1:54:05.600
 survival while being in the cold and in the rain and being hunted by animals and having

1:54:05.600 --> 1:54:11.760
 open wounds is very unpleasant. There's a contradiction in there. Yes, I and you,

1:54:11.760 --> 1:54:18.160
 just as you said, would not choose it, but if I was forced into it, it would be a fulfilling

1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:24.560
 existence. If you are adapted to it, basically, if your brain is wired up in such a way that you'll

1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:30.640
 get rewards optimally in such an environment and there's some evidence for this that for a certain

1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:35.840
 degree of complexity, people are more happy in such an environment because it's what we largely

1:54:35.840 --> 1:54:40.880
 have evolved for. In between, we had a few thousand years in which I think we have evolved for a

1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:46.720
 slightly more comfortable environment. There is probably something like an intermediate stage

1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:51.920
 in which people would be more happy than there would be if they would have to fend for themselves

1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:57.840
 in small groups in the forest and often die versus something like this where we now have

1:54:57.840 --> 1:55:05.600
 basically a big machine, a big mordor in which we run through concrete boxes and press buttons

1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:11.440
 and machines and largely don't feel well cared for as the monkeys that we are.

1:55:12.960 --> 1:55:20.240
 So returning briefly to, not briefly, but returning to AI. Let me ask a romanticized

1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:26.320
 question. What is the most beautiful to you, silly ape? The most beautiful, surprising idea

1:55:26.320 --> 1:55:31.280
 in the development of artificial intelligence, whether in your own life or in the history of

1:55:31.280 --> 1:55:37.760
 artificial intelligence that you've come across? If you built an AI, it probably can make models at

1:55:37.760 --> 1:55:44.000
 an arbitrary degree of detail of the world and then it would try to understand its own nature.

1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:48.400
 It's tempting to think that at some point when we have general intelligence, we have competitions

1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:53.760
 where we will let the AIs wake up in different kinds of physical universes and we measure how many

1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:57.920
 movements of the Rubik's Cube it takes until it's figured out what's going on in its universe

1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:03.600
 and what it is and its own nature and its own physics and so on. So what if we exist in the

1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:08.400
 memory of an AI that is trying to understand its own nature and remembers its own genesis and

1:56:08.400 --> 1:56:14.240
 remembers Lex and Joshua sitting in a hotel, sparking some of the ideas of that led to the

1:56:14.240 --> 1:56:18.960
 development of general intelligence? So we're a kind of simulation that's running in an AI system

1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:24.960
 that's trying to understand itself. It's not that I believe that, but I think it's a beautiful

1:56:28.560 --> 1:56:35.040
 idea. I mean, you kind of return to this idea with a Turing test of intelligence being

1:56:36.880 --> 1:56:42.400
 of intelligence being the process of asking and answering what is intelligence.

1:56:42.400 --> 1:56:53.600
 I mean, why do you think there is an answer? Why is there such a search for an answer?

1:56:53.600 --> 1:56:58.800
 So does there have to be like an answer? You just had an AI system that's trying to

1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:02.880
 understand the why of what, you know, understand itself.

1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:09.920
 Is that a fundamental process of greater and greater complexity, greater and greater

1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:13.920
 intelligence? Is the continuous trying of understanding itself?

1:57:14.960 --> 1:57:19.360
 No, I think you will find that most people don't care about that because they're well adjusted enough

1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:24.800
 to not care. And the reason why people like you and me care about it probably has to do with the

1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:29.680
 need to understand ourselves. It's because we are in fundamental disagreement with the universe

1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:34.720
 that we wake up in. They look down on me and they say, oh my God, I'm caught in a monkey. What's that?

1:57:34.720 --> 1:57:39.120
 That's the feeling, right? That's the government and I'm unhappy with the

1:57:39.120 --> 1:57:44.960
 entire universe that I find myself in. Oh, so you don't think that's a fundamental

1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:50.400
 aspect of human nature that some people are just suppressing that they wake up shocked

1:57:50.400 --> 1:57:56.560
 they're in the body of a monkey? No, there is a clear adaptive value to not be confused by that.

1:57:56.560 --> 1:58:05.840
 Well, no, that's not what I asked. So, yeah, if there's clear adaptive value, then there's clear

1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:11.440
 adaptive value to while fundamentally your brain is confused by that, by creating an illusion.

1:58:11.440 --> 1:58:18.160
 Another layer of the narrative that says, you know, that tries to suppress that and instead

1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:21.760
 say that, you know, what's going on with the government right now is the most important

1:58:21.760 --> 1:58:26.480
 thing. What's going on with my football team is the most important thing. But it seems to me

1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:34.240
 the, like, for me, it was a really interesting moment reading Ernest Beck's denial of death,

1:58:35.040 --> 1:58:44.880
 that, you know, this kind of idea that we're all, you know, the fundamental thing from which most

1:58:44.880 --> 1:58:52.160
 of our human mind springs is this fear of mortality and being cognizant of your mortality and the

1:58:52.160 --> 1:58:59.440
 fear of that mortality. And then you construct illusions on top of that. I guess you being,

1:59:00.160 --> 1:59:07.600
 just to push on it, you really don't think it's possible that this worry of the big existential

1:59:07.600 --> 1:59:13.280
 questions is actually fundamental as the existentialist thought to our existence.

1:59:13.280 --> 1:59:18.880
 I think that the fear of death only plays a role as long as you don't see the big picture. The thing

1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:25.040
 is that minds are software states, right? Software doesn't have identity. Software in some sense is

1:59:25.040 --> 1:59:32.640
 a physical law. But it feels like there's an identity. I thought that was for this particular

1:59:32.640 --> 1:59:38.240
 piece of software. And the narrative it tells, that's a fundamental property of it. The

1:59:38.240 --> 1:59:42.960
 maintenance of the identity is not terminal. It's instrumental to something else. You maintain

1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:47.600
 your identity so you can serve your meaning. So you can do the things that you're supposed to do

1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:52.640
 before you die. And I suspect that for most people, the fear of death is the fear of dying before

1:59:52.640 --> 1:59:56.160
 they are done with the things that they feel they have to do, even though they cannot quite put their

1:59:56.160 --> 2:00:06.320
 finger on it, what that is. Right. But in the software world, return to the question, then what

2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:14.080
 happens after we die? Why would you care? You will not be longer there. The point of dying is that

2:00:14.080 --> 2:00:21.040
 you are gone. Well, maybe I'm not. This is what, you know, it seems like there's so much,

2:00:23.040 --> 2:00:28.800
 in the idea that this is just, the mind is just a simulation that's constructing a narrative around

2:00:28.800 --> 2:00:37.280
 some particular aspects of the quantum mechanical wave function world that we can't quite get direct

2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:45.280
 access to. Then like the idea of mortality seems to be fuzzy as well. Maybe there's not a clear

2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:51.040
 answer. The fuzzy idea is the one of continuous existence. We don't have continuous existence.

2:00:51.040 --> 2:00:56.560
 How do you know that? Because it's not computable. Because you're saying it's...

2:00:56.560 --> 2:00:59.520
 There is no continuous process. The only thing that binds you together with the

2:00:59.520 --> 2:01:03.760
 Lex Friedman from yesterday is the illusion that you have memories about him. So if you

2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:08.000
 want to upload, it's very easy. You make a machine that thinks it's you. Because it's the same thing

2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:13.520
 that you are. You are a machine that thinks it's you. But that's immortality. Yeah, but it's just

2:01:13.520 --> 2:01:18.160
 a belief. You can create this belief very easily. Once you realize that the question whether you

2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:25.280
 are immortal or not depends entirely on your beliefs and your own continuity. But then you can

2:01:25.280 --> 2:01:32.000
 be immortal by the continuity of the belief. It cannot be immortal, but you can stop being afraid

2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:36.400
 of your mortality because you realize you were never continuously existing in the first place.

2:01:37.760 --> 2:01:42.080
 Well, I don't know if I'd be more terrified or less terrified with that. It seems like the fact

2:01:42.080 --> 2:01:47.520
 that I existed. So you don't know this state in which you don't have a self. You can turn off

2:01:47.520 --> 2:01:53.840
 yourself, you know? I can't turn off myself. You can turn it off. I can. Yes, and you can

2:01:53.840 --> 2:01:57.920
 basically meditate yourself in a state where you are still conscious. There are still things

2:01:57.920 --> 2:02:02.400
 are happening where you know everything that you knew before, but you're no longer identified with

2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:09.120
 changing anything. And this means that yourself in a way dissolves. There is no longer this person.

2:02:09.120 --> 2:02:13.920
 You know that this person construct exists in other states and it runs on this brain of

2:02:13.920 --> 2:02:20.080
 lack of treatment. But it's not a real thing. It's a construct. It's an idea. And you can change

2:02:20.080 --> 2:02:25.040
 that idea. And if you let go of this idea, if you don't think that you are special,

2:02:25.040 --> 2:02:29.760
 you realize it's just one of many people and it's not your favorite person even, right? It's

2:02:29.760 --> 2:02:34.160
 just one of many. And it's the one that you are doomed to control for the most part,

2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:39.680
 and that is basically informing the actions of this organism as a control model. And this is

2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:44.160
 all there is. And you are somehow afraid that this control model gets interrupted

2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:51.440
 or loses the identity of continuity. Yeah, so I'm attached. I mean, yeah, it's a very popular,

2:02:51.440 --> 2:02:58.000
 it's a somehow compelling notion that being, being attached, like there's no need to be attached to

2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:06.880
 this idea of an identity. But that in itself could be an illusion that you construct. So the

2:03:06.880 --> 2:03:12.400
 process of meditation while popular is thought of as getting under the concept of identity,

2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:16.880
 it could be just putting a cloak over it, just telling it to be quiet for the moment.

2:03:16.880 --> 2:03:25.120
 You know, I think that meditation is eventually just a bunch of techniques that let you control

2:03:25.120 --> 2:03:30.480
 attention. And when you can control attention, you can get access to your own source code,

2:03:30.480 --> 2:03:35.040
 hopefully not before you understand what you're doing. And then you can change the way it works

2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:41.760
 temporarily or permanently. So yeah, meditation is to get a glimpse at the source code, get under

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:44.560
 sort of basically control or turn off the attention. The entire thing is that you learn to

2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:48.560
 control attention. So everything else is downstream from controlling attention.

2:03:48.560 --> 2:03:52.080
 And control the attention that's looking at the attention?

2:03:52.080 --> 2:03:55.920
 Normally, we only get attention in the parts of our mind that create heat where you have a

2:03:55.920 --> 2:04:01.520
 mismatch between model and the results that are happening. And so most people are not self aware

2:04:01.520 --> 2:04:06.560
 because their control is too good. If everything works out roughly the way you want, and the only

2:04:06.560 --> 2:04:11.600
 things that don't work out is whether your football team wins, then you will mostly have models

2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:16.560
 about these domains. And it's only when, for instance, your fundamental relationships to the

2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:21.840
 world around you don't work because the ideology of your country is insane and the other kids are

2:04:21.840 --> 2:04:27.040
 not nerds and don't understand why you understand physics and you don't why you want to understand

2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:30.560
 physics and you don't understand why somebody would not want to understand physics.

2:04:31.920 --> 2:04:37.520
 So we kind of brought up neurons in the brain as reinforcement learning agents.

2:04:37.520 --> 2:04:44.960
 And there's been some successes as you brought up with Go, with AlphaGo AlphaZero,

2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:49.280
 with ideas of self play, which I think are incredibly interesting ideas of systems playing

2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:58.480
 each other in an automated way to improve by playing other systems in a particular construct

2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:04.000
 of a game that are a little bit better than itself and then thereby improving continuously.

2:05:04.000 --> 2:05:09.520
 All the competitors in the game are improving gradually, so being just challenging enough

2:05:09.520 --> 2:05:15.440
 and learning from the process of the competition. Do you have hope for that reinforcement learning

2:05:15.440 --> 2:05:19.760
 process to achieve greater and greater level of intelligence? So we talked about different

2:05:19.760 --> 2:05:27.040
 ideas in AI that we need to be solved. Is RL a part of that process of trying to create an

2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:31.520
 AGI system? So definitely forms of unsupervised learning, but there are many algorithms that

2:05:31.520 --> 2:05:38.000
 can achieve that. And I suspect that ultimately the algorithms that work, there will be class of

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:44.640
 them or many of them, and they might have small differences of magnitude and efficiency. But

2:05:44.640 --> 2:05:49.120
 eventually what matters is the type of model that you form. And the types of models that we

2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:57.600
 form right now are not sparse enough. What does it mean to be sparse? It means that ideally every

2:05:57.600 --> 2:06:05.680
 potential model state should correspond to a potential world state. So basically, if you vary

2:06:05.680 --> 2:06:10.480
 states in your model, you always end up with valid world states. And our mind is not quite there.

2:06:10.480 --> 2:06:15.040
 So an indication is basically what we see in dreams. The older we get, the more boring our

2:06:15.040 --> 2:06:20.080
 dreams become because we incorporate more and more constraints that we learned about how the world

2:06:20.080 --> 2:06:25.280
 works. So many of the things that we imagine to be possible as children turn out to be

2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:31.600
 constrained by physical and social dynamics. And as a result, fewer and fewer things remain

2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:36.000
 possible. And it's not because our imagination scales back, but the constraints under which it

2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:42.240
 operates become tighter and tighter. And so the constraints under which our neural networks operate

2:06:42.240 --> 2:06:46.960
 are almost limitless, which means it's very difficult to get a neural network to imagine

2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:54.160
 things that look real. Right. So I suspect part of what we need to do is we probably need to

2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:59.680
 build dreaming systems. I suspect that part of the purpose of dreams is to, similar to a

2:06:59.680 --> 2:07:05.040
 generative adversarial network, learn certain constraints, and then it produces alternative

2:07:05.040 --> 2:07:10.720
 perspectives on the same set of constraints. So you can recognize it under different circumstances.

2:07:10.720 --> 2:07:15.440
 Maybe we have flying dreams as children, because we recreate the objects that we know and the maps

2:07:15.440 --> 2:07:19.520
 that we know from different perspectives, which also means from a bird's eye perspective.

2:07:19.520 --> 2:07:26.400
 So I mean, aren't we doing that anyway? I mean, not with our eyes closed and when we're sleeping.

2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:31.440
 Are we just constantly running dreams and simulations in our mind as we try to interpret

2:07:31.440 --> 2:07:36.960
 the environment? I mean, sort of considering all the different possibilities, the way we interact

2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:45.360
 with the environment seems like essentially, like you said, sort of creating a bunch of

2:07:45.360 --> 2:07:50.720
 simulations that are consistent with our expectations, with our previous experiences,

2:07:50.720 --> 2:08:01.200
 with the things we just saw recently. And through that hallucination process, we are able to then

2:08:01.200 --> 2:08:06.960
 somehow stitch together what actually we see in the world with the simulations that match it well

2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:12.640
 and thereby interpret it. I suspect that you and my brain are sadly unusual in this regard,

2:08:12.640 --> 2:08:19.520
 which is probably what got you into MIT. So this obsession of constantly pondering possibilities

2:08:19.520 --> 2:08:27.520
 and solutions to problems. Oh, stop. But I think I'm not talking about intellectual stuff. I'm

2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:35.440
 talking about just doing the kind of stuff it takes to walk and not fall. Yes, this is largely

2:08:35.440 --> 2:08:43.920
 automatic. Yes, but the process is, I mean... It's not complicated. It's relatively easy to

2:08:43.920 --> 2:08:49.120
 build a neural network that in some sense learns the dynamics. The fact that we haven't done it

2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:53.440
 right so far, it doesn't mean it's hard because you can see that a biological organism does it.

2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:58.160
 There's relatively few neurons. So basically, you build a bunch of neural oscillators that

2:08:58.160 --> 2:09:02.800
 entrain themselves with the dynamics of your body in such a way that the regulator becomes

2:09:02.800 --> 2:09:08.480
 isomorphic in its model to the dynamics that it regulates, and then it's automatic. And it's only

2:09:08.480 --> 2:09:11.360
 interesting the sense that it captures attention when the system is off.

2:09:12.080 --> 2:09:19.520
 See, but thinking of the kind of mechanism that's required to do walking as a controller, as a

2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:29.920
 neural network, I think it's a compelling notion, but it discards quietly or at least makes implicit

2:09:29.920 --> 2:09:34.640
 the fact that you need to have something like common sense reasoning to walk. That's not,

2:09:34.640 --> 2:09:40.400
 it's an open question whether you do or not. But my intuition is to act in this world,

2:09:40.400 --> 2:09:46.400
 there's a huge knowledge base that's underlying it somehow. There's so much information

2:09:47.440 --> 2:09:54.400
 of the kind we have never been able to construct in our neural networks or in artificial intelligence

2:09:54.400 --> 2:10:00.960
 systems period, which is like it's humbling, at least in my imagination, the amount of information

2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:08.480
 required to act in this world humbles me. And I think saying that neural networks can accomplish

2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:16.720
 it is missing the fact that we don't, yeah, we don't have yet a mechanism for constructing

2:10:16.720 --> 2:10:25.440
 something like common sense reasoning. I mean, what's your sense about to linger on how much,

2:10:25.440 --> 2:10:31.200
 you know, to linger on the idea of what kind of mechanism would be effective at walking?

2:10:31.200 --> 2:10:36.160
 You said just a neural network, not maybe the kind we have, but something a little bit better

2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:40.720
 would be able to walk easily. Don't you think it also needs to know

2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:48.240
 a huge amount of knowledge that's represented under the flag of common sense reasoning?

2:10:48.240 --> 2:10:52.400
 How much common sense knowledge do we actually have? Imagine that you are really hardworking

2:10:52.400 --> 2:10:57.120
 through all your life and you form two new concepts every half hour. So you end up with

2:10:57.120 --> 2:11:02.240
 something like a million concepts because you don't get that old. So a million concepts,

2:11:02.240 --> 2:11:09.200
 that's not a lot. So it's not just a million concepts. I think it would be a lot, I personally

2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:13.440
 think it might be much more than a million. But if you think just about the numbers,

2:11:13.440 --> 2:11:17.920
 you don't live that long. If you think about how many cycles do your neurons have in your

2:11:17.920 --> 2:11:24.000
 life, it's quite limited. You don't get that old. Yeah, but the powerful thing is the number of

2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:31.920
 concepts, and they're probably deeply hierarchical in nature, the relations as you described between

2:11:31.920 --> 2:11:38.000
 them is the key thing. So it's like even if it's a million concepts, the graph of relations that's

2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:46.400
 formed and some kind of probabilistic relationships, that's what common sense reasoning is,

2:11:46.400 --> 2:11:53.120
 the relationship between things. In some sense, I think of the concepts as the address space for

2:11:53.120 --> 2:11:57.600
 our behavior programs. And the behavior programs allow us to recognize objects and interact with

2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:03.440
 them, also mental objects. And a large part of that is the physical world that we interact with,

2:12:03.440 --> 2:12:08.000
 which is this res extensor thing, which is basically a navigation of information and space.

2:12:08.800 --> 2:12:16.080
 And basically, it's similar to a game engine. It's a physics engine that you can use to describe

2:12:16.080 --> 2:12:21.360
 and predict how things that look in a particular way, that feel when you touch them in particular

2:12:21.360 --> 2:12:25.760
 way, that are appropriate, that have auditory perception and so on, how they work out. So

2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:31.840
 basically the geometry of all these things. And this is probably 80% of what our brain is doing,

2:12:31.840 --> 2:12:36.560
 is dealing with that with this real time simulation. And by itself, a game engine is

2:12:36.560 --> 2:12:41.440
 fascinating, but it's not that hard to understand what it's doing, right? And our game engines

2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:49.120
 are already in some sense, approximating the fidelity of what we can perceive. So if we

2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:55.040
 put on an Oculus Quest, we get something that is still relatively crude with respect to what we

2:12:55.040 --> 2:12:59.120
 can perceive, but it's also in the same ballpark already, right? It's just a couple order of

2:12:59.120 --> 2:13:05.760
 magnitudes away from saturating our perception in terms of the complexity that it can produce.

2:13:05.760 --> 2:13:11.440
 So in some sense, it's reasonable to say that the computer that you can buy and put into your home

2:13:11.440 --> 2:13:16.960
 is able to give a perceptual reality that has a detail that is already in the same ballpark as

2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:22.800
 what your brain can process. And everything else are ideas about the world. And I suspect that

2:13:22.800 --> 2:13:28.240
 they are relatively sparse and also the intuitive models that we form about social interaction.

2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:33.200
 Social interaction is not so hard. It's just hard for us nerds because we all have our wires

2:13:33.200 --> 2:13:38.320
 crossed, so we need to deduce them. But the pyres are present in most social animals. So

2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:44.560
 it's an interesting thing to notice that many domestic social animals, like cats and dogs,

2:13:44.560 --> 2:13:51.440
 have better social cognition than children. I hope so. I hope it's not that many concepts

2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:57.440
 fundamentally to do to exist in this world. For me, it's more like I'm afraid so because

2:13:57.440 --> 2:14:02.560
 this thing that we only appear to be so complex to each other because we are so stupid is a little

2:14:02.560 --> 2:14:11.040
 bit depressing. Yeah, to me that's inspiring if we're indeed as stupid as it seems.

2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:15.920
 I think our brains don't scale and the information processing that we build tend to scale very well.

2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:23.920
 Yeah, but one of the things that worries me is that the fact that the brain doesn't scale

2:14:23.920 --> 2:14:30.080
 means that that's actually a fundamental feature of the brain. All the flaws of the brain,

2:14:30.080 --> 2:14:35.120
 everything we see as limitations, perhaps there is a fundamental, the constraints on the system

2:14:35.120 --> 2:14:43.840
 could be a requirement of its power, which is different than our current understanding of

2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:48.720
 intelligent systems where scale, especially with deep learning, especially with reinforcement

2:14:48.720 --> 2:14:56.320
 learning, the hope behind open AI in deep mind, all the major results really have to do with

2:14:56.320 --> 2:15:01.760
 huge compute. And yeah. It would also be that our brains are so small, not just because they

2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:07.520
 take up so much glucose in our body, like 20% of the glucose so they don't arbitrarily scale.

2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:11.600
 But there are some animals like elephants which have larger brains than us and they don't seem

2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:16.160
 to be smarter. Elephants seem to be autistic. They have very, very good motor control and

2:15:16.160 --> 2:15:20.240
 they're really good with details, but they really struggle to see the big picture. So you can make

2:15:20.240 --> 2:15:27.040
 them recreate drawings stroke by stroke. They can do that, but they cannot reproduce a still life.

2:15:27.040 --> 2:15:31.440
 So they cannot make a drawing of a scene that they see. They will always be only able to

2:15:31.440 --> 2:15:34.800
 reproduce the line drawing, at least as far from what I could see in the experiments.

2:15:35.760 --> 2:15:40.720
 Yeah. Why is that? Maybe smarter elephants would meditate themselves out of existence

2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:44.160
 because their brains are too large. So basically the elephants that were not autistic,

2:15:44.160 --> 2:15:48.160
 they didn't reproduce. Yeah. So we have to remember that the brain

2:15:48.160 --> 2:15:52.080
 is fundamentally interlinked with the body in our human and biological system.

2:15:52.080 --> 2:15:56.480
 Do you think that AGI systems that we try to create or greater intelligence systems would

2:15:56.480 --> 2:16:01.920
 need to have a body? I think that should be able to make use of a body if you give it to them.

2:16:02.960 --> 2:16:07.600
 But I don't think that I fundamentally need a body. So I suspect if you can interact with the

2:16:07.600 --> 2:16:13.280
 world by moving your eyes and your head, you can make controlled experiments. And this allows you

2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:21.200
 to have many magnitudes, fewer observations in order to reduce the uncertainty in your models.

2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:25.040
 So you can pinpoint the areas in your models where you're not quite sure and you just move

2:16:25.040 --> 2:16:30.000
 your head and see what's going on over there and you get additional information. If you just have

2:16:30.000 --> 2:16:34.560
 to use YouTube as an input and you cannot do anything beyond this, you probably need just

2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:40.080
 much more data. But we have much more data. So if you can build a system that has enough

2:16:40.080 --> 2:16:44.720
 time and attention to browse all of YouTube and extract all the information that there is to be

2:16:44.720 --> 2:16:49.040
 found, I don't think there's an obvious limit to what it can do.

2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:53.760
 Yeah, but it seems that the interactivity is a fundamental thing that the physical body allows

2:16:53.760 --> 2:16:59.920
 you to do. But let me ask on that topic, that's what a body is, is allowing the brain to touch

2:16:59.920 --> 2:17:05.840
 things and move things and interact with whether the physical world exists or not, whatever,

2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:12.240
 but interact with some interface to the physical world. What about a virtual world? Do you think

2:17:13.680 --> 2:17:22.640
 we can do the same kind of reasoning, consciousness, intelligence if we put on a VR headset and move

2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:27.200
 over to that world? Do you think there's any fundamental difference between the interface,

2:17:27.200 --> 2:17:31.760
 the physical world, that it's here in this hotel and if we were sitting in the same hotel in the

2:17:31.760 --> 2:17:38.160
 virtual world? The question is, does this nonphysical world or this other environment entice you to

2:17:38.160 --> 2:17:43.840
 solve problems that require general intelligence? If it doesn't, then you probably will not develop

2:17:43.840 --> 2:17:47.760
 general intelligence. And arguably, most people are not generally intelligent because they don't

2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:52.240
 have to solve problems that make them generally intelligent. And even for us, it's not yet clear

2:17:52.240 --> 2:17:57.360
 if we are smart enough to build AI and understand our own nature to this degree. So it could be

2:17:57.360 --> 2:18:01.440
 a matter of capacity. And for most people, it's in the first place a matter of interest. They

2:18:01.440 --> 2:18:05.920
 don't see the point because the benefit of attempting this project are marginal because

2:18:05.920 --> 2:18:10.320
 you're probably not going to succeed in it. And the cost of trying to do it requires complete

2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:15.120
 dedication of your entire life. But it seems like the possibility is what you can do in the

2:18:15.120 --> 2:18:20.400
 virtual world. So imagine that is much greater than you can in the real world. So imagine a

2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:26.960
 situation and be interesting option for me. If somebody came to me and offered what I'll do

2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:34.000
 is so from now on, you can only exist in the virtual world. And so you put on this headset.

2:18:34.000 --> 2:18:39.920
 And when you eat, we'll make sure to connect your body up in a way that when you eat in the

2:18:39.920 --> 2:18:44.080
 virtual world, your body will be nourished in the same way in the virtual world. So

2:18:44.080 --> 2:18:49.600
 the aligning incentives between the our common sort of real world and the virtual world. But

2:18:49.600 --> 2:18:55.200
 then the possibilities become much bigger. Like I could be other kinds of creatures I could do.

2:18:55.200 --> 2:18:59.840
 I can break the laws of physics. We know them. I could do a lot. I mean, the possibilities

2:18:59.840 --> 2:19:06.160
 are endless, right? As far as we think, it's an interesting thought whether like what existence

2:19:06.160 --> 2:19:11.840
 would be like, what kind of intelligence would emerge there, what kind of consciousness, what

2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:18.720
 kind of maybe greater intelligence, even in me, Lex, even at this stage in my life, if I spend

2:19:18.720 --> 2:19:24.320
 the next 20 years in that world to see how that intelligence emerges. And if I was,

2:19:24.320 --> 2:19:28.800
 if that happened at the very beginning, before I was even cognizant of my existence in this

2:19:28.800 --> 2:19:34.560
 physical world, it's interesting to think how that child would develop. And the way

2:19:34.560 --> 2:19:39.520
 virtual reality and digitization of everything is moving, it's not completely out of the realm

2:19:39.520 --> 2:19:46.880
 of possibility that we're all, that some part of our lives will, if not entirety of it, will live

2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:52.800
 in a virtual world to a greater degree than we currently have living on Twitter and social media

2:19:52.800 --> 2:20:00.240
 and so on. Do you have, I mean, does something draw you intellectually or naturally in terms

2:20:00.240 --> 2:20:04.000
 of thinking about AI to this virtual world, or more possibilities?

2:20:05.600 --> 2:20:09.840
 I think that currently it's a waste of time to deal with the physical world before we have

2:20:09.840 --> 2:20:14.720
 mechanisms that can automatically learn how to deal with it. The body gives you a second order

2:20:14.720 --> 2:20:21.280
 agency. What constitutes the body is the things that you can indirectly control. Third order

2:20:21.280 --> 2:20:26.800
 are tools. And the second order is the things that are basically always present. But you operate

2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:32.080
 on them with first order things, which are mental operators. And the zero order is,

2:20:32.080 --> 2:20:39.600
 in some sense, the direct sense of what you're deciding. So you observe yourself initiating

2:20:39.600 --> 2:20:44.800
 an action. There are features that you interpret as the initiation of an action. Then you perform

2:20:44.800 --> 2:20:49.360
 the operations that you perform to make that happen. And then you see the movement of your

2:20:49.360 --> 2:20:53.920
 limbs. And you learn to associate those and thereby model your own agency over this feedback.

2:20:54.560 --> 2:20:58.080
 But the first feedback that you get is from this first order thing already. Basically,

2:20:58.080 --> 2:21:02.640
 you decide to think a thought and the thought is being thought. You decide to change the thought

2:21:02.640 --> 2:21:07.520
 and you observe how the thought is being changed. And in some sense, this is, you could say, an

2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:12.320
 embodiment already. And I suspect it's sufficient as an embodiment for intelligence.

2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:17.360
 And so it's not that important, at least at this time, to consider variations in the second order.

2:21:17.360 --> 2:21:24.080
 Yes. But the thing that you also put mentioned just now is physics that you could change in

2:21:24.080 --> 2:21:29.120
 any way you want. So you need an environment that puts up resistance against you. If there's

2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:33.920
 nothing to control, you cannot make models. There needs to be a particular way that resists you.

2:21:34.640 --> 2:21:38.880
 And by the way, your motivation is usually outside of your mind. It resists your motivation,

2:21:38.880 --> 2:21:43.040
 is what gets you up in the morning, even though it would be much less work to stay in bed.

2:21:43.040 --> 2:21:51.520
 Right? So it's basically forcing you to resist the environment. And it forces your mind to serve

2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:56.720
 it, to serve this resistance to the environment. So in some sense, it is also putting up resistance

2:21:56.720 --> 2:22:01.280
 against the natural tendency of the mind to not do anything. Yeah. But so some of that resistance,

2:22:01.280 --> 2:22:05.600
 just like you described with motivation, is like in the first order, it's in the mind.

2:22:05.600 --> 2:22:10.240
 Some resistance is in the second order, like the actual physical objects pushing against

2:22:10.240 --> 2:22:14.560
 you and so on. It seems that the second order stuff in virtual reality could be recreated.

2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:19.040
 Of course. But it might be sufficient that you just do mathematics and mathematics is

2:22:19.040 --> 2:22:24.160
 already putting up enough resistance against you. So basically just with an aesthetic motive,

2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:29.840
 this could maybe sufficient to form a type of intelligence. It would probably not be a very

2:22:29.840 --> 2:22:37.360
 human intelligence, but it might be one that is already general. So to mess with this zero

2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:42.320
 order, maybe first order, what do you think about ideas of brain computer interfaces? So

2:22:42.320 --> 2:22:47.120
 again, returning to our friend Elon Musk and Neuralink, a company that's trying to,

2:22:47.120 --> 2:22:52.000
 of course, there's a lot of trying to cure diseases and so on with a near term. But the

2:22:52.000 --> 2:22:56.880
 long term vision is to add an extra layer to basically expand the capacity of the brain

2:22:58.480 --> 2:23:04.400
 connected to the computational world. Do you think one that's possible,

2:23:04.400 --> 2:23:07.840
 too, how does that change the fundamentals of the zero of the order in the first order?

2:23:07.840 --> 2:23:11.920
 It's technically possible, but I don't see that the FDA would ever allow me to drill holes in

2:23:11.920 --> 2:23:17.200
 my skull to interface my neocortex on mass envisions. So at the moment, I can do horrible

2:23:17.200 --> 2:23:23.120
 things to mice, but I'm not able to do useful things to people, except maybe at some point

2:23:23.120 --> 2:23:28.240
 down the line in medical applications. So this thing that we are envisioning, which means

2:23:28.240 --> 2:23:34.720
 recreational and recreational brain computer interfaces are probably not going to happen

2:23:34.720 --> 2:23:41.120
 in the present legal system. I love it. How I'm asking you out there, philosophical and

2:23:42.160 --> 2:23:48.080
 sort of engineering questions. And for the first time ever, you jumped to the legal FDA.

2:23:48.080 --> 2:23:51.760
 There would be enough people that would be crazy enough to have holes drilled in their skull to

2:23:51.760 --> 2:23:57.680
 try a new type of brain computer interface. But also if it works, FDA will approve it.

2:23:57.680 --> 2:24:04.160
 I work a lot with autonomous vehicles. Yes, you can say that it's going to be a very difficult

2:24:04.160 --> 2:24:08.080
 regulatory process of approving autonomous, but it doesn't mean autonomous vehicles are

2:24:08.080 --> 2:24:13.200
 never going to happen. No, they will totally happen as soon as we create jobs for at least

2:24:13.200 --> 2:24:22.640
 two lawyers and one regulator per car. Yes, lawyers. Lawyers is the fundamental

2:24:22.640 --> 2:24:28.560
 substrate of reality. In the US, it's a very weird system. It's not universal in the world.

2:24:29.440 --> 2:24:33.120
 The law is a very interesting software once you realize it, right? These circuits are,

2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:38.080
 in some sense, streams of software and there is largely works by exception handling.

2:24:38.080 --> 2:24:42.000
 So you make decisions on the ground and they get synchronized with the next level structure as

2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:48.240
 soon as an exception is being thrown. So it escalates the exception handling. The process is

2:24:48.240 --> 2:24:54.960
 very expensive, especially since it incentivizes the lawyers for producing work for lawyers.

2:24:54.960 --> 2:25:03.600
 Yes, so the exceptions are actually incentivized for firing often. But to return, outside of lawyers,

2:25:04.640 --> 2:25:10.560
 is there anything fundamentally, is there anything interesting, insightful about the

2:25:10.560 --> 2:25:15.280
 possibility of this extra layer of intelligence added to the brain?

2:25:15.280 --> 2:25:20.880
 I do think so, but I don't think that you need technically invasive procedures to do so.

2:25:20.880 --> 2:25:25.120
 We can already interface with other people by observing them very, very closely and getting

2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:31.680
 in some kind of empathetic resonance. And I'm not very good at this, but I noticed that people

2:25:31.680 --> 2:25:37.360
 are able to do this to some degree. And it basically means that we model an interface

2:25:37.360 --> 2:25:42.400
 layer of the other person in real time. And it works despite our neurons being slow,

2:25:42.400 --> 2:25:46.960
 because most of the things that we do are built on periodic processes. So you just need to train

2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:52.320
 yourself with the oscillation that happens. And if the oscillation itself changes slowly enough,

2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:59.200
 you can basically follow along. Right. But the bandwidth of the interaction,

2:26:00.800 --> 2:26:03.680
 it seems like you can do a lot more computation when there's...

2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:08.560
 Yes, of course. But the other thing is that the bandwidth that our brain, our own mind is running

2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:13.280
 on is actually quite slow. So the number of thoughts that I can productively think in any

2:26:13.280 --> 2:26:18.400
 given day is quite limited. But it's much... If they had the discipline to write it down

2:26:18.400 --> 2:26:22.960
 and the speed to write it down, maybe it would be a book every day or so. But if you think about

2:26:22.960 --> 2:26:26.880
 the computers that we can build, the magnitudes at which they operate,

2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:30.720
 right, this would be nothing. It's something that they can put out in a second.

2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:37.120
 Well, I don't know. So it's possible sort of the number of thoughts you have in your brain is...

2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:42.000
 It could be several orders of magnitude higher than what you're possibly able to express through

2:26:42.000 --> 2:26:48.160
 your fingers or through your voice. Most of them are going to be repetitive. Because they...

2:26:48.160 --> 2:26:52.960
 How do you know that? Because they have to control the same problems every day. When I walk,

2:26:52.960 --> 2:26:57.600
 there are going to be processes in my brain that model my walking pattern and regulate them and

2:26:57.600 --> 2:27:00.560
 so on. But it's going to be pretty much the same every day. But that could be because...

2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:03.040
 But that could be because... Every step. But I'm talking about intellectual reason,

2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:06.880
 like thinking. So the question, what is the best system of government? So you sit down and

2:27:06.880 --> 2:27:11.200
 start thinking about that. One of the constraints is that you don't have access to a lot of...

2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:17.520
 You don't have access to a lot of facts, a lot of studies. You always have to interface with

2:27:17.520 --> 2:27:24.560
 something else to learn more, to aid in your reasoning process. If you can directly access

2:27:24.560 --> 2:27:29.280
 all of Wikipedia and try to understand what is the best form of government, then every thought

2:27:29.280 --> 2:27:34.080
 won't be stuck in a loop. Every thought that requires some extra piece of information will

2:27:34.080 --> 2:27:40.080
 be able to grab it really quickly. That's the possibility of... If the bottleneck is literally

2:27:40.080 --> 2:27:49.200
 the information that the bottleneck of breakthrough ideas is just being able to quickly access huge

2:27:49.200 --> 2:27:54.080
 amounts of information, then the possibility of connecting your brain to the computer could lead

2:27:54.080 --> 2:28:00.320
 to totally new... Totally new breakthroughs. You can think of mathematicians being able to

2:28:00.320 --> 2:28:08.720
 just up the orders of magnitude of power in their reasoning about mathematical roots.

2:28:08.720 --> 2:28:14.160
 What if humanity has already discovered the optimal form of government through a evolutionary

2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:20.400
 process? There is an evolution going on. What we discover is that maybe the problem of government

2:28:20.400 --> 2:28:25.200
 doesn't have stable solutions for us as a species, because we are not designed in such a way that we

2:28:25.200 --> 2:28:30.960
 can make everybody conform to them. But there could be solutions that work under different

2:28:30.960 --> 2:28:35.680
 circumstances or that they're the best for certain environment and depends on, for instance,

2:28:35.680 --> 2:28:41.840
 the primary forms of ownership and the means of production. If the main means of production is land,

2:28:42.480 --> 2:28:48.240
 then the forms of government will be regulated by the landowners and you get a monarchy.

2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:54.720
 If you also want to have a form of government in which you depend on some form of slavery,

2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:58.640
 for instance, where the peasants have to work very long hours for very little gain,

2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:04.480
 so very few people can have plumbing, then maybe you need to promise them that you get paid in

2:29:04.480 --> 2:29:12.320
 the afterlife over time. You need a theocracy. For much of human history in the West,

2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:18.000
 we had a combination of monarchy and theocracy that was our form of governance. At the same time,

2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:24.400
 the Catholic Church implemented game theoretic principles. I recently reread Thomas

2:29:24.400 --> 2:29:29.600
 Okinas. It's very interesting to see this because he was not a dualist. He was translating Aristotle

2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:36.640
 in a particular way for designing an operating system for the Catholic society. He says that

2:29:36.640 --> 2:29:41.840
 basically people are animals in very much the same way as Aristotle envisions, which basically

2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:46.960
 organisms with cybernetic control. Then he says that there are initial rational principles that

2:29:46.960 --> 2:29:51.600
 humans can discover and everybody can discover them so they are universal. If you are sane,

2:29:51.600 --> 2:29:55.840
 you should understand you should submit to them because you can rationally deduce them.

2:29:55.840 --> 2:30:03.920
 And these principles are roughly you should be willing to self regulate correctly. You should

2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:11.280
 be willing to do correct social regulation. It's intraorganismic. You should be willing

2:30:11.280 --> 2:30:18.720
 to act on your models. So you have skin in the game. And you should have goal rationality. You

2:30:18.720 --> 2:30:25.200
 should be choosing the right goals to work on. So basically these three rational principles,

2:30:25.200 --> 2:30:31.600
 goal rationality he calls prudence or wisdom. Social regulation is justice. The correct social

2:30:31.600 --> 2:30:37.760
 one and the internal regulation is temperance. And this I think willingness to act on your models

2:30:37.760 --> 2:30:42.880
 is courage. And then he says that there are additionally to these four cardinal virtues,

2:30:43.600 --> 2:30:47.440
 three divine virtues. And these three divine virtues cannot be rationally deduced,

2:30:47.440 --> 2:30:52.000
 but they reveal themselves by the harmony, which means if you assume them and you extrapolate

2:30:52.000 --> 2:30:57.680
 what's going to happen, you will see that they make sense. And it's often been misunderstood as

2:30:57.680 --> 2:31:01.600
 God has to tell you that these are the things. So basically there's something nefarious going on.

2:31:02.800 --> 2:31:08.000
 The Christian conspiracy forces you to believe some guy with a long beard that they discovered

2:31:08.000 --> 2:31:14.480
 this. But so these principles are relatively simple. Again, it's for high level organization

2:31:14.480 --> 2:31:20.240
 for the resulting civilization that you form. Commitment to unity. So basically you serve this

2:31:20.240 --> 2:31:25.360
 higher larger thing, this structural principle on the next level. And he calls that phase.

2:31:26.400 --> 2:31:31.120
 Then there needs to be a commitment to shared purpose. This is basically this global reward

2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:34.960
 that you try to figure out what that should be and how you can facilitate this. And this is love.

2:31:34.960 --> 2:31:40.080
 The commitment to shared purpose is the core of love. You see this sacred thing that is more

2:31:40.080 --> 2:31:44.640
 important than your own organismic interests in the other. And you serve this together. And this

2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:49.920
 is how you see the sacred in the other. And the last one is hope, which means you need to be willing

2:31:49.920 --> 2:31:55.600
 to act on that principle without getting rewards in the here and now, because it doesn't exist yet.

2:31:55.600 --> 2:32:00.000
 Then you start out building the civilization. So you need to be able to do this in the absence

2:32:00.640 --> 2:32:04.880
 of its actual existence yet. So it can come into being.

2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:11.040
 So the way it comes into being is by you accepting those notions and then you see these

2:32:11.040 --> 2:32:15.840
 three divine concepts and you see them realized. And now the problem is divine is a loaded concept

2:32:15.840 --> 2:32:20.880
 in our world, because we are outside of this cult and we are still scarred from breaking free of it.

2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:25.280
 But the idea is basically we need to have a civilization that acts as an intentional agent,

2:32:25.280 --> 2:32:30.320
 like an insect state. And we are not actually a tribal species, we are a state building species.

2:32:30.320 --> 2:32:37.280
 And what enabled state building is basically the formation of religious states and other forms

2:32:37.280 --> 2:32:42.400
 of rule based administration in which the individual doesn't matter as much as the rule or the higher

2:32:42.400 --> 2:32:47.040
 goal. We got there by the question, what's the optimal form of governance? So I don't think

2:32:47.040 --> 2:32:52.560
 that Catholicism is the optimal form of governance because it's obviously on the way out. So it is

2:32:52.560 --> 2:32:58.320
 for the present type of society that we are in. Religious institutions don't seem to be

2:32:58.320 --> 2:33:04.240
 optimal to organize that. So what we discovered right now that we live in in the West is democracy.

2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:08.480
 And democracy is the role of oligarchs that are the people that currently own the means of production

2:33:09.440 --> 2:33:14.240
 that is administered not by the oligarchs themselves, because there's too much disruption,

2:33:14.240 --> 2:33:19.040
 right? We have so much innovation that we have in every generation new means of production

2:33:19.040 --> 2:33:24.240
 that we invent. And corporations die usually after 30 years or so and something other

2:33:24.240 --> 2:33:30.240
 takes a leading role in our societies. So it's administered by institutions. And these institutions

2:33:30.240 --> 2:33:36.880
 themselves are not elected, but they provide continuity. And they are led by electable politicians.

2:33:37.440 --> 2:33:41.600
 And this makes it possible that you can adapt to change without having to kill people, right? So

2:33:41.600 --> 2:33:45.200
 you can, for instance, have a change in governments. If people think that the current

2:33:45.200 --> 2:33:50.560
 government is too corrupt or it's not up to date, you can just elect new people. Or if a journalist

2:33:50.560 --> 2:33:55.840
 finds out something inconvenient about the institution and the institution has no plan B,

2:33:55.840 --> 2:34:01.680
 like in Russia, the journalist has to die. This is what when you run society by the deep state.

2:34:01.680 --> 2:34:08.400
 So ideally, you have an administration layer that you can change if something bad happens,

2:34:08.400 --> 2:34:12.800
 right? So you will have a continuity in the whole thing. And this is the system that we came up in

2:34:12.800 --> 2:34:16.720
 in the West. And the way it's set up in the US is largely result of low level models,

2:34:16.720 --> 2:34:21.440
 so it's mostly just second, third order consequences that people are modeling

2:34:21.440 --> 2:34:25.520
 in the design of these institutions. It's a relatively young society that doesn't really

2:34:25.520 --> 2:34:29.120
 take care of the downstream effects of many of the decisions that are being made.

2:34:29.760 --> 2:34:34.320
 And I suspect that AI can help us this in a way if you can fix the incentives.

2:34:35.040 --> 2:34:40.560
 The society of the US is a society of cheaters. It's basically cheating is so indistinguishable

2:34:40.560 --> 2:34:43.040
 from innovation. And we want to encourage innovation.

2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:45.040
 Can you elaborate on what you mean by cheating?

2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:47.600
 It's basically people do things that they know are wrong.

2:34:47.600 --> 2:34:51.440
 It's acceptable to do things that you know are wrong in this society to a certain degree.

2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:56.400
 You can, for instance, suggest some non sustainable business models and implement them.

2:34:57.440 --> 2:34:59.600
 Right. But you're always pushing the boundaries. I mean, you're...

2:35:00.720 --> 2:35:02.720
 And yes, this is seen as a good thing largely.

2:35:03.920 --> 2:35:04.240
 Yes.

2:35:04.880 --> 2:35:09.200
 And this is different from other societies. So for instance, social mobility is an aspect of

2:35:09.200 --> 2:35:13.280
 this. Social mobility is the result of individual innovation that would not be

2:35:13.280 --> 2:35:15.680
 sustainable at scale for everybody else. Right.

2:35:15.680 --> 2:35:17.920
 Normally, you should not go up. You should go deep, right?

2:35:17.920 --> 2:35:20.400
 We need bakers and indeed we are very good bakers.

2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:24.320
 But in a society that innovates, maybe you can replace all the bakers with a really good machine.

2:35:25.200 --> 2:35:25.600
 Right.

2:35:25.600 --> 2:35:29.520
 And that's not a bad thing. And it's a thing that made the US so successful, right?

2:35:29.520 --> 2:35:33.600
 But it also means that the US is not optimizing for sustainability, but for innovation.

2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:39.600
 And so it's not obvious as the evolutionary processes on rolling is not obvious that that

2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:46.400
 long term would be better. It has side effects. So basically, if you treat, you will have a certain

2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:50.400
 layer of toxic sludge that covers everything that is a result of cheating.

2:35:50.400 --> 2:35:55.600
 And we have to unroll this evolutionary process to figure out if these side effects are so damaging

2:35:55.600 --> 2:36:01.840
 that the system is horrible, or if the benefits actually outweigh the negative effects.

2:36:03.600 --> 2:36:05.760
 How do we get to the which system of government is best?

2:36:05.760 --> 2:36:10.240
 That was from, I'm trying to trace back last five minutes.

2:36:10.240 --> 2:36:16.480
 I suspect that we can find a way back to AI by thinking about the way in which our brain has

2:36:16.480 --> 2:36:23.440
 to organize itself. In some sense, our brain is a society of neurons. And our mind is a

2:36:24.000 --> 2:36:29.680
 society of behaviors. And they need to be organizing themselves into a structure that

2:36:29.680 --> 2:36:35.680
 implements regulation. And government is social regulation. We often see government as the

2:36:35.680 --> 2:36:40.240
 manifestation of power or local interest, but it's actually a platform for negotiating the

2:36:40.240 --> 2:36:46.240
 conditions of human survival. And this platform emerges over the current needs and possibilities

2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:51.280
 in the trajectory that we have. So given the present state, there are only so many options

2:36:51.280 --> 2:36:55.840
 on how we can move into the next state without completely disrupting everything. And we mostly

2:36:55.840 --> 2:37:00.160
 agree that it's a bad idea to disrupt everything because it will endanger our food supply for a

2:37:00.160 --> 2:37:06.960
 while and the entire infrastructure and fabric of society. So we do try to find natural transitions.

2:37:06.960 --> 2:37:10.640
 And there are not that many natural transitions available at any given point.

2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:12.080
 What do you mean by natural transitions?

2:37:12.080 --> 2:37:14.560
 So we try to not have revolutions if we can have it.

2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:21.200
 So speaking of revolutions and the connection between government systems in the mind,

2:37:21.200 --> 2:37:27.600
 you've also said that you said that in some sense becoming an adult means you take charge of your

2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:34.560
 emotions. Maybe you never said that. Maybe I just made that up. But in the context of the mind,

2:37:34.560 --> 2:37:41.200
 what's the role of emotion? And what is it? First of all, what is emotion? What's its role?

2:37:41.200 --> 2:37:46.480
 It's several things. So psychologists often distinguish between emotion and feeling and

2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:52.400
 feeling. And in common day parlance, we don't. I think that emotion is a configuration of the

2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:57.360
 cognitive system. And that's especially true for the lowest level for the affective state.

2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:02.080
 So when you have an affect, it's the configuration of certain modulation parameters like arousal,

2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:08.080
 valence, your attentional focus, whether it's wide or narrow, interception or extra reception,

2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:13.040
 and so on. And all these parameters together put you in a certain way that you relate to the

2:38:13.040 --> 2:38:17.600
 environment and to yourself. And this is in some sense an emotional configuration. In the more

2:38:17.600 --> 2:38:23.520
 narrow sense, an emotion is an affective state that has an object. And the relevance of that

2:38:23.520 --> 2:38:29.040
 object is given by motivation. And motivation is a bunch of needs that are associated with rewards,

2:38:29.040 --> 2:38:33.040
 things that give you pleasure and pain. And you don't actually act on your needs, you act on

2:38:33.040 --> 2:38:37.040
 models of your needs. Because when the pleasure and pain manifests, it's too late, you've done

2:38:37.040 --> 2:38:42.000
 everything. But so you act on expectations that will give you pleasure and pain. And these are

2:38:42.000 --> 2:38:47.040
 your purposes. The needs don't form a hierarchy, they just coexist and compete. And your organism

2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:52.480
 has to, your brain has to find a dynamic homeostasis between them. But the purposes need to be

2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:58.560
 consistent. So you basically can create a story for your life and make plans. And so we organize

2:38:58.560 --> 2:39:02.560
 them all into hierarchies. And there is not a unique solution for this. Some people eat to

2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:07.040
 make art, and other people make art to eat. And they might end up doing the same things,

2:39:07.040 --> 2:39:12.560
 but they cooperate in very different ways. Because their ultimate goals are different than we

2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:16.560
 cooperate based on shared purpose. Everything else that is not cooperation on shared purpose

2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:25.760
 is transactional. I don't think I understood that last piece of achieving the homeostasis.

2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:30.240
 Are you distinguishing between the experience of emotion and the expression of emotion?

2:39:30.240 --> 2:39:37.680
 Of course. So the experience of emotion is a feeling. And in this sense, what you feel is an

2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:42.880
 appraisal that your perceptual system has made of the situation at hand. And it makes this based

2:39:42.880 --> 2:39:50.240
 on your motivation and on your estimates, not your but of the subconscious geometric parts of

2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:54.880
 your mind that assess the situation in the world with something like a neural network.

2:39:54.880 --> 2:39:59.440
 And this neural network is making itself known to the symbolic parts of your mind,

2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:06.400
 to your conscious attention, by mapping them as features into a space. So what you will feel

2:40:06.400 --> 2:40:11.280
 about your emotion is a projection usually into your body map. So you might feel anxiety in your

2:40:11.280 --> 2:40:16.960
 solar plexus, and you might feel it as a contraction, which is all geometry. Your body

2:40:16.960 --> 2:40:22.400
 map is the space that is always instantiated and always available. So it's a very obvious cheat

2:40:22.400 --> 2:40:29.360
 if your non symbolic parts of your brain try to talk to your symbolic parts of your brain to map

2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:34.000
 the feelings into the body map. And then you perceive them as pleasant and unpleasant, depending

2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:38.320
 on whether the appraisal has a negative or positive valence. And then you have different

2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:42.960
 features of them that give you more knowledge about the nature of what you're feeling. So for

2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:47.280
 instance, when you feel connected to other people, you typically feel this in your chest region around

2:40:47.280 --> 2:40:52.800
 your heart. And you feel this is an expansive feeling in which you're reaching out, right?

2:40:52.800 --> 2:40:57.680
 And it's very intuitive to encode it like this. That's why it's encoded like this for most people.

2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:00.800
 But it's encoded. It's encoded. It's a code. It's a code in which the non symbolic parts of

2:41:00.800 --> 2:41:05.840
 your mind talk to the symbolic ones. And then the expression of emotion is then the final step

2:41:05.840 --> 2:41:10.320
 that could be sort of gestural or visual and so on. That's part of the communication.

2:41:10.320 --> 2:41:15.360
 This probably evolved as part of an adversarial communication. So as soon as you started to

2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:20.400
 observe the facial expression and posture of others to understand what emotional state they are in,

2:41:20.400 --> 2:41:25.200
 others started to use this as signaling and also to subvert your model of their emotional state.

2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:29.360
 So we now look at the inflections, at the difference between the standard phase that

2:41:29.360 --> 2:41:33.360
 they're going to make in this situation. When you are at a funeral, everybody expects you to

2:41:33.360 --> 2:41:38.000
 make a solemn phase. But the solemn phase doesn't express whether you're sad or not. It just expresses

2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:42.320
 that you understand what phase you have to make at a funeral. Nobody should know that you are

2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:48.080
 triumphant. So when you try to read the emotion of another person, you try to look at the delta

2:41:48.080 --> 2:41:56.400
 between a truly sad expression and the things that are animated, mating this phase behind the curtain.

2:41:56.400 --> 2:42:03.440
 So the interesting thing is, so having done this podcast and the video component,

2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:09.200
 one of the things I've learned is that now I'm Russian and I just don't know how to express

2:42:09.200 --> 2:42:16.320
 emotion on my face when I see that as weakness. But whatever the people look to me after you

2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:22.960
 say something, they look to my face to help them see how they should feel about what you said,

2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:27.760
 which is fascinating because then they'll often comment on why did you look bored or why did

2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:31.840
 you particularly enjoy that part or why did you whatever. It's a kind of interesting,

2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:37.680
 it makes me cognizant of I'm part, like you're basically saying a bunch of brilliant things,

2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:45.920
 but I'm part of the play that you're the key actor and by making my facial expressions and

2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:51.200
 therefore telling the narrative of what the big point is, which is fascinating.

2:42:51.200 --> 2:42:55.440
 It makes me cognizant that I'm supposed to be making facial expressions. Even this conversation

2:42:55.440 --> 2:43:01.920
 is hard because my preference would be to wear a mask with sunglasses to where I could just listen.

2:43:01.920 --> 2:43:08.000
 Yes, I understand this because it's intrusive to interact with others this way and basically Eastern

2:43:08.000 --> 2:43:12.880
 European society have a taboo against that and especially Russia, the further you go to the

2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:19.280
 east and in the US it's the opposite. You're expected to be hyperanimated in your face and

2:43:19.280 --> 2:43:25.920
 you're also expected to show positive effect. And if you show positive effect without a good

2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:34.720
 reason in Russia, people will think you are a stupid, unsophisticated person. Exactly. And

2:43:34.720 --> 2:43:40.160
 here positive effect without reason goes either appreciate or go unnoticed.

2:43:40.800 --> 2:43:45.920
 No, it's the default. It's being expected. Everything is amazing. Have you seen this

2:43:46.640 --> 2:43:52.080
 Lego movie? No, there was a diagram where somebody gave the appraisals that exist in

2:43:52.080 --> 2:44:00.880
 the US and Russia. So you have your bell curve and the lower 10% in the US, it's a good start.

2:44:01.680 --> 2:44:09.600
 Everything above the lowest 10% is amazing. It's amazing. And for Russians, everything below the

2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:18.000
 top 10% is terrible. And then everything except the top percent is, I don't like it. And the top

2:44:18.000 --> 2:44:27.040
 percent is even so. Yeah, it's funny, but it's kind of true. Yeah.

2:44:27.040 --> 2:44:31.440
 But there's a deeper aspect to this. It's also how we construct meaning in the US.

2:44:32.400 --> 2:44:37.440
 Usually you focus on the positive aspects and you just suppress the negative aspects.

2:44:38.080 --> 2:44:45.040
 And in our Eastern European traditions, we emphasize the fact that if you hold something

2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:49.040
 above the waterline, you also need to put something below the waterline because existence

2:44:49.040 --> 2:44:54.960
 by itself is as best neutral. Right. That's the basic intuition. If at best neutral,

2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:59.520
 or it could be just suffering, the default. There are moments of beauty, but these moments of beauty

2:44:59.520 --> 2:45:05.280
 are inextricably linked to the reality of suffering. And to not acknowledge the reality

2:45:05.280 --> 2:45:09.600
 of suffering means that you are really stupid and unaware of the fact that basically every conscious

2:45:09.600 --> 2:45:17.840
 being spends most of the time suffering. Yeah, you just summarized the ethos of the Eastern Europe.

2:45:17.840 --> 2:45:23.360
 Yeah, most of life is suffering with occasional moments of beauty. And if your facial expressions

2:45:23.360 --> 2:45:29.200
 don't acknowledge the abundance of suffering in the world and in existence itself, then you must

2:45:29.200 --> 2:45:36.000
 be an idiot. It's an interesting thing when you raise children in the US and you in some sense

2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:40.960
 preserve the identity of the intellectual and cultural traditions that are embedded in your

2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:47.520
 own families. And your daughter asks you about Ariel, the mermaid. And you ask you, why is Ariel

2:45:47.520 --> 2:45:54.320
 not allowed to play with the humans? And you tell her the truth. She's a siren. Sirens eat people.

2:45:54.320 --> 2:45:58.640
 You don't play with your food. It does not end well. And then you tell her the original story,

2:45:58.640 --> 2:46:02.560
 which is not the one by Anderson, which is the romantic one. And there's a much darker one,

2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:11.920
 the Undine story. So Undine is a mermaid or a waterwoman. She lives on the ground of a river

2:46:11.920 --> 2:46:16.640
 and she meets this prince and they fall enough. And the prince really, really wants to be with her.

2:46:16.640 --> 2:46:21.840
 And she says, okay, but the deal is you cannot have any other woman. If you marry somebody else,

2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:24.880
 even though you cannot be with me, because obviously you cannot breathe underwater and

2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:31.760
 have other things to do than managing your kingdom with you up here, you will die. And eventually,

2:46:31.760 --> 2:46:36.640
 after a few years, he falls in love with some princess and marries her. And she shows up

2:46:36.640 --> 2:46:41.920
 and quietly goes into his chamber and nobody is able to stop her or willing to do so because

2:46:41.920 --> 2:46:46.480
 she is fierce. And she comes quietly and sat out of his chamber and they ask her,

2:46:47.440 --> 2:46:50.240
 what has happened? What did you do? And she said, I kissed him to death.

2:46:51.920 --> 2:46:58.640
 All done. And you know the Anderson story, right? And the Anderson story, the mermaid is playing

2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:03.680
 with this prince that she saves and she falls in love with him and she cannot live out there. So

2:47:03.680 --> 2:47:10.400
 she is giving up her voice and her tale for a human like appearance. So she can walk among

2:47:10.400 --> 2:47:15.760
 the humans. But this guy does not recognize that she is the one that you marry. Instead,

2:47:15.760 --> 2:47:20.720
 he marries somebody who has a kingdom and economical and political relationships to his

2:47:20.720 --> 2:47:33.200
 own kingdom and so on as he should. She dies. Yeah. Instead, Disney, the little mermaid story

2:47:33.200 --> 2:47:37.040
 has a little bit of a happy ending. That's the western, that's the American way.

2:47:37.040 --> 2:47:42.000
 My own problem is this, of course, that I read Oscar Wilde before I read the other things. So I'm

2:47:42.000 --> 2:47:46.960
 indoctrinated, inoculated with this romanticism. And I think that the mermaid is right. You

2:47:46.960 --> 2:47:51.840
 sacrifice your life for romantic love. That's what you do because if you are confronted with either

2:47:51.840 --> 2:47:57.520
 serving the machine and doing the obviously right thing under the economic and social and

2:47:57.520 --> 2:48:01.520
 other human incentives, that's wrong. You should follow your heart.

2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:09.520
 So do you think suffering is fundamental to happiness along these lines?

2:48:09.520 --> 2:48:14.640
 No. Suffering is the result of caring about things that you cannot change. And if you are able to

2:48:14.640 --> 2:48:17.920
 change what you care about to those things that you can change, you will not suffer.

2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:24.640
 Would you then be able to experience happiness? Yes. But happiness itself is not important.

2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:29.520
 Happiness is like a cookie. When you are a child, you think cookies are very important and you want

2:48:29.520 --> 2:48:33.040
 to have all the cookies in the world. You look forward to being an adult because then you have

2:48:33.040 --> 2:48:37.760
 as many cookies as you want, right? Yes. But as an adult, you realize a cookie is a tool.

2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:41.920
 It's a tool to make you eat vegetables. And once you eat your vegetables anyway, you stop

2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:46.000
 eating cookies for the most part because otherwise you will get diabetes and will not be around for

2:48:46.000 --> 2:48:52.320
 your kids. Yes. But then the cookie, the scarcity of a cookie. If scarcity is enforced nevertheless,

2:48:52.320 --> 2:48:57.120
 so like the pleasure comes from the scarcity. Yes. But the happiness is a cookie that your

2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:01.600
 brain bakes for itself. It's not made by the environment. The environment cannot make you

2:49:01.600 --> 2:49:05.840
 happy. It's your appraisal of the environment that makes you happy. And if you can change

2:49:05.840 --> 2:49:09.680
 your appraisal of the environment which you can learn to, then you can create arbitrary states

2:49:09.680 --> 2:49:14.000
 of happiness. And some meditators fall into the trap. So they discover the room, the

2:49:14.000 --> 2:49:18.320
 basement room in their brain where the cookies are made and they indulge in stuff themselves.

2:49:18.320 --> 2:49:22.800
 And after a few months, it gets really old and the big crisis of meaning comes. Because they

2:49:22.800 --> 2:49:28.000
 thought before that their unhappiness was the result of not being happy enough. So they fixed

2:49:28.000 --> 2:49:33.600
 this, right? They can release the newer transmitters at will if they train. And then the crisis of

2:49:33.600 --> 2:49:38.320
 meaning pops up at a deeper layer. And the question is, why do I live? How can I make a

2:49:38.320 --> 2:49:42.880
 sustainable civilization that is meaningful to me? How can I insert myself into this? And this

2:49:42.880 --> 2:49:49.760
 was the problem that you couldn't solve in the first place. But at the end of all this, let me

2:49:49.760 --> 2:49:55.760
 then ask that same question. What is the answer to that? What could the possible answer be of the

2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:02.080
 meaning of life? What could an answer be? What is it to you? I think that if you look at the

2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:09.360
 limiting of life, you look at what the cell is. The life is the cell. Yes, or this principle,

2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:14.960
 the cell. It's this self organizing thing that can participate in evolution. In order to make it

2:50:14.960 --> 2:50:19.280
 work, it's a molecular machine. It needs a self replicator and like entropy extractor and a

2:50:19.280 --> 2:50:24.000
 Turing machine. If any of these parts is missing, you don't have a cell and it is not living, right?

2:50:24.000 --> 2:50:29.200
 And life is basically the emergent complexity over that principle. Once you have this intelligent

2:50:29.200 --> 2:50:34.000
 super molecule, the cell, there is very little that you cannot make it do. It's probably the optimal

2:50:34.000 --> 2:50:39.600
 computronium and especially in terms of resilience. It's very hard to sterilize a planet once it's

2:50:39.600 --> 2:50:47.600
 infected with life. So it's active function of these three components or the super cell of cell

2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:53.280
 is present in the cell, is present in us, and it's just... We are just an expression of the cell.

2:50:53.280 --> 2:50:58.640
 It's a certain layer of complexity in the organization of cells. So in a way, it's tempting

2:50:58.640 --> 2:51:04.080
 to think of the cell as a von Neumann probe. If you want to build intelligence on other planets,

2:51:04.080 --> 2:51:09.520
 the best way to do this is to infect them with cells and wait for long enough. And with a reasonable

2:51:09.520 --> 2:51:13.840
 chance, the stuff is going to evolve into an information processing principle that is general

2:51:13.840 --> 2:51:20.320
 enough to become sentient. Well, that idea is very akin to sort of the same dream and beautiful

2:51:20.320 --> 2:51:24.800
 ideas that are expressed to cellular automata in their most simple mathematical form. If you just

2:51:24.800 --> 2:51:31.440
 inject the system with some basic mechanisms of replication and so on, basic rules, amazing

2:51:31.440 --> 2:51:37.280
 things would emerge. And the cell is able to do something that James Trady calls existential

2:51:37.280 --> 2:51:42.560
 design. He points out that in technical design, we go from the outside in. We work in a highly

2:51:42.560 --> 2:51:46.640
 controlled environment in which everything is deterministic, like our computers, our labs,

2:51:46.640 --> 2:51:52.080
 or our engineering workshops. And then we use this determinism to implement a particular kind

2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:56.960
 of function that we dream up and that seamlessly interfaces with all the other deterministic

2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:02.640
 functions that we already have in our world. So it's basically from the outside in. And biological

2:52:02.640 --> 2:52:08.640
 systems designed from the inside out as seed will become a seedling by taking some of the

2:52:08.640 --> 2:52:14.320
 relatively unorganized matter around it and turn it into its own structure and thereby

2:52:14.320 --> 2:52:19.200
 subdue the environment. And cells can cooperate if they can rely on other cells having a similar

2:52:19.200 --> 2:52:25.360
 organization that is already compatible. But unless that's there, the cell needs to divide

2:52:25.360 --> 2:52:30.400
 to create that structure by itself. So it's a self organizing principle that works on a

2:52:30.400 --> 2:52:36.640
 somewhat chaotic environment. And the purpose of life in the sense is to produce complexity.

2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:40.480
 And the complexity allows you to harvest like entropy gradients that you couldn't harvest

2:52:40.480 --> 2:52:45.520
 without the complexity. And in the sense, intelligence and life are very strongly connected

2:52:45.520 --> 2:52:50.480
 because the purpose of intelligence is to allow control and the conditions of complexity. So

2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:56.720
 basically you shift the boundary between the ordered systems into the realm of chaos. You

2:52:56.720 --> 2:53:02.080
 build bridgeheads into chaos with complexity. And this is what we are doing. This is not

2:53:02.080 --> 2:53:05.760
 necessarily a deeper meaning. I think the meaning that we have priors for that we are

2:53:05.760 --> 2:53:09.920
 involved for outside of the priors, there is no meaning meaning only exists if a mind projects

2:53:09.920 --> 2:53:17.280
 it. That is probably civilization. I think that what feels most meaningful to me is to try to

2:53:17.280 --> 2:53:23.600
 build and maintain a sustainable civilization. And taking a slight step outside of that, we talked

2:53:23.600 --> 2:53:35.840
 about a man with a beard and God, but something, some mechanism perhaps must have planted the seed,

2:53:35.840 --> 2:53:43.520
 the initial seed of the cell. Do you think there is a God? What is a God? And what would that look

2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:49.760
 like? So if there was no spontaneous our biogenesis, that in the sense that the first cell formed by some

2:53:50.560 --> 2:53:55.040
 happy random accidents where the molecules just happened to be in the right constellation to

2:53:55.040 --> 2:54:01.040
 each other, but there could also be the mechanism of that allows for the random. I mean, there's

2:54:01.040 --> 2:54:05.680
 like turtles all the way down. There seems to be there has to be a head turtle at the bottom.

2:54:05.680 --> 2:54:11.520
 Let's consider something really wild. Imagine, is it possible that a gas giant could become intelligent?

2:54:12.240 --> 2:54:17.360
 What would that involve? So imagine you have vortices that spontaneously emerge on the gas

2:54:17.360 --> 2:54:22.560
 giants like big storm systems that endure for thousands of years. And some of these storm

2:54:22.560 --> 2:54:27.040
 systems produce electromagnetic fields because some of the clouds are ferromagnetic or something.

2:54:27.040 --> 2:54:32.400
 And as a result, they can change how certain clouds react rather than other clouds and thereby

2:54:32.400 --> 2:54:36.640
 produce some self stabilizing patterns that eventually to regulation feedback loops,

2:54:36.640 --> 2:54:42.240
 nested feedback loops and control. So imagine you have such a thing that basically has emergent,

2:54:42.240 --> 2:54:46.640
 self sustaining, self organizing complexity. And at some point this fakes up and realizes

2:54:46.640 --> 2:54:51.360
 and basically lambs Solaris. I am a sinking planet, but I will not replicate because I

2:54:51.360 --> 2:54:57.040
 can recreate the conditions of my own existence somewhere else. I'm just basically an intelligence

2:54:57.040 --> 2:55:02.960
 that has spontaneously formed because it could. And now it builds a von Neumann probe. And the

2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:06.960
 best von Neumann probe is such a thing might be the cell. So maybe it, because it's very,

2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:11.920
 very clever and very enduring, creates cells and sends them out. And one of them has infected our

2:55:11.920 --> 2:55:15.760
 planet. And I'm not suggesting that this is the case, but it would be compatible with the

2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:21.360
 Prince Birmingham hypothesis. And with my intuition that our biogenesis is very unlikely.

2:55:21.360 --> 2:55:26.240
 It's possible, but you probably need to roll the cosmic dice very often, maybe more often

2:55:26.240 --> 2:55:35.920
 than there are planetary surfaces. I don't know. So God is just a system that's large enough

2:55:35.920 --> 2:55:39.840
 that allows randomness. Now, I don't think that God has anything to do with creation.

2:55:39.840 --> 2:55:46.080
 I think it's a mistranslation of the Talmud into the Catholic mythology. I think that Genesis is

2:55:46.080 --> 2:55:52.960
 actually the childhood memories of a God. So the Genesis is the childhood memories of a God.

2:55:52.960 --> 2:56:00.240
 It's basically a mind that is remembering how it came into being. And we typically interpret

2:56:00.240 --> 2:56:06.160
 Genesis as the creation of a physical universe by a supernatural being. And I think when you'll

2:56:06.800 --> 2:56:13.280
 read it, there is light and darkness that is being created. And then you discover sky and

2:56:13.280 --> 2:56:20.080
 ground, create them. You construct the plants and the animals, and you give everything their

2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:25.200
 names and so on. That's basically cognitive development. It's a sequence of steps that every

2:56:25.200 --> 2:56:29.600
 mind has to go through when it makes sense of the world. And when you have children, you can see

2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:34.560
 how initially they distinguish light and darkness. And then they make out directions in it, and they

2:56:34.560 --> 2:56:38.240
 discover sky and ground, and they discover the plants and the animals, and they give everything

2:56:38.240 --> 2:56:42.640
 their name. And it's a creative process that happens in every mind. Because it's not given,

2:56:42.640 --> 2:56:46.880
 right? Your mind has to invent these structures to make sense of the patterns on your retina.

2:56:46.880 --> 2:56:53.600
 Also, if there was some big nerd who set up a server and runs this world on it, this would not

2:56:53.600 --> 2:56:58.080
 create a special relationship between us and the nerd. This nerd would not have the magical power

2:56:58.080 --> 2:57:04.560
 to give meaning to our existence, right? So this equation of a creator God with the God of meaning

2:57:05.200 --> 2:57:10.320
 is a slate of hand. You shouldn't do it. The other one that is done in Catholicism is the

2:57:10.320 --> 2:57:15.360
 equation of the first mover, the prime mover of Aristotle, which is basically the automaton

2:57:15.360 --> 2:57:21.200
 that runs the universe. Aristotle says, if things are moving and things seem to be moving here,

2:57:21.200 --> 2:57:25.440
 something must move them, right? If something moves them, something must move the thing that

2:57:25.440 --> 2:57:30.320
 is moving it. So there must be a prime mover. This idea to say that this prime mover is a

2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:36.800
 supernatural being is complete nonsense, right? It's an automaton in the simplest case. So we

2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:42.640
 have to explain the enormity that this automaton exists at all. But again, we don't have any

2:57:42.640 --> 2:57:48.480
 possibility to infer anything about its properties except that it's able to produce change in

2:57:48.480 --> 2:57:53.680
 information, right? So there needs to be some kind of computational principle. This is all there is.

2:57:53.680 --> 2:57:58.160
 But to say this automaton is identical again with the creator of first cause or with the

2:57:58.160 --> 2:58:05.520
 thing that gives meaning to our life is confusion. Now, I think that what we perceive is the higher

2:58:05.520 --> 2:58:10.800
 being that we are part of. And the higher being that we are part of is the civilization. It's the

2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:16.800
 thing in which we have a similar relationship as the cell has to our body. And we have this prior

2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:22.800
 because we have evolved to organize in these structures. So basically, the Christian God

2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:27.520
 in its natural form without the mythology, if you do undress it, is basically the platonic form of

2:58:27.520 --> 2:58:35.280
 the civilization. Is the ideal? Yes, it's this ideal that you try to approximate when you interact

2:58:35.280 --> 2:58:42.640
 with others, not based on your incentives, but on what you think is right. Wow, we covered a lot

2:58:42.640 --> 2:58:48.640
 of ground. And we left with one of my favorite lines. And there's many, which is happiness

2:58:49.520 --> 2:58:58.240
 is a cookie that the brain bakes itself. It's been a huge honor and a pleasure to talk to you.

2:58:58.240 --> 2:59:03.920
 I'm sure our paths will cross many times again. Josh, thank you so much for talking today.

2:59:03.920 --> 2:59:08.160

2:59:41.280 --> 2:59:47.120
 spell it without the E. And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom from Yosha Bach.

2:59:48.320 --> 2:59:53.680
 If you take this as a computer game metaphor, this is the best level for humanity to play.

2:59:53.680 --> 3:00:01.600
 And this best level happens to be the last level as it happens against the backdrop of a dying world.

3:00:01.600 --> 3:00:25.680
 But it's still the best level. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
