 The following is a conversation with Catherine DeClear, a professor of Planetary Science and

00:04.640 --> 00:10.400
 Astronomy at Caltech. Her research is on the surface environments, atmospheres,

00:10.400 --> 00:15.200
 and thermochemical histories of the planets and moons in our solar system.

00:15.760 --> 00:22.560
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Fund Rise, Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and Magic Spoon.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.040
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:25.040 --> 00:30.640
 As a side note, let me say that this conversation and a few others, quite big ones actually,

00:30.640 --> 00:35.840
 that are coming up or filmed in a studio where I was trying to outsource some of the work.

00:35.840 --> 00:40.800
 Like all experiments, it was a learning experience for me. It had some positives and negatives.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.960
 Ultimately, I decided to return back to doing it the way I was doing before, but hopefully

00:44.960 --> 00:51.040
 with a team who can help me out and work with me long term. The point is, I will always keep

00:51.040 --> 00:56.400
 challenging myself, trying stuff out, learning, growing, and hopefully improving over time.

00:56.400 --> 01:01.360
 My goal is to surround myself with people who love what they do, are amazing at it,

01:01.360 --> 01:06.560
 and are obsessed with doing the best work of their lives. To me, there's nothing more energizing

01:06.560 --> 01:12.400
 and fun than that. In fact, I'm currently hiring a few folks to work with me on very small projects.

01:12.400 --> 01:17.200
 If this is something of interest to you, go to lexfreedman.com slash hiring.

01:17.200 --> 01:22.720
 That's where I will always post opportunities for working with me. This is the Lex Freedman

01:22.720 --> 01:29.840
 podcast, and here is my conversation with Catherine DeCleer. Why is Pluto not a planet anymore?

01:29.840 --> 01:34.000
 Does this upset you or has justice finally been served?

01:36.240 --> 01:41.360
 So I get asked this all the time. I think all planetary scientists get asked about Pluto,

01:41.360 --> 01:47.600
 especially by kids who we just love for Pluto to still be a planet. But the reality is,

01:48.800 --> 01:55.120
 when we first discovered Pluto, it was a unique object in the outer solar system, and we thought,

01:55.120 --> 02:00.320
 you know, we were adding a planet to the inventory of planets that we had. And then over time,

02:00.320 --> 02:06.080
 it became clear that Pluto was not a unique, large object in the outer solar system, that there were

02:06.080 --> 02:11.440
 actually many of these. And as we started discovering more and more of them, we realized that the

02:11.440 --> 02:18.400
 concept of Pluto being a planet didn't make sense unless maybe we added all the rest of them as

02:18.400 --> 02:21.600
 planets. So, you know, you could have imagined actually a different direction that this could

02:21.600 --> 02:26.560
 have gone where all the other objects that were discovered in that belt, or at least all the ones,

02:26.560 --> 02:34.000
 let's say above a certain size, became planets instead of Pluto being declassified. But we

02:34.000 --> 02:38.320
 were now aware of many objects out there in the outer solar system and what's called the Kuiper

02:38.320 --> 02:46.080
 Belt that are of the same size, or in some cases even larger than Pluto. So, the declassification

02:46.080 --> 02:51.680
 was really just a realization that it was not in the same category as the other planets in

02:51.680 --> 02:56.640
 the solar system. And we basically needed to refine our definition in such a way that took

02:56.640 --> 03:02.640
 into account that there's this belt of debris out there in the outer solar system of things

03:02.640 --> 03:09.120
 with a range of sizes. Is there a hope for clear categorization of what is a planet and not?

03:10.000 --> 03:14.560
 Or is it all just gray area? When you study planets, when you study moon satellites of those

03:14.560 --> 03:21.760
 planets, is there a line that could be cleanly drawn or is it just a giant mess? This is all

03:21.760 --> 03:27.920
 like a fluid, let's say not mess, but it's like fluid of what is a planet, what is a moon of a

03:27.920 --> 03:34.480
 planet, what is debris, what is asteroids, all that kind of. So, there are technically clear

03:34.480 --> 03:42.720
 definitions that were set down by the IAU, the International Astronomy Union. Is it size related?

03:42.720 --> 03:47.280
 Like what are the parameters based on what? So, the parameters are that it has to orbit the sun,

03:47.280 --> 03:51.920
 which was essentially to rule out satellites. Of course, this was a not very forward thinking

03:51.920 --> 03:56.000
 definition because it technically means that all extra solar planets according to that definition

03:56.000 --> 04:02.560
 are not planets. So, it has to orbit the sun. It has to be large enough that its gravity has

04:02.560 --> 04:07.680
 caused it to become spherical in shape, which also applies to satellites and also applies to

04:07.680 --> 04:11.440
 Pluto. The third part of the definition is the thing that really rules out everything else,

04:11.440 --> 04:17.440
 which is that it has to have cleared out its orbital path. And because Pluto orbits in a

04:17.440 --> 04:22.640
 belt of material, it doesn't satisfy that stipulation. Why didn't you clear out the path?

04:22.640 --> 04:28.080
 It's not big enough to knock everybody out of the way. And this actually is not the first time

04:28.080 --> 04:32.560
 it has happened. So, Ceres, when it was discovered, Ceres is the largest asteroid in the asteroid

04:32.560 --> 04:37.520
 belt and it was originally considered a planet when it was first discovered and it went through

04:37.520 --> 04:44.000
 exactly the same story, history, where people actually realized that it was just one of many

04:44.000 --> 04:48.240
 asteroids in the asteroid belt region and then it got declassified to an asteroid and now it's

04:48.240 --> 04:53.440
 back to a dwarf planet. So, there is a lot of reclassification. So, to me, as somebody who

04:53.440 --> 05:01.440
 studies solar system objects, I just personally don't care my level of interest in something has

05:01.440 --> 05:06.960
 nothing to do with what it's classified as. So, my favorite objects in the solar system are all moons

05:06.960 --> 05:12.160
 and frequently when I talk about them, I refer to them as planets because to me they are planets.

05:12.160 --> 05:17.680
 They have volcanoes. They have geology. They have atmospheres. They're planet like worlds. And so,

05:17.680 --> 05:23.360
 the distinction is not super meaningful to me, but it is important just for having a general

05:23.360 --> 05:28.560
 framework for understanding and talking about things to have a precise definition.

05:28.560 --> 05:34.560
 So, you don't have a special romantic appreciation of a moon versus a planet versus an asteroid. It's

05:34.560 --> 05:39.200
 just an object that flies out there and it doesn't really matter what the categorization is. Because

05:39.200 --> 05:45.360
 there's movies about asteroids and stuff and then there's movies about the moon, whatever,

05:45.360 --> 05:55.040
 it's a really good movie. There's something about moons that's almost like an outlier.

05:55.040 --> 06:03.920
 Like, you think of a moon as a thing that's the secret part and the planet is the more vanilla

06:03.920 --> 06:08.960
 regular part. None of that. You don't have any of that? No, I actually do. I really, satellites are

06:08.960 --> 06:13.200
 the moons are my favorite things in the solar system. And I think part of what you're saying,

06:13.200 --> 06:18.240
 I agree from maybe a slightly different perspective, which is from the perspective of

06:18.240 --> 06:24.160
 exploration. We've spent a lot of time sending spacecraft missions to planets. We had a mission

06:24.160 --> 06:28.400
 to Jupiter. We had a mission to Saturn. We have plenty of missions to Mars and missions to Venus.

06:28.400 --> 06:33.120
 I think that exploration of the moons in the outer solar system is the next frontier of

06:33.120 --> 06:39.760
 solar system exploration. The belt of debris just real quick. That's out there. Is there something

06:39.760 --> 06:45.200
 incredible to be discovered there? Again, we tend to focus on the planets and the moons,

06:45.200 --> 06:49.840
 but it feels like there's probably a lot of stuff out there. And it probably,

06:50.880 --> 06:56.640
 what is it? It's like a garbage collector from outside of the solar system, isn't it?

06:56.640 --> 07:02.560
 Like, doesn't it protect from other objects that kind of fly in and what it just feels like it's

07:02.560 --> 07:08.560
 a cool, you know, you know, when you like walk along the beach and look for stuff and like look

07:08.560 --> 07:13.120
 for sure. It feels like that's that kind of place where you can find cool, cool, weird things.

07:14.880 --> 07:20.320
 I guess in our conversation today, when we think about tools and what science is studying,

07:20.320 --> 07:24.080
 is there something to be studied out there? Or we just don't have maybe the tools yet,

07:24.080 --> 07:28.640
 or there's nothing to be found? There's absolutely a lot to be found. So the material

07:28.640 --> 07:32.800
 that's out there is remnant material from the formation of our solar system. We don't think

07:32.800 --> 07:41.280
 it comes from outside the solar system, at least not most of it. But there are so many

07:41.280 --> 07:45.680
 fascinating objects out there. And I think what you fit on is exactly right that we just don't

07:45.680 --> 07:50.880
 have the tools to study them in detail. But we can look out there and we can see there are

07:50.880 --> 07:56.720
 different species of ice on their surface that tells us about, you know, the chemical composition

07:56.720 --> 08:00.800
 of the disk that formed our solar system. Some of these objects are way brighter than

08:00.800 --> 08:05.200
 they should be, meaning they have some kind of geological activity. People have hypothesized

08:05.200 --> 08:09.840
 that some of these objects have subsurface oceans. You could even stretch your imagination and say

08:09.840 --> 08:15.760
 some of those oceans could be habitable. But we can't get very detailed information about them

08:15.760 --> 08:20.400
 because they're so far away. And so I think if any of those objects were in the inner solar system,

08:20.400 --> 08:25.360
 it would be studied intently and would be very interesting. So would you be able to design a

08:25.360 --> 08:31.760
 probe in that like very dense debris field, be able to like hop from one place to another?

08:32.560 --> 08:38.160
 Is that just outside of the realm of like, how would you even design devices or sensors that

08:38.160 --> 08:43.840
 go out there and take pictures and land? Do you have to land to truly understand

08:44.720 --> 08:50.640
 a little piece of rock? Or can you understand it from remotely, like fly up close and remotely

08:50.640 --> 08:56.640
 observe? You can learn quite a lot from just a flyby. And that's all we're currently capable

08:56.640 --> 09:02.240
 of doing in the outer solar system. The New Horizons mission is a recent example, which flew

09:02.240 --> 09:07.840
 by Pluto. And then they had searched for another object that was out there in the Kuiper Belt,

09:07.840 --> 09:13.200
 any object that was basically somewhere that they could deflect their trajectory to actually

09:13.200 --> 09:18.480
 fly by. And so they did fly by another object out there in the Kuiper Belt, and they take pictures

09:18.480 --> 09:22.560
 and they do what they can do. And if you've seen the images from that mission of Pluto,

09:22.560 --> 09:27.680
 you can see just how much detail we have compared to just the sort of reddish dot

09:27.680 --> 09:33.440
 that we knew of before. So you do get an amazing amount of information actually from just essentially

09:33.440 --> 09:39.520
 a high speed flyby. It always makes me sad to think about flybys that we might be able to,

09:39.520 --> 09:45.520
 we might fly by a piece of rock, take a picture and think, oh, that looks pretty and cool and

09:45.520 --> 09:49.600
 whatever and that you could study certain like composition of the surface and so on.

09:49.600 --> 09:56.800
 But it's actually teeming with life, and we won't be able to see it at first. And it's sad,

09:56.800 --> 10:00.080
 because you know, like when you're on a deserted island, you wave your hands and the

10:00.080 --> 10:05.120
 thing flies by and you're trying to get their attention. And they probably do the same, well,

10:05.120 --> 10:10.480
 in their own way, bacteria probably, right? But, and we miss it. I don't know,

10:10.480 --> 10:17.600
 some reason it makes me, it's the FOMO, it's fear of missing out. It makes me sad that there might

10:17.600 --> 10:26.800
 be life out there. And we don't, we're not in touch with it. We're not talking. Yeah. Well, okay.

10:29.120 --> 10:34.640
 A sad pause, a Russian philosophical pause. Okay. What are the tools available to us to

10:34.640 --> 10:43.360
 study planets and their moons? Oh my goodness, that is such a big question. So among the field

10:43.360 --> 10:48.880
 of astronomy, so planetary science broadly speaking, well, it falls kind of at the border of

10:48.880 --> 10:54.640
 astronomy, geology, climate science, chemistry, and even biology. So it's kind of on the border

10:54.640 --> 10:59.200
 of many things, but part of it falls under the heading of astronomy. And among the things that

10:59.200 --> 11:05.520
 you can study with telescopes like solar system moons and planets, the solar system is really

11:05.520 --> 11:11.360
 unique in that we can actually send spacecraft missions to the objects and study them in detail.

11:11.360 --> 11:15.920
 And so I think that's, that's the kind of type of tool that is that people are most aware of,

11:15.920 --> 11:22.240
 this most popularized, these amazing NASA missions that either you fly by the object,

11:22.240 --> 11:28.000
 you orbit the object, you land on the object, potentially you can talk about digging into it,

11:28.000 --> 11:37.440
 drilling, trying to detect tectonic tremors on its surface. The types of tools that I use are

11:37.440 --> 11:43.360
 primarily telescopes. And so I, my background is in astrophysics. And so I actually got into

11:43.360 --> 11:48.800
 solar system science from astronomy, not from, you know, a childhood fascination with spacecraft

11:48.800 --> 11:53.520
 missions, which is actually what a lot of planetary scientists became planetary scientists

11:53.520 --> 11:58.720
 because of childhood fascination with spacecraft missions, which is kind of interesting for me to

11:58.720 --> 12:03.040
 talk to people and see that trajectory. I kind of came at it from the fascination with telescopes

12:03.040 --> 12:08.320
 angle. So you like telescopes, not rockets, or at least the Earth? When I was a kid, it was looking

12:08.320 --> 12:12.720
 at the stars and playing with telescopes that really fascinated me. And that's how I got into this.

12:13.920 --> 12:21.200
 But telescopes, it's amazing how much detail and how much information you can get from

12:21.200 --> 12:28.640
 telescopes today, you can resolve individual cloud features and watch them kind of shear

12:28.640 --> 12:35.520
 out in the atmosphere of Titan, you can literally watch volcanoes on IO change from day to day as

12:35.520 --> 12:42.720
 the lava flows expand. So, and then, you know, with spectroscopy, you get compositional information

12:42.720 --> 12:50.320
 on all these things. And it's, when I started doing solar system astronomy, I was surprised by

12:50.320 --> 12:55.680
 how much detail and how much information you can get even from Earth, and then as well as from orbit

12:55.680 --> 13:03.280
 like the Hubble Space Telescope or the James Webb. So with the telescope, you can, I mean,

13:03.280 --> 13:08.880
 how much information can you get about volcanoes, about storms, about sort of weather,

13:09.920 --> 13:14.400
 just so we kind of get a sense like what a resolution we're talking about.

13:14.400 --> 13:20.400
 Well, in terms of resolution, so to, you know, on a given night, if I go and take a picture of

13:20.400 --> 13:26.560
 IO and it's volcanoes, you can sometimes see at least a dozen different volcanoes, you can see

13:26.560 --> 13:30.720
 the infrared emission coming off of them and resolve them, separate them from one another

13:31.280 --> 13:36.320
 on the surface, and actually watch how the heat coming off of them changes with time.

13:37.280 --> 13:41.680
 And I think this time variability aspect is one of the big advantages we get from telescopes. So

13:41.680 --> 13:46.400
 you send a spacecraft mission there, and you get an incredible amount of information over a very

13:46.400 --> 13:52.960
 short time period. But for some science questions, you need to observe something for 30 years, 40

13:52.960 --> 13:57.760
 years, like let's say you want to look at the moon Titan, which has one of the most interesting

13:57.760 --> 14:05.840
 atmospheres in the solar system. Its orbital period is 29, 30 years. And so if you want to look at

14:05.840 --> 14:11.200
 how its atmospheric seasons work, you have to observe it over that long of a time period. And

14:11.200 --> 14:14.480
 you're not going to do that with a spacecraft, but you can do it with telescopes.

14:15.200 --> 14:21.040
 Can we just zoom in on certain things like, let's talk about IO, which is the moon of Jupiter.

14:21.920 --> 14:30.800
 Okay, it's like epic. There's like volcanoes all over the place. From a distance, it's awesome.

14:30.800 --> 14:37.520
 So can you tell me about this moon? And you're sort of a scholar of many planets and moons,

14:37.520 --> 14:41.280
 but that one kind of stood out to me. So why is that an interesting one?

14:42.160 --> 14:47.520
 For so many reasons, but IO is the most volcanically active object in the solar system.

14:47.520 --> 14:54.400
 It has hundreds of active volcanoes on it. It has volcanic plumes that go hundreds of kilometers

14:54.400 --> 15:02.000
 up above its surface. It puts out more volume of magma per volcano than volcanoes on Earth today.

15:02.000 --> 15:09.600
 Okay. But I think to me, the reason that it's most interesting is as a laboratory for understanding

15:09.600 --> 15:17.200
 planetary processes. So one of the broad goals of planetary science is to put together a sort of

15:17.840 --> 15:25.680
 more general and coherent framework for how planets work in general. Our current framework,

15:25.680 --> 15:29.680
 you know, it started out very Earth centric. We start to understand how Earth volcanoes work.

15:29.680 --> 15:34.400
 But then when you try to transport that to somewhere like IO that doesn't have an atmosphere,

15:34.400 --> 15:38.960
 which makes it has a very tenuous atmosphere, which makes a big difference for how the magma

15:38.960 --> 15:43.760
 de gases, for something that's really small, for something that has a different heat source,

15:43.760 --> 15:48.320
 for something that's embedded in another object's magnetic field, the kind of intuition we have

15:48.320 --> 15:54.560
 from Earth doesn't apply. And so broadly, planetary science is trying to broaden that

15:54.560 --> 15:59.520
 framework so that you have a kind of narrative that all you can understand how each planet

15:59.520 --> 16:04.720
 became different from every other planet. And I'm already making a mistake. When I say planet,

16:04.720 --> 16:07.920
 I mean planets and moons, like I said, I see the moons as planets.

16:07.920 --> 16:14.400
 As planets. Yeah. I actually already noticed that you didn't introduce IO as the moon of Jupiter.

16:14.400 --> 16:20.480
 You completely, you kind of ignored the fact that Jupiter exists. It's like, let's focus on this.

16:22.640 --> 16:27.440
 Yeah. Okay. So, Anne, you also didn't mention Europa, which I think is the,

16:27.440 --> 16:32.880
 is that the most famous moon of Jupiter? Is that the one that gets attention because it might have

16:32.880 --> 16:39.680
 life? Exactly. Yeah. But to you, IO is also beautiful. What's the difference between volcanoes

16:39.680 --> 16:47.760
 on IO versus Earth? You said atmosphere makes a difference. What? Yeah. The heat source plays

16:47.760 --> 16:54.320
 a big role. So, many of the moons in the outer solar system are heated from gravitationally by

16:54.320 --> 17:01.200
 tidal heating. And I'm happy to describe what that is. Yeah, please. What's tidal? Yes.

17:01.200 --> 17:07.600
 So, tidal heating is, it's, if you want to understand and contextualize planets and moons,

17:07.600 --> 17:13.520
 you have to understand their heat sources. So, for Earth, we have radioactive decay in our

17:13.520 --> 17:19.600
 interior as well as residual heat of formation. But for satellites, tidal heating plays a really

17:19.600 --> 17:25.920
 significant role and in particular in driving geological activity on satellites and potentially

17:25.920 --> 17:31.760
 making those subsurface oceans in places like Europa and Enceladus habitable. And so, the way

17:31.760 --> 17:38.640
 that that works is if you have multiple moons and their orbital periods are integer multiples of one

17:38.640 --> 17:46.640
 another, that means that they're always encountering each other at the same point in the orbit. So,

17:46.640 --> 17:50.320
 if they were on just random orbits, they'd be encountering each other at random places and

17:50.320 --> 17:55.280
 the gravitational effect between the two moons would be canceling out over time. But because

17:55.280 --> 18:00.800
 they're always meeting each other at the same point in the orbit, those gravitational interactions

18:00.800 --> 18:07.840
 add up coherently. And so, that tweaks them into eccentric orbits. What's the eccentric orbit?

18:07.840 --> 18:13.440
 So, eccentric orbit or elliptical orbit, it just means noncircular. So, a deviation from a circular

18:13.440 --> 18:18.800
 orbit and that means that for Io or Europa, at some points in their orbit, they're closer to

18:18.800 --> 18:24.480
 Jupiter and at some points in their orbit, they're farther away. And so, when they're closer, they're

18:25.200 --> 18:31.120
 stretched out in a sense, but literally just not very stretched out, like a couple hundred meters,

18:31.120 --> 18:35.520
 something like that. And then when they're farthest away, they're less stretched out. And so, you

18:35.520 --> 18:40.560
 actually have the shape of the object deforming over the course of the orbit. And these orbits

18:40.560 --> 18:46.960
 are like just a couple of days. And so, that, in the case of Io, that is literally sufficient

18:46.960 --> 18:52.080
 friction in its mantle to melt the rock of its mantle. And that's what generates the magma.

18:52.080 --> 19:01.040
 That's the source of the time. Okay. So, Europa is, I thought there's like ice and

19:01.040 --> 19:05.120
 oceans underneath kind of thing. So, why is Europa not getting a friction?

19:05.120 --> 19:10.080
 It is. It's just a little bit farther away from Jupiter. And then, Ganymede is also in the orbital

19:10.080 --> 19:15.840
 resonance. So, it's a three object orbital resonance in the Jupiter system. But we have these sorts

19:15.840 --> 19:22.000
 of orbital resonances all over the solar system and also in exoplanets. So, for Europa, basically,

19:22.000 --> 19:27.280
 because it's farther from Jupiter, the effect is not as extreme, but you do still have heat

19:27.280 --> 19:32.720
 generated in its interior in this way. And that may be driving, could be driving hydrothermal

19:32.720 --> 19:38.320
 activity at the base of its ocean, which obviously would be a really valuable thing for life.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.680
 Cool. So, it's like heating up the ocean a little bit.

19:41.680 --> 19:46.800
 Heating up the ocean a little bit and specifically in these hydrothermal vents where we see really

19:46.800 --> 19:50.960
 interesting life evolve in the bottom of Earth's oceans.

19:50.960 --> 19:57.200
 That's cool. Okay. So, what's Io? What else? So, we know the source is this friction,

19:57.840 --> 20:03.360
 but there's no atmosphere. I'm trying to get a sense of what it's like if you and I were to visit

20:03.360 --> 20:10.720
 Io. Like, what would that look like? What would it feel like? Is this the entire thing covered in

20:10.720 --> 20:19.280
 basically volcanoes? So, it's interesting because there's very little atmosphere. The surface is

20:19.280 --> 20:24.160
 actually really cold, very far below freezing on the surface when you're away from a volcano,

20:24.160 --> 20:29.680
 but the volcanoes themselves are over a thousand degrees or the magma when it comes out is over

20:29.680 --> 20:34.400
 a thousand degrees. But it does come to the surface of the magma? It does, yeah.

20:35.520 --> 20:42.880
 In particular places, whoa, that probably looks beautiful. So, it's frozen, not ice. What is

20:43.920 --> 20:51.840
 rock? It's really cold rock. And then you just have this, what would that look like with no

20:51.840 --> 20:59.520
 atmosphere? Would that, would it be smoke? What does it look like? Is it just magma, like just

20:59.520 --> 21:06.800
 red, yellow, like liquidy things? It's black. It's black and red, I guess. Like, think of

21:07.440 --> 21:12.480
 the type of magma that you see in Hawaii. So, different types of magma flow in different ways,

21:12.480 --> 21:18.960
 for example. So, in somewhere like Io, the magma is really hot and so, it will flow out in sheets

21:18.960 --> 21:26.560
 because it has really low viscosity. And I think the lava flows that we've been having in Hawaii

21:26.560 --> 21:32.960
 over the past couple years are probably a decent analogy, although Io's magmas, lavas are even

21:32.960 --> 21:39.200
 more fluid and faster moving. How fast? Like, what, how fast, like, if you, by the way,

21:39.200 --> 21:46.400
 started through the telescope, are you tracking at what time scale? Like, every frame is how

21:46.400 --> 21:50.960
 far apart, if you're looking through a telescope. Are we talking about seconds or we're talking about

21:51.760 --> 21:56.880
 days, months? When you kind of track, try to get a picture of what the surface might look like,

21:57.600 --> 22:04.960
 what's the frequency? So, it depends a little bit on what you want to do, ideally every night.

22:06.160 --> 22:12.000
 But you could take a frame every second and see how things are changing. The problem with that

22:12.000 --> 22:17.600
 is that for things to change on a one second time scale, you, to actually see something change that

22:17.600 --> 22:21.600
 fast, you have to have super high resolution. The spatial resolution we have is a couple hundred

22:21.600 --> 22:27.840
 kilometers. And so, things are not changing on those scales over one second unless you have

22:27.840 --> 22:34.880
 something really crazy happening. So, if you get, if you get a telescope closer to Io, if you get,

22:34.880 --> 22:40.560
 or a camera closer to Io, would you be able to understand something? Is that something of interest

22:40.560 --> 22:46.800
 to you? Would you be able to understand something deeper about these volcanic eruptions and how

22:46.800 --> 22:53.280
 magma flows and just the, like, the rate of the magmas? Or is it basically enough to have the

22:53.280 --> 22:59.120
 kilometer resolution? Do you get a sense? No way. We want to go there. Absolutely. You want to go to Io?

22:59.120 --> 23:02.240
 I mean, I don't want to go there personally, but I want to send a spacecraft mission there,

23:02.240 --> 23:06.560
 absolutely. Why? Why are you scared? Why am I scared? Oh, you mean you don't...

23:06.560 --> 23:13.040
 Oh, like... I don't want to go there as a human. As a human. I want to send a robot there to look

23:13.040 --> 23:16.880
 at it, though. This is, again, everybody's discriminating against robots. This is not,

23:17.440 --> 23:23.360
 but it's fine. But it's not hospitable to humans in any way, right? So, it's very cold and very hot.

23:24.480 --> 23:31.840
 It's very cold. The atmosphere is composed of sulfur dioxide, so you can breathe it. There's no

23:31.840 --> 23:37.120
 pressure. I mean, it's kind of all the same things you talk about. One talks about Mars only

23:37.120 --> 23:44.000
 worse. The atmosphere is still a thousand times less dense than Mars is. And the radiation environment

23:44.000 --> 23:49.280
 is terrible because you're embedded deep within Jupiter's magnetic field. And Jupiter's magnetic

23:49.280 --> 23:56.960
 field is full of charged particles that have all come out of Io's volcanoes, actually. So,

23:56.960 --> 24:03.280
 Jupiter's magnetic field strips all this material out of Io's atmosphere, and that populates its

24:03.280 --> 24:07.760
 entire magnetosphere, and then that material comes back around and hits Io and spreads throughout

24:07.760 --> 24:12.800
 the system, actually. It's like Io is the massive polluter of the Jupiter system.

24:14.320 --> 24:22.400
 Okay, cool. So, what is studying Io teach you about volcanoes on Earth or vice versa

24:22.400 --> 24:34.000
 in the difference of the two? What insights can you mine out that might be interesting in some way?

24:34.640 --> 24:41.840
 Yeah, we try to port the tools that we use to study Earth volcanism to Io, and it works to some

24:41.840 --> 24:49.200
 extent, but it is challenging because the situations are so different. And the compositions

24:49.200 --> 24:54.000
 are really different when you talk about outgassing, you know, Earth volcanoes outgassed primarily

24:54.640 --> 25:01.360
 water and carbon dioxide, and then sulfur dioxide is the third most abundant gas. And on Io,

25:01.360 --> 25:08.800
 the water and carbon dioxide are not there. Either it didn't form with them or it lost them,

25:08.800 --> 25:13.040
 we don't know. And so, the chemistry of how the magma outgasses is completely different.

25:13.040 --> 25:24.480
 But the kind of one, to me, most interesting analogy to Earth is that so Io, as I've said,

25:24.480 --> 25:30.320
 has these really low viscosity magmas, the lava spreads really quickly across its surface. It can

25:30.320 --> 25:35.680
 put out massive volumes of magma in relatively short periods of time. And that sort of volcanism

25:35.680 --> 25:41.440
 is not happening anywhere else in the solar system today, but literally every terrestrial

25:41.440 --> 25:48.560
 planet and the moon had this, what we call, very effusive volcanism early in their history.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.920
 Okay, so this is almost like a little glimpse into the early history of Earth.

25:51.920 --> 25:52.400
 Yeah.

25:52.400 --> 25:58.400
 Okay, cool. So what are the chances that a volcano on Earth destroys all of human civilization?

25:59.920 --> 26:01.680
 Maybe I wanted to sneak in that question.

26:01.680 --> 26:03.120
 Yeah, a volcano on Earth.

26:05.840 --> 26:09.280
 Do you think about that kind of stuff when you just study volcanoes elsewhere?

26:09.280 --> 26:14.000
 Because isn't it kind of humbling to see something so powerful and so hot,

26:14.000 --> 26:18.640
 like so unpleasant for humans? And then you realize we're sitting on many of them here?

26:18.640 --> 26:26.640
 Right. Yeah, Yellowstone as a classic example. I don't know what the chances are of that happening.

26:26.640 --> 26:32.000
 My intuition would be that the chances of that are lower than the chances of us getting wiped out

26:32.000 --> 26:38.240
 by some other means. That maybe it'll happen eventually that there'll be one of these massive

26:38.240 --> 26:42.880
 volcanoes on Earth, but we'll probably be gone by then by some other means. Not to sound bleak.

26:44.160 --> 26:48.880
 That's very comforting. Okay, so can we talk about Europa?

26:50.880 --> 26:57.760
 Is there, so maybe can you talk about the intuition, the hope that people have about

26:57.760 --> 27:03.440
 life being on Europa? Maybe also, what are the things we know about it?

27:03.440 --> 27:08.640
 What are things to you that are interesting about that particular moon of Jupiter? Sure.

27:09.760 --> 27:15.520
 Yeah, Europa is, from many perspectives, one of the really interesting places in the solar system

27:15.520 --> 27:22.880
 among the solar system moons. So there are a few, there has, there's a lot of interest in looking for

27:23.760 --> 27:28.240
 or understanding the potential for life to evolve in the subsurface oceans. I think it's

27:28.240 --> 27:34.640
 fairly widely accepted that the chances of life evolving on the surfaces of really anything in

27:34.640 --> 27:43.520
 the solar system is very low. The radiation environment is too harsh. And there's, there's

27:43.520 --> 27:49.600
 just not liquids on the surface of most of these things. And it's canonically accepted that liquids

27:49.600 --> 27:54.960
 are required for life. And so the subsurface oceans, in addition to maybe Titan's atmosphere,

27:54.960 --> 28:00.640
 the subsurface oceans of the icy satellites, are one of the most plausible places in the

28:00.640 --> 28:06.880
 solar system for life to evolve. Europa and Celadus are interesting because for many of the big

28:06.880 --> 28:11.840
 satellites, so Ganymede and Callisto, also satellites of Jupiter, also are thought to have

28:11.840 --> 28:18.080
 subsurface oceans. But they are, so they have these ice shells, and then there's an ocean

28:18.080 --> 28:22.400
 underneath the ice shell. But on those moons around Ganymede, we think that there's another ice

28:22.400 --> 28:28.240
 shell underneath, and then there's rock. And the reason that that is a problem for life is that

28:28.880 --> 28:33.760
 your ocean is probably just pure water because it's trapped between two big shells of ice.

28:34.480 --> 28:40.880
 So Europa doesn't have this ice shell at the bottom of the ocean, we think. And so the water

28:40.880 --> 28:45.760
 and rock are in direct interaction. And so that means that you can basically dissolve a lot of

28:45.760 --> 28:51.600
 material out of the rock. You potentially have this hydrothermal activity that's injecting energy

28:51.600 --> 28:57.840
 and nutrients for life to survive. And so this rock water interface is considered really important

28:58.480 --> 29:06.000
 for the potential habitability. As a smaller side, you kind of said that it's canonically assumed

29:06.000 --> 29:14.320
 that light water is required for life. Is it possible to have life in the volcano? I remember

29:14.320 --> 29:22.080
 people, it's like a National Geographic program or something kind of hypothesizing that you can

29:22.080 --> 29:27.280
 really have life anywhere. So as long as there's a source of heat, a source of energy, do you think

29:27.280 --> 29:38.320
 it's possible to have life in a volcano? Like no water? I think anything's possible. I think it's

29:38.320 --> 29:45.040
 so water, it doesn't have to be water. That's sort of, you can tell, as you identified, I phrased

29:45.040 --> 29:50.880
 that really carefully. It's canonically accepted that because we recognize that, you know, scientists

29:50.880 --> 29:55.760
 recognize that we have no idea what broad range of life could be out there. And all we really have

29:55.760 --> 30:01.280
 is our biases of life as we know it. But for life as we know it, it's very helpful to have, or even

30:01.280 --> 30:08.560
 necessary to have some kind of liquid and preferably a polar solvent that can actually dissolve

30:08.560 --> 30:12.880
 molecules, something like water. So the case of liquid methane on Titan is less ideal from that

30:12.880 --> 30:19.520
 perspective. But you know, liquid magma, if it stays liquid long enough for life to evolve,

30:19.520 --> 30:23.680
 you have a heat source, you have a liquid, you have nutrients. In theory, that checks your three

30:23.680 --> 30:30.960
 classic astrobiology boxes. That'd be fascinating. I mean, it'd be fascinating if it's possible to

30:30.960 --> 30:40.160
 detect it easily. How would we detect if there is life on Europa? Is it possible to do in a

30:40.160 --> 30:49.040
 noncontact way from a distance through telescopes and so on? Or do we need to send robots and do

30:49.040 --> 30:58.160
 some drilling? I think realistically, you need to do the drilling. So Europa also has these

30:58.160 --> 31:03.920
 long tectonic features on its surface where it's thought that there's potential for water from

31:03.920 --> 31:10.160
 the ocean to be somehow making its way up onto the surface. And you could imagine some out there

31:10.160 --> 31:14.320
 scenario where there's bacteria in the ocean, it's somehow working its way up through the ice shell,

31:14.320 --> 31:20.160
 it's spilling out on the surface, it's being killed by the radiation. But your instrument

31:20.160 --> 31:24.800
 could detect some spectroscopic signature of that dead bacterium. But that's, you know,

31:24.800 --> 31:29.280
 that's many ifs and assumptions. That's a hope because then you don't have to do that much

31:29.280 --> 31:34.080
 drilling you can collect from the surface. Right. Or even I'm thinking even remotely.

31:34.720 --> 31:42.880
 Oh, remotely. Yeah. That's sad that there's a single cell civilization living underneath all

31:42.880 --> 31:51.040
 that ice trying, trying to get up, trying to get out. So Enceladus gives you a slightly better

31:51.040 --> 31:59.040
 chance of that because Enceladus is a moon of Saturn and it's broadly similar to Europa in

31:59.040 --> 32:03.600
 some ways. It's an icy satellite, it has a subsurface ocean that's probably in touch with

32:03.600 --> 32:08.880
 the rocky interior. But it has these massive geysers at its south pole where it's spewing out

32:08.880 --> 32:13.680
 material that appears to be originating all the way from the ocean. And so in that case,

32:14.480 --> 32:20.960
 you could potentially fly through that plume and scoop up that material and hope that at the

32:20.960 --> 32:24.960
 velocities you'd be scooping it up, you're not destroying any signature of the life you're looking

32:24.960 --> 32:31.280
 for. But let's say that you have some ingenuity and can come up with a way to do that, you know,

32:31.280 --> 32:39.040
 it potentially gives you a more direct opportunity at least to try to measure those bacteria directly.

32:39.040 --> 32:46.480
 Can you tell me a little more on how do you pronounce it? Celas. Enceladus. Enceladus?

32:47.440 --> 32:52.640
 Can you tell me a little bit more about Enceladus? Like we've been talking about way too much about

32:52.640 --> 33:04.000
 Jupiter. Saturn doesn't get as much love. So what's Enceladus? Is that the most exciting moon of

33:04.000 --> 33:11.680
 Saturn? Depends on your perspective. It's very exciting from an astrobiology perspective. I think

33:11.680 --> 33:17.200
 Enceladus and Titan are the two most unique and interesting moons of Saturn that definitely

33:17.200 --> 33:24.640
 both get the most attention also from the life perspective. So what's the more likely Titan

33:24.640 --> 33:32.160
 or Enceladus for life? If you were to bet all your money in terms of like investing,

33:32.160 --> 33:36.480
 which to investigate, what are the difference between the two that they're interesting to you?

33:37.440 --> 33:44.880
 Yeah, so the potential for life in each of those two places is very different. So Titan is the one

33:44.880 --> 33:49.920
 place in the solar system where you might imagine, again, all of this is so speculative, but you

33:49.920 --> 33:56.960
 might imagine life evolving in the atmosphere. So from a biology perspective, Titan is interesting

33:56.960 --> 34:02.800
 because it forms complex organic molecules in its atmosphere. It has a dense atmosphere. It's

34:02.800 --> 34:07.600
 actually denser than Earth's. It's the only moon that has an atmosphere denser than Earth's.

34:07.600 --> 34:11.760
 That's cool. It's got tons of methane in it. What happens is that methane gets irradiated,

34:11.760 --> 34:16.880
 it breaks up and it reforms with other things in the atmosphere. It makes these complex,

34:16.880 --> 34:22.560
 organic molecules and it's effectively doing prebiotic chemistry in the atmosphere.

34:23.120 --> 34:30.640
 While it's still freezing cold? Yes. Okay. What would that be like? Would that be pleasant

34:30.640 --> 34:35.520
 for humans to hang out there? It's just really cold? There's nowhere in the solar system that

34:35.520 --> 34:39.440
 would be pleasant for humans. It would be cold. You couldn't breathe the air.

34:39.440 --> 34:46.000
 But colonization wise, if there's an atmosphere, is that a big plus or still a ton of radiation?

34:47.840 --> 34:54.800
 Okay. So Titan, that's a really nice feature that the life could be in the atmosphere because

34:54.800 --> 35:00.160
 then it might be remotely observable or certainly is more accessible if you visit.

35:01.840 --> 35:07.920
 Okay. So what about Enceladus? So that would be still in the ocean.

35:07.920 --> 35:12.800
 Right. Enceladus has the advantage, like I said, of spewing material out of its

35:12.800 --> 35:17.680
 south pole so you could collect it. But it has the disadvantage of the fact that we don't actually

35:17.680 --> 35:27.840
 really understand how its ocean could stay globally liquid over the age of the solar system.

35:27.840 --> 35:34.800
 And so there are some models that say that it's going through this cyclical evolution

35:34.800 --> 35:39.120
 where the ocean freezes completely and thaws completely and the orbit sort of

35:40.080 --> 35:47.600
 oscillates in and out of these eccentricities. And in that case, the potential for life

35:47.600 --> 35:51.520
 ever occurring there in the first place is a lot lower because if you only have an ocean for 100

35:51.520 --> 35:57.920
 million years, is that enough time? And it also means that might be mass extinction events if

35:57.920 --> 36:03.040
 it does occur. Right. And it just freezes. Yes. Again, very sad, man. This is very depressing.

36:03.040 --> 36:10.080
 All that slaughter of life elsewhere. How unlikely do you think life is on earth?

36:11.680 --> 36:16.640
 So when you look, when you study other planets and you study the contents of other planets,

36:18.160 --> 36:24.960
 does that give you a perspective on the origin of life on earth, which again is full of mystery

36:24.960 --> 36:29.440
 in itself? Not the evolution, but the origin, the first springing to life,

36:29.440 --> 36:35.360
 like from, from nothing to life, from the basic ingredients to life.

36:37.440 --> 36:40.000
 I guess another way of asking it is how unique are we?

36:40.720 --> 36:46.640
 Yeah, it's a great question. And it's one that just scientifically we don't have an answer to.

36:47.440 --> 36:53.040
 We don't even know how many times life evolved on earth if it was only once or if it happened

36:53.040 --> 36:57.680
 independently a thousand times in different places. We don't know whether it's happened

36:57.680 --> 37:04.400
 anywhere else in the universe, although it feels absurd to believe that we are the only

37:04.400 --> 37:09.680
 life that evolved in the entire universe, but it's conceivable. We just have just no

37:10.960 --> 37:15.360
 real information. We don't understand really how life came about in the first place on earth.

37:16.000 --> 37:23.600
 I mean, so if you look at the Drake equation that tries to estimate how many alien civilizations

37:23.600 --> 37:30.640
 are out there, planets have a big part to play in that equation. If you were to bet money

37:32.560 --> 37:38.080
 in terms of the odds of origins of life on earth, I mean, this all has to do with how special

37:38.080 --> 37:43.280
 and unique is earth. What you land in terms of the number of civilizations has to do with

37:43.840 --> 37:50.480
 how unique their rare earth hypothesis is, how rare a special is earth, how rare and special

37:50.480 --> 37:57.600
 is the solar system. If you had to bet all your money on a completely unscientific question,

37:57.600 --> 38:03.040
 well, no, it's actually rigorously scientific. We just don't know a lot of things in that equation.

38:03.040 --> 38:07.920
 There's a lot of mysteries about that, and it's slowly becoming better and better understood

38:07.920 --> 38:13.520
 in terms of exoplanets, in terms of how many solar systems are out there where there's planets,

38:13.520 --> 38:17.120
 there are earth like planets that's getting better and better understood. What's your sense

38:17.120 --> 38:25.120
 from that perspective, how many alien civilizations out there, zero or one plus?

38:25.120 --> 38:30.560
 You're right that the equation is being better understood, but you're really only talking about

38:30.560 --> 38:34.400
 the first three parameters in the equation or something, how many stars are there,

38:34.400 --> 38:39.520
 how many planets per star, and then we're just barely scratching the surface of what fraction

38:39.520 --> 38:43.440
 of those planets might be habitable. The rest of the terms in the equation are like,

38:43.440 --> 38:48.480
 how likely is life to evolve given habitable conditions? How likely is it to survive all

38:48.480 --> 38:55.520
 these things? They're all these huge unknowns. Actually, I remember when I first saw that

38:55.520 --> 39:01.200
 equation, I think it was my first year of college, and I thought, this is ridiculous,

39:01.200 --> 39:09.360
 this is a common sense that didn't need to give a name and b, just a bunch of unknowns,

39:09.360 --> 39:14.320
 it's like putting our ignorance together in one equation, but I've actually, now I understand

39:14.320 --> 39:20.160
 this equation, it's not something we ever necessarily have the answer to, it just gives

39:20.160 --> 39:24.800
 us a framework for having the exact conversation we're having right now, and I think that's how

39:24.800 --> 39:29.200
 it was intended in the first place when it was put into writing was to give people a language

39:29.200 --> 39:36.000
 to communicate about the factors that go into the potential for aliens to be out there and for

39:36.000 --> 39:46.720
 us to find them. I would put money on there being aliens, I would not put money on us having definitive

39:46.720 --> 39:55.200
 evidence of them in my lifetime. Well, definitive is a funny, is a fun word, because my sense is,

39:56.080 --> 40:02.240
 this is the saddest part for me, is my sense in terms of intelligent alien civilizations.

40:02.240 --> 40:12.160
 I feel like we're so, we're so self obsessed that we literally would not be able to detect them,

40:12.960 --> 40:19.360
 even when they're like in front of us, like, like trees could be aliens, but just their

40:19.360 --> 40:27.200
 intelligence could be realized on a scale, on a time scale, or physical scale that we're not

40:27.200 --> 40:32.560
 appreciating, like trees could be way more intelligent than us, I don't know, it's just

40:32.560 --> 40:39.760
 a dumb example, it could be rocks, rock, or it could be things like, I love this, this is

40:39.760 --> 40:46.240
 Dawkins memes, it could be that ideas are the, like ideas we have, like where do ideas come from,

40:46.240 --> 40:52.800
 where do thoughts come from, maybe thoughts are the aliens, or maybe thoughts is the

40:52.800 --> 40:59.120
 actual mechanisms of communication in physics, right, this is like, we think of thoughts as

40:59.120 --> 41:05.440
 something that springs up from neurons firing, or where the hell they come from. And now,

41:06.320 --> 41:12.320
 what about consciousness, maybe consciousness is the communication, it sounds like ridiculous,

41:12.320 --> 41:19.680
 but like, we're so self centered on this space time, communication and physical space,

41:19.680 --> 41:27.440
 using like written language, like spoken with audio, on a time scale that's very specific,

41:27.440 --> 41:35.280
 on a physical scale that's very specific. So I tend to think that bacteria will probably

41:35.280 --> 41:40.160
 recognize, like, like moving organisms will probably recognize, but when that forms itself

41:40.160 --> 41:44.960
 into intelligence, most likely it'll be robots of some kind, because we won't be meeting the

41:44.960 --> 41:50.720
 origins, we'll be meeting the creations of those intelligences, we just would not be able to

41:50.720 --> 42:01.440
 appreciate it. And that's the saddest thing to me, that we, yeah, we're too dumb to see aliens.

42:02.560 --> 42:07.440
 Like, we're too, we kind of think like, look at the progress of science, we've accomplished so

42:07.440 --> 42:14.160
 much. The sad thing, it could be that we're just like, in the first 0.001% of understanding anything,

42:14.160 --> 42:20.560
 it's humbling. I hope that's true, because I feel like we're very ignorant as a species,

42:20.560 --> 42:26.080
 and I hope that our current level of knowledge only represents the 0.001% of what we will someday

42:26.080 --> 42:32.720
 achieve. That actually feels optimistic to me. Well, I feel like that's easier for us to comprehend

42:32.720 --> 42:38.000
 in the space of biology, and not as easy to comprehend in the space of physics, for example,

42:38.000 --> 42:44.880
 because we have a sense that like, we have, it like, if you talk to theoretical physicists, they

42:44.880 --> 42:52.800
 have a sense that we understand the basic laws that form the nature of reality of our universe.

42:53.920 --> 42:58.640
 But so there's much more, like physicists are much more confident. Biologists are like,

42:58.640 --> 43:08.400
 this is a squishy mess, we're doing our best. But I would be, it'd be fascinating to see if

43:08.400 --> 43:14.000
 physicists themselves would also be humbled by their being, like, what the hell is dark matter

43:14.000 --> 43:20.320
 and dark energy? What the hell is the, not just the origin of the, not just the Big Bang, but

43:21.440 --> 43:25.600
 everything that happens since the Big Bang. A lot of things that happen since the Big Bang,

43:25.600 --> 43:29.840
 we have no ideas about, except basic models of physics. Right, or what happened before the Big

43:29.840 --> 43:34.480
 Bang? Yeah, yeah, what happened before, or what's happening inside the Black Hole? Why is there a

43:34.480 --> 43:39.600
 Black Hole at the side of our galaxy? Can somebody answer this? A supermassive Black Hole? Nobody

43:39.600 --> 43:45.920
 knows how it started. And they seem to be like in the middle of all galaxies. So that could be a

43:45.920 --> 43:50.560
 portal for aliens to communicate through consciousness. Okay. All right, back to planets.

43:50.560 --> 43:58.000
 What's your favorite, outside of Earth, what's your favorite planet or moon? Maybe outside of

43:58.000 --> 44:04.400
 the ones, well, first, have we talked about it already? Or, and then, if we did mention it,

44:04.400 --> 44:08.880
 what's the one outside of that? Oh, gosh, I have to come up with another favorite that's not Io?

44:08.880 --> 44:14.640
 Oh, Io is the favorite. Oh, absolutely. Why is Io the favorite? I mean, basically everything I've

44:14.640 --> 44:23.760
 already said, it's just such an amazing and unique object. But on, I guess, a personal note, it's

44:23.760 --> 44:30.480
 probably the object that made me become a planetary scientist. It's the first thing in the solar system

44:30.480 --> 44:39.600
 that really deeply captured my interest. And when I started my PhD, I wanted to be an

44:39.600 --> 44:47.040
 astrophysicist working on things like galaxy evolution. And sort of slowly, I had done some

44:47.040 --> 44:51.520
 projects in the solar system, but Io was the thing that like really caught me into doing

44:51.520 --> 44:57.760
 solar system science. Okay, let's, let's leave moons aside. What's your favorite planet?

44:58.720 --> 45:03.440
 It sounds like you like moons better than planets. So let's, that's accurate. But the

45:03.440 --> 45:09.760
 planets are, are fascinating. I think, you know, I find the planets in the solar system really

45:09.760 --> 45:16.800
 fascinating. What I like about the moons is that they, there's so much less that is known,

45:16.800 --> 45:21.360
 there's still a lot more discovery space. And the questions that we can ask are still the

45:21.360 --> 45:27.280
 bigger questions. Gotcha. Which, you know, I, and maybe I'm being unfair to the planets because

45:27.280 --> 45:32.320
 we're still trying to understand things like was there ever life on Mars? And that is a huge

45:32.320 --> 45:38.560
 question and one that we've sent numerous robots to Mars to try to answer. So maybe I'm being unfair

45:38.560 --> 45:43.200
 to the planets, but there is certainly quite a bit more information that we have about the

45:43.200 --> 45:50.400
 planets than the moons. But I mean, Venus is, is a fascinating object. So I like the objects that

45:51.280 --> 45:58.720
 lie at the extremes. I think that if we can make a sort of theory or like I've been saying,

45:58.720 --> 46:03.360
 framework for understanding planets and moons that can incorporate even the most extreme ones,

46:03.360 --> 46:08.000
 then, you know, those are the things that really test your theory and test your understanding.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.480
 And so they've always really fascinated me, not so much the nice habitable places like Earth,

46:12.480 --> 46:21.840
 but these extreme places like Venus that have sulfuric acid clouds and just incredibly hot and

46:21.840 --> 46:30.080
 dense surfaces. And Venus, of course, I love volcanism for some reason. And Venus has, probably

46:30.080 --> 46:35.280
 has volcanic activity, definitely has in their recent past, maybe has ongoing today.

46:36.800 --> 46:41.840
 What do you make of the news and maybe you can update it in terms of life being discovered

46:41.840 --> 46:47.600
 in the atmosphere of Venus? Is that, sorry. Okay. You have opinion, I can already tell you

46:47.600 --> 46:54.000
 have opinions. Was that fake news? I got excited. I saw that. What's the, what's the final,

46:54.880 --> 46:59.840
 is there a life on Venus? So the detection that was reported was the detection of the molecule

46:59.840 --> 47:09.120
 phosphine. And they said that they tried every other mechanism they could think of to produce

47:09.120 --> 47:15.360
 phosphine. And they none of no mechanism worked. And then they said, well, we know that life

47:15.360 --> 47:19.440
 produces phosphine. And so that was sort of the train of logic. And

47:21.920 --> 47:25.600
 I don't personally believe that phosphine was detected in the first place.

47:26.160 --> 47:33.440
 Okay. So I mean, this is just one study, but I as a layman, I'm skeptical a little bit

47:35.040 --> 47:41.520
 about tools that sense the contents of an atmosphere, like contents of an atmosphere from

47:41.520 --> 47:46.080
 remotely and making conclusive statements about life.

47:47.120 --> 47:51.280
 Oh, yeah. Well, that connection that you just made, the contents of the atmosphere to the life

47:52.160 --> 47:59.120
 is a tricky one. And yeah, I know that that claim received a lot of criticism for

47:59.120 --> 48:06.560
 the lines of logic that went from detection to claim of life. Even the detection itself, though,

48:06.560 --> 48:13.680
 doesn't, doesn't meet the sort of historical scientific standards of a detection.

48:15.200 --> 48:21.200
 The, it was a very tenuous detection and only one line of the species was detected. And a lot of

48:21.200 --> 48:27.440
 really complicated data analysis methods had to be applied to even make that weak detection.

48:27.440 --> 48:32.320
 Yeah. So it could be, it could be noise, it could be polluted data, it could be all the,

48:32.320 --> 48:37.680
 all those things. And so it doesn't have, it doesn't meet the, the level of rigor that you would

48:37.680 --> 48:45.520
 hope. But of course, I mean, we're doing our best. And it's clear that the human species are hopeful

48:45.520 --> 48:52.480
 to find life. Clearly. Yes. Everyone is so excited about that possibility. All right. Let's, let me

48:52.480 --> 49:05.600
 ask you about Mars. So there's a guy named Elon Musk. And he seems to want to take something

49:05.600 --> 49:12.160
 called Dogecoin there. First of the month. I'm just kidding about the Dogecoin. I don't even

49:12.160 --> 49:23.200
 know what the heck is up with that whole, I think, I think humor has power in the 21st century

49:24.080 --> 49:33.600
 in a way to spread ideas in the most positive way. So I love that kind of humor because it makes

49:33.600 --> 49:39.280
 people smile, but it also kind of sneaks like a Trojan horse for cool ideas.

49:39.280 --> 49:47.200
 You open with humor and you, like the humor is the appetizer and then the main meal is the science

49:47.200 --> 49:59.680
 and the engineering. Anyway, do you think it's possible to colonize Mars or other planets in

49:59.680 --> 50:06.480
 the solar system? But we're especially looking to Mars. Is there something about planets that

50:06.480 --> 50:12.480
 make them very harsh to humans? Is there something in particular you think about? And maybe, you know,

50:12.480 --> 50:18.000
 high, like big picture perspective, do you have a hope we do in fact become a multi planetary

50:18.000 --> 50:26.720
 species? I do think that if our species survives long enough and we don't wipe ourselves out or

50:26.720 --> 50:33.600
 get wiped out by some other means that we will eventually be able to colonize other planets,

50:33.600 --> 50:38.880
 I do not expect that to happen in my lifetime. I mean, tourists may go to Mars, tourists,

50:38.880 --> 50:43.280
 people who commit years of their life to go into Mars as a tourist may go to Mars.

50:44.400 --> 50:49.600
 I don't think that we will colonize it. Is there a sense why it's just too harsh

50:49.600 --> 50:57.600
 from an environment to, like it's too costly to build something habitable there for a large

50:57.600 --> 51:06.080
 population? I think that we need to do a lot of work and learning how to use the resources that

51:06.080 --> 51:10.880
 are on the planet already to do the things we need. So if you're talking about someone going

51:10.880 --> 51:19.600
 there for a few months, so we'll back up a little bit. There are many things that make Mars not

51:19.600 --> 51:24.800
 hospitable temperature. You can't breathe air, you need a pressure suit, even if you're on the

51:24.800 --> 51:28.960
 surface, the radiation environment is, you know, even in all of those things, the radiation

51:28.960 --> 51:34.960
 environment is too harsh for the human body. All of those things seem like they could eventually

51:34.960 --> 51:45.360
 have technological solutions. The challenge, the real significant challenge to me seems to be the

51:45.360 --> 51:51.680
 creation of a self sustaining civilization there. You know, you can bring pressure suits,

51:51.680 --> 51:55.520
 you can bring oxygen to breathe, but those are all in limited supply. And if we're going to

51:55.520 --> 52:01.840
 colonize it, we need to find ways to make use of the resources that are there to do things like

52:01.840 --> 52:06.400
 produce food, produce the air the humans need to keep breathing, just in order to make itself

52:06.400 --> 52:10.960
 sustaining, there's a tremendous amount of work that has to be done. And people are working on

52:10.960 --> 52:17.360
 these problems. But I think that's going to be a major obstacle in going from visiting where we

52:17.360 --> 52:23.760
 can bring everything we need to survive in the short term to actually colonizing. Yeah, I find

52:23.760 --> 52:31.440
 that whole project of the human species quite inspiring. These like huge moonshot projects.

52:32.960 --> 52:39.280
 Somebody was reading something in terms of the source of food that's that may be the most effective

52:39.280 --> 52:46.240
 on Mars is you could farm insects. That's the easiest thing to farm. So we'll be eating like

52:46.240 --> 52:51.520
 cockroaches before living on Mars. Because that's the easiest thing to actually

52:52.720 --> 52:58.880
 as a source of protein. So growing a source of protein is the easiest thing is insects. I just

52:58.880 --> 53:05.520
 imagine this giant for people who are afraid of insects. This is not a pleasant. Maybe you're

53:05.520 --> 53:09.280
 not supposed to even think of it that way. It'll be like a cockroach milkshake or something like

53:09.280 --> 53:15.600
 that. Right. I wonder if people have been working on the genetic engineering of insects to make them

53:17.440 --> 53:23.760
 radiation friendly, or pressure resistant or whatever. What can possibly go wrong?

53:25.040 --> 53:32.240
 Radiation resistant. They're already like survived everything. Plus, I took an allergy test in

53:32.240 --> 53:38.960
 Austin. So there's everybody's like the allergy levels are super high there. And one of the things,

53:38.960 --> 53:45.040
 apparently, I'm not allergic to any insects, except cockroaches. It's hilarious. So maybe

53:47.360 --> 53:52.320
 well, I'm going to use that as you know, people use an excuse that I'm allergic to cats to not

53:52.320 --> 53:57.200
 have cats. I'm going to use that as an excuse to not go to Mars as one of the first batch of people.

53:57.760 --> 54:00.400
 I was going to ask if you had the opportunity when you go.

54:00.400 --> 54:05.040
 Yeah, I'm joking about the cockroach thing. I would definitely go. I love challenges.

54:06.080 --> 54:16.080
 I love things. I love doing things where the possibility of death is not insignificant

54:17.040 --> 54:25.920
 because it makes me appreciate it more. Meditating on death makes me appreciate life.

54:25.920 --> 54:34.480
 And when the meditation on death is forced on you because of how difficult the task is,

54:35.520 --> 54:41.440
 I enjoy those kinds of things. Most people don't, it seems like. But I love the idea of difficult

54:41.440 --> 54:50.080
 journeys for no purpose whatsoever, except exploration, going into the unknown, seeing what

54:50.080 --> 54:54.880
 the limits of the human mind and the human body are. It's like, what the hell else is this whole

54:54.880 --> 55:00.960
 journey that we're on for? But it could be because I grew up in the Soviet Union, there's a kind of

55:00.960 --> 55:09.440
 love for space, like the space race, the Cold War created. I don't know if still it permeates

55:09.440 --> 55:15.520
 American culture as much, but especially with the data as a scientist, I think I've

55:17.040 --> 55:22.720
 loved the idea of humans striving out towards the stars, always. Like from the engineer

55:22.720 --> 55:26.560
 perspective, it's been really exciting. I don't know if people love that as much in America

55:26.560 --> 55:32.320
 anymore. I think Elon is bringing that back a little bit, that excitement about rockets and

55:32.320 --> 55:39.600
 going out there. So that's hopeful. But for me, I always love that idea. From an alien scientist

55:39.600 --> 55:48.400
 perspective, if you were to look back on Earth, is there something interesting you could say

55:48.400 --> 55:55.520
 about Earth? How would you summarize Earth? Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, if you had to

55:55.520 --> 56:04.400
 report, write a paper on Earth or a letter, like a one pager, summarizing the contents of the

56:04.400 --> 56:08.080
 surface and the atmosphere, is there something interesting? Do you ever take that kind of

56:08.080 --> 56:14.960
 perspective on it? I know you like volcanism, so volcanoes, that'll probably be in the report.

56:14.960 --> 56:18.480
 I was going to say that's where I was going to go first. There are a few things to say about

56:18.480 --> 56:25.600
 the atmosphere, but in terms of the volcanoes, so one of the really interesting puzzles to me

56:25.600 --> 56:31.760
 in planetary sciences, so we can look out there and we've been talking about surfaces and volcanoes

56:31.760 --> 56:37.120
 and atmospheres and things like that. But that is just this tiny little veneer on the outside of

56:37.120 --> 56:42.720
 the planet, and most of the planet is completely inaccessible to telescopes or to spacecraft

56:42.720 --> 56:46.560
 missions. You can drill a meter into the surface, but that's still really the veneer.

56:48.400 --> 56:54.240
 And one of the cool puzzles is looking at what's going on on the surface and trying to figure out

56:54.800 --> 57:00.240
 what's happening underneath, or just any kind of indirect means that you have to study the

57:00.240 --> 57:05.760
 interior because you can't dig into it directly, even on Earth, you can't dig deep into Earth.

57:05.760 --> 57:14.320
 So from that perspective, looking at Earth, one thing that you would be able to tell from orbit,

57:14.320 --> 57:21.920
 given enough time, is that Earth has tectonic plates. So you would see that volcanoes follow

57:21.920 --> 57:27.040
 the edges. If you trace where all the volcanoes are on Earth, they follow these lines that trace

57:27.040 --> 57:33.680
 the edges of the plates. And similarly, you would see things like the Hawaiian string of volcanoes

57:33.680 --> 57:39.760
 that you could infer, just like we did as people actually living on Earth, that the plates are

57:39.760 --> 57:44.720
 moving over some plume that's coming up through the mantle. And so you could use that to say,

57:45.440 --> 57:50.000
 if the aliens could look at where the volcanoes are happening on Earth and say something about

57:50.000 --> 57:54.000
 the fact that Earth has plate tectonics, which makes it really unique in the solar system.

57:55.280 --> 57:58.480
 So the other planets don't have plate tectonics? It's the only one that has plate tectonics.

57:58.480 --> 58:03.760
 Yeah. What about Io and the friction and all that? That's not plate tectonics. What's the

58:03.760 --> 58:11.120
 difference between all this plate tectonics, like another layer of solid rock that moves around

58:11.120 --> 58:17.840
 and there's cracks? Exactly. Yeah. So Earth has plates of solid rock sitting on top of a partially

58:17.840 --> 58:26.080
 molten layer. And those plates are shifting around. On Io, it doesn't have that. And the

58:26.080 --> 58:30.960
 volcanism is what we call heat pipe volcanism. It's the magma just punches a hole through the

58:30.960 --> 58:35.120
 crust and comes out on the surface. I mean, that's a simplification, but that's effectively what's

58:35.120 --> 58:41.280
 happening through the freezing cold crust. Yes. Very cold, very rigid crust. Yeah.

58:41.920 --> 58:48.240
 How does that look like, by the way? I don't think we've mentioned. So the gas that's expelled,

58:48.240 --> 58:52.720
 like if we were to look at it, is it like beautiful? Is it like boring? The gas?

58:52.720 --> 58:58.400
 Like the whole thing, like the magma punching through the icy? Yes. I'm sure it would be

58:58.400 --> 59:04.000
 beautiful. And the pictures we've seen of it are beautiful. You have, so the magma will come out of

59:04.000 --> 59:10.160
 the lava, will come out of these fissures. And you have these curtains of lava that are

59:11.440 --> 59:16.640
 maybe even a kilometer high. So if you looked at videos, I don't know how many volcano videos

59:16.640 --> 59:20.640
 you've looked at on Earth, but you sometimes see a tiny, tiny version of this in Iceland. You see

59:20.640 --> 59:24.640
 just these sheets of magma coming out of a fissure when you have this really low

59:25.680 --> 59:31.200
 viscosity magma sort of water like coming out at these sheets. And the plumes that come out,

59:31.200 --> 59:38.960
 because there's no atmosphere, all the plume molecules are just plume particles where they

59:38.960 --> 59:44.560
 end up is just a function of the direction that they left the vent. So they're all following

59:44.560 --> 59:49.680
 ballistic trajectories. And you end up with these umbrella plumes. You don't get these sort of

59:49.680 --> 59:54.560
 complicated plumes that you have on Earth that are occurring because of how that material is

59:54.560 --> 59:58.720
 interacting with the atmosphere that's there. You just have these huge umbrellas. And it's

59:58.720 --> 1:00:06.240
 been hypothesized actually that the atmosphere is made of sulfur dioxide and that you could have

1:00:06.240 --> 1:00:12.320
 these kind of ash particles from the volcano and the sulfur dioxide would condense onto these

1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:16.320
 particles. And you'd have sulfur dioxide snow coming out of these volcanic plumes.

1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:22.560
 And that's not much light though, right? So you wouldn't be able to, like it would

1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:27.520
 make a good, it would not make a good Instagram photo because you have to, would you see the snow?

1:00:28.480 --> 1:00:33.520
 Sure. There's light. It depends. Oh, okay. So you could, you could, okay. Depends what angle

1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:37.280
 you're looking at it, where the sun is, all the things like that. You know, the sunlight is much

1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:44.800
 weaker, but it's still there. It's still there. And how big is IO in terms of gravity? Is it smaller?

1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:50.800
 Is it a pretty small moon? It's quite a bit smaller than Earth anyway. It's smaller than Earth. Okay.

1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:56.080
 Okay, cool. So they float, float up for a little bit. So the floats, wow, they, yeah,

1:00:56.080 --> 1:01:00.960
 no, you're right. That would be, that would be, that would be gorgeous. What else about Earth

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:06.080
 is interesting besides the volcano. So plate tectonics, I didn't realize that that was the

1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:15.360
 unique element of a planet in the solar system. Because that, I wonder what, I mean, we experience

1:01:15.360 --> 1:01:18.960
 that as human beings, it's quite painful because of earthquakes and all those kinds of things, but

1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:25.520
 I wonder if there's nice features to it. Yeah. So coming back to habitability again,

1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:31.840
 things like tectonics and plate tectonics are, are thought to play an important role in the

1:01:31.840 --> 1:01:36.800
 surface being habitable. And that's because you have a way of recycling materials. So

1:01:37.520 --> 1:01:41.680
 if you have a stagnant surface, everything, you know, you use up all the free oxygen,

1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:47.760
 everything reacts until you no longer have reactants that life can extract energy from.

1:01:47.760 --> 1:01:51.600
 And so if nothing's changing on your surface, you kind of reach this stagnation point.

1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:58.640
 But something like plate tectonics recycles material, you bring up new fresh material from

1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:05.360
 the interior, you bring down material that's up on the surface, and that can kind of refresh your

1:02:05.360 --> 1:02:10.880
 nutrient supply in a sense, or the sort of raw materials that the surface has to work with.

1:02:11.760 --> 1:02:19.760
 So from a kind of astrobiologist perspective, looking at Earth, you would see that recycling of

1:02:19.760 --> 1:02:24.880
 material because the plate tectonics, you would also see how much oxygen is in Earth's atmosphere.

1:02:24.880 --> 1:02:30.800
 And between those two things, you would identify Earth as a reasonable candidate for a habitable

1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:35.760
 environment, in addition to, of course, the, you know, pleasant temperature and liquid water.

1:02:36.960 --> 1:02:41.360
 But the abundance of oxygen and the, the plate tectonics both play a role as well.

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.640
 And also see like tiny dots, satellites flying around.

1:02:44.640 --> 1:02:45.840
 Well, sure, yes.

1:02:46.560 --> 1:02:51.680
 I wonder if they would be able to, I really think about that, like if they, if aliens were to visit,

1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:56.640
 and would they really see humans as the thing they should be focusing on?

1:02:57.840 --> 1:03:00.400
 I think it would take a while, right?

1:03:00.960 --> 1:03:05.920
 Because it's so obvious that that should, because there's like so much incredible,

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:09.280
 in terms of biomass, humans are a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:10.800
 There's like ants.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.800
 They would probably detect ants, right?

1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:16.960
 Or they probably would focus on the water and the fish.

1:03:16.960 --> 1:03:21.680
 Because there's like a lot of what, I don't, I was surprised to learn that there's more species

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:23.360
 on land than there is in the sea.

1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:28.240
 Like there's 90, I think 90 to 95% of the species are on land.

1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:29.280
 Or on land?

1:03:29.280 --> 1:03:30.400
 Not in the sea.

1:03:30.400 --> 1:03:31.360
 Not in the sea.

1:03:31.360 --> 1:03:37.120
 I thought like there's so much going on in the sea, but no, the, the variety that like the

1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:42.080
 branches created by evolution, apparently, it's probably a good answer from an evolutionary

1:03:42.080 --> 1:03:45.600
 biology perspective, why land created so much diversity, but it did.

1:03:45.600 --> 1:03:52.960
 So like the sea, there's so much not known about the sea, about the oceans, but it's not,

1:03:54.320 --> 1:03:56.720
 it's not diversity friendly, what can I say?

1:03:56.720 --> 1:03:59.680
 It needs to, it needs to improve its diversity.

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:00.480
 Looking at the sea.

1:04:00.480 --> 1:04:01.600
 Do you think the aliens would come?

1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:05.600
 I mean, the first thing they would see is, I suppose, are cities, assuming that they had some

1:04:05.600 --> 1:04:11.600
 idea of what a natural world looked like, they would see cities and say these don't belong.

1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:15.840
 Which of these many species created these?

1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:20.080
 Yeah, I mean, there's, I, if I were to guess, it would, it's a good question.

1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:26.640
 I don't know if you do this when you look at the telescope, whether you look at geometric

1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:35.120
 shapes, like if it's good, because to me, like hard corners, like what do we think is engineered?

1:04:35.120 --> 1:04:39.840
 Things that are like, have kind of straight lines and corners and so on, they would probably

1:04:39.840 --> 1:04:44.720
 detect those in terms of buildings would stand out to them, because that's, that goes against

1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:48.160
 the basic natural physics of the world.

1:04:49.040 --> 1:04:55.600
 But I don't know if the electricity and lights and so on, it could be, I honestly, it could be

1:04:55.600 --> 1:05:02.320
 the plate tectonics, it could be like, that, the like the volcanoes, that'd be, okay, that's

1:05:02.320 --> 1:05:06.960
 a source of heat, and then they would focus, they might literally, I mean, depending on how

1:05:06.960 --> 1:05:13.200
 alien life forms are, they might notice the microorganisms before they notice the big,

1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:18.960
 like notice the and before the elephant, because like, there's a lot more of them,

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:24.160
 depending what they're measuring device, we think like size matters, but maybe with

1:05:24.160 --> 1:05:29.200
 their tools of measurement, they would look for quantity versus size.

1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:34.720
 Like why focus on the big thing, focus on the thing that there's a lot of, and when they see

1:05:34.720 --> 1:05:39.120
 humans, depending on their measurement devices, they might see, we're made up of billions of

1:05:39.120 --> 1:05:45.040
 organisms, like the fact that we have, we're very human set, we think we're one organism,

1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:46.720
 but that may not be the case.

1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:52.560
 They might see, in fact, they might also see like a human city, as one organism.

1:05:52.560 --> 1:06:00.480
 Like, what is this thing that like, clearly, this organism gets aroused at night, because

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:06.480
 the lights go on, and then, and then it like, it sleeps during the day.

1:06:07.760 --> 1:06:11.360
 I don't know, like, the what perspective you take on the city.

1:06:12.880 --> 1:06:17.360
 Is there something interesting about earth or other planets in terms of weather patterns?

1:06:17.360 --> 1:06:20.560
 So we talked a lot about, what is the reason for that?

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:25.280
 So we talked a lot about volcanic patterns.

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:32.800
 Is there something else about weather that's interesting, like storms, or variations in

1:06:32.800 --> 1:06:35.120
 temperature, all those kinds of things?

1:06:37.920 --> 1:06:43.840
 Yeah, so there's sort of, every planet and moon has a kind of interesting and unique

1:06:43.840 --> 1:06:50.480
 weather pattern, and those weather patterns are really, we don't have a good understanding of

1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:56.960
 them. We don't even have a good understanding of the global circulation patterns of many of these

1:06:57.760 --> 1:07:00.320
 atmospheres, why the storm systems occur.

1:07:00.320 --> 1:07:09.200
 So the composition and occurrence of storms and clouds and these objects is another one of these

1:07:09.200 --> 1:07:13.440
 kind of windows into the interior that I was talking about with surfaces.

1:07:13.440 --> 1:07:18.640
 One of these ways that we can get perspective and what the composition is at the interior and

1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:20.080
 how the circulation is working.

1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:27.120
 So circulation will bring some species up from deeper in the atmosphere of the planet to some

1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:31.440
 altitude that's a little bit colder, and that species will condense out and form a cloud at that

1:07:31.440 --> 1:07:36.960
 altitude, and we can detect, in some cases, what those clouds are composed of.

1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:46.960
 And looking at where those occur can tell you how the circulation cells are, whether the atmospheric

1:07:46.960 --> 1:07:51.520
 circulation is, say, coming up at the equator and going down at the poles, or whether you have

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:58.000
 multiple cells in the atmosphere. And I mean, Jupiter's atmosphere is just insane. There's

1:07:58.000 --> 1:08:02.400
 so much going on. You look at these pictures and there's all these vortices and anti vortices,

1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:08.560
 and you have these different bands that are moving in opposite directions that may be giving you

1:08:08.560 --> 1:08:19.840
 information about the deep in the atmosphere, physically deep properties of Jupiter's interior

1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:21.120
 and circulation.

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:26.800
 What are these vortices? What's the basic material of the storms?

1:08:26.800 --> 1:08:33.360
 It's condensed molecules from the atmosphere, so ammonia ice particles. In the case of Jupiter,

1:08:33.360 --> 1:08:38.480
 it's methane ice, in the case of, let's say, Uranus and Neptune, and other species. You can

1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:44.080
 kind of construct a chemical model for which species can condense where, and so you see a cloud at a

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:48.880
 certain altitude within the atmosphere, and you can make a guess at what that cloud is made of,

1:08:48.880 --> 1:08:53.360
 and sometimes measure it directly, and different species make different colors as well.

1:08:53.360 --> 1:09:01.200
 Oh, cool. Ice storms. Okay. I mean, the climate of Uranus has always been fascinating to me because

1:09:01.200 --> 1:09:08.640
 it orbits on its side, and it has a 42 year orbital period. And so, you know, with Earth,

1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:13.200
 our seasons are because our equator is tipped just a little bit to the plane that we orbit in. So

1:09:13.200 --> 1:09:16.400
 sometimes the sunlight's a little bit above the equator, and sometimes it's a little bit below

1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:22.720
 the equator. But on Uranus, it's like for 10 years, the sunlight is directly on the North Pole,

1:09:22.720 --> 1:09:28.320
 and then it's directly on the equator, and then it's directly on the South Pole. And it's actually

1:09:28.320 --> 1:09:34.160
 kind of amazing that the atmosphere doesn't look crazier than it does. But understanding how,

1:09:34.720 --> 1:09:40.160
 taking, again, like one of these extreme examples, if we can understand why that atmosphere behaves

1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:45.600
 in the way it does, it's kind of a test of our understanding of how atmosphere is.

1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:52.960
 So like heats up one side of the planet for 10 years, and then freezes it the next,

1:09:53.840 --> 1:10:01.600
 like, and that you're saying should probably lead to some chaos. And it doesn't.

1:10:01.600 --> 1:10:05.600
 The fact that it doesn't tells you something about the atmosphere. So atmospheres have a

1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:09.680
 property that surfaces don't have, which is that they can redistribute heat a lot more effectively.

1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:14.720
 Right. So they're a stabilizing, like self regulating aspect to them,

1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:21.920
 that they're able to deal with extreme conditions. But predicting how that complex system

1:10:23.280 --> 1:10:28.400
 unrolls is very difficult, as we know, about predicting the weather on Earth even.

1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:31.280
 Oh my goodness. Even with a little variation we have on Earth.

1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:35.280
 You know, people have tried to put together global circulation models. You know, we've

1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:39.920
 done this for Earth. People have tried to do these for other planets as well. And it is a really hard

1:10:39.920 --> 1:10:45.840
 problem. So Titan, for example, like I said, it's one of the best studied atmospheres in the solar

1:10:45.840 --> 1:10:50.800
 system. And people have tried to make these global circulation models and actually predict what's

1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:55.840
 going to happen moving into sort of the next season of Titan. And those predictions have

1:10:55.840 --> 1:11:00.400
 ended up being wrong. And so then, you know, I don't know, it's always exciting when a prediction

1:11:00.400 --> 1:11:05.040
 is wrong, because it means that there's something more to learn, like your theory wasn't sufficient.

1:11:05.760 --> 1:11:09.760
 And then you get to go back and learn something by how you have to modify the theory to make it

1:11:09.760 --> 1:11:16.000
 fit. I'm excited by the possibility of one day there'll be for various moons and planets, there'll

1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:23.200
 be like news programs reporting the weather with the fake confidence of like as if you can predict

1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:30.640
 the weather. We talked quite a bit about planets and moons. Can we talk a little bit about asteroids?

1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:35.840
 For sure. What is, what's an asteroid and what kind of asteroids are there?

1:11:35.840 --> 1:11:42.160
 So the asteroids, let's talk about just the restricted to the main asteroid belt, which is the

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:54.960
 region, it's a region of debris basically between Mars and Jupiter. And the, these sort of belts of

1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:59.440
 debris throughout the solar system, the outer solar system, you know, the Kuiper belt that we

1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:03.600
 talked about the asteroid belt, as well as certain other populations where they accumulate,

1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:10.720
 because they're gravitationally more favored, are remnant objects from the origin of the

1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:16.960
 solar system. And so one of the reasons that we are so interested in them, aside from potentially

1:12:16.960 --> 1:12:26.880
 the fact that they could come hit earth, but scientifically, it's, it gives us a window into

1:12:26.880 --> 1:12:34.240
 understanding the composition of the material from which earth and the other planets formed,

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:39.760
 and how that material was kind of redistributed over the, the history of the solar system.

1:12:39.760 --> 1:12:45.840
 So the asteroids, one could classify them in two different ways. Some of them are ancient objects,

1:12:45.840 --> 1:12:54.720
 so they accreted out of the, the sort of disk of material that the whole solar system formed out

1:12:54.720 --> 1:13:03.840
 of, and have kind of remained ever since more or less the same. They've probably collided with each

1:13:03.840 --> 1:13:10.160
 other, and we see all these collisional fragments. And you can actually look and, based on their

1:13:10.160 --> 1:13:16.720
 orbits, say, you know, like these 50 objects originated as the same object, you can see them

1:13:16.720 --> 1:13:23.840
 kind of dynamically moving apart after some big collision. And so some of them are these ancient

1:13:23.840 --> 1:13:28.240
 objects maybe that have undergone collisions. And then there's this other category of object that

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:34.640
 is the one that I personally find really interesting, which is remnants of objects

1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:43.680
 that could have been planets. So early on, a bunch of potential planets accreted that we call

1:13:43.680 --> 1:13:48.000
 planetesimals, and they formed, and they formed with a lot of energy, and they had enough time to

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:52.400
 actually differentiate. So some of these objects differentiated into cores and mantles and crusts.

1:13:52.400 --> 1:14:01.120
 And then they were subsequently disrupted in these massive collisions. And they, now we have

1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:06.560
 these fragments. We think fragments floating around the asteroid belt that are like bits of mantle,

1:14:06.560 --> 1:14:12.320
 bits of core, bits of crust, basically. So it's like puzzle pieces that you might be able to stitch

1:14:12.320 --> 1:14:20.080
 together. Or I guess it's all, it's all mixed up. So you can't stitch together the original planet

1:14:20.080 --> 1:14:27.200
 candidates. Or is that possible to try to see if they kind of, I mean, there's too many, there's

1:14:27.200 --> 1:14:32.320
 too many objects in there. I think that there are cases where people have, have kind of looked at

1:14:32.320 --> 1:14:36.800
 objects. And by looking at their orbits, they say these objects should have originated together,

1:14:36.800 --> 1:14:42.560
 but they have very different compositions. And so then you can hypothesize maybe they were different

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:47.040
 fragments of differentiated objects. But one of the really cool things about this is, you know,

1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:54.800
 we've been talking about getting clues into the interiors of planets. We've never seen a planetary

1:14:54.800 --> 1:15:00.080
 core or deep mantle directly. Some mantle material comes up on our surface and then we can see it.

1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:06.560
 But, you know, in sort of in bulk, we haven't seen these things directly. And these asteroids

1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:12.960
 potentially give us a chance to like look at what our own core and mantle is like, or at least

1:15:12.960 --> 1:15:17.760
 would be like if it had been also floating through space for a few billion years and getting

1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:24.880
 irradiated and all that. But it's, it's a cool potential window or like analogy into the interior

1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:31.600
 of our own planet. Well, how do you begin studying some of these asteroids? What, if you were to put

1:15:31.600 --> 1:15:36.160
 together a study, like what are the interesting questions to ask that are a little bit more

1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:42.640
 specific? Do you find a favorite asteroid that could be tracked and try to try to track it

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:51.600
 through telescopes? Or do you, is it has to be, you have to land on those things to study it?

1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:58.240
 So when it comes to the asteroids, there's so many of them. And the big pictures or the big

1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:08.720
 questions are answered. So some questions can be answered by zooming in in detail on individual

1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:12.880
 objects, but mostly you're trying to do a statistical study. So you want to look at

1:16:14.320 --> 1:16:20.080
 thousands of objects, even hundreds of thousands of objects, and figure out what their composition

1:16:20.800 --> 1:16:27.440
 is and look at, you know, how many big asteroids there are of this composition versus how many

1:16:27.440 --> 1:16:32.800
 small asteroids of this other composition and put together these kind of statistical properties of

1:16:32.800 --> 1:16:38.960
 the asteroid belt. And those properties can be directly compared with the results of simulations

1:16:38.960 --> 1:16:44.960
 for the formation of the solar system. What do we know about the surfaces of asteroids or the

1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:54.800
 contents of the insides of asteroids? And what are still open questions? So I would say that we don't

1:16:54.800 --> 1:17:03.440
 know a whole lot about their compositions. Most of them are small. And so you can't study them

1:17:03.440 --> 1:17:09.840
 in such detail with telescopes as you could, you know, a planet or moon. And at the same time,

1:17:09.840 --> 1:17:15.760
 because there are so many of them, you could send a spacecraft to a few. But you can't really like

1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:22.320
 get a statistical survey with spacecraft. And so a lot of what we, a lot of what has been done

1:17:22.320 --> 1:17:28.720
 comes down to sort of classification. You look at how bright they are, you look at whether they're

1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:33.920
 red or blue, simply, you know, whether their spectrum is sloped towards long wavelengths or

1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:40.880
 short wavelengths. There are certain, if you point a spectrograph at their surfaces, there are

1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:44.400
 certain features you can see. So you can tell that some of them have silicates on them.

1:17:46.320 --> 1:17:51.280
 And but these are the sort of, they're pretty basic questions. We're still trying to classify

1:17:51.280 --> 1:17:57.600
 them based on fairly basic information in kind of combination with our general understanding of

1:17:57.600 --> 1:18:01.680
 the material the solar system formed from. And so you're sort of, you come, you're coming in with

1:18:01.680 --> 1:18:05.600
 prior knowledge, which is that you more or less know what the materials are the solar system formed

1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:12.080
 from. And then you're trying to classify them into these categories. There's still a huge amount of

1:18:12.080 --> 1:18:18.320
 room for, for understanding them better. And for understanding how their surfaces are changing

1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:25.920
 in the space environment. Is it hard to land on an asteroid? Is this, is this a dumb question?

1:18:25.920 --> 1:18:36.480
 It feels like it would be quite difficult to actually operate a spacecraft in such a dense

1:18:36.480 --> 1:18:43.440
 field of debris. Oh, the asteroid belt, there's a ton of material there, but it's actually not

1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:49.600
 that dense. It is mostly open space. So, so mentally do picture like mostly open space with,

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:55.520
 with some rocks. The problem is some of them are not thought to be solid. So some of these asteroids,

1:18:55.520 --> 1:19:00.400
 especially these, these core mantle fragments, you can think of as sort of solid like a planet.

1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:06.720
 But some of them are just kind of aggregates of material, we call them rubble piles. And so

1:19:06.720 --> 1:19:14.560
 there's not necessarily. Might look like a rock. But do a lot of them have kind of clouds around

1:19:14.560 --> 1:19:20.800
 them, like a dust cloud thing? Or like, do you know what you're stepping on when you try to land on

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:27.520
 it? Like what, what are we supposed to be visualizing here? There's like very few of water,

1:19:27.520 --> 1:19:32.640
 right? There's some water in the outer part of the asteroid belt, but they're not quite like

1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:39.200
 comets. Okay. In the, in the sense of having clouds around them, there are some crazy asteroids

1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:43.840
 that do become active like comets. That's the whole other category of thing that we don't

1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:49.840
 understand. But their surfaces, I mean, we have visited some, you can, you know, find pictures

1:19:49.840 --> 1:19:53.840
 that spacecraft have taken of them. We've actually scooped up material off of the surface of some

1:19:53.840 --> 1:19:59.520
 of these objects. We're bringing it back to analyze it in the lab. And there's a mission

1:19:59.520 --> 1:20:06.400
 that's launching next year to land on one of these supposedly core fragment objects to try to

1:20:06.400 --> 1:20:12.080
 figure out what the heck it is and what's going on with it. But the surfaces, you know, they're,

1:20:12.080 --> 1:20:19.040
 they're, you can picture a solid surface with some little grains of sand or pebbles on it

1:20:19.040 --> 1:20:26.080
 and occasional boulders, maybe some fine dusty regions, dust kind of collecting in certain places.

1:20:26.080 --> 1:20:33.760
 But is there this, do you worry about this? Is there any chance that one of these

1:20:34.800 --> 1:20:43.120
 fellows destroys all of human civilization by an asteroid kind of colliding with something,

1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:49.120
 changing its trajectory and heading its way towards Earth? That is definitely possible.

1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:54.000
 And it doesn't even have to necessarily collide with something and change its trajectory.

1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:58.480
 We're not tracking all of them. We can't track all of them yet. You know, there's still

1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:04.880
 a lot of them. People are, people are tracking a lot of them and we are doing our best to track

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:09.200
 more of them. But there are a lot of them out there and it would be potentially catastrophic

1:21:09.200 --> 1:21:16.800
 if one of them impacted Earth. Have you, are you aware of this Apophis object?

1:21:16.800 --> 1:21:22.640
 So there's an asteroid near Earth objects called Apophis that people thought had a

1:21:22.640 --> 1:21:29.040
 decent probability of hitting Earth in 2029 and then potentially again in 2036. So they did a

1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:34.960
 lot of studies. It's not actually going to hit Earth, but it is going to come very close. It's

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:40.880
 going to be visible in the sky in a relatively dark, I mean, not even that dark, probably not

1:21:40.880 --> 1:21:51.200
 visible from Los Angeles, but, and it's going to come a tenth of the way between the Earth and the

1:21:51.200 --> 1:21:55.520
 Moon. It's going to come closer apparently than some geosynchronous communication satellites.

1:21:56.080 --> 1:21:56.720
 Oh, wow.

1:21:56.720 --> 1:22:02.640
 So that is a close call, but people have studied it and then apparently are very confident it's

1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:04.160
 not actually going to hit us, but it wasn't.

1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:09.360
 I'm going to have to look into this because I'm very sure, I'm very sure what's going to happen

1:22:09.360 --> 1:22:16.800
 if an asteroid actually hits Earth, that the scientific community and government

1:22:16.800 --> 1:22:25.120
 will confidently say that we have nothing to worry about, it's going to be a close call.

1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:29.200
 And then last minute, they'll be like, there was a miscalculation.

1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:34.880
 They're not lying. It's just like the space of possibilities because it's very difficult to

1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:40.240
 track these kinds of things. And there's a lot of kind of, there's complexities involved to this.

1:22:40.240 --> 1:22:47.360
 There's a lot of uncertainties that just something tells me that human civilization will end with,

1:22:47.360 --> 1:22:54.080
 we'll see it coming. And then last minute there'll be a oops, like we'll see it coming and we'll

1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:58.960
 be like, no, it's just, it's just threatening, but no problem, no problem. And last minute it'll

1:22:58.960 --> 1:23:03.360
 be like, oops, there was a miscalculation and then it's all over in a matter of like a week.

1:23:03.360 --> 1:23:12.000
 But we're just very positive and optimistic today. Is there any chance that Bruce Willis

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:18.320
 can save us in the sense that from what you know about asteroids, is there something that

1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:27.520
 you can catch them early enough to change volcanic eruptions, right?

1:23:27.520 --> 1:23:34.960
 Sort of drill, put a nuclear weapon inside and break up the asteroid or change its trajectory?

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:45.520
 There is potential for that if you catch it early enough in advance. I think in theory if you knew

1:23:47.440 --> 1:23:48.640
 five years in advance,

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:56.480
 depending on the objects and how close with how much you would need to deflect it,

1:23:57.600 --> 1:24:03.680
 you could deflect it a little bit. I don't know that it would be sufficient in all cases.

1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:10.080
 And this is definitely not my specific area of expertise, but my understanding is that

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:16.080
 there is something you could do. But it also how you would carry that out depends a lot on

1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:20.800
 the properties of the asteroid. If it's a solid object versus a rubble pile, so let's say you

1:24:20.800 --> 1:24:27.760
 planted some bomb in the middle of it and it blew up, but it was just kind of a pile of

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:32.000
 material anyway, and then that material comes back together and then you kind of just have the same

1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:38.880
 thing. Presumably its trajectory would be altered, but it's... It's like Terminator 2 when it's like

1:24:38.880 --> 1:24:43.120
 the thing that just like you shoot it and it splashes and then comes back together. It would

1:24:43.120 --> 1:24:50.240
 be very useless. That's fascinating. And but what's fascinating, I've gotten a lot of hope

1:24:51.600 --> 1:25:00.080
 from watching SpaceX rockets that land. There's so much... It's like, oh wow, from an AI perspective,

1:25:00.080 --> 1:25:07.120
 from a robotics perspective, wow, we can do a hell of an amazing job with control.

1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:15.040
 And but then we have an understanding about surfaces here on Earth. We can map up a lot

1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:21.680
 of things. I wonder if we can do that some kind of detail of being able to have that same level

1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:29.440
 of precision in landing on surfaces with as wide of a variety as asteroids have. So be able to

1:25:29.440 --> 1:25:35.920
 understand the exact properties of the surface and be able to encode that into whatever rocket

1:25:35.920 --> 1:25:43.360
 that lands. Sufficiently to... I presume humans, unlike the movies, humans would likely get in

1:25:43.360 --> 1:25:53.040
 the way. Like it should all be done by robots. Like land, drill, place the explosive, that should

1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:58.640
 all be done through control through robots. And then you should be able to dynamically adjust to

1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:05.360
 the surface. The flip side of that for a robotics person, I don't know if you've seen these. It's

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:12.720
 been very heartbreaking. Somebody, I know well, Russ Tedrick at MIT led the DARPA Robotics Challenge

1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:17.680
 team for the Humanoid Robot Challenge. For DARPA, I don't know if you've seen videos of robots on

1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:23.600
 two feet falling. But you're talking about millions, several years of work with some of the most

1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:28.720
 brilliant roboticists in the world, millions of dollars. And the final thing is a highlight video

1:26:28.720 --> 1:26:34.080
 on YouTube of robots falling. But they had a lot of trouble with uneven surfaces. That's basically

1:26:34.080 --> 1:26:40.000
 what you have to do with the challenge involves you're mostly autonomous with some partial human

1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:45.440
 communication. But that human communication is broken up. Like you don't get a, you get a noisy

1:26:45.440 --> 1:26:51.760
 channel. So you can, humans can, which is very similar to what it would be like in humans remotely

1:26:51.760 --> 1:26:58.160
 operating a thing on an asteroid. And so with that, robots really struggle. There's some hilarious,

1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:03.840
 painful videos of like a robot not able to like open the door. And then it tries to open the door

1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:11.280
 without like, it misses the handle and in doing so like falls. I mean, it's, it's painful to watch.

1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:17.840
 So like that there's that. And then there's SpaceX. So I have hope from SpaceX. And then I have less

1:27:17.840 --> 1:27:24.480
 hope from by Peter Robotics. But it's fun. It's fun to kind of imagine. And I think the planetary

1:27:24.480 --> 1:27:28.800
 side of it comes into play and understanding the surfaces of these asteroids more and more.

1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:34.960
 That, you know, forget sort of destruction of the human civilization. It'd be cool to have like

1:27:34.960 --> 1:27:40.640
 spacecraft just landing on all these asteroids to study them at scale. And being able to figure

1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:48.160
 out dynamically what, you know, whether it's a rubble pile or whether it's a solid objects.

1:27:48.160 --> 1:27:54.240
 Like, do you see that kind of future of science, maybe 100, 200, 300 years from now, where there's just

1:27:54.880 --> 1:28:01.200
 robots expanding out through the solar system, like sensors, essentially, some of it taking

1:28:01.200 --> 1:28:05.200
 pictures from a distance, some of them landing, just exploring and giving us data. Because it

1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:13.920
 feels like we're working with very little data right now. Sure, I, I do see exploration going

1:28:13.920 --> 1:28:23.520
 that way. I think the way that NASA is currently, or historically has been doing missions is putting

1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:28.720
 together these, these really large missions that do a lot of things and are extremely well tested

1:28:28.720 --> 1:28:36.880
 and have a very low rate of failure. But now that these sort of CubeSat technologies are becoming

1:28:37.440 --> 1:28:42.640
 easier to build, easier to launch, they're very cheap. And, you know, NASA is getting

1:28:42.640 --> 1:28:47.440
 involved in this as well. There's, there's a lot of interest in these missions that are

1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:52.240
 relatively small, relatively cheap, and just do one thing. So you can really optimize it to,

1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:56.400
 to just do this one thing. And maybe you could build 100 of them and send them to different

1:28:56.400 --> 1:29:00.160
 asteroids. And they would just collect this one piece of information from each asteroid.

1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:07.680
 It's a kind of different, more distributed way of doing science, I guess. And there's a ton of

1:29:07.680 --> 1:29:15.600
 potential there. I agree. Let me ask you about objects or one particular object from outside

1:29:15.600 --> 1:29:21.200
 our solar system. We don't get to study many of these, right? They don't, we don't get stuff that

1:29:21.200 --> 1:29:26.640
 just flies in out of nowhere from outside the solar system and flies through. Apparently there's been

1:29:26.640 --> 1:29:36.240
 two recently in the past few years. One of them is Amua Moa. What are your thoughts about Amua Moa?

1:29:36.240 --> 1:29:42.800
 So fun to say. Could it, could it be space junk from a distant alien civilization,

1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:52.080
 or is it just a weird shaped comet? I like the way that's phrased. So Amua Moa is,

1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:56.560
 is a fascinating object. Just the fact that we have started discovering things that are coming

1:29:56.560 --> 1:30:02.480
 in from outside our solar system is amazing and can, can start to study them. And now that we have

1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:11.120
 seen some, we can design now kind of thinking in advance. The next time we see one, we will be much

1:30:11.120 --> 1:30:15.040
 more ready for it. We will know which telescopes we want to point at it. We will have explored

1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:20.800
 whether we could even launch a fast turnaround mission to actually like get to it before it leaves

1:30:20.800 --> 1:30:28.720
 the solar system. In terms of Amua Moa, yeah, it's for an object in our solar system, it's really

1:30:28.720 --> 1:30:36.880
 unusual in two particular ways. One is the dimensions that we don't see natural things

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:41.280
 in our solar system that are kind of long and skinny. We see the things we see in our solar

1:30:41.280 --> 1:30:48.320
 system don't deviate from spherical by that much. And then that it showed these strange properties

1:30:48.320 --> 1:30:52.320
 of accelerating as it was leaving the solar system, which was not understood at first.

1:30:52.320 --> 1:31:03.040
 So, in terms of the alien space junk, you know, as a scientist, I cannot rule out that possibility.

1:31:03.040 --> 1:31:09.360
 I have no evidence to the contrary. However, see, you're saying there's a chance.

1:31:10.480 --> 1:31:17.280
 I cannot, I cannot as a scientist honestly say that I can rule out that it's alien space junk.

1:31:17.280 --> 1:31:27.360
 However, I see the kind of alien explanation as following this, the Sagan's extraordinary claims

1:31:27.360 --> 1:31:33.280
 require extraordinary evidence. If you are going to actually claim that something is aliens,

1:31:34.960 --> 1:31:39.840
 you need to carefully evaluate, one needs to carefully evaluate the other options

1:31:39.840 --> 1:31:45.520
 and see whether it could just be something that we know exists that makes sense. In the case of

1:31:45.520 --> 1:31:54.240
 Amua Mua, there are explanations that fit well within our understanding of how things work.

1:31:54.240 --> 1:32:00.720
 So, there are a couple, there are two hypotheses for what it could be made of. They're both basically

1:32:00.720 --> 1:32:05.440
 just ice shards. In one case, it's a nitrogen ice shard that came off of something like Pluto

1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:10.800
 in another solar system. That Pluto got hit with something and broke up into pieces and one of

1:32:10.800 --> 1:32:17.840
 those pieces came through our solar system. In the other scenario, it's a bit of a failed solar

1:32:17.840 --> 1:32:24.960
 system. So, our solar system formed out of a collapsing molecular cloud. Sometimes those

1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:30.320
 molecular clouds are not massive enough and they sort of collapse into bits, but they don't actually

1:32:30.320 --> 1:32:34.320
 form a solar system, but you end up with these kind of chunks of hydrogen ice, apparently.

1:32:34.880 --> 1:32:38.960
 And so, one of those chunks of hydrogen ice could have got ejected and passed through our

1:32:38.960 --> 1:32:46.720
 solar system. So, both cases explain these properties in about the same way. So, those

1:32:46.720 --> 1:32:51.360
 ices will sublimate once they've passed the sun. And so, as they're moving away from the sun, you

1:32:51.360 --> 1:32:56.480
 have the hydrogen or nitrogen ice sublimating off the sunward part of it. And so, that is

1:32:56.480 --> 1:33:02.640
 responsible for the acceleration. The shape also, because you have all this ice sublimating off the

1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:10.960
 surface, if you take something, the analogy that works pretty well here is for a bar of soap.

1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:16.160
 Your bar of soap starts out sort of close to spherical, at least from a physicist's perspective.

1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:22.080
 And as you use it over time, you eventually end up with this long, thin shard, because it's been

1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:29.920
 just by sort of weathering, as we would call it. And so, in the same way, if you just sublimate

1:33:29.920 --> 1:33:35.600
 material off of one of these ice shards, it ends up long and thin, and it ends up accelerating

1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:39.840
 out of the solar system. And so, given that these properties can be reasonably well explained that

1:33:39.840 --> 1:33:48.080
 way, you know, we should be extremely skeptical about attributing things to aliens.

1:33:48.800 --> 1:33:54.560
 See, the reason I like to think that it's aliens is because it puts a lot of priority on us not

1:33:54.560 --> 1:34:00.880
 being lazy, and we need to catch this thing next time it comes around. I like the idea that there

1:34:00.880 --> 1:34:07.440
 are objects, not like, it almost saddens me. They come out of the darkness really fast,

1:34:07.440 --> 1:34:13.200
 and just fly by and go and leave. It just seems like a wasted opportunity not to study them.

1:34:14.240 --> 1:34:21.440
 It's like, it's the easiest way to do space travel outside of the solar system,

1:34:21.440 --> 1:34:25.280
 is having the things come to us. I like that way of putting it.

1:34:25.280 --> 1:34:30.960
 And it would be nice to just land on it. And first of all, really importantly,

1:34:30.960 --> 1:34:41.120
 detect it early, and then land on it with a really nice spacecraft, and study the hell out of it.

1:34:41.120 --> 1:34:54.480
 And, you know, if there's a chance it's aliens, alien life, it just feels like such a cheap

1:34:55.280 --> 1:35:02.240
 way, inexpensive way, to get information about alien life or something interesting that's out

1:35:02.240 --> 1:35:08.000
 there. And I'm not sure if an ice shard from another planetary system will be interesting,

1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:11.920
 but it very well could be. It could be totally new sets of materials. It could be,

1:35:11.920 --> 1:35:17.440
 tell us about composition of planets we don't quite understand. And it's just a nice one,

1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:21.280
 especially in the case of a more and more, I guess it was pretty close to Earth. It would have been

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:28.960
 nice to, you know, let's say, don't go there, they come to us. I don't know. That's what makes me,

1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.240
 that's what makes me quite a sad. It's a missed opportunity.

1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:38.640
 Well, yeah, and whether you think it's aliens or not, it's a missed opportunity, but, you know,

1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:45.760
 we weren't prepared, and we will be prepared for the next ones. And as, so there's been a movement

1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:50.960
 in astronomy more towards what's called time domain astronomy, so kind of monitoring the whole

1:35:50.960 --> 1:35:56.160
 sky all the time at all wavelengths, that's kind of the goal. And so we expect to detect many more

1:35:56.160 --> 1:36:00.400
 of these in the future, even though these were the first two we saw, our potential to detect them

1:36:00.400 --> 1:36:06.480
 is only increasing with time. And so there will be more opportunities. And, you know, based on these

1:36:06.480 --> 1:36:11.680
 two, we now can actually sit and think about what we'll do when the next one shows up.

1:36:11.680 --> 1:36:17.680
 I also, what it made me realize, I know I didn't really think through this, but it made me realize

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:23.040
 if there is alien civilizations out there, the thing we're most likely to see first would be

1:36:23.040 --> 1:36:30.400
 space junk, my stupid understanding of it. And the second would be really dumb kind of,

1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:38.400
 you could think of maybe like relay nodes or something, objects that you need to have a whole

1:36:38.400 --> 1:36:45.600
 lot of for particular purposes of like space travel and so on, like speed limit signs or

1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:51.120
 something, I don't know, whatever we have on earth, a lot of that's dumb. It's not alien,

1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:56.400
 aliens and themselves, it's like artifacts that are useful to the engineering in the

1:36:56.400 --> 1:37:02.720
 systems that are engineered by alien civilizations. So like, it would, we would see a lot of stuff

1:37:03.680 --> 1:37:07.760
 in terms of setting, in terms of looking for alien life and trying to communicate with it,

1:37:07.760 --> 1:37:17.120
 maybe we should be looking not for like smart creatures or systems to communicate with,

1:37:17.120 --> 1:37:23.120
 maybe we should be looking for artifacts or even as dumb as like space junk.

1:37:23.760 --> 1:37:28.800
 It just kind of reframed my perspective of like, what are we looking for as science?

1:37:28.800 --> 1:37:34.480
 Because there could be a lot of stuff that doesn't have intelligence but gives us really strong signs

1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:41.920
 that there's somewhere is life or intelligent life. And yeah, that made me kind of, I know it

1:37:41.920 --> 1:37:47.840
 might be dumb to say, but reframe the kind of thing that we should be looking for. Yeah, it's,

1:37:48.400 --> 1:37:54.000
 so the benefit of looking for intelligent life is that we perhaps have a better chance of recognizing

1:37:54.000 --> 1:38:01.280
 it. Yeah, we couldn't necessarily recognize what an alien stop sign look like. That's true.

1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:05.760
 And maybe, you know, the theorists are the people who sort of model and try to understand

1:38:06.400 --> 1:38:10.320
 slow system objects are pretty good at coming up with models for anything. I mean,

1:38:10.320 --> 1:38:16.560
 it may be a mua mua was a stop sign, but we're clever enough that we could come up with some

1:38:16.560 --> 1:38:21.120
 physical explanations for it. And then, you know, we all want to go with the simplest possible,

1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:26.400
 we all want to believe the sort of most skeptical possible explanation. And so we missed it because

1:38:26.400 --> 1:38:30.800
 we're too good at coming up with alternate explanations for things. And it's such an

1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:36.080
 outlier, such a rare phenomena that we can't, we can't study, you know, 100 or 1000 of these

1:38:36.080 --> 1:38:42.160
 objects, we have to we had just one. And so the science almost destroys the possibility of

1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:47.520
 something special being there. It's like a Johnny I've this design of Apple, I don't know if you

1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:52.640
 know who that is, he's the lead designer, he's the person who designed the iPhone and all the major

1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:58.480
 things. And he talked about he's brilliant on my favorite humans on earth, and one of the best

1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:05.280
 designers in the history of earth. He talked about like when he had this origins of an idea,

1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:10.320
 like in his baby stages, he would not tell Steve Jobs, because Steve would usually like

1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:15.520
 trample all over it. He would say this is dumb idea. And so I sometimes think of the scientific

1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:23.600
 community in that sense, because the the weapon of the scientific method is so strong at its best,

1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:31.200
 that it sometimes crushes the out of the box outlier evidence. You know, we don't get a lot

1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:35.920
 of that evidence, because we don't have we're not lucky enough to have a lot of evidence. So we

1:39:35.920 --> 1:39:43.440
 have to deal with just special cases. And special cases could present an inkling of something much

1:39:43.440 --> 1:39:49.040
 bigger. But the scientific method user tramples all over and it's hard to know what to do with that,

1:39:49.040 --> 1:39:54.080
 because the scientific method works. But at the same time, every once in a while, it's like a

1:39:54.080 --> 1:40:00.320
 balance. You have to do 99% of the time you have to do like scientific rigor. But every once in a

1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:06.400
 while, this is not you saying me saying smoke some weed and sit back and think, I wonder,

1:40:07.280 --> 1:40:13.200
 you know, it's the Joe Rogan thing, it's entirely possible that it's alien space junk.

1:40:14.320 --> 1:40:22.320
 Anyway, yeah, I think so I completely agree. And I think that most scientists do speculate

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:29.520
 about these things. It's just at what point do you act on those things? So you're right that

1:40:29.520 --> 1:40:35.360
 the scientific method has inherent skepticism. And for the most part, that's a good thing,

1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:44.240
 because it means that we're not just believing crazy things all the time. But it's an interesting

1:40:44.240 --> 1:40:51.040
 point that requiring that high level of rigor occasionally means that you will miss

1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:57.360
 something that is truly interesting, because you needed to verify it three times, and it

1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:01.280
 wasn't verifiable. I also think like when you communicate with the general public,

1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:09.600
 I think there's power in that 1% speculation of just demonstrating authenticity as a human

1:41:09.600 --> 1:41:17.600
 being as a curious human being. I think too often, I think this is changing, but I saw,

1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:23.200
 I've been quite disappointed, my colleagues throughout 2020 with the coronavirus, there's

1:41:23.200 --> 1:41:29.440
 too much speaking from authority, as opposed to speaking from curiosity. There's some of the most

1:41:29.440 --> 1:41:33.680
 incredible science has been done in 2020, especially on the virology biology side.

1:41:34.480 --> 1:41:41.280
 And the kind of being talked down to by scientists is always really disappointing to me,

1:41:41.280 --> 1:41:46.160
 as opposed to inspiring, like the things we there's a lot of uncertainty about the coronavirus.

1:41:46.720 --> 1:41:52.560
 But we know a lot of stuff. And we speak from scientists from various disciplines speak from

1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:58.320
 data in the face of that uncertainty. And we're curious, we don't know what the hell is going

1:41:58.320 --> 1:42:03.840
 on. We don't know if this virus is going to evolve, evolve, mutate. We don't know if this virus or the

1:42:03.840 --> 1:42:09.280
 next one might, you know, might destroy all human civilization. You can't speak with certain, in fact,

1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:16.480
 you know, I was on a survey paper about masks. Something I don't talk much about, because

1:42:16.480 --> 1:42:22.480
 I don't like politics. But we don't know if masks work. But there's a lot of evidence to show that

1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:26.960
 they work for this particular virus. The transmission of the virus is fascinating, actually. The

1:42:27.760 --> 1:42:35.440
 biomechanics of the way viruses spread is fascinating. If it wasn't destructive, it would be beautiful.

1:42:36.080 --> 1:42:41.920
 And we don't know, but it's inspiring to apply the scientific method to the best of our ability,

1:42:41.920 --> 1:42:47.280
 but also to show that you don't always know everything, and to perhaps not about the virus

1:42:47.280 --> 1:42:55.440
 as much, but about other things speculate. What if, you know, what if it's the worst case and the best

1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:00.320
 case? And because that's ultimately what we are, descendants of apes that are just curious about

1:43:00.320 --> 1:43:07.120
 the world around us. Yeah, I'll just add to that, not on the topic of masks, but on the topic of

1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:18.880
 curiosity. That's, I mean, I think that's astronomy and planetary sciences, a field are a little are

1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:27.040
 unique because for better and for worse, they don't directly impact humanity. So, you know,

1:43:27.040 --> 1:43:35.600
 we're not studying virology to prevent transmission of, you know, illness amongst humans. We're not

1:43:35.600 --> 1:43:42.880
 characterizing volcanoes on earth that could destroy cities. We, and it really is a more curious

1:43:42.880 --> 1:43:50.480
 and in my opinion, playful scientific field than many. So, for better and worse, we can kind of

1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:56.320
 afford to pursue some of the speculation more because human lives are not in danger if we

1:43:56.320 --> 1:44:04.000
 speculate a little bit too freely and get something wrong. Yeah, definitely. In the space of AI, I am

1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:12.000
 worried that we're sometimes too eager, speaking for myself to like flip the switch to on just to

1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:17.920
 see like what happens. Maybe sometimes we want to be a little bit careful about that because bad

1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:26.960
 things might happen. Is there books or movies in your life long ago or recently that were inspiring

1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:32.960
 and had an impact on you that you would recommend? Yeah, absolutely. So many that just don't know

1:44:32.960 --> 1:44:40.480
 where to start with it. So, I love reading. I read obsessively. I've been reading fiction and a little

1:44:40.480 --> 1:44:47.680
 bit of nonfiction, but mostly fiction obsessively since I was a child and just never stopped. So,

1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:53.680
 I have some favorite books. None of them are easy reading. So, I definitely, I mean, I recommend them

1:44:53.680 --> 1:45:01.760
 for somebody who likes an intellectual challenge in the books that they read. So, maybe I should

1:45:01.760 --> 1:45:09.280
 go chronologically. I have at least three. I'm not going to go through 50 here. Yeah, I'd love to

1:45:09.280 --> 1:45:16.640
 also like maybe ideas that you took away from what you mentioned. Yeah, yeah, why they were so

1:45:16.640 --> 1:45:24.800
 compelling to me. One of the first books that really captured my fascination was Nabokov's book

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:35.280
 Pale Fire. Are you familiar with it? So, I read it actually for a class. It's one of the few books

1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:44.400
 I've ever read for a class that I actually really liked. And the book is, it's in some sense a puzzle.

1:45:44.400 --> 1:45:52.480
 He's a brilliant writer, of course. But the book is like, it's formatted like a poem. So,

1:45:52.480 --> 1:45:59.920
 there's an introduction, a very long poem, and footnotes. And you get partway through it before

1:45:59.920 --> 1:46:05.360
 realizing that the whole thing is actually a novel unless you sort of read up on it going in. But

1:46:05.360 --> 1:46:11.600
 the whole thing is a novel and there's a story that slowly reveals itself over the course of all of

1:46:11.600 --> 1:46:22.720
 this and kind of reveals this just fascinating character, basically, and how his mind works in

1:46:22.720 --> 1:46:30.160
 this story. The idea of a novel also being a kind of intellectual puzzle and something that slowly

1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:35.280
 reveals itself over the course of reading was really fascinating to me. And I have since found a lot

1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:43.120
 more writers like that. You know, contemporary example that comes to mind is Kazuo Ishiguro,

1:46:43.120 --> 1:46:47.760
 who's pretty much all of his books are like slow reveals over the course of the book and like

1:46:47.760 --> 1:46:53.280
 nothing much happens in the books, but you keep reading them because you just want to know like

1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:59.600
 what the reality is that he's slowly revealing to you. The kind of discovery oriented reading,

1:46:59.600 --> 1:47:08.000
 maybe. What's the second one? Perhaps my favorite writer is Renier Maria Rilke.

1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:14.880
 Are you familiar with him? No, also not familiar. You're hitting ones, I mean, I know in the book

1:47:14.880 --> 1:47:20.880
 of Well, but I've never read Pale Fire. But Rilke, I've never, I know it's a very difficult read.

1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:25.680
 I know that much. Yeah, right. All of these are difficult reads. I think I just,

1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:34.000
 I read for in part for an intellectual challenge. But Rilke, so he wrote one thing that might be

1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:39.280
 characterizable as a novel, but he wrote a lot of poetry. I mean, he wrote this series of poems

1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:47.680
 called The Duino Elegies that were very impactful for me personally, just emotionally, which actually,

1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:57.040
 it kind of ties in with astronomy in that there's there's a sense, you know, in which we're all

1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:04.000
 going through our lives alone. And there's just this sense of kind of profound loneliness in the

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:14.880
 existence of every individual human. And I think I was drawn to astronomy in part because the sort

1:48:14.880 --> 1:48:21.760
 of vast spaces, the kind of loneliness and desolateness of space made the sort of internal

1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:30.480
 loneliness feel okay. In a sense, it like gave companionship. And that's how I feel about Rilke's

1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:38.320
 poetry. He turns the kind of desolation and loneliness of human existence into something

1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:44.960
 joyful and almost meaningful. Yeah, there's something about melancholy. I don't know about

1:48:44.960 --> 1:48:56.320
 Rilke in general, but like contemplating the melancholy nature of our of the human condition that

1:48:56.320 --> 1:49:04.320
 makes it okay. I got gentle from an engineering perspective, think that there is so much loneliness

1:49:04.320 --> 1:49:11.440
 we haven't explored within ourselves yet. And that's my hope is to build AI systems that help us

1:49:11.440 --> 1:49:19.440
 explore our own loneliness. I think that's kind of what love is. And friendship is somebody who in a

1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:27.280
 very small way helps us explore our own loneliness, like they listen, we connect like two lonely creatures,

1:49:27.280 --> 1:49:37.280
 connect for time. And it's like, oh, like acknowledge that we exist together, like for a brief time.

1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:43.600
 But in a somewhat shallow way, I think relative to how much it's possible to truly connect as two

1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:50.000
 consciousnesses. So AI might be able to help on that on that front. So what's the third one?

1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:54.480
 Actually, you know, I hadn't realized until this moment, but it's yet another one of these kind of

1:49:54.480 --> 1:50:03.200
 slow reveal books. It's a contemporary Russian, I think Russian American writer named Olga Grushin,

1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:10.480
 G R U S H I N. And she wrote this just phenomenal book called The Dream Life of Sukhanov that I

1:50:10.480 --> 1:50:16.320
 read this year, maybe it was last year for the first time. And it's just a really beautiful,

1:50:16.320 --> 1:50:24.160
 this one you could call a character study, I think, of a Russian father coming to terms with

1:50:24.160 --> 1:50:31.200
 himself and his own past, as he potentially slowly loses his mind.

1:50:31.200 --> 1:50:35.680
 Slow reveal. Slow reveal.

1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:40.080
 Well, that's apparent from the beginning. I hope I don't think it's a spoiler.

1:50:40.080 --> 1:50:47.360
 I don't think it's a spoiler. Decline into madness. Spoiler alert. So all of these are really heavy.

1:50:47.360 --> 1:50:51.520
 I don't know. I just, I don't have anything lighter to recommend. Ishii grows the light

1:50:51.520 --> 1:50:59.280
 version of this. Okay. Well, heavy has a certain kind of beauty to it in itself. Is there advice

1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:03.840
 you would give to a young person today that looks up to the stars and wonders what the heck they

1:51:03.840 --> 1:51:11.440
 want to do with their life? So career, science, life in general. You've for now chosen a certain

1:51:11.440 --> 1:51:18.480
 kind of path of curiosity. What insights do you draw from that that you can give us advice to others?

1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:27.840
 I think for somebody, I would not presume to speak to giving people advice on life and

1:51:27.840 --> 1:51:35.680
 humanity overall, but for somebody thinking of being a scientist. So there are a couple of things,

1:51:35.680 --> 1:51:42.320
 one sort of practical thing, which is career wise, I hadn't appreciated this going into science, but

1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:51.040
 you need to, so the questions you're working on and the techniques you use are both

1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:56.480
 of very high importance, maybe equal importance for being happy in your career.

1:51:56.480 --> 1:52:02.080
 If there are questions you're interested in, but the techniques that you need to use to do them

1:52:02.960 --> 1:52:08.400
 are tedious for you, then your job is going to be miserable, even if the questions are inspiring.

1:52:08.960 --> 1:52:14.640
 So you have to find, but if the techniques that you use are things that excite you,

1:52:14.640 --> 1:52:21.120
 then your job is fun every day. So for me, I'm fascinated by the solar system and I love telescopes

1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:25.040
 and I love doing data analysis, playing with data from telescopes, coming up with new ways to use

1:52:25.040 --> 1:52:30.640
 telescopes. And so that's where I have found that mesh. But if I was interested in the

1:52:30.640 --> 1:52:34.960
 dynamical evolution of the solar system, how the orbits of things evolve, then I would need to do

1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:39.360
 a different type of work that I would just not find as appealing and so it just wouldn't be a good

1:52:39.360 --> 1:52:44.960
 fit. And so it sort of seems like an unromantic thing to have to think about the techniques

1:52:44.960 --> 1:52:49.520
 being the thing you want to work on also, but it really makes a profound difference for,

1:52:49.520 --> 1:52:52.160
 I think, your happiness and your scientific career.

1:52:52.160 --> 1:52:56.960
 I think that's really profound. It's like the thing, the menial tasks. If you enjoy those,

1:52:56.960 --> 1:53:02.000
 that's a really good sign that that's the right path for you. I think David Foster Wallace said

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:09.760
 that the key to life is to be unboreable. So basically, everything should be exciting. I

1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:15.040
 don't think that's feasible, but you should find an area where everything is exciting,

1:53:15.040 --> 1:53:21.040
 I mean, depending on the day, but you can find the joy in everything, not just the big exciting

1:53:21.040 --> 1:53:28.720
 chronicle things that everyone thinks is exciting, but the details, the repetitive stuff, the

1:53:28.720 --> 1:53:32.800
 menial stuff, the stuff that takes years, the stuff that involves a lot of failure,

1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:36.880
 and all those kinds of things that you find that enjoyable. That's actually really profound to focus

1:53:36.880 --> 1:53:42.960
 on that. Because people talk about dreams and passion and goals and so on, the big thing,

1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:46.240
 but that's not actually what takes you there. It takes you there as every single day,

1:53:46.240 --> 1:53:52.640
 putting in the hours, and that's what actually makes up life is the boring bits. If the boring bits

1:53:52.640 --> 1:54:01.200
 aren't boring, then that's an exciting life. Because when you were talking so romantically

1:54:01.200 --> 1:54:09.040
 and passionately about IO, I remember the poem by Robert Frost. So let me read the poem and ask

1:54:09.040 --> 1:54:15.520
 what your opinion is. It's called Fire and Ice. Oh yeah, I could almost recite this from memory.

1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:20.880
 Some say the world will end in fire, some say in ice. From what I've tasted of desire,

1:54:20.880 --> 1:54:27.360
 I hold with those who favor fire. But if I had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate

1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:33.920
 to say that for destruction, ice is also great and with suffice. So let me ask,

1:54:33.920 --> 1:54:42.560
 if you had to only choose one, would you choose the world to end in fire, in volcanic eruptions,

1:54:43.600 --> 1:54:52.080
 in heat, and magma, or in ice frozen over? Fire or ice? Fire.

1:54:52.080 --> 1:55:06.160
 Excellent choice. I've always been a fan of chaos and the idea of things just

1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:16.080
 slowly getting cold and stopping and dying is just so depressing to me. So much more depressing than

1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:22.640
 things blowing up or burning and they're getting covered by a lava flow. Somehow the activity of

1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:30.160
 it endows it with more meaning to me, maybe. I've just now had this vision of you in action films

1:55:30.160 --> 1:55:35.040
 where you're walking away without looking back and there's explosions behind you and you just got

1:55:35.040 --> 1:55:41.200
 and you put on shades and then it goes to credits. So, Catherine, this was awesome. I think your

1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:48.960
 work is really inspiring. The kind of things we'll discover about planets in the next few

1:55:48.960 --> 1:55:54.400
 decades is super cool and I hope, I know you said there's probably not life in one of them,

1:55:54.400 --> 1:56:01.280
 but there might be and I hope we discover just that. And perhaps even on Io, within the volcanic

1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:06.800
 eruptions, there's a little creature hanging on that we'll one day discover. Thank you so much

1:56:06.800 --> 1:56:11.760
 for wasting all your valuable time with me today. It was really awesome. Yeah, likewise. Thank you

1:56:11.760 --> 1:56:17.280
 for having me here. Thanks for listening to this conversation with Catherine de Cleer and thank you

1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:24.800
 to Fundurize, Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and Magic Spoon. Check them out in the description to support

1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:31.120
 this podcast. And now, let me leave you with some words from Carl Sagan. Untightened, the molecules

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:36.480
 that have been raining down like mona from heaven for the last four billion years might still be

1:56:36.480 --> 1:56:43.360
 there, largely unaltered, defrozen, awaiting for the chemists from Earth. Thank you for listening

1:56:43.360 --> 1:57:07.360
 and hope to see you next time.
