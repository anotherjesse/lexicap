00:00.000 --> 00:05.840
 The following is a conversation with Nick Carter, who is a partner at Castle Island Ventures,

00:05.840 --> 00:13.200
 cofounder of CoinMetrics.io, and previously a crypto asset research analyst at Fidelity Investments.

00:13.200 --> 00:19.600
 He's a prominent writer, speaker, and podcaster on topics around decentralized finance,

00:19.600 --> 00:26.720
 and especially Bitcoin. Quick mention of our sponsors, The Information, Athletic Greens,

00:26.720 --> 00:31.760
 ForSigmatic, and Blinkist. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:32.640 --> 00:37.200
 This conversation with Nick Carter is part of a series of episodes on cryptocurrency

00:37.200 --> 00:42.640
 that is a small journey of exploration I'm on because I find decentralized finance and especially

00:42.640 --> 00:49.520
 Bitcoin fascinating, technically and philosophically, especially because it may be the very mechanism that

00:49.520 --> 00:55.360
 achieves a global decentralization of power, giving more sovereignty to the individual,

00:55.360 --> 01:00.880
 and making our systems more resilient to corruption, manipulation, and in general,

01:00.880 --> 01:06.640
 to the darker sides of human nature. Please let me also address something for a few minutes

01:06.640 --> 01:12.160
 that happened recently that's been weighing heavy on me. If you find me annoying to listen to,

01:12.160 --> 01:17.680
 please skip to the actual conversation with Nick. I had a recent podcast episode with Anthony

01:17.680 --> 01:26.080
 Pompliano where we spoke about Bitcoin and life in general for three hours. I was curious, inspired,

01:26.080 --> 01:33.200
 positive, or at least I tried to be as I usually do. Someone clipped out, out of context, a short

01:33.200 --> 01:39.680
 segment of me mumbling something about having a PhD, and I started getting mocked online because

01:39.680 --> 01:45.680
 that made it convenient for people to mock me for being yet another quote unquote expert who

01:45.680 --> 01:51.920
 learns about Bitcoin and thinks he knows everything. I almost never mentioned that I have a PhD,

01:51.920 --> 01:57.440
 except to make fun of myself as I was doing or at least trying to do in the full context of

01:57.440 --> 02:03.440
 that conversation. I brought up grad school as a random example of one of the many journeys I've

02:03.440 --> 02:10.320
 taken that was hard but where the destination was in itself not very useful. I was saying I

02:10.320 --> 02:16.960
 enjoy exploring with a curious mind and am willing to be patient to learn to listen to humble myself

02:16.960 --> 02:23.680
 with knowledge for the sake of knowledge itself. Grad school was an example of that. The PhD means

02:23.680 --> 02:30.320
 nothing, at least to me. I never call myself an expert or at least try not to because that would be

02:30.320 --> 02:38.880
 dumb because I know how little I know. I'm not a influencer or a thought leader or whatever else

02:38.880 --> 02:45.200
 silly self aggrandizing label people put on their LinkedIn. I try to be the opposite of what I was

02:45.200 --> 02:50.640
 mocked for. I try to think deeply about the world to look for the beautiful ideas in the minds of

02:50.640 --> 02:57.120
 others and to be inspired by them. I wanted to say all this because psychologically it struck

02:57.120 --> 03:03.600
 a bit of a blow. It made me realize that even when I approached things with love, I may be mocked,

03:03.600 --> 03:10.080
 I may be derided, I may be taken out of context or even lied about. With a growing platform this

03:10.080 --> 03:16.400
 is sadly only increasing. I now have learned that there's people who are waiting for my missteps

03:16.400 --> 03:23.200
 so they can point the finger laugh and say see I told you so that guy's a joke he's a fraud.

03:24.160 --> 03:30.400
 As a fellow human being the knowledge of this is painful. Yes I know people tell me to toughen up

03:30.400 --> 03:37.200
 and my life has been about strengthening my mind in the face of my limits but I refuse to not be

03:37.200 --> 03:43.760
 fragile and wear my heart on my sleeve. It's who I am. In some sense this is the immune system of

03:43.760 --> 03:50.720
 the internet but let us be careful not to destroy the good ones in the process. The Bitcoin community

03:50.720 --> 03:56.240
 had to endure many years of attacks from quote unquote experts and also fraudulent cryptocurrency

03:56.240 --> 04:02.080
 efforts that scam people out of their money. This created a powerful immune system that

04:02.080 --> 04:08.000
 fought the attackers and the scammers. I understand this and I also understand that one of the beautiful

04:08.000 --> 04:15.040
 aspects of Bitcoin is its community of humans is decentralized but some small part of this community

04:15.040 --> 04:20.880
 has come to enjoy the us versus them battles sometimes for the sake of the battle in itself.

04:20.880 --> 04:27.760
 This happens in political discourse as well. I understand this but to my limited mind it sounds

04:27.760 --> 04:34.000
 like groupthink which has powerful defense mechanisms against bad ideas but has dangerous

04:34.000 --> 04:40.720
 consequences if taken too far as in many periods of human history that I often talk about where the

04:40.720 --> 04:47.440
 us versus them thinking has led to the suffering of many. Again I understand the value of this

04:47.440 --> 04:53.920
 as many Bitcoins explain to me but it's not the way I as a sovereign individual choose to walk in

04:53.920 --> 05:00.160
 this life. By the way none of this podcast should be treated as financial advice before Nick kindly

05:00.160 --> 05:07.440
 gifted me with a hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin in hardware form. I didn't own any. I'll probably

05:07.440 --> 05:13.760
 buy some Bitcoin on Cash App Coinbase and other platforms and also transfer to a hardware wallet

05:13.760 --> 05:20.400
 just to learn how to do it but other than that I don't necessarily make wise investment decisions.

05:20.400 --> 05:26.000
 Money is not a motivation for me personally. I try to avoid it actually. I'm grateful for every day

05:26.000 --> 05:31.200
 I'm alive no matter how much money is in my bank account. For long stretches of my life that number

05:31.200 --> 05:38.160
 was very close to zero and I was always fortunate to be free and happy so I encourage you to listen

05:38.160 --> 05:44.800
 to people much smarter than me for actual good financial advice. Here I'm just exploring ideas

05:45.440 --> 05:50.960
 and as if this has not already gone on too long let me please make another comment on the style of

05:50.960 --> 05:58.080
 discourse among some Bitcoin maximalists on platforms like Twitter that in my humble view

05:58.080 --> 06:04.320
 I may be wrong but I believe is not conducive to the nuanced empathetic exchange of ideas

06:04.320 --> 06:10.080
 I very much look for and enjoy. Again I appreciate their style of discourse. I think I understand

06:10.080 --> 06:15.520
 the value of it but it's not my thing so I don't want to engage in it. I want to hear the quiet

06:15.520 --> 06:21.520
 voices in the room. I look for people to inspire each other and when we disagree I look for disagreement

06:21.520 --> 06:28.240
 that is grounded in respect and empathy. I think that mockery and derision destroys the possibility

06:28.240 --> 06:33.840
 of those nuanced conversations. It drives away the quiet thoughtful empathetic voices

06:33.840 --> 06:40.640
 and I try to give those voices space to be heard, to shine, to exchange ideas whether we agree or

06:40.640 --> 06:49.200
 disagree. So if I happen to block you on Twitter I block you with love. Honestly I will never speak

06:49.200 --> 06:54.320
 poorly of you or even think poorly of you. I would love to hang out in person give you a big

06:54.320 --> 07:01.280
 old hug and talk about life over some beers. If you see or hear me say something stupid which I'm

07:01.280 --> 07:06.960
 sure I do often or something you disagree with and you still respect me as a human being please

07:06.960 --> 07:13.920
 show your love as I always do to you but also send me some links to blogs, books, videos, podcasts

07:13.920 --> 07:20.000
 where people describe why my stated idea may be totally wrong. I love this kind of long form

07:20.000 --> 07:26.480
 disagreement. I humble myself every day by reading books and blogs by people much smarter than me.

07:26.480 --> 07:31.920
 Sometimes it strengthens my ideas sometimes it totally changes them but I always learn.

07:32.720 --> 07:39.760
 This is a too long way of saying that I'm here trying to walk with grace and with an open mind

07:39.760 --> 07:47.680
 a bit of patience and always love. If I make mistakes cut me some slack like you I'm only human

07:47.680 --> 07:56.240
 allegedly. This is the Lex Freeman podcast and here is my conversation with Nick Carter.

07:57.280 --> 08:03.120
 What philosopher or philosophical idea had a big impact on your life not just in the space of

08:03.120 --> 08:08.320
 cryptocurrency but in general? Oh so we're we're going now we're rolling going right in rolling

08:08.320 --> 08:14.000
 because you majored philosophy. I did I majored in philosophy I didn't know what to do with my life

08:14.000 --> 08:19.520
 and my parents said do whatever you find interesting it's like okay philosophy great find that interesting

08:20.720 --> 08:27.200
 and it had way more of an impact on my career actually than I thought it might you know typically

08:27.200 --> 08:30.560
 I guess if you do philosophy go into law or finance so it sort of makes sense but

08:32.880 --> 08:38.640
 there are a number of philosophers I really admire. One of my favorites would be Descartes

08:38.640 --> 08:44.320
 probably the notion of skepticism it's sort of a rabbit hole it's kind of hard to pull yourself out

08:44.320 --> 08:50.000
 of it basically the brain in the vat theory pulling yourself out of that but yeah I really like

08:50.000 --> 08:57.520
 epistemology you know questioning what it is to have knowledge so Descartes was one of my gateways

08:57.520 --> 09:05.680
 to that. Do you think everything is noble like we humans can can know fully the objective reality?

09:05.680 --> 09:12.640
 Oh definitely not no I mean reality is very much processed through your own you know subjective lens.

09:13.760 --> 09:20.320
 So how much do you think do we understand about this world because a lot of your ideas a lot of

09:20.320 --> 09:26.080
 things we might talk about today are kind of trying to figure out human civilization how humans

09:26.800 --> 09:32.800
 how human behavior works at scale all those kinds of things that kind of assumes that we have it

09:32.800 --> 09:40.000
 or we're able to somehow figure most of it out right so in your sort of when you step way back

09:40.960 --> 09:45.840
 how much of it have we really figured out? Well I think that's the conceit of economics is

09:46.400 --> 09:51.280
 thinking that you can model human behavior right and these unbelievably complex systems

09:52.320 --> 09:56.800
 and then I think that's the modern critique of economics like the sort of Tel Aviv and critique

09:56.800 --> 10:02.560
 is that you can't have true knowledge and they're much less predictable than we think they are

10:03.280 --> 10:09.840
 and you know we behave according to our accumulated assumptions and we're using tiny sort of datasets

10:09.840 --> 10:16.000
 trained on the last 50 hundred years and they turn out to be horribly askew and that's when we

10:16.000 --> 10:23.680
 have our grey swans and our black swans so I'm much more on the sort of you know reality is much

10:23.680 --> 10:29.120
 less knowable than we think side of things but it is nice to have very concrete things like Bitcoin

10:29.120 --> 10:34.320
 that's for sure. Oh so you think so most of it is shaky ground but there are some things there's

10:34.320 --> 10:40.880
 like islands of sturdiness. Yeah Bitcoin is one of them. That's a good way to put it yeah I mean

10:40.880 --> 10:46.240
 look at the dollar system not to pivot this into the dollar right away but the dollar is like

10:46.240 --> 10:53.040
 shaky ground. Who truly understands the dollar system I mean the totality of it the euro dollar

10:53.040 --> 11:00.720
 system the way that monetary policy interacts with the economy is monetary issuance inflationary

11:01.280 --> 11:06.160
 what's the relationship between unemployment and inflation even policy makers don't understand

11:06.160 --> 11:11.280
 these things economists don't seem to understand them what is inflation how do you define inflation

11:11.280 --> 11:16.880
 none of these things are really known or knowable. So a lot of people kind of make a claim that there's

11:16.880 --> 11:23.120
 a lot of manipulation possible with the dollar with those currencies if you couple that with the

11:23.120 --> 11:30.000
 fact that people don't understand it and yet there's claims that being manipulated by centralized

11:30.000 --> 11:36.480
 power how do you bring those two ideas together if no one understands that how can you manipulate it.

11:36.480 --> 11:42.000
 I think what we don't understand are the long term consequences of our structures so like

11:42.000 --> 11:50.720
 like the feds mandate to target unemployment and steady exchange rates or low inflation

11:51.520 --> 11:56.720
 you know what we don't understand is okay what is the result of doing that continuously for 40 years

11:57.600 --> 12:02.720
 what is the net effect of that what is the consequence of the long term accumulation of

12:02.720 --> 12:07.920
 debt and you know basement interest rates what is the net effect of that on society

12:07.920 --> 12:14.400
 we might understand just much short short term features of the system but I think it's a longer

12:14.400 --> 12:20.720
 term features we don't understand. Do you think there's like malevolent people with people that

12:20.720 --> 12:28.800
 don't have good intent in central banks like in the system you know when you have centralized power

12:28.800 --> 12:38.480
 or any forms it's susceptible to somebody hacking the system taking the power and in the shadows

12:38.480 --> 12:44.000
 this is where conspiracy theories come in right in the shadows be able to you know

12:46.480 --> 12:52.080
 act out things that have a lot of negative impacts on a large percent of the population

12:52.080 --> 12:57.120
 in self in greedy self interest do you think there's people like that or do you think fundamentally

12:57.120 --> 13:03.040
 most people are good even those associated with the sort of central banking.

13:03.680 --> 13:08.640
 Oh I mean I don't villainize those people I think everyone is the hero of their own story

13:08.640 --> 13:12.800
 right so they all believe that their force are good in the world you have to

13:13.760 --> 13:19.120
 are there any true villains I don't think so I think they get socialized into a world where

13:19.120 --> 13:27.440
 they believe their particular skills and their mandate is you know what they should be doing. I

13:27.440 --> 13:35.360
 think they might be presumptuous or arrogant in some cases and you know I think it's more of a

13:35.360 --> 13:42.800
 systemic issue where you have a small handful of very homogenous types of people with PhDs

13:42.800 --> 13:50.080
 from the same institutions that are brought up in the same cultural context that you know set policy

13:50.080 --> 13:55.760
 and wield a tremendous amount of control over society and I think they have this notion that you

13:55.760 --> 14:02.320
 can tinker society you can play with a few key variables and tinker society into a state that

14:02.320 --> 14:08.240
 is desirable or good and that's what they're trying to do and I think the consequences of that can

14:08.240 --> 14:15.200
 be pretty bad but no I don't think it's born out of malevolence. There's an interesting idea I think

14:15.200 --> 14:22.880
 Michael Malis brought it up as a test whether you're on the left or the right. The question he asks

14:22.880 --> 14:30.720
 which is do you think some people are better than others? If you say yes he claims you're on the right

14:30.720 --> 14:40.640
 if you start answering if you start like saying a lot of things like you're on the left. So if

14:40.640 --> 14:49.120
 you start explaining yourself well equipping as a good term for it. I was really in this test I

14:49.120 --> 14:54.400
 suppose I would be on the left because I'm uncomfortable with the idea that some people are

14:54.400 --> 15:00.960
 better than others as a basic feeling as a starting point in the way you think about the world because

15:01.680 --> 15:07.600
 as we're talking about everybody's a hero of their own story when you start to think some people

15:07.600 --> 15:17.040
 are better than others as a starting axiom it's like a slippery slope to where you think you're

15:17.040 --> 15:26.560
 way better than others and then you start to like basically it's okay to take advantage of a large

15:26.560 --> 15:32.560
 percent of the population for the greater good totally and then you go into Stalin mode and

15:32.560 --> 15:38.720
 Hitler mode where it's okay to murder a large part of the population for the greater good.

15:38.720 --> 15:45.040
 So it's like it's this very dangerous slippery slope of my mind so I tried to not uh yeah I was

15:45.040 --> 15:49.200
 always uncomfortable with that kind of test or even that kind of thought and yes the same applies

15:49.200 --> 15:57.280
 and suppose in government in central banking is if you think some people are better than others

15:57.280 --> 16:02.960
 applying your idea of what is good can have large scale detrimental effects.

16:03.680 --> 16:11.200
 Of course. Yeah. I'm glad you didn't pose me the question. I mean I think it maybe the left right

16:11.200 --> 16:20.640
 axiom isn't the disjunction isn't the way I would sort of put it but to me it's just if you reason

16:20.640 --> 16:27.920
 in a consequentialist way that lends itself to authoritarianism whereby you think you can shape

16:27.920 --> 16:34.720
 society and only you can shape society in a positive direction according to your specific

16:34.720 --> 16:42.400
 objectives. So let's step onto the land of sturdiness that is bitcoin. What is bitcoin

16:42.400 --> 16:48.480
 and in your view what are you know the principles the philosophical foundations of bitcoin?

16:49.440 --> 16:56.560
 Well bitcoin the term I think refers to two things specifically so one is the protocol for

16:57.200 --> 17:02.640
 conveying value through communications channel. So just a set of rules that we collectively opt

17:02.640 --> 17:11.280
 into in order to transact online or just add a distance and then the other thing is the name

17:11.280 --> 17:18.000
 of the asset the sort of monetary unit which circulates within the system and that always

17:18.000 --> 17:22.080
 confuse people a lot because it's like well we've got uppercase bitcoin lowercase bitcoin

17:22.800 --> 17:27.920
 white and satoshi just gives them different names like in ethereum you've got ethereum

17:27.920 --> 17:33.760
 the system and then ether although people don't really talk about ether very much but they

17:33.760 --> 17:40.640
 you know chose to distinguish them in bitcoin for whatever reason they're not distinct so the

17:40.640 --> 17:46.640
 two bitcoins get commingled all the time in the explanations. Did you find that's a problem that

17:46.640 --> 17:52.320
 confuses things? I mean what's really a distinction between the protocol and the currency? Well they

17:52.320 --> 17:57.920
 are sometimes distinguished practically like you can transact with bitcoin outside of the

17:57.920 --> 18:05.680
 bitcoin protocol for instance right so you know you can transact with bitcoin on ethereum or

18:05.680 --> 18:10.880
 I have bitcoin on an open dime here this would be a bitcoin transaction it wouldn't settle on the

18:10.880 --> 18:15.840
 bitcoin network. Do you mind explaining what you have on the table before us? Yeah so I brought

18:15.840 --> 18:21.920
 you some presents. That's awesome. This isn't a bribe this is just a proof of concept. Okay. So this

18:21.920 --> 18:32.000
 is basically a bitcoin bearer instrument so I put a hundred bucks of bitcoin on here and to spend it

18:32.000 --> 18:37.200
 you have to basically physically destroy part of the device you have to poke a hole and you know

18:37.200 --> 18:44.640
 poke off one of the little transistors on this so it can only be spent once so and you can't

18:44.640 --> 18:49.520
 extract the private key from this device so the private key was generated on device always stays

18:49.520 --> 18:58.400
 on the device so what it means without like breaking off like a small part so this basically is

18:59.440 --> 19:08.240
 a way to physically instantiate bitcoin so it's um it's it's kind of gold yeah effectively so here

19:09.440 --> 19:16.720
 this one's limited edition it's orange so what is it called again open dime the point is if you

19:16.720 --> 19:22.160
 wanted to settle a bitcoin transaction instantly the kind of the same way that a cash transaction

19:22.160 --> 19:28.800
 is instant final settlement right you would do it with a device like this so if I was buying a house

19:28.800 --> 19:36.400
 from you know you might prefer to do it with a physical bearer instrument as opposed to waiting

19:36.400 --> 19:42.320
 for confirmation on the bitcoin blockchain so the moment I hand that over to you goes in your

19:42.320 --> 19:47.440
 possession you're the owner there's no way for me to have retained the private key like

19:47.440 --> 19:52.240
 I could have created a bitcoin paper wallet and given that to you but you have no assurance that

19:52.240 --> 19:58.080
 I didn't copy down that you know the key elsewhere so this solves that problem so this is a physical

19:58.080 --> 20:05.840
 instantiation of the bitcoin transaction outside the bitcoin protocol that's right see this is

20:05.840 --> 20:10.400
 you're transacting the currency outside of the protocol so it's analog bitcoin we're we're

20:10.400 --> 20:15.760
 running an analog which I was like because bitcoin is this immaterial thing and so it's

20:15.760 --> 20:21.760
 nice to have physical totems how much does it cost to manufacture this you know like 15 bucks or

20:21.760 --> 20:27.440
 something I is it so this is just kind of a almost like a philosophical statement versus

20:28.400 --> 20:35.200
 something that's scalable for for use like you know the point of bitcoin is to be in the digital

20:35.200 --> 20:40.720
 space right but this shows like bitcoin can be anywhere it's useful for gifts but yeah I mean

20:41.440 --> 20:47.440
 I don't know if it would be a suitable foundation for a physical bitcoin economy in theory these

20:47.440 --> 20:52.400
 would be like cash like instruments that you could use to transact well I just mean post apocalypse

20:52.400 --> 20:58.080
 yeah yeah but you still need you still need to plug it into your laptop to actually verify

20:58.080 --> 21:05.440
 that there's coins on there so you still need the internet so I have to take your word for how much

21:05.440 --> 21:11.760
 money is on here no I mean you can you can plug it into your laptop and check yeah but to transact

21:11.760 --> 21:17.920
 to extract bitcoin from this I need to break yeah you have to poke a hole through the the

21:17.920 --> 21:24.560
 little hole and that renders it spendable basically so you know that's protection against

21:24.560 --> 21:30.000
 you spending it and then representing that it's still loaded that's that's any cool yeah so that

21:30.000 --> 21:38.320
 the other thing I brought you're basically dice 12 sided they don't have any bitcoin on them so

21:38.320 --> 21:44.800
 they just have a bunch of different critiques of bitcoin on each side we'll go through them then

21:44.800 --> 21:50.000
 this is awesome I don't know if we have time to do all 11 because there's one with my phone's

21:50.000 --> 21:56.240
 logo on it but it's just basically a tongue in cheek joke that the critiques of bitcoin are so

21:56.240 --> 22:04.560
 formulaic at this point that you can just put them on dice yeah it's it's silly well some of them

22:04.560 --> 22:09.600
 might be topics for interesting conversations oh yeah we can even arrange the conversation

22:09.600 --> 22:16.160
 that way you can roll the dice and see what you got all right but first the the philosophical

22:16.160 --> 22:21.920
 foundations of bitcoin like how do you see bitcoin outside of just a basic protocol and a basic

22:21.920 --> 22:28.880
 currency it seems to be like you said it seems like sturdy ground so what do you mean by yeah

22:28.880 --> 22:33.440
 yeah so it's not just any protocol for moving value around it's not just any currency it's got

22:33.440 --> 22:40.480
 specific rules and values that are embedded in it and this is an important point is the bitcoin is

22:40.480 --> 22:48.480
 the encoding of certain values which are often misunderstood or not acknowledged necessarily

22:49.760 --> 22:55.280
 and so it's sort of impregnated with values and what they are specifically is a topic of debate

22:55.280 --> 23:01.840
 and there have been civil wars fought over the values inherent in bitcoin you know one of them

23:01.840 --> 23:07.600
 was should bitcoin be this cheap scalable the base layer low fee payments system

23:07.600 --> 23:15.360
 with a emphasis on p2p payments or should it be more of this like gold like digital commodity

23:15.920 --> 23:21.680
 that would eventually settle infrequently and mainly between institutions right so that's

23:22.240 --> 23:29.440
 fundamentally conflict of visions right but the so you know keep in mind that this is just

23:29.440 --> 23:36.720
 one man's opinion I don't speak for bitcoin right so I would say the key the key number one

23:36.720 --> 23:43.200
 value that's embedded in bitcoin is the notion of non discretionary monetary policy so algorithmic

23:43.200 --> 23:49.120
 monetary policy as opposed to human based monetary policy satoshi was very clear about that bitcoin

23:49.120 --> 23:55.600
 is an alternative to modern central banking where you have constant tweaking constant intervention

23:56.160 --> 24:03.200
 which satoshi felt leads to credit bubbles and so on so bitcoin proposes a completely

24:03.200 --> 24:10.400
 non discretionary monetary policy sort of decays over time 50 percent of the coins we're shooting

24:10.400 --> 24:15.680
 the first four years and then the next 25 percent the next four years then 12 and a half percent

24:15.680 --> 24:21.040
 the next four years until you get to 21 million units and none of those numbers really matter

24:21.040 --> 24:25.520
 like it could have been 25 million units and it could have been a more aggressive slope or a

24:25.520 --> 24:32.960
 more gradual slope but what matters is that this schedule was proposed even before the code was

24:32.960 --> 24:39.920
 public the schedule was proposed and then we all collectively agreed to stick to it and that is

24:39.920 --> 24:46.720
 kind of a first for monetary system I mean gold kind of has that property right because gold the

24:46.720 --> 24:52.160
 supply of gold above ground only really increases at one to two percent a year so it's it's sort of

24:52.160 --> 24:56.560
 inhuman which is a good feature right you don't want to give humans that much control over it

24:56.560 --> 25:04.960
 but bitcoin is a much more you know fastidious approach to that it really is super concrete

25:04.960 --> 25:11.120
 about what the supply schedule is and the fact crucially that it can't change so we can't have

25:11.120 --> 25:17.200
 a bailout of debt or as it was a lot of people let's say a lot of people had debts denominated

25:17.200 --> 25:22.160
 in bitcoin and we needed loose accommodative monetary policy to bail them out that's not

25:22.160 --> 25:28.240
 possible we couldn't have a jubilee denominated in bitcoin because the social contract we've all

25:28.880 --> 25:35.440
 you know bought into and committed to is that it's not non discretionary so that's sort of one

25:35.440 --> 25:42.240
 of the first things and I think ultimately that comes back to basically a strong respect for

25:42.240 --> 25:48.160
 property rights because if we were to have unanticipated inflation let's say you know really

25:48.160 --> 25:53.040
 charismatic leader somehow commandeered bitcoin and convinced everyone that we should have 30

25:53.040 --> 25:59.520
 million units and not 21 million that would basically be dilutive on everybody that held

25:59.520 --> 26:07.760
 bitcoin and had opted into the 21 million set of coins an additional 9 million unanticipated

26:07.760 --> 26:12.320
 would have a dilutive effect on everyone else and that would be a covert way of effectively

26:12.320 --> 26:17.680
 stealing their purchasing power through inflation is that possible that kind of thing I mean what

26:17.680 --> 26:23.520
 what's the mechanism of bitcoin that resists that kind of charismatic leader well we've had

26:24.080 --> 26:27.600
 people that have had a lot of influence in bitcoin in the past and they've

26:28.160 --> 26:34.640
 tried to make changes to the protocol not as dramatic as that but bitcoiners have generally

26:34.640 --> 26:41.120
 resisted those individuals institutions and they you know bitcoin is have a good track record of

26:41.120 --> 26:48.320
 sort of staying true to to those core values so that you know the you mentioned values and and

26:48.320 --> 26:55.200
 like sticking to the monetary thing but there's bigger values there's almost like psychological

26:55.200 --> 27:00.960
 values there instilled in bitcoin you make a point that bitcoin for many is a vessel quote

27:01.600 --> 27:04.160
 for their expectations hopes and dreams

27:04.160 --> 27:11.680
 can now the bitcoin protocol support this kind of complexity of the human condition

27:12.240 --> 27:19.600
 so like there's ideas of freedom that seem to be spoken about there's a sort of ideas of

27:21.600 --> 27:28.560
 of I mean even love yeah I mean some people kind of use it as a meme like you know bitcoin is

27:28.560 --> 27:34.640
 love or something like that you know mostly to troll me because I talk about love all the time but

27:34.640 --> 27:43.120
 you know these bigger ideas than just the exchange of currencies yeah I mean bitcoin itself is very

27:44.160 --> 27:50.960
 simple I would say like ultimately it doesn't you know pretend to do very much it really just

27:50.960 --> 28:00.160
 settles transactions but people do superimpose their own views on it for sure and bitcoins

28:00.160 --> 28:07.120
 qualities give rise to these perceptions of it having censorship resistance or giving you

28:07.120 --> 28:16.720
 transactional freedom or a measure of transactional privacy so because anyone can operate a node and

28:16.720 --> 28:23.120
 join the consensus process and because mining is a competitive free market process that means that

28:24.240 --> 28:29.920
 it's likely that you can't be censored by the miners so that means you have transactional freedom

28:29.920 --> 28:35.040
 so you have these computer science technical features of the system that cause it to have

28:35.040 --> 28:41.360
 these political qualities which is it's very hard or impossible to censor a specific individual

28:41.360 --> 28:49.120
 so it's interesting to see that flow but so that's one of the core values for sure is the

28:49.120 --> 28:55.840
 censorship resistance then you have the fact that it's a cryptographic base system and you

28:55.840 --> 29:01.840
 can hold value in your brain by memorizing 12 words for instance that gives it seizure resistance

29:02.480 --> 29:05.120
 which is again a political concept if you wanted to

29:05.120 --> 29:12.880
 to desert your jurisdiction with your wealth intact in your brain you know that you know

29:12.880 --> 29:16.720
 cryptographic feature of the system the fact that it's built on public key cryptography

29:17.360 --> 29:24.480
 and that you can encode a bitcoin private key in 12 words that gives it this political salience

29:25.120 --> 29:30.080
 that you know you can you're now empowered relative to a despot basically

29:30.080 --> 29:36.240
 yeah i mean there's so many beautiful concepts behind cryptocurrency behind bitcoin

29:37.440 --> 29:42.640
 that stand for sort of freedom some of the basic things at the founding of this country

29:42.640 --> 29:50.080
 the one thing i don't like personally behind bitcoin and cryptocurrencies that money is involved

29:50.080 --> 29:57.520
 and it's like people's life savings sometimes are involved so there is naturally a kind of fear

29:57.520 --> 30:06.800
 a self preservation uh like instinctual kind of dogmatic thing that comes in where you're not

30:06.800 --> 30:12.320
 the best of human nature you're you stop being a george washington and you lose touch of the

30:13.040 --> 30:17.040
 like foundational principles which i think are beautiful just like the founding principles of

30:17.040 --> 30:23.680
 this country so that's that's just like um so i like staying on the level of like the philosophy

30:23.680 --> 30:32.160
 versus the level of like all my money is invested in bitcoin and that that becomes very tricky

30:32.160 --> 30:39.440
 territory to have principal discussions yeah about ideas well it's an interesting tension

30:39.440 --> 30:45.760
 i try to stay balanced despite being very exposed to bitcoin so let me ask the ridiculous question

30:46.320 --> 30:52.720
 just in case who is itoshi nakamoto we don't we don't know it's probably not me because

30:52.720 --> 31:05.040
 i was um like 17 when itoshi mounted bitcoin 16 so unlikely and also i'm not really a programmer so

31:05.920 --> 31:11.280
 um there's a lot of theories but honestly it's one of the greatest mysteries of all time because even

31:12.000 --> 31:18.400
 bitcoins that have been around since day one really you know people that were around before

31:18.400 --> 31:23.200
 bitcoin came out they're on the mailing list they're active in the cypherpunk community you

31:23.200 --> 31:28.160
 ask them and they sincerely will not know and they may not even have a good guess as to who

31:28.160 --> 31:33.520
 sato she is is it important to know or is it like actually important not to know do you think that's

31:33.520 --> 31:39.120
 a feature a bug that you we don't know some people don't like the uncertainty especially you know

31:39.120 --> 31:46.640
 folks on wall street they really want to know and if you read the coinbase s1 their um disclosure

31:46.640 --> 31:53.920
 pre ipo that's a risk factor that satoshi could come back so the the risk management crowd wants

31:53.920 --> 32:00.320
 to know because they want to know if maybe satoshi had you know undesirable political opinions or

32:00.320 --> 32:05.040
 something that would forever taint the project do you think they were just trolling with that risk

32:05.040 --> 32:11.840
 with uh was satoshi's identity being a risk factor or is that like actual like was there an

32:11.840 --> 32:16.800
 actual meeting and a discussion of that being a risk factor i think in the risk factor sections of

32:16.800 --> 32:21.040
 the prospectus is it's really just the lawyers doing a total brain dump to cover absolutely

32:21.040 --> 32:26.800
 everything they can think of so it's just lawyers it's not like uh you know it's like uh i think

32:26.800 --> 32:34.480
 elon was somewhere in the legal documents for spacex mentioned that like uh earth governments

32:34.480 --> 32:39.760
 have no jurisdiction on mars yeah like they threw that in there and it feels like yeah that could be

32:39.760 --> 32:44.880
 lawyers but it could also just be elon trolling yeah so i wonder if it's like the coinbase folks

32:44.880 --> 32:51.600
 trolling or if uh i don't know if it's lawyers i hope it's the trolling not the lawyers the

32:51.600 --> 32:57.600
 the coinbase leadership they're not as big uh trolls as elon is but uh i mean it's a it's a

32:57.600 --> 33:03.360
 risk for sure from their perspective because let's say satoshi returned doesn't seem likely and let's

33:03.360 --> 33:10.560
 say they decided to spend all their coins which also seems very unlikely um that's you know rumored

33:10.560 --> 33:18.800
 to be or estimates have it at one to one point two million bitcoin which is like 50 60 billion

33:18.800 --> 33:26.320
 dollars worth so some people consider that to be a risk you think it's uh you know this is almost

33:26.320 --> 33:34.640
 like a topic of leadership it doesn't feel like anybody anyone person speaks for bitcoin uh not

33:34.640 --> 33:41.760
 there's not even like prominent figures like you have for like ethereum you have italic buterin

33:42.800 --> 33:50.160
 it doesn't there's a lot of like top minds talking about it like yourself but it's not like one or two

33:50.160 --> 33:56.640
 do you think again is that a feature a bug like uh do you think for effective for bitcoin to

33:56.640 --> 34:04.880
 effectively have a role in um society that like is as large or larger than the dollar there needs

34:04.880 --> 34:12.080
 to be like leadership that represents it almost like democratic kind of thing well that's a real

34:12.080 --> 34:17.280
 counterintuitive point because most bitcoiners including myself would say no the lack of leadership

34:17.280 --> 34:23.360
 is a great quality to have because if you have a charismatic leader and a foundation or corporation

34:23.360 --> 34:28.240
 that controls it maybe they can control the features of the protocol and maybe they can

34:29.120 --> 34:36.880
 expropriate holders of the coin or you know build in an endowment that pays them off and

34:36.880 --> 34:44.080
 gives them privileged access to the units of the coin for instance so you know we call people

34:44.080 --> 34:50.160
 that have privileged access to the money spigot cantillon insiders which is there is this economist

34:50.160 --> 34:56.240
 that pointed out that as you know i think richard cantillon that as money enters the economy it has

34:56.240 --> 35:04.400
 an uneven flow right so you see this in last last decade or so before that too the consequence of

35:04.400 --> 35:09.440
 money printing in this country is people that own financial assets made a lot of money and people

35:09.440 --> 35:16.560
 that didn't didn't so you see that cantillon insider cantillon outsider effect and it's the same with

35:16.560 --> 35:21.680
 a cryptocurrency in many other alternative cryptocurrencies that do have these corporate

35:22.480 --> 35:27.920
 entities or these leaders and CEOs they're able to make specific decisions regarding

35:28.560 --> 35:34.160
 the protocol and the currency of the asset the benefit themselves their cronies etc and that's

35:34.160 --> 35:41.920
 not a good feature to have i mean it does grant you you know the ability to orchestrate decisions in

35:41.920 --> 35:47.360
 a faster and more efficient way but long term what you're trying to optimize for if you're

35:47.360 --> 35:52.720
 creating a money is monetary credibility and soundness so you don't really want it changing

35:52.720 --> 35:59.040
 all that often and you don't want to have the appearance of you know these elites that are

35:59.040 --> 36:03.680
 engaging in rent seeking or anything like that so there's definitely people that are influential

36:03.680 --> 36:08.480
 in bitcoin there's core developers that people listen to because it's i would say of meritocracy

36:08.480 --> 36:14.720
 largely and they're sort of self appointed high priests of the protocol i write a lot about bitcoin

36:14.720 --> 36:20.320
 people listen to me but it's a completely free market of ideas right i don't have any authority

36:20.320 --> 36:26.800
 within bitcoin whatsoever i'm just a scribbler you know just a scribble or so was Aristotle

36:26.800 --> 36:37.120
 socrates and Nietzsche okay at the high level technically how does bitcoin work is there

36:37.120 --> 36:42.640
 interesting things you could say like what are miners what are nodes full nodes what are blocks

36:43.360 --> 36:50.480
 what's proof of work is there a nice way to wrap up a clean explanation of the protocol

36:50.480 --> 36:56.640
 oh man that's uh that could be a whole that could be another five hours is there interesting because

36:56.640 --> 37:01.360
 i'd love to talk to you about block size wars and sort of the the the politics of psychology

37:01.920 --> 37:06.160
 the principles around that but sort of building up to that would be nice to talk about how the

37:06.160 --> 37:12.400
 thing works that's fair i mean and the block size wars are really fascinating discussion of how

37:12.400 --> 37:20.880
 how governance debates intersect with technical features so i guess we can yeah so basically

37:21.760 --> 37:29.680
 at the highest possible level bitcoin is a globally shared it's really a replicated ledger that

37:30.960 --> 37:37.280
 any participant that wants to be an equal peer on that ledger they want to maintain that ledger

37:37.280 --> 37:44.080
 and they want to stay up to date with the global state of the ledger and really any monetary system

37:44.080 --> 37:52.720
 is just a ledger with physical cash we benefit from the physical instantiation of the money

37:52.720 --> 37:57.600
 so the physics is the ledger the physics is the ledger right same with gold right you can't just

37:57.600 --> 38:06.240
 produce new units of gold so we trust that gold atoms are hard to create although not impossible

38:06.240 --> 38:14.000
 right you could fire a bunch of protons that whatever is the adjacent metal and create gold

38:14.000 --> 38:18.400
 atoms would be expensive and the same with dollars you know we trust that it's hard to

38:18.400 --> 38:23.920
 counterfeit a dollar so we trust the physical analog world to help maintain the state of that

38:23.920 --> 38:30.320
 ledger with digital money like you know the money in your bank account your checking account

38:30.320 --> 38:36.320
 we basically trust our institutions or banking institutions to keep a faithful record and then

38:36.320 --> 38:41.840
 ultimately we trust the central bank to administer that system so there's kind of a handful of nodes

38:42.480 --> 38:48.880
 in bitcoin we trust that the economic incentives of the system are carefully poised basically so

38:49.600 --> 38:55.520
 we trust that the free market and mining competition will lead to the miners assembling

38:55.520 --> 39:01.680
 assembling transactions into blocks in a faithful and correct way and that we are going to converge

39:01.680 --> 39:08.240
 on a global state of the ledger continuously which updates every 10 minutes or so with some variants

39:08.880 --> 39:15.680
 and then the miners aren't the sole entities that control the system to really participate

39:15.680 --> 39:20.320
 if you are a merchant and you're accepting bitcoin you really want to run your own full node

39:20.320 --> 39:25.680
 and check the whole history of transactions sort of something like I want to say five to six hundred

39:25.680 --> 39:31.040
 million transactions that have ever occurred on bitcoin so full node contains all the transactions

39:31.040 --> 39:38.880
 ever transacted on the bitcoin blockchain and that's I saw it's like 200 gigs or something

39:38.880 --> 39:44.960
 like that like 350 something like that it's doable on a regular consumer laptop and that

39:44.960 --> 39:51.920
 is going to be really key later on in the discussion but so you know that's really the

39:51.920 --> 39:56.320
 ultimate trust models first of all we trust that the miners that assemble transactions into blocks

39:56.320 --> 40:01.440
 and they are the archivists you know they inscribe those transactions onto the ledger

40:02.000 --> 40:06.480
 and they have an economic incentive to sort of behave correctly because they're getting paid

40:06.480 --> 40:13.600
 in no units of bitcoin that's part of it but then really you are also you're not fully trusting

40:13.600 --> 40:17.840
 them you're actually if you want to run a node you replay every single transaction in the history

40:17.840 --> 40:23.200
 of bitcoin from the beginning to the current day and you arrive at the present state that way

40:23.760 --> 40:30.800
 so you don't really have to trust too many people or entities you can validate the correctness of

40:30.800 --> 40:34.720
 that all the rules have been followed that all the bitcoins that were created were done so in

40:34.720 --> 40:42.240
 the valid way that the inflation rate was adhered to and that there's no covert inflation you know

40:42.240 --> 40:50.320
 that if you're spending 50 units of bitcoin you had that bitcoin to spend in the first place so

40:51.040 --> 40:56.880
 it's sort of delicately poised between node operators who you know engage in this validity

40:56.880 --> 41:02.560
 checking kind of anti counterfeiting checking and then also the miners which are an industrial entity

41:03.120 --> 41:08.640
 and they basically produce block space and assemble transactions into blocks

41:08.640 --> 41:14.160
 and everybody so the miners are incentivized to not mess with the system because they're getting

41:14.160 --> 41:21.840
 value from the system so if they mess with it it's going to decrease the value of their physical

41:21.840 --> 41:28.320
 work investment yeah so they have to incur a real physical cost to produce a block right so

41:28.960 --> 41:35.760
 right now you get 6.25 bitcoins in a block at a minimum and then maybe some fees as well

41:35.760 --> 41:40.320
 and how hard is it to produce a block now well challenging I mean you need

41:42.000 --> 41:49.040
 so 6.25 bitcoins and a bitcoins worth $55,000 or so so it's probably going to cost you about

41:49.040 --> 41:55.120
 that amount to produce it because it's a free market competition and miners have very free

41:55.120 --> 42:02.000
 thin margins so it's like if I auction off a dollar you would pay up to 99 cents to buy that

42:02.000 --> 42:09.280
 dollar for me it's exactly what happens with miners they're you know basically competing for

42:09.280 --> 42:15.120
 the right to obtain new units of money so logically speaking they would pay up to the value of that

42:15.120 --> 42:21.280
 money in order to earn it and for people who are not familiar the process of mining is solving a

42:21.280 --> 42:26.720
 difficult cryptographic problem that's a computational problem it's I would say it's not like

42:26.720 --> 42:31.920
 people sometimes represented as like a really challenging puzzle like the individual puzzle is

42:31.920 --> 42:38.000
 very simple like you can do with pen and paper if you wanted you know like Shaw 256 it's just that

42:38.000 --> 42:43.360
 you're searching through the big mathematical space to find the needle in the haystack you just

42:43.360 --> 42:49.520
 do lots of iterations of a simple puzzle it's just brute force hence like the stability of the whole

42:49.520 --> 42:54.720
 idea of the proof of work if it was a if you if there was a shortcut it wouldn't be it wouldn't

42:54.720 --> 43:02.400
 work exactly so let's hope nobody solves Shaw 256 yeah there's a lot of discussions in from the

43:02.400 --> 43:08.160
 quantum computing space but at the everybody I talked to all my colleagues and their work

43:08.160 --> 43:14.560
 on quantum computers say this we're quite away quite a long way away from that being an issue

43:15.280 --> 43:20.880
 in cryptography and then and certainly an issue in cryptocurrency that should have been one of

43:20.880 --> 43:25.600
 the sides on these dice should have been quantum quantum because I don't think it is I forgot to

43:25.600 --> 43:32.800
 put on this edition people should check out Scott Aronson there's a lot of people that are kind of

43:34.560 --> 43:41.520
 selling quantum snake oil so you should be very careful I think it is a really exciting space that

43:41.520 --> 43:49.040
 might change the world in the next decade or a hundred couple hundred years especially for

43:49.040 --> 43:54.960
 simulating quantum mechanical systems but in quantum machine learning people should check

43:54.960 --> 44:00.640
 out TensorFlow quantum it's a nice way to sort of educate yourself about the space and actually

44:00.640 --> 44:07.040
 if you're pragmatically minded to you know through software engineering explore how you

44:07.040 --> 44:12.400
 simulate quantum circuits how you're on machine learning on those quantum circuits the the main

44:12.400 --> 44:17.600
 point that Scott makes Scott Aronson people should check out his blog too is that like

44:17.600 --> 44:25.200
 like there's not yet a single machine learning application that doesn't do almost as well on

44:25.200 --> 44:31.840
 a classical computer so it doesn't like yes the dream is somehow quantum computers will

44:32.560 --> 44:39.920
 change the nature of artificial intelligence but there's yet to be an actual algorithm that

44:39.920 --> 44:47.840
 or a problem set or a data set where that would be the case so skepticism is good in the space

44:47.840 --> 44:57.200
 anyway that said so you kind of explained how bitcoin works you also wrote a blog post recently

44:57.200 --> 45:05.360
 giving a shout out to the new book the block size wars what is the block size what are the block size

45:05.360 --> 45:13.520
 wars its history its importance its philosophical foundations yeah i mean bitcoin at this point

45:13.520 --> 45:19.920
 we have our own civil wars if you're wondering about how politically intense it gets it's currently

45:19.920 --> 45:27.440
 not hot it's cold it's oh yeah we're in a detente right now there's no tanks or missiles at least

45:27.440 --> 45:33.600
 not yet hopefully it can get a little violent i guess i think one of the bitcoin core developers

45:33.600 --> 45:39.520
 or one of the participants in the war got swatted at one point what's swatted means when someone

45:39.520 --> 45:45.360
 does a fake phone call saying that you're holding someone hostage at your house and the swat team

45:45.360 --> 45:53.840
 goes it's pretty cool wow internet warfare tactic yeah but the block size war i would say effectively

45:53.840 --> 46:01.680
 ended um although we're definitely gonna have more civil wars in bitcoin for sure but basically the

46:01.680 --> 46:09.120
 core argument was a technical one on its surface but a very deep political one uh at its core the

46:09.120 --> 46:17.440
 technical question is how many megabytes should be in each successive block so satoshi basically

46:17.440 --> 46:24.160
 installed a limit of one megabyte per block so we should backtrack there was no limit in the beginning

46:24.160 --> 46:32.000
 and it seems like satoshi what is this 2000 the war started in what 2017 or something like that

46:32.000 --> 46:39.040
 i don't know in the 15 was when the you know the battle cries began what was the first battle in

46:39.040 --> 46:45.200
 the civil war i don't remember but sort of satoshi i don't know if you can comment on it like why

46:45.200 --> 46:52.640
 did satoshi set the limit to one megabyte all of a sudden almost secretly and in the beginning

46:52.640 --> 46:58.480
 there was no limit whatsoever yeah i mean we can get into and people have spent thousands of hours

46:58.480 --> 47:04.240
 pouring over satoshi's writings to find you know which side satoshi was on and you can find

47:04.880 --> 47:12.000
 like any textual exegesis you can find evidence for either side right but uh yeah i mean effectively

47:12.000 --> 47:17.040
 when bitcoin was launched there was a block size because if you made a block over a certain size

47:17.040 --> 47:23.600
 with the first edition of the code it would have crashed nodes but then yeah in 2010 satoshi

47:23.600 --> 47:30.080
 added the one megabyte limit in a covert way with no comments or anything and that's stock

47:30.080 --> 47:37.280
 basically and then bitcoin blocks filled up and people that had been socialized into this

47:37.280 --> 47:43.360
 vision of bitcoin as an effectively free transactional network like why pay a transaction fee

47:43.360 --> 47:48.240
 if you're not at congestion if the block isn't full the miner will mine your transaction for free

47:48.240 --> 47:56.960
 right um people that had been brought up in that status quo from 2009 to kind of 2015

47:57.760 --> 48:01.440
 they noticed the block started to fill up and they're like okay well let's just remove this

48:01.440 --> 48:07.680
 arbitrary limit right what what could possibly be the harm right and then a whole other faction said

48:07.680 --> 48:15.360
 no you need to cap the data throughput of the system because if you increase it it's going

48:15.360 --> 48:20.800
 to be highly exclusionary and ultimately regular folks are not going to be able to run a full node

48:21.360 --> 48:27.280
 so there's a fixed number there's there's a fixed frequency of blocks and so if you want to increase

48:27.280 --> 48:33.840
 number of transactions per second you want to increase the size of the block so huge blocks

48:33.840 --> 48:38.800
 allow you to shove in a lot of transactions right small blocks don't so that's what you mean like

48:38.800 --> 48:44.640
 constraining the system so what's the benefit of a small block size where transactions

48:46.640 --> 48:51.920
 when you can squeeze in only a small number of transactions and what's the benefit of a huge

48:51.920 --> 48:56.880
 block size where you can squeeze in a lot of transactions well it really comes down to the

48:56.880 --> 49:02.400
 way you think about the system so a lot of people wanted bitcoin to be visa scale so

49:02.400 --> 49:08.960
 so do you have blocks sufficiently large that you could accommodate a visa level scale of

49:08.960 --> 49:15.200
 transactions so which is many orders of magnitude more transactions that's right i mean preposterously

49:15.200 --> 49:22.240
 larger in terms of data throughput then you know bitcoin offers up or at least it used to 144 megabytes

49:22.240 --> 49:29.760
 of space per day and your average transactions 350 bytes so you know you could add a push to

49:29.760 --> 49:36.960
 24500 thousand transactions a day which is not many so if you wanted to get to visa scale you'd

49:36.960 --> 49:45.040
 have to increase blocks obnoxiously large the small blockers claimed that this would overwhelm the

49:45.040 --> 49:51.280
 ability of any regular person to ingest that data and stay current at the you know state of the ledger

49:52.080 --> 49:57.120
 to rebroadcast to replay all those transactions to ensure that the protocol rules were valid so

49:57.120 --> 50:03.200
 basically the small blocker contention is that you eliminate the trustlessness of the system

50:03.760 --> 50:09.600
 by pushing a ton of data through the system because only one or two industrial heavy duty

50:09.600 --> 50:16.080
 nodes would ever be able to run the protocol at that point so by the way in the civil war the

50:16.080 --> 50:24.000
 two sides as you're calling them the small blocker and the big blocker sides and so that

50:24.000 --> 50:32.000
 takes us back to the the thing that you mentioned that a regular computer could be a node and with

50:32.000 --> 50:38.080
 the big with big blocks that's no longer going to be the case so just the number of transactions

50:38.080 --> 50:45.440
 is going to blow up the size of the blockchain that every full node has to store and so then

50:46.080 --> 50:52.960
 as opposed to a regular mom and pop type of node you're going to have to have data centers

50:52.960 --> 50:56.960
 so they're going to have to be owned by large organizations there's going to have to be very

50:56.960 --> 51:04.080
 few of them and that's how you centralize the control over this whole uh operation so the big

51:04.080 --> 51:11.360
 blocker uh yes it allows you to be visa and do a huge number of transactions but it becomes

51:11.360 --> 51:18.560
 centralized and then the small blocker is you cannot actually do kind of merchant style transactions

51:18.560 --> 51:24.480
 but you get the decentralized benefit well i don't even think the big blocker approach would allow

51:24.480 --> 51:31.360
 you to be visa frankly because there's effectively one node in the visa network right um so you don't

51:31.360 --> 51:36.640
 really need to maintain this peer to peer architecture at all um and the amount of data you'd

51:36.640 --> 51:41.840
 have to push through the network to reach visa scales are really preposterous amount i mean and

51:41.840 --> 51:47.760
 and we have now evidence for what happens when you try and scale up as a blockchain and do 10

51:47.760 --> 51:55.200
 million transactions a day which is still not visa scale right you know i've i've you know seen what

51:55.200 --> 52:02.160
 it's like to operate those nodes and it's not pretty so there are totally genuine computer science

52:02.160 --> 52:09.280
 physical limits um because it's a it's a broadcast network everyone has to be aware of every

52:09.280 --> 52:15.840
 transaction and that model which gives you the trustlessness the nice guarantees where everyone's

52:15.840 --> 52:20.560
 an equal peer on the network everyone has audited the full history of the transactions

52:20.560 --> 52:28.800
 that model falls apart under stress so the small blocker vision is that ultimately you would scale

52:28.800 --> 52:33.840
 in a layered approach with the base layer transactions being settlement style transactions

52:34.480 --> 52:40.000
 and you know payments happening at the other layers basically is that universally agreed upon

52:40.000 --> 52:46.480
 or like to a large degree agreed upon that the small blockers of one in this in this debate

52:47.360 --> 52:52.640
 well where would you put the the current state of affairs there was a wave of competing bitcoin

52:52.640 --> 53:00.240
 implementations in starting in 2015 with bitcoin xt um actually gavin andreson who is the guy that

53:00.240 --> 53:06.480
 satoshi handed the reins to when satoshi left gavin supported this large block block proposal

53:06.480 --> 53:12.320
 uh and so that was that didn't achieve consensus and then there was bitcoin unlimited

53:13.040 --> 53:20.160
 and then later on there was a genuine hard fork where the small blockers couldn't or the large

53:20.160 --> 53:25.200
 blockers couldn't push through their proposals on bitcoin itself so they just created a competing

53:25.200 --> 53:30.240
 version of bitcoin you know so by the way uh so maybe you can comment on but sort of hard fork

53:30.240 --> 53:36.320
 versus a soft fork a hard fork is when it's not no longer compatible what's the right way to put

53:36.320 --> 53:42.320
 it they can't operate on the same blockchain they say with the same protocol yeah so there's a few

53:42.320 --> 53:49.120
 ways to define them and it's pretty it gets controversial as well but um one one way to

53:49.120 --> 53:55.840
 define it as a hard fork is a expansion of protocol rules and a soft fork is a shrinking

53:55.840 --> 54:00.320
 of protocol rules that's an interesting way to find it it's not very intuitive so i don't like

54:00.320 --> 54:07.200
 that way um another way is that a hard fork is backwards and compatible whereas soft work is

54:07.200 --> 54:14.720
 in theory backwards compatible so in in august 2017 basically the large blockers had had enough

54:14.720 --> 54:20.640
 and they said we're going to hard fork bitcoin we're going to create a clone an alternative

54:20.640 --> 54:28.160
 version of bitcoin which has the same a shared history as bitcoin itself but you completely

54:28.160 --> 54:34.320
 fork it and you create a new future and uh but you know everybody that had a balance on bitcoin at

54:34.320 --> 54:40.480
 the time also had a balance on the alternative coin bitcoin cash and so that was really that's

54:40.480 --> 54:45.200
 what's called bitcoin cash is the hard fork that was one of them there were more actually i mean

54:45.200 --> 54:51.760
 what the heck is bitcoin satoshi uh satoshi's vision bsv bitcoin sv so this is all talking about

54:51.760 --> 54:56.960
 increasing the max the limit of the block size more and more and more yeah that was one of the

54:56.960 --> 55:03.520
 the changes they wanted to push through uh but bsv was a fork of bitcoin cash so hard fork of

55:03.520 --> 55:09.200
 bitcoin cash yeah so and so now there's multiple big blocker blockchains floating around it's like

55:09.200 --> 55:14.800
 what are your thoughts about them well i was is it pretty popular sorry to interrupt uh are they

55:14.800 --> 55:20.400
 popular i mean if you look at the metrics they're not and oh they they don't trade they i think each

55:20.400 --> 55:25.120
 trade below one percent of the value of bitcoin itself so measuring popularity is like how much

55:25.120 --> 55:31.280
 they actually oh value uh value frequency of trade oh no no i mean they they do like a fair

55:31.280 --> 55:37.920
 number of transactions but there's no way to know that that is genuine or just contrived so you know

55:37.920 --> 55:43.920
 ultimately the true measure i think in my mind is just where the market prices these protocols

55:43.920 --> 55:50.320
 relative to bitcoin uh because that's like a prediction market if if bitcoin cash was being

55:50.320 --> 55:57.360
 priced at 50 of bitcoin you could say the market has given it a 50 chance of unseeding bitcoin

55:57.360 --> 56:03.840
 right but both bitcoin cash and bitcoin sv which was a hard fork from bitcoin cash itself

56:04.480 --> 56:09.360
 are well i believe at this point well below one percent of the value of bitcoin and in the

56:10.400 --> 56:15.920
 in like the ranking of different cryptocurrencies what is the bitcoin ethereum is ethereum in value

56:15.920 --> 56:21.760
 uh yes number two and then bitcoin cash is the one that it's in the top five right but it's just a

56:21.760 --> 56:27.360
 fast drop off you know i haven't checked lately but i think it's it's reached kind of morbidity

56:27.360 --> 56:33.920
 you know it doesn't really have much traction um the blocks aren't full so the whole value proposition

56:33.920 --> 56:38.560
 was you know we will get all this merchant adoption if we increase the block size that just

56:38.560 --> 56:45.360
 didn't materialize in my view they had a flawed vision of how adoption works and what blockchain

56:45.360 --> 56:51.280
 should optimize for uh maybe maybe you get a bitcoin cash supporter on the show they give you

56:51.280 --> 56:56.640
 a different answer but yeah full disclosure you know have my sympathies and i think the small

56:56.640 --> 57:02.160
 blockers one that's girmish for sure so at this time there's no merchant adoption and so on so

57:02.160 --> 57:08.640
 it's kind of its vision the whole reason for existence for at least for now hasn't materialized

57:08.640 --> 57:16.160
 and so that's that's a indication as possible that well it's a sign that perhaps that's the wrong

57:16.160 --> 57:22.160
 way to accomplish the scalability well you know first of all i think the layered scaling model is

57:22.160 --> 57:26.800
 definitely definitely correct i mean that's absolutely the way these things have to work

57:26.800 --> 57:32.480
 given the constraints of blockchains what is the layered scaling model it's really how all

57:32.480 --> 57:38.240
 payment systems scale blockchain or otherwise and i think a lot of people don't understand this

57:38.240 --> 57:44.640
 is that there is no equivalent to scaling of the base layer in the regular payment space

57:44.640 --> 57:49.760
 that totally doesn't happen all of them are built on layers so visa is like the fifth layer

57:50.320 --> 57:55.520
 in the payment stack that ultimately depends on these utility scale settlement systems like

57:55.520 --> 58:04.240
 fedwire chips a ch basically interbank settlement systems so you've got these slow moving but high

58:04.240 --> 58:10.160
 assurance settlement systems uh fedwire is probably the number one you know like when you

58:10.160 --> 58:16.400
 send a wire that's using the fedwire system typically on top of that you know you have banks

58:16.400 --> 58:20.800
 and then you have payment processors and then you build up these layers and layers and layers and

58:20.800 --> 58:28.160
 then you have these fast payments you know venmo venmo PayPal credit debit visa you name it those

58:28.160 --> 58:33.360
 payments are not final when they occur you know a credit card transaction will not be final for

58:33.360 --> 58:41.200
 90 to 120 days so that's fascinating you've decoupled the payment the financial message

58:41.200 --> 58:45.600
 and the settlement those are distinct concepts and the settlement happens on a deferred basis

58:46.160 --> 58:53.120
 so that's how you get scalability is you have lots and lots of messages but that they don't

58:53.120 --> 59:00.080
 settle for a long time they might settle on a net basis on an end of day basis but so that's

59:00.080 --> 59:03.760
 really how it works and then you've fedwire where your average transactions in the millions of

59:03.760 --> 59:08.720
 dollars and there's only a few hundred thousand transactions a day that's sort of an interbank

59:08.720 --> 59:16.080
 settlement network so that's my vision for how i think bitcoin will develop too bitcoin itself

59:16.080 --> 59:21.200
 on the base layer is this slow moving high assurance final settlement network where if you're

59:21.200 --> 59:25.760
 sending money to the other side of the globe to someone you don't trust where you want that

59:25.760 --> 59:31.840
 payment to be final in a short period of time and both counterparties know it's final then you

59:31.840 --> 59:36.880
 would use that but if you wanted to buy coffee you could do it on a second you know second layer

59:37.840 --> 59:44.160
 lightning would be one way there's a bunch of side chains now or you could use you know a more

59:44.160 --> 59:50.160
 centralized solution if you wanted it's kind of a profound idea that in the space of transactions

59:50.160 --> 59:54.880
 when you're buying coffee or buying anything really from merchant or exchanging goods and all

59:54.880 --> 1:00:04.720
 of those kinds of things that most of the time like basic honest behavior human behavior which

1:00:04.720 --> 1:00:10.320
 it does appear that most of our societies is based on the fact that we're all most of us are honest

1:00:11.600 --> 1:00:17.840
 is like stuff is not going to go wrong when you do the transaction and you only need like the base

1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:23.120
 layer whether it's bitcoin whether it's uh i forget the terms you use for the for the credit card

1:00:23.120 --> 1:00:32.960
 version but you need that just to verify just to like resolve any disagreements or shady shit

1:00:33.600 --> 1:00:41.120
 yeah and and that's a really rare occurrence so it's okay for that to be handled uh in this in

1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:47.680
 a small block debate handled at a rate that's much much lower than the rate of the transactions

1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:53.920
 that's a kind of that's a really interesting idea that when we spend money we didn't actually

1:00:53.920 --> 1:00:59.280
 exchange the money most of the time yeah most of the time you're not getting a final settlement

1:00:59.280 --> 1:01:06.560
 when you do a transaction and oftentimes that causes there are there's pluses and minuses on

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:11.440
 the plus side of huge efficiency if you use a credit network like visa but that it's in the

1:01:11.440 --> 1:01:16.640
 name credit right visa is extending you credit right they're kind of guaranteeing your reputation

1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:23.200
 to the merchant but fraud happens all the time right there's always fraud because you have this

1:01:23.200 --> 1:01:30.800
 reversibility right um and so you can you know engage in fraud against the merchant um if you

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:36.000
 have a final settlement there's no possibility for fraud so that's one reason merchants kind of

1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:42.880
 like accepting bitcoin because once you receive an inbound bitcoin payment and you deliver some good

1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:49.600
 or service you know that payment can't be reversed but frankly most of the transactions we

1:01:49.600 --> 1:01:55.280
 you know undertake on a daily basis do not require those strong assurances of final settlement

1:01:55.920 --> 1:02:01.600
 there's one exception which is physical cash with physical cash or the open dime a cash like

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:09.920
 product you actually are getting final settlement but online most online banking transactions most

1:02:09.920 --> 1:02:18.960
 p2p uh digital wallet transactions in the dollar system they're not really final at all you mentioned

1:02:18.960 --> 1:02:25.440
 lightning lightning network what is it what are your thoughts on it and what are your thoughts about

1:02:25.440 --> 1:02:34.000
 any kind of alternatives so lightning is one potential payment solution built on top of bitcoin

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:39.600
 where you have different assurances different transactional assurances but ultimately it's very

1:02:39.600 --> 1:02:44.160
 proximate to the base layer so if something goes wrong you can always basically settle to the base

1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:50.880
 layer just layer two yeah layer two you could say and basically the intuition is it's kind of like

1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:56.320
 opening a bar tab so you go to the bar and you might drink a dozen beers over the course of the night

1:02:56.320 --> 1:03:05.040
 maybe half a dozen and well I guess nobody goes to the bar these days but let's say you did yeah

1:03:05.040 --> 1:03:11.200
 you open a tab and at the end of the night you settle up once you're not necessarily paying

1:03:11.200 --> 1:03:16.480
 each time you get another beer so it's just it's the same idea you're opening a channel

1:03:16.480 --> 1:03:22.080
 an ongoing relationship with your counterparty and so lightning has you open a channel with

1:03:22.080 --> 1:03:26.720
 a counterparty and you're sort of sending back and forth these cryptographic commitments saying

1:03:26.720 --> 1:03:31.120
 you know I agree to send you some bitcoin but you don't necessarily settle each time you make a

1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:36.240
 transaction so you do hundreds of thousands of transactions in a channel the other thing

1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:42.640
 lightning proposes is saying okay well now that we have channels established what if we interlocked

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:47.440
 a number of channels together so if you and I have a channel and you know me and my buddy have a

1:03:47.440 --> 1:03:53.120
 channel my buddy can now pay you because you're you have a relationship through me basically

1:03:53.680 --> 1:03:57.680
 and so lightning is this network this overlay network that sits on top of bitcoin

1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:05.200
 and allows people to transact in a much faster and less frictional way without the need for bitcoin's

1:04:05.200 --> 1:04:12.720
 kind of slow periodic settlement assuming that everything sort of goes well uh do you see any

1:04:12.720 --> 1:04:17.840
 downsides to this like have you seen flaws in the whole system from a security perspective from a

1:04:17.840 --> 1:04:25.840
 scaling perspective any of that or is it is lightning working well it works I've I use it when I

1:04:25.840 --> 1:04:31.520
 initially sold those dice I sold them on lightning it was one of the first merchants to use lightning

1:04:31.520 --> 1:04:37.840
 back in the day the first edition of the dice so people could buy these dice somewhere well they

1:04:37.840 --> 1:04:43.040
 used to be able to haven't made a new edition recently they're very scarce and very special

1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:49.600
 they're like physical NFTs just kind of yeah I mean the flaw with lightning is really that you

1:04:50.240 --> 1:04:54.240
 you know and this can be remedied in a number of ways but you have to sort of pre fund these channels

1:04:54.240 --> 1:04:59.840
 so it's it's a weird concept to have to inject liquidity into a channel in order to accept

1:04:59.840 --> 1:05:06.640
 a payment you know so I'm sure those user experience problems can be solved but it's still

1:05:06.640 --> 1:05:14.560
 uh in a state of relative immaturity so we'll see in terms of other ideas that are uh side

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:19.520
 chains or soft forks of bitcoin you've mentioned something about snow and taproot

1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:27.760
 um what are your thoughts about this update to bitcoin and in terms of its promise to improve

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:33.440
 privacy and scaling so on and what what other things are you interested excited about in terms

1:05:33.440 --> 1:05:40.640
 of the development of bitcoin well snow and taproot that's the first new protocol upgrade since

1:05:40.640 --> 1:05:47.920
 segwit uh in 2017 which was what um laid the groundwork for lightning to be developed basically

1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:55.520
 and snow and taproot is really the first protocol change in three almost four years now so it's

1:05:56.240 --> 1:06:02.480
 we're very excited about it what uh what i mean is there anything interesting to say

1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:08.720
 technically about what are the things that's actually going to improve and maybe on the on the

1:06:08.720 --> 1:06:17.200
 politics side bringing a protocol change uh on bitcoin what does that actually involve yeah i mean

1:06:17.200 --> 1:06:21.360
 it's a huge deal because the last time we tried to make a change to the protocol we had whole

1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:27.600
 civil war over it and it was incredibly difficult to get segwit activated in 2017

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:34.000
 uh and it took all this bricksmanship and threats and all these campaigns and it was this whole thing

1:06:35.120 --> 1:06:39.440
 luckily i think things have quieted down and there's much more consensus that snow taproot

1:06:39.440 --> 1:06:45.600
 is a good change to bitcoin everyone generally supports it but everyone kind of has ptsd over

1:06:45.600 --> 1:06:50.960
 the last time when we tried to change bitcoin and so we're sort of really dithering over how we

1:06:50.960 --> 1:06:56.240
 actually want to implement it so it's taking forever because we're trying to set the protocol

1:06:56.240 --> 1:07:01.920
 for how do you change bitcoin itself and that all of our assumptions went out the window last time

1:07:01.920 --> 1:07:06.960
 so we're trying to reset and decide what is a legitimate way to institute a change to bitcoin

1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:12.000
 so that's actually the big question right now it's not should we implement these changes we

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:16.960
 basically all agree that we should it's a meta question is what's the valid way to implement

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:22.640
 new changes to bitcoin what's the way that is scalable in the long term and will last and people

1:07:22.640 --> 1:07:28.560
 will consider credible even if this one isn't controversial at all so that's where we're at

1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:34.320
 we're basically debating over how do we implement this change that we all want to get a feeling of

1:07:34.320 --> 1:07:40.640
 how slow bitcoin governance is and how deliberate it is everybody collectively wants the change

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:45.600
 but we haven't fully agreed on how we're going to put it into bitcoin so it's the classic sort of

1:07:45.600 --> 1:07:51.680
 bitcoin situation but what it is is i mean schnore is an alternative signature scheme i think it was

1:07:51.680 --> 1:07:58.800
 encumbered by a patent and it had only just been unencumbered when satoshi created bitcoin i believe

1:07:59.760 --> 1:08:02.800
 it's a better signature scheme than elliptic curves which is what

1:08:03.840 --> 1:08:11.200
 than ecdsa which is what bitcoin uses and so it's been long enough that we now trust it you know

1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:17.200
 kind of in cryptography it's meant to be lindy you know it's sort of you want to test it over time

1:08:17.200 --> 1:08:22.240
 and then it's considered safe to use so schnore has been around for long enough that

1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:27.360
 we've decided to rip out ecdsa and insert schnore which is just a different signature scheme which

1:08:27.360 --> 1:08:33.040
 is more efficient and it has better properties like if you want to do a multi signature transaction

1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:39.840
 where many people collectively sign in order to permission to spend that would be more efficient

1:08:39.840 --> 1:08:48.080
 in a bytes sense than ecdsa for instance so it's it's pretty incremental and then taproot is all about

1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:57.120
 having transactional conditions that are sort of withheld from final entry onto the blockchain

1:08:58.400 --> 1:09:08.160
 so it's kind of a way to have more private conditional transactions on bitcoin so both of

1:09:08.160 --> 1:09:14.480
 them i would say are incremental changes is this an over exaggeration that schnore to

1:09:14.480 --> 1:09:19.120
 approve my improved privacy and scaling which is it like at the high level things that people

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:26.480
 mention is that just like a dramatic way of trying to frame what's fundamentally an incremental

1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:30.720
 improvement yes but incremental is the word right it's not we're not going to get an order

1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:36.560
 of magnitude enhancement to either privacy or scaling but we will get a considerable enhancement

1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:42.080
 but privacy and scaling are actually two sides the same coin because you get more transactional

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:47.280
 privacy by removing data from the ledger so that there's less metadata for people to

1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:53.840
 surveil and analyze and that's also you scale by compressing and being really space efficient

1:09:54.720 --> 1:10:00.720
 with transactions and the more parsimonious you are the more economically dense dense each

1:10:00.720 --> 1:10:07.120
 byte that everyone has to retain on the ledger is and so those are you know very closely allied

1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:16.720
 concepts so do you mind if we go through some potential criticisms of bitcoin totally this

1:10:16.720 --> 1:10:24.320
 i spent the last five years you know tackling these every day so the dice the same those two

1:10:24.320 --> 1:10:31.200
 are the same yeah there are three additions so let's go okay go with the dice what do we got

1:10:31.200 --> 1:10:38.000
 silk road was that mean road classic classic situation so i mean that was the dark net

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:44.240
 marketplace set up by ross albrecht in the early days of bitcoin that's one of the first killer

1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:50.080
 apps for bitcoin was being the the payments network behind this dark net marketplace and

1:10:50.080 --> 1:10:55.760
 you know where you'd go to buy drugs and things and so that became associated with bitcoin if

1:10:55.760 --> 1:11:01.280
 you remember the press coverage from back then but over time that faded and it became less of a critique

1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:07.840
 but so like the the critique is that bitcoin is something you would use for illegal activity

1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:13.440
 for drugs for crimes all those kinds of things as opposed to for any kind of legitimate transactions

1:11:13.440 --> 1:11:19.600
 in the merchant transactions and today bitcoin settles 10 billion dollars a day and the vast vast

1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:25.280
 majority of it is you know completely legitimate it's just a useful alternative system but back

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:31.440
 then a huge fraction of all bitcoin transactions were related to the basically illicit market

1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:39.440
 places and if you're just tuning in this incredible 12 sided die has 11 common criticisms of bitcoin

1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:45.040
 that nick yeah in a genius way has put together maybe you could do a couple more

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:53.680
 oh so that it was uh satoshi something satoshi coins satoshi coins we when we touched on that

1:11:53.680 --> 1:12:02.080
 early in the episode what if satoshi returns and sells all of their coins so we don't know for sure

1:12:02.080 --> 1:12:08.160
 how many coins satoshi actually mined or produced because there's a degree of probabilistic analysis

1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:16.400
 that you would do there's a few few thousand blocks that were mined by what we think is

1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:22.000
 a single entity in sort of 2009 and so if you add them all up you get to about a million so people

1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:27.680
 think that satoshi mined a million coins and then they're worried that satoshi would return and

1:12:27.680 --> 1:12:34.880
 market sell all the coins thus crushing the price of bitcoin so looking at some of these

1:12:34.880 --> 1:12:45.360
 uh no ceo i think we did we see we've already hit on the uh no merchants that that's no longer

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:53.920
 talking about that yeah uh there's a scalability one and i think that one is addressed the idea

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:59.040
 that you're mentioning with the block size debates and the lightning network that by adding extra

1:12:59.040 --> 1:13:07.120
 layers on top you can do you can achieve scalability that's my vision that's my theory um and you know

1:13:07.120 --> 1:13:12.240
 you can do it in a permissionless and a permissioned way like coinbase is a big bitcoin exchange

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:17.840
 they provide scalability they're a financial institution you know you can settle up internally

1:13:17.840 --> 1:13:24.080
 on their own database and then you know periodically settled to bitcoin so oh so they don't uh they do

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:28.880
 something like the lightning network internally so something like this a real kind of mechanism well

1:13:28.880 --> 1:13:34.080
 honestly i'm not sure exactly how works they might have that built in but just generally speaking

1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:40.320
 institutional scaling is a model for scaling right where you could have banks holding bitcoin and

1:13:40.320 --> 1:13:45.920
 they issue notes against bitcoin and those are your payments and then the base layer is the

1:13:45.920 --> 1:13:53.840
 settlement layer i think that's what you're getting with the boiling oceans is this is like the impact

1:13:53.840 --> 1:14:02.560
 on um weather on the environment on the environment so uh you know that that is a concern that people

1:14:02.560 --> 1:14:07.440
 have in terms of like the proof of work requires that there's a lot of computational resources and

1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:13.040
 being used and that requires a lot of energy and like some large percentage of the world's

1:14:13.040 --> 1:14:19.200
 energy is used to to mine bitcoin what's how how would you respond to that criticism yeah i mean

1:14:19.200 --> 1:14:24.480
 that's been the loudest critique of bitcoin this year in the press this year really yeah so i mean

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:31.280
 it's not like a new criticism but bitcoin is consuming more energy than ever so as the price

1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:39.200
 rises the electricity consumption rises and so we've we've we've heard renewed uh you know

1:14:39.200 --> 1:14:44.880
 belly aching over this for sure i mean it's if you don't believe that bitcoin is useful then

1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:51.200
 you're inclined to think that all the energy consumption is a waste so that's you know it's

1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:57.360
 it it's something that's sort of unrebotable if you fundamentally contest the validity of the

1:14:57.360 --> 1:15:06.320
 bitcoin system so if bitcoin is like a thing that will take over will become like the main

1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:13.680
 mechanism of financial transactions or transactions period in the world then you say well the cost of

1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:18.320
 energy use is actually quite low relative to the benefit it provides if you think it's not going to

1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:27.040
 be if it's just a volatile way to to make a little money in the short term then you see the energy

1:15:27.040 --> 1:15:34.080
 use is really wasteful it's totally spurious yeah so so then there's no really response i suppose

1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:39.920
 that's so i can totally you know get into the details of bitcoin's energy mix and things like

1:15:39.920 --> 1:15:44.960
 that but that's like at a high level what the debate is it's this normative question like

1:15:44.960 --> 1:15:50.240
 does bitcoin have an entitlement to consume any of the world's resources and that's actually where

1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:57.200
 the debate should end much of the time because a lot of people fundamentally dispute the the

1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:03.120
 validity or usefulness of bitcoin as a system and so of course they're gonna consider the energy

1:16:03.120 --> 1:16:09.680
 usage illegitimate now there's a lot of mitigating factors if you you know think the bitcoin is

1:16:09.680 --> 1:16:16.320
 potentially a useful system which is bitcoin consumes energy in a very peculiar way which

1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:25.200
 virtually no other industry does which is that bitcoin is a geography independent buyer of energy

1:16:25.200 --> 1:16:31.360
 which is not how we humans typically consume energy like we need energy to be produced

1:16:31.360 --> 1:16:37.360
 near to population centers and we needed to be produced at the you know corresponding to the

1:16:37.360 --> 1:16:42.960
 peaks and troughs of our consumption right because we have to 100% match the demand in the supply at

1:16:42.960 --> 1:16:50.960
 all times right otherwise we have blackouts so bitcoin doesn't care about any of that it just

1:16:50.960 --> 1:16:58.080
 buys energy on a constant basis and so it's you know indifferent to where it's being produced and so

1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:04.640
 the the consequence of all that is that bitcoin will buy energy that's otherwise being wasted

1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:11.040
 basically so it will buy so called stranded energy assets that would not make it to a population

1:17:11.040 --> 1:17:18.400
 center and in fact most energy produced is ultimately does not sort of make it to you

1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:25.920
 know your your socket in your wall and so this is why so much bitcoin is mine in china for instance

1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:31.200
 it's not because you know chinese industrialists had a special affinity for bitcoin it's because

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:37.520
 the chinese grid had a massive overabundance of energy in particularly in four provinces

1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:43.680
 situan yunnan in amongolia and zhengjing so in those four provinces those are all

1:17:44.400 --> 1:17:50.400
 pretty distant from major population centers so because of that you can't really transport the

1:17:50.400 --> 1:17:55.840
 energy that easily and so huge amounts of energy are curtailed or basically wasted in all these

1:17:55.840 --> 1:18:01.920
 provinces and so miners set up shop there because they could mine bitcoin with the excess energy

1:18:01.920 --> 1:18:06.640
 they could monetize this thing that otherwise was going to go to waste so you know there's things

1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:12.640
 like that which you know i think mitigate the the reality bitcoin is not really rival

1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:19.440
 with our consumption of electricity it's not depriving anyone of electricity it's mostly

1:18:19.440 --> 1:18:23.680
 these stranded assets that are going into supporting the bitcoin network

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:30.320
 so maybe let's do a last one since you mentioned china says china control so if so much mining

1:18:30.320 --> 1:18:38.480
 is happening in china how do we not uh how do we prevent nation states from controlling much

1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:44.080
 of bitcoin yeah that's the flip side of a large portion of the blocks being mined in china due

1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:49.600
 to this energy feature which i discussed which is that there's a lot of chinese miners for sure

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:56.720
 now the question ultimately is what degree of control do miners have over the bitcoin system

1:18:56.720 --> 1:19:04.320
 right and that was part of the block size debate i mean the miners there when we implemented

1:19:04.320 --> 1:19:10.080
 segregated witness in in 2017 the miners just didn't want to do it eventually the users the

1:19:10.080 --> 1:19:16.400
 regular folks running nodes rebelled and basically said look we're going to implement this whether

1:19:16.400 --> 1:19:22.000
 or not you do it and it was a threat to the valley of bitcoin because if this threat had gone through

1:19:22.000 --> 1:19:26.800
 it could have split bitcoin and it would have been really messy so the miners sort of capitulated

1:19:27.360 --> 1:19:33.520
 so i think the current consensus is that miners do not have unilateral control over bitcoin

1:19:34.480 --> 1:19:39.600
 and that governance is more poised between people that run nodes developers and miners it's sort of

1:19:39.600 --> 1:19:46.640
 a triumvirate where neither of them has you know total control uh so that's my current model for

1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:52.480
 control in bitcoin uh i think if you asked a miner they would tell you they didn't feel that

1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:58.560
 they had sort of unilateral control over bitcoin either almost as a thought experiment can i ask

1:19:58.560 --> 1:20:05.040
 you to think about if you're if some of your predictions some of your analysis some of your

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:11.600
 understanding of bitcoin is wrong in the in the following sense where it will not have the impact

1:20:12.800 --> 1:20:19.680
 that you have a vision for it that it will not to have the scale of impact and perhaps in terms

1:20:19.680 --> 1:20:24.720
 of value will go to zero to something very low and other cryptocurrency or other financial systems

1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:32.560
 will overtake it what would be the reason for that in your mind like why might you be wrong if

1:20:32.560 --> 1:20:40.240
 you look back at it yeah in the future what did you not understand about bitcoin that will result

1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:47.840
 in that yeah that's a great question i think for that to happen one of two things would have to

1:20:47.840 --> 1:20:52.800
 obtain one of two things that have happened for bitcoin to just be irrelevant basically

1:20:54.480 --> 1:21:00.400
 either central banks totally clean up their act and you know stop engaging in rampant money

1:21:00.400 --> 1:21:05.760
 printing which i don't expect that to happen anytime soon i mean it looks like we're normalizing

1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:11.920
 this new regime of inflation you know pro inflation just to remediate the the debt issues we have

1:21:13.120 --> 1:21:18.320
 so that would be one thing that would make bitcoin cryptocurrency much less relevant

1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:24.160
 as if everyone becomes totally assured of the soundness of sovereign currencies basically

1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:30.880
 namely the dollar like the dollar being the main one uh that it seems like we're going

1:21:30.880 --> 1:21:36.400
 in completely opposite direction with most people seem to be noticing the stirrings of inflation in

1:21:36.400 --> 1:21:41.760
 society you might have noticed it too it's showing up in commodity prices lumber prices

1:21:42.480 --> 1:21:48.000
 and food obviously in financial assets and it'll show up in consumer prices generally soon

1:21:49.040 --> 1:21:52.240
 but so that would be one way for bitcoin to basically become irrelevant

1:21:52.240 --> 1:22:00.000
 because it's a you know it's a dialectical thing bitcoin is held in opposition to the

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:07.360
 established monetary regime so if they completely reform themselves and you know the dollar becomes

1:22:07.360 --> 1:22:14.240
 super sound once again and the fed stops tinkering the way they constantly do then uh

1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:19.120
 then we wouldn't need cryptocurrency as much the other thing would be if

1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:27.840
 if a completely superior design for a new sort of state independent monetary system emerged

1:22:28.400 --> 1:22:33.680
 but it's really hard to even imagine how that would come to emerge and there's good reasons

1:22:34.480 --> 1:22:41.280
 to think that bitcoin uh the conditions of its launch were extremely favorable and hard to replicate

1:22:42.240 --> 1:22:48.880
 can you speak to some of those conditions why it's a unique timing wise uh moment for

1:22:48.880 --> 1:22:53.920
 bitcoin to emerge yeah so obviously bitcoin was born in the depths of the financial crisis which

1:22:53.920 --> 1:23:00.800
 gives it a nice nice historical element but that was kind of a coincidence honestly we

1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:08.480
 know that satoshi had been working on it earlier in back or in 2017 um the really special thing

1:23:08.480 --> 1:23:15.920
 about bitcoin was that it was launched anonymously by an entity that did not seek any glory or credit

1:23:15.920 --> 1:23:21.920
 for what they did and apparently never monetized it at all so they never really moved any of their

1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:28.880
 coins satoshi sent one test transaction to uh halfini who's one of the earliest bitcoiners

1:23:29.680 --> 1:23:34.640
 aside from that as far as we know satoshi never spent any of their coins so you have this wonderful

1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:43.280
 promethean quality whereby it's almost self sacrificial i mean it's like this borderline godlike

1:23:43.280 --> 1:23:49.440
 figure in terms of their restraint finds this monetary technology and releases it to the world

1:23:49.440 --> 1:23:55.600
 and pays the price they never took advantage of their filthy lucre you know they never they never

1:23:55.600 --> 1:24:02.160
 recognize any of the 50 billion dollars that they made from bitcoin right uh and satoshi also didn't

1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:07.840
 assign themselves any privileged access uh to the coins you know satoshi could have just written in

1:24:07.840 --> 1:24:13.680
 the code i own 10 percent of the coins but they didn't they just mined in the open free market

1:24:13.680 --> 1:24:18.480
 competition like everyone else it's just that satoshi is an early miner to support the network

1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:23.280
 accumulate a lot of coins for sure but they didn't have any privileged special access

1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:29.440
 so that's one thing that's extremely special about the launch is that we had a founder that

1:24:29.440 --> 1:24:35.360
 was truly committed to the monetary protocol and didn't seek either recognition or financial

1:24:35.360 --> 1:24:42.640
 spoils and then also left you know if satoshi left in 2010 2011 and hasn't really been heard from since

1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:48.640
 it's a very george washington move gangster move where he didn't want power and once he got power

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:55.680
 he let go of it precisely that was a key actually move what one that was that was uh probably one

1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:59.600
 of the most important moves at the founding of this country that's right george washington could

1:24:59.600 --> 1:25:05.600
 have been a king uh probably if he'd wanted and satoshi could have been uh gerome powell if he'd

1:25:05.600 --> 1:25:12.080
 wanted and satoshi could have held on to power indefinitely but chose to leave the other thing

1:25:12.080 --> 1:25:21.200
 is that bitcoin circulated for a long period of time from january 2009 to about july 2010 without

1:25:21.200 --> 1:25:26.960
 really having a financial value so there weren't really any marketplaces it didn't have a value

1:25:26.960 --> 1:25:33.120
 and so that gave it this really great distribution you know among a broad set of stakeholders

1:25:33.760 --> 1:25:38.640
 and there were no venture funds or hedge funds you know trying to aggressively buy up all the

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:44.240
 supply back then now when you have new cryptocurrencies launched they're like aggressively pre

1:25:44.240 --> 1:25:51.360
 mined and some gigantic silicon valley venture fund is going to own 30 of it and so it's sort of

1:25:51.360 --> 1:25:58.480
 impossible to conceive of how that could become a global money because how could you know a silicon

1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:04.160
 valley investment firm own 30 of the money supply that doesn't make sense that's just so

1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:11.920
 oligarchical right it's unbelievable so bitcoin by contract is a very bottom up thing it was

1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:19.440
 the early enthusiasts uh people that were you know really um excited about the technology

1:26:19.440 --> 1:26:25.360
 they're the ones that obtained those early coins and so there was a real element of fairness and

1:26:25.360 --> 1:26:30.880
 just an organic nature to its launch which would be incredibly hard to recapture today let's say

1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:38.400
 satoshi came back and they said okay i made bitcoin 2.0 i'm gonna release it there'd be the

1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:46.240
 most aggressive land grab ever by you know gigantic pools of capital to sort of get favorable

1:26:46.240 --> 1:26:55.200
 allocations of the new system right can satoshi with bitcoin 2.0 build in a resistance mechanism

1:26:55.200 --> 1:27:01.360
 or a prevention mechanism for the land grab it would be hard to because you know if you have

1:27:01.360 --> 1:27:05.440
 capital and resources i mean if it was a proof of work chain you'd just have people that would

1:27:05.440 --> 1:27:10.640
 invest a ton of money in mining for instance but most new blockchain cryptocurrencies are just

1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:18.080
 sold basically they're you know issued in token offerings kind of thing so so it's hard to enforce

1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:23.760
 through the protocol the decentralization of control yeah our it'd be challenging to and people

1:27:23.760 --> 1:27:29.120
 have tried to do airdrops you know where they you know distribute coins a large number of people

1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:34.880
 basically doesn't work most people don't care about the airdrop so it's hard to have an equitable

1:27:34.880 --> 1:27:41.600
 distribution i think the conditions of bitcoin's launch were so lucky and favorable that they're

1:27:41.600 --> 1:27:47.280
 very unlikely to be replicated so i do think it's going to be a real challenge to ever have a new

1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:54.320
 competitor that's as decentralized as leaderless as dispersed sort of distributed as bitcoin is

1:27:54.320 --> 1:28:00.800
 has its credibility i don't know how you could overrule it on those important features what about

1:28:00.800 --> 1:28:09.680
 bitcoin's comparison to other current cryptocurrency so bitcoin versus ethereum for example why is it

1:28:09.680 --> 1:28:14.720
 possible that ethereum overtakes bitcoin that's certainly possible yeah i'm not ruling it out

1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:21.840
 ethereum leadership is sort of wise enough to understand that they shouldn't compete with bitcoin

1:28:22.400 --> 1:28:30.480
 on those most profound qualities like ethereum doesn't really aspire to be more sound from

1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:34.800
 a monetary perspective than bitcoin right the in fact the ethereum leadership are sort of

1:28:34.800 --> 1:28:40.320
 constantly tweaking the monetary policy so they went for a completely different tradeoff right

1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:46.960
 they also don't compete to be as decentralized from a governance perspective right because

1:28:46.960 --> 1:28:53.680
 there's leadership there's an eth foundation there's a charismatic leader of italic and ethereum

1:28:53.680 --> 1:29:00.080
 has this policy of hard forks so in bitcoin hard forks are extremely rare in ethereum that it's

1:29:00.080 --> 1:29:06.400
 the default way to change things so it's a much more adaptive system and it changes more frequently

1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:11.440
 but that also means that it's sort of they're incurring more risk when they introduce those

1:29:11.440 --> 1:29:17.840
 changes there's much more complexity so ethereum is smart because they sort of understood bitcoin

1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:24.560
 as the top dog when it comes to a sound money a digital gold type thing and they went for all

1:29:24.560 --> 1:29:30.960
 of the different tradeoffs they wanted to be more of a platform they wanted to have more complexity

1:29:30.960 --> 1:29:36.560
 the transactional layer they wanted to take on more risk in terms of changing the protocol they

1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:45.040
 wanted to change more quickly they wanted to make the monetary policy more mutable so ethereum takes

1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:49.840
 that completely different tack of course you know not ruling out that it could take over bitcoin

1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:55.760
 from a market cap perspective it's just a very different system and i tend to think

1:29:55.760 --> 1:30:01.520
 that bitcoin is the most disruptive one because it's the most equipped to challenge sovereign

1:30:01.520 --> 1:30:08.800
 currencies in the grand scheme do you think they can coexist so like in the future is do you see a

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:17.440
 world where you know ethereum captures some large percent of the market and but nevertheless the

1:30:17.440 --> 1:30:24.560
 minority a hundred percent a hundred percent bitcoin has already been tokenized and put onto

1:30:24.560 --> 1:30:30.400
 ethereum many units of bitcoin i think over a billion dollars worth so none of them do they

1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:36.880
 coexist they are actually mutualistic so they're like two creatures that have this you know it's

1:30:36.880 --> 1:30:43.440
 like the rhino and like the bird the pex the parasites off the rhino's back whatever yeah

1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:48.400
 right so i don't know which is which in the analogy but yeah i don't know who the parasites are

1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:56.720
 yeah or you know the alligator and the teeth cleaning fish or whatever right so you know i

1:30:56.720 --> 1:31:01.920
 always wonder why the alligator doesn't just eat the fish but uh i guess they're brushing its teeth

1:31:01.920 --> 1:31:08.720
 basically so ethereum is it gives you more transactional flexibility there's much more

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:14.880
 experimentation happening there it has this whole decentralized finance element there's a huge number

1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:20.880
 of bitcoins that circulate on the ethereum protocol right because ethereum is open to other asset

1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:27.600
 types basically so i think that's actually a creative to both systems because ethereum gets

1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:33.440
 to have this good form of collateral bitcoin on the system which is good volatility characteristics

1:31:33.440 --> 1:31:41.360
 and then it's a supply sink for bitcoins which are sort of now they're injected into this third party

1:31:41.360 --> 1:31:48.000
 protocol and that i think reduces the velocity of bitcoin over on it's probably good for the valuation

1:31:48.880 --> 1:31:53.520
 so you see it's it quite possibly could be a symbiotic relationship that's really interesting

1:31:53.520 --> 1:32:02.160
 i think so i think so uh what are your thoughts about uh vitalik buterin what are your thoughts about

1:32:02.160 --> 1:32:09.200
 some of the other figures in the space outside of bitcoin i think vitalik made some mistakes with

1:32:09.200 --> 1:32:15.440
 ethereum ultimately like i disagree with some of the decisions that were made along the way like

1:32:15.440 --> 1:32:21.600
 there's this infamous case of this bailout where 14 percent of ether was lost in the smart contract

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:27.200
 or really the this smart contract that a lot of ethereum leadership were sort of backing and

1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:35.840
 supporting was hacked and then the foundation with vitalik support chose to make a change to the

1:32:35.840 --> 1:32:45.840
 underlying protocol to undo the hack right so to me that was not the most prudent approach

1:32:45.840 --> 1:32:53.360
 because you're basically violating the core protocol rules in order to undo you know to

1:32:53.360 --> 1:32:59.440
 bail out a specific contract which has failed granted there was a lot of ether in there but

1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:05.520
 i think that shook the credibility of the ethereum system that happened back in 2016 i think uh that

1:33:05.520 --> 1:33:12.720
 was one reason why i i became disenchanted with ethereum so basically even if in that case that

1:33:12.720 --> 1:33:21.680
 might fix an important problem that opens the door to centralized like manipulation of the protocol

1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:27.120
 in the future yeah it basically demonstrates that there's certain elites at the protocol level

1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:34.480
 that can exercise specific control over the system and you know a lot of people have lost

1:33:34.480 --> 1:33:40.880
 money in hacks on ethereum and a lot of contracts have gone south huge amount of value but they

1:33:40.880 --> 1:33:47.840
 didn't get a bailout and it was just when you know this specific contract called the dao dao

1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:55.200
 uh was hacked that you know the leadership intervened and you know to their credit they

1:33:55.200 --> 1:34:01.760
 haven't had a significant intervention or bailout since then but it did normalize the practice

1:34:01.760 --> 1:34:07.680
 and i think it weakened the social contract so i would prefer that you sort of bite the bullet

1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:14.800
 in that situation and you accept the failure of that contract there'll be a ballsy move to bite

1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:19.120
 that bullet yeah i mean and then you would have had like what they thought was a malicious entity

1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:24.960
 and control of a lot of coins i think the real reason they sort of felt that they had to undo

1:34:24.960 --> 1:34:30.240
 it was because they'd always planned to move to this proof of stake world where your political

1:34:30.240 --> 1:34:35.600
 control over the system is a function of your wealth in the system and they didn't want this

1:34:35.600 --> 1:34:42.480
 attacker which would have inherited all this significant wealth to have influence over that

1:34:42.480 --> 1:34:49.280
 future proof of stake version that's sort of my theory yeah i mean that makes sense this it kind

1:34:49.280 --> 1:34:57.440
 of reminds me of the bailout of car companies you know this is difficult there's a lot of people

1:34:57.440 --> 1:35:03.840
 that criticize the bailout of these large companies you know but creative destruction i mean i was

1:35:03.840 --> 1:35:10.160
 critical of the bailouts that happened during covid i mean i generally think that it's healthier

1:35:10.160 --> 1:35:17.280
 for society for bad firms that aren't making money to fail or be reorganized under the various you

1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:24.080
 know forms of bankruptcy and you saw what happens you see the you know in the corporate sector in

1:35:24.080 --> 1:35:31.520
 japan in the 90s there's this like slow motion and solvency where basically firms weren't allowed

1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:37.680
 to fail and the japanese corporate sector lost competitiveness because bad firms did not fail

1:35:37.680 --> 1:35:45.280
 and so you know the process of actual capitalism for the market clearing didn't occur so i'm always

1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:52.240
 in support of you know of the free market being allowed to clear for non profitable firms to fail

1:35:52.880 --> 1:35:59.840
 it's complicated man because uh creative destruction seems to be in the long term a positive

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:09.840
 but human civilization is such that short term pain has real impact on people you know

1:36:09.840 --> 1:36:14.800
 yeah policymakers don't ever want to incur that short term pain because they have a short term

1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:22.720
 outlook and term limits often so but and also just it's short term pain forget policy makers

1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:31.040
 forget politicians it sucks to lose a job for an individual you know you could say the company

1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:36.400
 you know created destruction of a company means the company was inefficient and that's going to

1:36:36.400 --> 1:36:40.800
 have a ripple effect of teaching everybody else what an efficient operation looks like

1:36:41.440 --> 1:36:46.720
 but like there's jobs that are being lost there's families that have to suffer because of that i mean

1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:53.520
 i mean that's a tension we live in society is having a basic safety net for our world

1:36:55.040 --> 1:37:02.160
 because there's a level beyond which like if through creative destruction that you have

1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:07.760
 some percent of the population that dips below a certain level that you would call like suffering

1:37:08.400 --> 1:37:14.080
 we don't want that and that's a difficult thing to live with like yes in the long term

1:37:14.080 --> 1:37:22.480
 term you want inefficiency to be destroyed and efficiency to be rewarded but there there does

1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:28.560
 seem to be a base level of like quality of life that we want to uphold that's a difficult thing

1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:36.640
 to think about i think about that a lot there's a doctor called paul farmer that you know there's

1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:45.200
 like a in hady or in africa there's a child who's dying and as a doctor you want to give everything

1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:52.800
 you have all the money you have to save that one child but there you know and you do actually but

1:37:52.800 --> 1:38:02.000
 that's a that's a very human action it's not an economic it's not a it's not a rational action

1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:06.560
 from a game theoretic perspective because there's no way you can take that action for every child

1:38:06.560 --> 1:38:11.200
 who's suffering but there's something deeply human about doing that for that one particular child

1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:19.920
 in that same sense creative destruction is an economic principle but it's not it's not necessarily

1:38:19.920 --> 1:38:26.640
 that same kind of human principle and there's a tension there i i see it i mean i think that's the

1:38:26.640 --> 1:38:31.360
 that's the issue with modern central banking really is that the central bank always has an

1:38:31.360 --> 1:38:37.600
 incentive to lower interest rates and they've been doing that from the 70s towards today on this you

1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:43.440
 know well 80s really on this slow march down because whenever there was a hint of a crisis

1:38:43.440 --> 1:38:50.240
 in the economy or financial asset prices started to fall their reaction is okay well inject more

1:38:50.240 --> 1:38:56.800
 capital into the economy we'll save it but i my view is that these palliative short term measures

1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:01.760
 cause the buildup of a huge amount of fragility in the long term and then the ultimate collapse is

1:39:01.760 --> 1:39:08.240
 much worse than the counterfactual situation where you raised interest rates you you know you took

1:39:08.240 --> 1:39:14.640
 your medicine and the economy was healthier so and that's sort of that's why you know people

1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:20.000
 like Ray Dahlia point out that you have these long term debt cycles and we're sort of at the end of

1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:27.360
 one now is because we couldn't take our medicine we couldn't you know let interest rates clear

1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:32.800
 we constantly wanted to ward off any you know difficulty and we didn't ever want to

1:39:32.800 --> 1:39:40.800
 deleverage truly and then when the when the debt crisis happens and it hits it's you know horrendously

1:39:40.800 --> 1:39:51.200
 bad so do you think bitcoin might reach a million dollars in value it's uh it's having a current

1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:59.360
 resurgence a crazy one in 2021 in the recent months of over 60 000 i guess it is now do you

1:39:59.360 --> 1:40:03.520
 think it's possible it goes over 100 000 do you think it's possible it goes to a million you

1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:09.680
 can't rule anything out with bitcoin so i mean i'm not you know wanted to put price targets on it but

1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:14.480
 one way it could reach a million dollars is bitcoin's value stays unchanged in real terms

1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:21.840
 and dollar and precious dollar depreciates against it um not that i expect hyperinflation but yeah i

1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:26.320
 mean like bitcoin is worth about one tenth uh slightly under one tenth the value of all the

1:40:26.320 --> 1:40:32.720
 gold in the world and uh you know gold is worth 10 trillion 11 trillion dollars in the aggregate

1:40:32.720 --> 1:40:39.360
 do i think bitcoin can be more culturally and economically salient than gold in two decades

1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:47.280
 time 100 percent bitcoin was unknown 12 years ago and today 100 million people worldwide own

1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:54.080
 bitcoin so just extrapolate that what is the level of penetration you think we'll get 500 million

1:40:54.080 --> 1:41:03.120
 500 million a billion you know you can easily tune these adoption curves however you like i i don't

1:41:03.120 --> 1:41:09.520
 think it's done you know monetizing and being adopted globally you think it become it can become

1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:15.280
 like the base layer for a lot of our financial operation like to become the main base layer for

1:41:15.280 --> 1:41:21.840
 all our transactions so like even even banks will use bitcoin essentially and like visa would use

1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:26.880
 bitcoin as the base layer like it would actually operate very similarly at the at the surface

1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:32.400
 layer but at the base layer would all be bitcoin that's precisely what i expect and banks and visa

1:41:32.400 --> 1:41:40.000
 are already using bitcoin so visa has embraced bitcoin in a really big way actually and it's

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:45.200
 always funny to the people saying bitcoin has to change in a certain way so it can compete with visa

1:41:45.200 --> 1:41:53.440
 no visa adopted bitcoin right paypal adopted bitcoin square adopted bitcoin obviously they're

1:41:53.440 --> 1:41:58.560
 not tearing out all of their existing infrastructure but they're totally engaging with this thing

1:41:59.520 --> 1:42:05.840
 banks have now begun they got the green light to provide custody for bitcoin for their depositors

1:42:05.840 --> 1:42:11.920
 that's the first step eventually likes you know it'll have in one of two ways either bitcoin

1:42:11.920 --> 1:42:17.360
 native financial institutions will become banks that's already happening there's bitcoin exchanges

1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:22.800
 that have gotten banking licenses or banks themselves will start to engage with bitcoin

1:42:22.800 --> 1:42:30.160
 as a reserve asset it'll converge either way that's totally happening and yes i mean i don't think

1:42:30.160 --> 1:42:34.800
 bitcoin is going to power every financial transaction i think it'll coexist alongside

1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:41.360
 sovereign currencies but i think it's a great reserve asset it's a very powerful asset to

1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:47.440
 build a financial system on top of because it's highly highly auditable it's something that you

1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:52.720
 can take physical delivery of very cheaply and those are great qualities if you're a depositor

1:42:52.720 --> 1:42:58.480
 in a bank they can prove to you how much bitcoin they have they can't really easily prove you know

1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:03.760
 in the old system how much gold they held on deposit and you can easily conduct a run on the

1:43:03.760 --> 1:43:10.000
 bank you can hold them accountable because you can withdraw it because you know making bitcoin

1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:14.400
 transaction is pretty easy at the end of the day unlike fiat currency it's like kind of

1:43:14.400 --> 1:43:19.680
 you can't really withdraw all your dollars from the bank i mean you sort of can but you're not

1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:26.480
 going to want to take delivery of pounds of cash or anything like that so it's a good modern asset

1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:34.080
 upon which to build a financial system basically you you measure square and visa sort of investing

1:43:34.080 --> 1:43:39.520
 in bitcoin what do you make of probably one of the higher profile big investments in bitcoin

1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:45.680
 which is tesla and ilan musk but there's also a few billionaires like chamath and all them investing

1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:49.280
 what do you make of this whole movement why do you think they're doing it i mean tesla is an

1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:54.880
 interesting case why do you think tesla is putting uh i'm buying so much bitcoin i honestly don't

1:43:54.880 --> 1:44:01.440
 know and i would love to truly know ilan's genuine thoughts on bitcoin um because he's kind of sending

1:44:01.440 --> 1:44:08.880
 us mixed messages honestly with his embrace of dogecoin which is sort of playful not exactly

1:44:08.880 --> 1:44:13.520
 sure what point he's trying to make there so you were involved with dogecoin you mentioned offline

1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:19.440
 a little bit in like in the early days or at least like played around with it what do you make of

1:44:19.440 --> 1:44:26.080
 dogecoin what do you make of ilan and doge what do you make of this particular meme coin is it

1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:35.280
 is it one like a legitimate cryptocurrency or is it two like a funny internet way of saying

1:44:35.280 --> 1:44:41.760
 fu to the man yeah it's it's a good question i mean so i wasn't like a figurehead in dogecoin

1:44:41.760 --> 1:44:46.960
 or anything but that was totally my introduction to crypto was mining dogecoin in my dorm room

1:44:47.600 --> 1:44:53.680
 and then tipping people online in dogecoin which i just thought was the funniest thing

1:44:55.840 --> 1:45:02.080
 so i guess i was really easy to entertain back in 2013 but it was very playful at the time there

1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:08.320
 was a culture around dogecoin and the people liked it because it was in opposition to the bitcoin

1:45:08.320 --> 1:45:14.640
 culture which was really serious and involved lots of austrian economics and rothbard and hyac and

1:45:14.640 --> 1:45:21.040
 stuff like that so that was my introduction to cryptocurrency was because i thought the bitcoin

1:45:21.040 --> 1:45:26.400
 people were pretty lame yeah and they were like way too serious about all this stuff and i was like

1:45:26.400 --> 1:45:31.120
 okay i'll just be a part of the dogecoin community and they did all these funny publicity stunts like

1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:37.760
 they paid to send the jamaican bobsled team to the olympics you know like great stuff like they

1:45:37.760 --> 1:45:43.600
 put the dogecoin logo on top of a nascar car yeah um and i just that tickled me so much because it's

1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:48.960
 like this made up internet coin this was back when crypto was pretty novel and still like kind of

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:56.000
 funny and stuff and that was really entertaining fast forward seven eight years dogecoin is way

1:45:56.000 --> 1:46:02.880
 less entertaining now frankly because it's the leadership left the community spirit evaporated

1:46:04.160 --> 1:46:09.040
 um the meme didn't persist i mean doge itself is not really a contemporary meme right i mean it's an

1:46:09.040 --> 1:46:14.560
 old meme although that new refresh of the meme like doge haven't heard that name in a long time

1:46:14.560 --> 1:46:21.440
 like or doge is like in a hat smoking a cigarette i mean there's some sense where elon is reinvigorating

1:46:21.440 --> 1:46:28.080
 the meme and it's funny because like one influential figure could do just that which

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:33.280
 just speaks to the tension that you're talking about like tessa is investing bitcoin and yet

1:46:33.280 --> 1:46:40.800
 elon he also tweets about bitcoin but yeah he's i mean who am i to question the meme right like

1:46:40.800 --> 1:46:46.080
 yeah i i can't you know dissect internet culture and pedantically sit here and tell you it's an

1:46:46.080 --> 1:46:52.560
 invalid meme yeah you know if if people believe in it then it's real is there a space for meme coins

1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:59.760
 at this at this time like like doge or somebody somebody else to almost like um you know there's

1:46:59.760 --> 1:47:06.320
 it does serve a lot of purposes which is like you said it pulls in people into this whole space of

1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:12.880
 digital currency and digital in uh and into cryptocurrency allow them to explore allow them

1:47:12.880 --> 1:47:18.640
 to have fun as opposed to taking everything very seriously is there still space for that yeah yeah

1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:26.000
 and i mean the crypto landscape is very broad today so whatever you know cultural element you seek

1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:32.160
 to find within crypto you will find it was a bit different in 2013 because bitcoin was kind of the

1:47:32.160 --> 1:47:38.480
 only game in town there were a couple alt coins and so doge coin made a lot of sense as a counterpart

1:47:38.480 --> 1:47:44.160
 to bitcoin as a less serious counterpart today crypto is just this like gigantic cultural and

1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:52.240
 economic trend so it's you know very multifaceted doge coin is one of the many you know ways that

1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:58.560
 people have to engage with it i think a lot of people that buy doge coin based on elons implied

1:47:58.560 --> 1:48:04.400
 guidance are going to lose money because fundamentally there's nothing enduring about doge coin it's an

1:48:04.400 --> 1:48:11.520
 ancient fork of bitcoin it's unmaintained there you know it's probably at risk actually from a

1:48:11.520 --> 1:48:18.720
 protocol perspective it's merge mined with light coin i think um if there was an inflation bug on

1:48:18.720 --> 1:48:24.880
 doge coin it's unclear who would sort of be able to remediate that you know so it's not technologically

1:48:25.680 --> 1:48:32.720
 very sound um so i wouldn't recommend that anyone stores wealth in it you know yes it's funny because

1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:39.280
 cryptocurrency like my interest in cryptocurrency is in the exploration of technical ideas

1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:49.440
 but cryptocurrency is also like in the case of doge coin like for lulls at least originally

1:48:49.440 --> 1:48:59.520
 like a meme coin but it's also a mechanism for investment and so those are sometimes a tension

1:48:59.520 --> 1:49:07.280
 and and it's unclear sort of like yeah you know there's the meme with doge has almost

1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:12.320
 become to take it to i guess to a dollar trying to drive the price of the value up to a dollar

1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:19.280
 but you know implied in that is like this overlap of the meme coin and like legitimate

1:49:19.280 --> 1:49:26.480
 investment and so you have a lot of young people i think who almost start getting greedy and want

1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:33.520
 to make money like as opposed to uh having fun and that becomes a different beast then because

1:49:33.520 --> 1:49:41.040
 you're essentially making financial decisions that can have a long lasting like you know money is

1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:50.080
 freedom and uh if you make stupid financial decisions it you can remove freedom from your life

1:49:50.080 --> 1:49:55.840
 and that's it can be detrimental in that sense so i don't uh it's difficult i don't know what

1:49:55.840 --> 1:50:00.800
 to do with that with that set of ideas because a lot of cryptocurrency including bitcoin is very

1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:08.000
 volatile because it's new so you're trying to figure out the space of like what's actually

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:14.160
 going to be a large part of like you speak of network effects like what's going to take over

1:50:14.160 --> 1:50:20.240
 the world and through that process there's going to be a lot of volatility and if you're

1:50:20.240 --> 1:50:29.040
 just talking about cryptocurrency as an investment mechanism then it can have a real detrimental

1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:35.360
 effects on people's lives yeah and that's really the challenge with operating in the crypto space

1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:41.120
 talking about it overlaid on top of everything that's interesting politically or culturally

1:50:41.120 --> 1:50:48.400
 about it is the financial incentive yeah and so you know it's not all fun and games because

1:50:48.400 --> 1:50:55.840
 there are literally billions over a trillion dollars at stake now so if you buy dogecoin because

1:50:55.840 --> 1:51:01.920
 some influencer on tiktok said so yeah you've now made a financial decision right so i'm not

1:51:01.920 --> 1:51:08.960
 going to scold any dogecoin buyers or any crypto asset buyer for that matter but be aware that

1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:14.240
 there are like billions of dollars of really elite hedge funds that are trying to front run

1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:20.720
 on all of your decisions and evaluate social sentiment things like that so it's a waterfall

1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:26.720
 of sharks basically and by the way if you're listening to this uh don't take this podcast

1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:31.440
 or anything i ever say is financial advice that's definitely not my interest or expertise level

1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:38.320
 now the the interest here is to explore different ideas speaking of which you've written a little

1:51:38.320 --> 1:51:47.920
 bit about nfts i'm interested to hear your opinions on this space of ideas these non fungible tokens

1:51:49.200 --> 1:51:55.920
 they seem to have a cultural impact currently but do they have a long lasting

1:51:56.560 --> 1:52:02.560
 technical financial or cultural impact or is this just a fad what do you what do you think of nfts

1:52:02.560 --> 1:52:09.040
 yeah i think the current enthusiasm for nfts and the financial metrics you see the growth there in

1:52:09.040 --> 1:52:17.520
 that sector is partially a function of where we are in the actual credit cycle so oftentimes when

1:52:17.520 --> 1:52:24.160
 inflationary events occur you have correspondence speculative manias that occur at the same time

1:52:24.160 --> 1:52:30.320
 because people intuitively feel that the fiat currency that they hold is being debased and so

1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:39.920
 they frantically look around for other places to put it so stocks property commodities and then other

1:52:39.920 --> 1:52:47.360
 asset classes nfts or an asset class and this is a case with any inflation you look at in history

1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:55.200
 you saw these correspondence speculative manias basically speculative episodes so a lot of us

1:52:55.200 --> 1:53:00.640
 feel that inflation is occurring whether it's in cpi or not the basically lots of dollars are

1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:06.960
 being injected into the economy we've all seen stocks massively appreciate even as gdp contracted

1:53:07.520 --> 1:53:13.680
 and so a lot of people sort of got caught on to this notion that wow is the fed you know

1:53:13.680 --> 1:53:19.520
 lower interest rates and congress spends a huge amount of stimulus dollars into the economy

1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:25.840
 financial assets going to go up so i better have exposure to all that stuff and so you see virtually

1:53:25.840 --> 1:53:30.800
 every asset class is awash with cash right now people are investing like their lives depend

1:53:30.800 --> 1:53:36.640
 on it investing trading whatever whether it's options volumes on robin hood you know like

1:53:36.640 --> 1:53:42.960
 kind of retail brokerages things like that whether it's stocks whether it's crypto and then other

1:53:42.960 --> 1:53:48.400
 collectibles baseball cards their valuations have been skyrocketing and so i think nfts are part of

1:53:48.400 --> 1:53:55.600
 that it's a new asset class it's basically an opportunity to invest in sort of art or collectibles

1:53:56.400 --> 1:54:03.920
 in game items things like that i think that explains a large degree of the enthusiasm the

1:54:03.920 --> 1:54:10.000
 excitement is that it's a novel asset class that people can trade and right as you know

1:54:10.720 --> 1:54:17.040
 these inflationary tailwinds pick up now is for the sort of virtues of the actual technical

1:54:17.040 --> 1:54:24.960
 phenomenon nfts are actually not a new idea at all so you've had nfts i didn't call them nfts but

1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:32.160
 in 2016 built on bitcoin for instance so it's been around for a while what it is is a serial code

1:54:32.160 --> 1:54:39.520
 basically a string of data that is inserted onto a public blockchain and then circulates as a unique

1:54:39.520 --> 1:54:45.120
 token and then the question is okay well what does that data refer to what's the external reference

1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:50.880
 and that has to be defined there has to be some entity which says oh yeah this unique string refers

1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:57.920
 to like this piece of art or digital content or you know trading card or whatever so nft the concept

1:54:57.920 --> 1:55:04.480
 itself is like an incredibly broad idea it's just well what if we took you know barcodes and put them

1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:10.160
 on chain so that they could be traded and so they could circulate freely on a peer to peer basis and

1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:17.600
 plugged into exchanges and things like that so that concept is super valid clearly has protocol

1:55:17.600 --> 1:55:24.080
 market fit right people are using it for a really wide array of purposes it's completely going to

1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:33.280
 exist may the valuations contract of nfts in the aggregate definitely possible probably likely but

1:55:33.280 --> 1:55:41.680
 uh but i think the notion of creating enduring collectibles or artworks that have accompanying

1:55:42.320 --> 1:55:46.160
 you know accompanying signatures basically autographed art on the blockchain

1:55:46.880 --> 1:55:53.440
 that has totally been validated i think that won't go away i wonder if there's ideas like

1:55:53.440 --> 1:55:58.240
 big clout for example i don't know if you saw that if there's ideas built on top of this concept

1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:03.040
 it doesn't have to be nft like ethereum nft it could be just the concept of non fungible tokens

1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:11.600
 whether those kinds of things could take hold and they it's less about financial transactions

1:56:11.600 --> 1:56:22.400
 and more about almost like uh i don't i don't know how to put it but like staking identity

1:56:22.400 --> 1:56:29.280
 in some way whether it's big cloud or identity of objects like there might be some way of connecting

1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:34.880
 physical reality and digital reality some interesting ways so just the financial aspect

1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:43.440
 is a way to like put some validity behind the identity i i wonder if there's like ideas there

1:56:43.440 --> 1:56:52.000
 that are yet to be discovered or ideas that yet to be take hold like big cloud seems interesting

1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:58.480
 yeah seems shady as hell seems a little scammy yeah i don't know if i like the idea that you can

1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:05.280
 bet on people essentially right yeah i think my market cap on big cloud is like 90 000 dollars

1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:12.720
 and i haven't done anything there so it's like did you take did you like take like verify yourself

1:57:12.720 --> 1:57:18.160
 or whatever i have not i think people would yell at me on twitter if i did so and it's unclear

1:57:18.160 --> 1:57:24.080
 whether it's a scam yet or not right it sounds clear where it's coming from well there are some

1:57:24.080 --> 1:57:29.280
 details about the you know investors it's it's backed by some pretty big name investors so

1:57:29.280 --> 1:57:34.160
 i probably wouldn't use the word scam to describe it but it's got Ponzi like dynamics

1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:39.600
 like everything in crypto yeah so there's very questionable and then also is using

1:57:39.600 --> 1:57:44.960
 using people's likeness without their permission which is i think a legal question you know so

1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:52.560
 there's open questions around it but you know is our public blockchains and you know that sort of

1:57:52.560 --> 1:57:56.960
 architecture is that going to be useful for decentralized or alternative forms of social

1:57:56.960 --> 1:58:04.160
 media yeah a hundred percent yes you know i'm super super bullish on that idea basically

1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:11.200
 creating open protocols uh open namespaces ways to organize without the dependence on

1:58:11.200 --> 1:58:18.160
 on a single node effectively in silicon valley you know the twitter node or the facebook node

1:58:19.280 --> 1:58:24.960
 i think it's a matter of urgency that we create you know digital gathering spaces where you have

1:58:24.960 --> 1:58:29.520
 strong property rights you know you have a claim on your identity you have a claim on your data

1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:35.680
 and open architectures are a way to do that i don't know if it'll be a blockchain but certainly i

1:58:35.680 --> 1:58:43.920
 think the the general you know concept introduced by blockchains is a good template for how to

1:58:43.920 --> 1:58:50.000
 you know organize these systems yeah value freedom value decentralization of power

1:58:50.640 --> 1:58:58.400
 whatever the mechanism uh let me ask you about love so uh there is a bitcoin maximalist community

1:58:58.400 --> 1:59:08.320
 that uh sometimes uh so those folks in general have a strong belief that bitcoin is good for the

1:59:08.320 --> 1:59:19.520
 world and it's almost an ethical imperative to to sort of help bitcoin succeed which i think is

1:59:20.480 --> 1:59:25.920
 as a member of any community i think is beautiful to believe in the vision of the community right

1:59:25.920 --> 1:59:32.240
 there does seem to be some properties of uh what some may call like toxicity or

1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:40.560
 derision and mockery and those kinds of things um so you know uh some folks have criticized this

1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:47.600
 right that uh bitcoin maximalism is not necessarily good for the world even if bitcoin is good for

1:59:47.600 --> 1:59:56.080
 the world what are your thoughts about this kind of approach philosophically or practically to uh

1:59:56.640 --> 2:00:03.600
 the spread of bitcoin and is there a way that we can add more love to the world while we add

2:00:03.600 --> 2:00:09.040
 more bitcoin to the world that's a great question i mean i you know bitcoin is sort of what you make

2:00:09.040 --> 2:00:16.640
 of it so you can define your own path as you advocate for bitcoin or don't for that matter

2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:25.200
 so my chosen approach is the approach you see here which i try to minimize the amount of sort

2:00:25.200 --> 2:00:30.960
 of harshness or mockery although i've been known to be mean on twitter too you know what twitter

2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:36.640
 is a specific site to interrupt is a specific media where this takes its worst form so i'm

2:00:36.640 --> 2:00:41.360
 learning listen i'm actually because of this podcast but in general i'm part of different

2:00:41.360 --> 2:00:49.520
 communities and some are full of like unabashed love and some are like when i experienced on

2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:57.040
 twitter the bitcoin community at first i was off put yeah in terms of the intensity the mockery

2:00:57.040 --> 2:01:07.360
 i bet yeah the layers of lull like the layers of not taking anything seriously and um i think

2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:13.760
 there's power to that there's freedom to that i appreciate it i have respect for it but it's not

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:19.680
 my thing on twitter it's just not not the way i enjoy communicating on twitter i retired from

2:01:19.680 --> 2:01:25.920
 twitter i hit i hit 100 000 followers and then i retired so i'm free now i don't have to tweet

2:01:25.920 --> 2:01:32.960
 anymore it's great but i i totally can see the point i wish that bitcoiners were gentler in

2:01:32.960 --> 2:01:38.160
 their approach not all bitcoiners are like that of course there's you know 50 to 100 million of

2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:44.240
 them worldwide and a few tens of thousands on twitter so i'm not going to claim that they're

2:01:44.240 --> 2:01:52.320
 necessarily representative the toxicity though is kind of a learned habit because uh bitcoin

2:01:52.320 --> 2:01:59.040
 has had so many episodes where strong willed institutions the dice billionaires the dice

2:01:59.040 --> 2:02:05.360
 are pretty toxic you could say right i'm basically mocking critics of bitcoin but at the same time

2:02:05.920 --> 2:02:10.400
 you're saying that the criticism has been predictable and repeatable and all it's been

2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:16.480
 the same throughout yeah and that's a that's a pretty you know dismissive thing to say right

2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:24.640
 that i can reduce you to a an algorithm of you know with 11 uh 11 yeah permutations um

2:02:24.640 --> 2:02:30.640
 um but you know the thing to remember i guess is that some of the best funded companies in

2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:35.520
 the bitcoin space the most powerful miners billionaires have tried to change and coopt

2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:42.960
 and alter bitcoin um to shape it to their liking and without these incredibly hard

2:02:42.960 --> 2:02:49.440
 core sort of high priests of the bitcoin protocol it would have been hopeless hopelessly

2:02:49.440 --> 2:02:57.040
 malleated in all number of ways and so there is a reason why someone would be incredibly

2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:04.080
 protective of bitcoin uh does that justify immense toxicity you know on social media

2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:11.920
 probably not but it's a leaderless uh protocol so the whole point is that it's money for enemies

2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:17.760
 and you know some of the bitcoin maximalists came for me too when i made suggestions that they

2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:24.400
 didn't like um but you know i'm happy to use it the protocol because i know that that transaction

2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:31.360
 will be final regardless of how odious my counterparty is or how how you know politically

2:03:31.360 --> 2:03:36.400
 disfavored their opinions are see i i mean and this is where there's this there could be disagreements

2:03:36.400 --> 2:03:44.560
 but i i think you have to think about what's effective as a defense mechanism of strong ideas

2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:52.320
 and i personally think uh that uh like kindness and thoughtfulness and like

2:03:54.400 --> 2:04:00.240
 is much more effective because it lets the idea shine as opposed to the personality

2:04:00.800 --> 2:04:08.480
 of the individual humans overriding it but there's debates on this you know i i mean i take your

2:04:08.480 --> 2:04:14.880
 side on that i think a patient and careful approach is the way to go now do all critics

2:04:14.880 --> 2:04:20.080
 deserve good faith engagement right no i would say a lot of critics of bitcoin operate an

2:04:20.080 --> 2:04:26.320
 extreme bad faith and the reason why is because we're not just talking about technical questions

2:04:26.320 --> 2:04:29.520
 in fact most of this conversation is not been technical it's been political

2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:37.200
 because bitcoin is an intensely political idea and so a lot of people are predisposed to totally

2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:44.000
 hate it and to wish you know death on bitcoiners i mean there's a professor at gw this i saw earlier

2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:49.280
 this week that was musing about getting all the bit corners on a boat and singing it it's like

2:04:49.280 --> 2:04:55.680
 in what other context would a you know upstanding professor muse about mass murder but in the context

2:04:55.680 --> 2:05:02.960
 of bitcoin it's sort of okay um you know within his peers because you're talking about something

2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:07.600
 that most people don't like you know it's the concept it's alien to them that doesn't jive

2:05:07.600 --> 2:05:14.960
 with the way they see the world and so because it's so you know pitched from a political perspective

2:05:16.080 --> 2:05:21.840
 there's a lot of critics as well as defenders that operate in bad faith i would say but that's

2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:26.560
 the nature of the beast it's because we're proposing a very disruptive thing and there are

2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:35.600
 people that would be disrupted by it you wrote a blog post titled on writing you're i think an

2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:42.240
 excellent writer uh so let me ask what does it take to be a good writer what does it take to

2:05:44.400 --> 2:05:50.960
 write some of the blog posts you've written sort of condensed set of ideas in your head

2:05:50.960 --> 2:05:55.760
 the mess that's probably in your head and putting down on paper in a way that's uh

2:05:55.760 --> 2:06:03.200
 communicates the idea clearly and powerfully so that was basically the point of the blog post

2:06:03.200 --> 2:06:09.200
 is that being an impressive writer is different from being an effective writer you know so

2:06:09.840 --> 2:06:17.680
 i think the answer to your question is humility basically so uh i think if you let pride and

2:06:17.680 --> 2:06:26.000
 vanity seep into your writing then you risk uh creating a very noisy signal you know creating

2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:31.680
 a very inefficient channel for communicating literal neural arrangements from your brain to

2:06:31.680 --> 2:06:37.120
 someone else's brain and that's what i think about when i write it's like wow i have the power to

2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:44.720
 at scale change the literal physical composition of people's brains right to rewire them if i make

2:06:44.720 --> 2:06:53.040
 an idea that's so persuasive that's so sticky if i coin a phrase that is so pithy then i can alter

2:06:53.040 --> 2:06:58.320
 their brain that's crazy i mean you're letting someone reach into your head and like mess with it

2:06:58.320 --> 2:07:03.520
 a little bit that's unbelievable and that's like a superpower and if you could do that to a hundred

2:07:03.520 --> 2:07:09.600
 thousand people at once how powerful is that right and you mentioned to cart i think therefore i am

2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:14.640
 that's like literally rewired millions of brains throughout history right i mean that's one of the

2:07:14.640 --> 2:07:22.320
 most powerful like kogodo urgo sum one of the most powerful phrases ever written and that sent

2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:27.120
 zillion philosophy undergraduates on a rabbit hole of skepticism that some of them didn't make it out

2:07:27.120 --> 2:07:32.640
 of you know and they're convinced that you know with the brain in the vat theory is true and

2:07:32.640 --> 2:07:39.600
 there's no way to know you know what are tangible experiences um but yeah that so that's the beauty

2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:47.520
 of writing and um the thing that interferes with that is our pride our desire to you know impress

2:07:47.520 --> 2:07:55.920
 people and you know look good to them and chill off our our vocab and stuff and that's that was

2:07:55.920 --> 2:08:00.720
 the point of that piece is that i went on this journey where i eventually realized that i don't

2:08:00.720 --> 2:08:06.240
 know if i'm any better of a writer for having realized it but i think that is a necessary condition

2:08:06.240 --> 2:08:16.320
 so does that mean there is a value to striving for simplicity in the words as opposed to um

2:08:17.040 --> 2:08:23.840
 i mean complexity i think so for sure and we deal with complex topics all the time in crypto

2:08:24.560 --> 2:08:28.640
 and that's always a huge red flag for me i mean if you can't explain something simply do you

2:08:28.640 --> 2:08:34.560
 understand it you know yeah so if you're talking about something complex if you can't find

2:08:34.560 --> 2:08:40.720
 simple ways to discuss it my presumption is that you're actually obfuscating the truth

2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:46.400
 and this is what Orwell railed against with political language you know he really hated

2:08:46.400 --> 2:08:53.920
 political language because he felt that its authors were using deliberate obfuscation uh and you

2:08:53.920 --> 2:09:01.200
 know he hated euphemisms and i hate euphemisms too you know i i much prefer you know forthrightness

2:09:01.200 --> 2:09:07.520
 and clarity of thought but most people when they write don't really endeavor to be particularly

2:09:07.520 --> 2:09:14.960
 clear they might be writing to show off their startup or you know to demonstrate to people

2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:22.400
 how cool they are or how well read they are you know they're displaying it's like a peacock style

2:09:22.400 --> 2:09:30.240
 display what fraction of people write to actually communicate meaning small fraction it's especially

2:09:30.240 --> 2:09:37.920
 difficult because what i've detected is um something in us humans as readers assign more

2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:46.000
 credibility to people that obfuscate so like simple clear communication of an idea

2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:55.840
 is not like the immediate reaction uh is is not one where we assign credibility to the person like

2:09:55.840 --> 2:10:02.720
 like that was uh that was brilliant there's a lot of people that i kind of listened to without

2:10:02.720 --> 2:10:08.720
 really understanding what the heck they're talking about and but it sounds musical and smart and then

2:10:08.720 --> 2:10:18.480
 i see a lot of folks assigning credibility to that person and it's unfortunate uh it's unfortunate

2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:24.240
 that there's that tension as a reader that we appreciate the the beauty and power of like

2:10:24.240 --> 2:10:35.680
 like complex weaving of words without assigning as much value to like actual clear communication

2:10:35.680 --> 2:10:42.160
 of an idea um and i'm always skeptical in speech as well when someone will describe someone as

2:10:42.160 --> 2:10:48.880
 articulate i'm always immediately skeptical of the value of what that person is saying uh because

2:10:48.880 --> 2:10:55.440
 if you articulate you can make bad ideas sound very acceptable and great and norm chowskis

2:10:55.440 --> 2:11:03.600
 has said this before he uh as a way to defend the way he speaks he said that like he's suspicious

2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:09.040
 of charismatic people because they can basically sell any kind of idea he speaks in a very monotone

2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:16.160
 and boring way so that whatever the value his ideas have they'll shine through there's something to

2:11:16.160 --> 2:11:20.640
 that there's something to that i love that but it's a difficult journey it's a difficult path

2:11:20.640 --> 2:11:24.880
 because then i i think it's the right path because ultimately you focus on the quality

2:11:24.880 --> 2:11:33.120
 of your ideas and in the long term that wins i agree just by way of advice is is there if

2:11:33.120 --> 2:11:39.360
 people are interested in bitcoin or cryptocurrency in your work what are good books or resources on

2:11:39.360 --> 2:11:45.360
 bitcoin now from you and from others that you can recommend that were in your own journey helped you

2:11:45.360 --> 2:11:52.800
 or you've seen help others well it's very easy i mean it's much easier today to make the bitcoin

2:11:52.800 --> 2:11:56.800
 journey because the quality of content is so much better than it was when i started i mean

2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:02.640
 when i learned about bitcoin there was the bitcoin wiki and the bitcoin stack exchange

2:12:02.640 --> 2:12:08.720
 and the subreddit and that was kind of it and uh you had to just pick up everything and the economic

2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:12.880
 theory hadn't really been worked out very much so you had to pick everything up from scratch

2:12:12.880 --> 2:12:17.760
 the good news is that there's a huge abundance of content and that's actually one of bitcoin's

2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:23.200
 greatest strengths is that people are totally inspired to write about it and it's almost a

2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:29.280
 rite of passage at this point if you're like a bitcoin thinker to have your book i don't have a

2:12:29.280 --> 2:12:33.840
 book yet i would love to recommend my book i haven't written one do you think about writing a book

2:12:33.840 --> 2:12:39.440
 yeah i think it's my duty 100% everyone that has created a lot of bit of bitcoin content

2:12:39.440 --> 2:12:46.080
 probably should condense it into a book to give it an enduring status it's interesting because you

2:12:46.080 --> 2:12:53.040
 mentioned uh block size wars and you've written on a lot of different topics so you could both

2:12:53.040 --> 2:13:02.880
 write a like a big like sapien style book about bitcoin or cryptocurrency right but you can also

2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:10.240
 write a book on each like a specific thing and now that you put pressure on yourself and talk

2:13:10.880 --> 2:13:16.080
 talk about simplicity right yeah where do you lean on those different book journeys that you

2:13:16.080 --> 2:13:24.560
 might take on like do you have in you uh eventually like a like a bitcoin book i mean i tallied up

2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:28.720
 the words that i wrote in the last couple years on bitcoin it's like over a hundred thousand words

2:13:28.720 --> 2:13:37.600
 a year so that's two novels there um but yeah i think i do um i think there's so much underexplored

2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:44.240
 space in bitcoin i mean uh a systematic interpretation of satoshi's writings for instance

2:13:44.240 --> 2:13:48.000
 and a lot of people don't want anyone to do that because they don't want it to have these

2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:55.040
 religious overtones where you're engaging in interpretation you know but that's you know

2:13:55.040 --> 2:13:59.040
 something it should be done there's a lot of bitcoin histories that haven't been written

2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:04.480
 there was a great bitcoin history recently published that's this is one of my recommendations

2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:11.520
 is on the block size war by uh jonathan beer uh who runs probably the best research desk in the

2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:19.280
 industry um so there's huge amounts of history that has transpired that hasn't been chronicled

2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:25.280
 and some of the accounts are indifferent you know they're often written by outsiders

2:14:26.160 --> 2:14:32.240
 you know journalists that maybe don't fully engage with the bitcoin system but if you think

2:14:32.240 --> 2:14:36.880
 the humans are interesting in the story too of course they're the most interesting thing

2:14:37.440 --> 2:14:42.800
 you know i mean bitcoin itself doesn't really change that much it's kind of this cold you know

2:14:42.800 --> 2:14:47.600
 protocol that just sort of takes along but the characters are just fascinating i mean and there's

2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:53.600
 so many unbelievable characters in the bitcoin story unbelievable yeah that's the cool thing about

2:14:53.600 --> 2:15:00.800
 bitcoin and cryptocurrency and just internet is like the weirdos the brilliant weirdos like

2:15:01.440 --> 2:15:07.520
 all the people in uh in the stuff that's already established are boring like economics professors

2:15:07.520 --> 2:15:14.160
 are all boring right but the interesting people the wild ones are are the ones that are innovating on

2:15:14.160 --> 2:15:20.400
 in the crypto space which uh is you know that's where the dangerous weirdos are and the exciting

2:15:20.400 --> 2:15:25.760
 brilliant weirdos well you had to be kind of crazy to adopt bitcoin and in the first sort of five

2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:32.080
 years of its life so there's an adverse selection element there i don't know if that's an uncharitable

2:15:32.080 --> 2:15:38.480
 way to put it but like some of bitcoin's earliest evangelists are not the evangelists i would have

2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:44.240
 chosen but they were the ones that we got so it's the one we got but is there uh is there

2:15:44.240 --> 2:15:51.120
 resources you're basically saying just throw a dart and most books are going to be good

2:15:51.120 --> 2:15:55.440
 or is there something that's out to you i mean your average book is you know terrible for sure

2:15:55.440 --> 2:16:01.920
 but uh not on bitcoin specifically but just in general um it depends whether you like the computer

2:16:01.920 --> 2:16:08.400
 science the economics or the history but my recommendations would be you know obviously the

2:16:08.400 --> 2:16:14.480
 bitcoin white paper that's uh and satoshi's uh complimentary writings that's very important

2:16:14.480 --> 2:16:19.600
 is to try and understand the intentions behind the system and also to understand the system

2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:25.280
 without having your view colored by some third party's description of it most descriptions of

2:16:25.280 --> 2:16:31.920
 bitcoin are really bad uh so the just go to the originals go to the howlfinney's post satoshi's

2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:37.680
 post on bitcoin talk there's a huge amount of lucidity there and actually most of our questions

2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:42.640
 about bitcoin today that we have a decade later were really answered in those earliest days people

2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:50.800
 just don't know it the canonical economic work relating to bitcoin a lot of people don't like

2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:56.160
 it i think it's fine would be uh the bitcoin standard a lot of people don't like it i just

2:16:56.160 --> 2:17:01.280
 read it it's good i like it i think it's it's a good uh description of sort of the austrian

2:17:01.280 --> 2:17:06.000
 perspective and then how it relates to bitcoin there isn't that much about bitcoin in there

2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:12.000
 but i think the point is once you've understood you know safedine's view of monetary policy

2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:15.200
 bitcoin makes a ton of sense you know i actually need to argue for it that much

2:17:15.200 --> 2:17:21.840
 so the bitcoin standard is a good introduction to sort of the orthodox thought in bitcoin

2:17:22.960 --> 2:17:30.800
 um there's a more recent book called layered money which i liked um by nick batia which goes

2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:34.560
 into more depth about what i was talking about earlier in the conversation the layered approach

2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:40.160
 to scaling and that's a really critical thing to understand then technical books about bitcoin

2:17:40.160 --> 2:17:47.120
 i like grokking bitcoin uh which is a very computer science heavy one there's a good

2:17:47.120 --> 2:17:56.480
 textbook um called uh bitcoin and cryptocurrency technologies um by uh arvind noranian i think

2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:02.160
 he's um a princeton computer science professor which is really good at building intuition

2:18:02.160 --> 2:18:10.720
 um antonopoulos's books uh mastering bitcoin are good then there's like simpler intuition

2:18:10.720 --> 2:18:15.280
 building books that aren't hardcore on the economics or the protocol design so you have

2:18:15.280 --> 2:18:20.560
 like inventing bitcoin by yon pritzker which is good you have bitcoin clarity by qr bickers

2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:26.000
 as you can tell i have like a my bookshelf is like mostly bitcoin books okay well that's a

2:18:26.000 --> 2:18:31.040
 good selection and of course like you said you're you're writing and your book that comes out

2:18:31.040 --> 2:18:37.280
 about this year or next year next year i think i'm gonna need 18 months okay uh but you know

2:18:37.280 --> 2:18:45.120
 the most of the good bitcoin content is just online on medium on twitter so um it's it's a

2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:52.560
 decentralized you know consensus kind of thing what about the book recommendations that you

2:18:52.560 --> 2:18:58.640
 could give people love these outside of the world of uh crypto that maybe had an impact on your life

2:18:58.640 --> 2:19:04.720
 fiction like sci fi maybe technical philosophical is there something you would recommend that people

2:19:04.720 --> 2:19:10.400
 might read i really liked the three body problem but that's a really hackneyed recommendation

2:19:11.040 --> 2:19:15.200
 but it really made me think and i like the hard sci fi you know the commitment to

2:19:15.840 --> 2:19:21.040
 science and science fiction so i thought it was very clever is there one uh is there something

2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:27.040
 that really annoys you in terms of the opposite of hard sci fi like that doesn't get stuff right

2:19:27.040 --> 2:19:36.400
 movies are um i mean i have issues when i watch like ostensibly sci fi or fantasy films that are

2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:42.480
 not consistent about this the rules for the universe that they've laid out or where there's

2:19:42.480 --> 2:19:49.040
 an impossible to comprehend like um uh christopher no one's latest film oh yeah you needed like a

2:19:49.040 --> 2:19:54.240
 spreadsheet and i understand that tenet yeah i trust that maybe he was consistent about the

2:19:54.240 --> 2:20:00.160
 rules of his universe i just did not understand it yeah at all in that sense i i really probably

2:20:00.160 --> 2:20:08.240
 one of my favorites is uh 2001 space odyssey it's so obviously it's many decades ago but

2:20:09.200 --> 2:20:19.200
 it's quite brilliant in both its consistency and the depth of thought put into like what the

2:20:19.200 --> 2:20:28.240
 technology would actually be uh not in like visually not in kind of silly graphical ways

2:20:28.960 --> 2:20:39.440
 but in um in terms of function and its impact on humanity so right but that takes care that takes

2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:43.280
 that takes a lot of work and that takes genius actually which is why cubrick is

2:20:43.280 --> 2:20:51.920
 is regarded for what he is what advice you've taken an interesting journey through your life

2:20:52.640 --> 2:21:00.640
 uh you've you were at fidelity your philosophy major uh you're now uh one of the seminal minds

2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:06.480
 in the world of bitcoin and cryptocurrency who the hell knows what the next five ten years looks for

2:21:06.480 --> 2:21:14.720
 you if you were to give advice to somebody uh young today uh you know making their way through

2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:20.800
 life making a career what would you uh what kind of advice would you give see the problem with advice

2:21:20.800 --> 2:21:29.120
 is that in a world where so much of success is defined by luck and serendipity is that the

2:21:29.120 --> 2:21:35.200
 advice givers often don't know why they've been successful right and so yeah they might say you

2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:40.320
 know I was wearing a green tie on the day of my job interview and so you should go out and wear

2:21:40.320 --> 2:21:46.960
 green ties and so they might just get the causality completely wrong right I mean I'm not gonna claim

2:21:46.960 --> 2:21:54.400
 that I'm super successful yet but um see that's the problem is that I don't think my journey is

2:21:54.400 --> 2:22:00.960
 replicable necessarily so um you know who am I to to give advice although the one thing I will say

2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:10.320
 is that the thing I did right was to become completely obsessed with um a domain I found

2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:14.960
 really interesting and held promise like if I had been really interested in like magic the

2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:20.080
 gathering I wouldn't have been able to like do much with that aside from build like a killer

2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:29.120
 you know card pack or whatever um and I wasn't afraid to you know really put myself out there um

2:22:29.120 --> 2:22:34.560
 and you know float my thoughts online and see how people reacted to them even if I said stuff that

2:22:34.560 --> 2:22:40.160
 was completely erroneous or wrong all the time the rewards to writing and just publishing content

2:22:40.160 --> 2:22:46.080
 are immense as you know obviously it's the most high leverage activity I think most young people

2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:55.680
 have available to them um and I was very lucky and I benefited from a lot of favorable coincidences

2:22:55.680 --> 2:23:02.320
 a lot of people that took a chance on me um and if I had more time I would sit here and name them

2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:10.800
 but uh is there something you in your actions that made you more open to the the benefits of luck

2:23:12.400 --> 2:23:16.080
 sort of uh you know luck can bring you a lot of positive and negative things

2:23:16.640 --> 2:23:22.000
 so saying you're lucky means you are able to ride the wave of whatever positive stuff luck

2:23:22.000 --> 2:23:26.800
 bring brought you well that's right you have to put yourself in a position to be lucky and most

2:23:26.800 --> 2:23:34.160
 people don't so you just have to get as many shots on goal as possible and of course luck is

2:23:34.160 --> 2:23:41.280
 plays an undeniable role in any career path for sure but you do have to make yourself available

2:23:41.280 --> 2:23:49.120
 to it um and you have to take a ton of chances um but yeah that's the problem with advice

2:23:49.120 --> 2:23:54.560
 it's just so hard to replicate it so I find it illegitimate most of the time

2:23:57.200 --> 2:24:00.800
 uh you heard it here kids don't listen to anything Nick just said

2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:06.880
 exactly wear a green tie to your interviews it'll work out well uh do you think there's a

2:24:07.680 --> 2:24:14.560
 meaning or reason to any of this this existence this life well we we make our own meaning for sure

2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:21.840
 uh I find a huge amount of meaning in what I do um I find it beautiful I feel very lucky

2:24:22.480 --> 2:24:28.240
 and blessed to be in the line of work that I'm in uh you know to have your hobby and your passion

2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:34.400
 and your job just be a completely integrated thing so that's where I find meaning but you're

2:24:34.400 --> 2:24:43.360
 just a bag of like cells and bacteria that eventually dissipates dies and it goes into

2:24:43.360 --> 2:24:50.080
 the ground and disappears back into the universe I mean that doesn't make any sense

2:24:50.080 --> 2:24:56.400
 well that may be true but uh I find the sublime in things like bitcoin I find it incredibly

2:24:56.400 --> 2:25:02.800
 inspiring to work on it I believe it's a hundred year plus project and uh you know it stirs those

2:25:02.800 --> 2:25:11.360
 aesthetic emotions in you as I'm sure your work does so you find it beautiful absolutely absolutely

2:25:11.360 --> 2:25:16.000
 and and inspiring more than just beautiful so you have hope for human civilization

2:25:16.000 --> 2:25:21.040
 and bitcoin as part of that hope yeah it's a very optimistic view and people accuse us of being

2:25:21.040 --> 2:25:26.480
 pessimists and saying that we are you know rooting for the collapse of civilization completely false

2:25:27.200 --> 2:25:33.280
 um bitcoiners are complete are wildly optimistic because they believe that you can monetize a

2:25:33.280 --> 2:25:39.120
 completely new system from scratch and compete with the strongest superpower and the military and

2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:45.200
 the dollar and everything that goes with that that's the craziest most ludicrously optimistic

2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:50.960
 proposition imaginable so I think bitcoiners are the most optimistic people out there

2:25:52.800 --> 2:25:59.280
 I don't think there's a better way to end it on that hopeful vision of human civilization Nick

2:25:59.840 --> 2:26:07.600
 I've heard a lot of amazing things about you I was binge watching your interviews binge reading

2:26:07.600 --> 2:26:15.120
 your blogs fell in love with your work you're a good dude uh inspiring brilliant thank you so much

2:26:15.120 --> 2:26:21.680
 for wasting all your valuable time with me today my absolute pleasure thanks for listening to this

2:26:21.680 --> 2:26:28.240
 conversation with Nick Carter and thank you to the information athletic greens for sigmatic

2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:34.160
 and blinkest check them out in the description to support this podcast and now let me leave you

2:26:34.160 --> 2:26:40.800
 with some words about freedom and beauty from Stephen King some birds are not meant to be caged

2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:47.520
 that's all their feathers are too bright their songs too sweet and wild so you let them go

2:26:48.080 --> 2:26:52.640
 or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you and the part of you

2:26:52.640 --> 2:26:58.160
 that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place for joises but still the place where

2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:04.720
 you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure thank you for listening and hope to see

2:27:04.720 --> 2:27:28.720
 you next time you
