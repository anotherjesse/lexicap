00:00.000 --> 00:05.760
 The following is a conversation with Harry Cliff, a particle physicist at the University of Cambridge

00:05.760 --> 00:11.840
 working on the Large Hedron Collider Beauty Experiment that specializes in investigating

00:11.840 --> 00:17.680
 the slight differences between matter and antimatter by studying a type of particle called the beauty

00:17.680 --> 00:23.440
 quirk or B quirk. In this way, he's part of the group of physicists who are searching for the

00:23.440 --> 00:27.680
 evidence of new particles that can answer some of the biggest questions in modern physics.

00:27.680 --> 00:34.160
 He's also an exceptional communicator of science, with some of the clearest and most captivating

00:34.160 --> 00:41.040
 explanations of basic concepts in particle physicists that I've ever heard. So when I visited London,

00:41.040 --> 00:46.400
 I knew I had to talk to him. And we did this conversation at the Royal Institute Lecture

00:46.400 --> 00:52.000
 Theatre, which has hosted lectures for over two centuries from some of the greatest scientists

00:52.000 --> 00:58.560
 and science communicators in history, from Michael Faraday to Carl Sagan. This conversation was

00:58.560 --> 01:03.280
 recorded before the outbreak of the pandemic. For everyone feeling the medical and psychological

01:03.280 --> 01:09.440

03:52.480 --> 03:57.360
 probably one of the coolest things that human beings have ever created the large hands on

03:57.360 --> 04:06.400
 collider OHC. What is it? How does it work? Okay, so it's essentially this gigantic 27 kilometer

04:06.400 --> 04:12.000
 circumference particle accelerator. It's this big ring buried about 100 meters underneath the surface

04:12.000 --> 04:16.960
 in the countryside just outside Geneva in Switzerland. And really what it's for ultimately

04:16.960 --> 04:22.560
 is to try to understand what are the basic building blocks of the universe. So you can think of it in

04:22.560 --> 04:29.120
 a way as like a gigantic microscope and the analogy is actually fairly precise. So gigantic

04:29.120 --> 04:35.280
 microscope. Effectively, except it's a microscope that looks at the structure of the vacuum.

04:36.160 --> 04:42.880
 In order for this kind of thing to study particles, which are the microscopic entities,

04:42.880 --> 04:48.480
 it has to be huge. Yes, gigantic Microsoft. So what do you mean by studying vacuum?

04:48.480 --> 04:54.240
 Okay, so I mean, so particle physics as a field is kind of badly named in a way because

04:54.240 --> 04:58.960
 particles are not the fundamental ingredients of the universe. They're not fundamental at all. So

04:58.960 --> 05:04.080
 the things that we believe are the real building blocks of the universe are objects, invisible,

05:04.080 --> 05:10.080
 fluid like objects called quantum fields. So these are fields like like the magnetic field

05:10.080 --> 05:14.560
 around a magnet that exists everywhere in space. They're always there. In fact, actually, it's

05:14.560 --> 05:19.200
 funny that we're in the Royal Institution because this is where the idea of the field was

05:19.200 --> 05:23.680
 effectively invented by Michael Faraday doing experiments with magnets and coils of wire.

05:23.680 --> 05:29.120
 So he noticed that, you know, if he was very famous experiment that he did where he got a magnet

05:29.120 --> 05:33.280
 and put on top of it a piece of paper and then sprinkled iron filings and he found the iron

05:33.280 --> 05:38.960
 filings arranged themselves into these kind of loops of which was actually mapping out the

05:38.960 --> 05:42.880
 invisible influence of this magnetic field, which is the thing, you know, we've all experienced,

05:42.880 --> 05:47.360
 we've all felt held a magnet and or two poles of magnet and pushing together and felt this thing,

05:47.360 --> 05:52.480
 this force pushing back. So these are real physical objects. And the way we think of

05:52.480 --> 05:57.280
 particles in modern physics is that they are essentially little vibrations, little ripples

05:57.920 --> 06:02.400
 in these otherwise invisible fields that are everywhere. They fill the whole universe.

06:03.120 --> 06:08.720
 You know, I don't, I apologize, perhaps for the ridiculous question. Are you comfortable

06:08.720 --> 06:15.600
 with the idea of the fundamental nature of our reality being fields? Because to me, particles,

06:16.880 --> 06:22.000
 you know, a bunch of different building blocks makes more sense sort of intellectually, sort of

06:22.000 --> 06:28.000
 visually, like it seems to, I seem to be able to visualize that kind of idea easier.

06:28.720 --> 06:33.840
 Are you comfortable psychologically with the idea that the basic building block is not a block,

06:33.840 --> 06:39.440
 but a field? I think it's, I think it's quite a magical idea. I find it quite appealing. And

06:39.440 --> 06:44.560
 it's, well, it comes from a misunderstanding of what particles are. So like when you, when we do

06:44.560 --> 06:48.400
 science at school, and we draw a picture of an atom, you draw like, you know, a nucleus with

06:48.400 --> 06:51.760
 some protons and neutrons, these little spheres in the middle, and then you have some electrons

06:51.760 --> 06:56.400
 that are like little flies flying around the atom. And that is a completely misleading picture of

06:56.400 --> 07:00.800
 what an atom is like. It's nothing like that. The electron is not like a little planet orbiting

07:00.800 --> 07:06.960
 the atom. It's this spread out, wibbly, wobbly, wave like thing. And we know we've known that since,

07:06.960 --> 07:12.480
 you know, the early 20th century, thanks to quantum mechanics. So when we carry on using this word

07:12.480 --> 07:17.920
 particle, because sometimes when we do experiments, particles do behave like their little marbles or

07:17.920 --> 07:23.360
 little bullets, you know, so in the LHC, when we collide particles together, you'll get, you know,

07:23.360 --> 07:27.200
 you get like hundreds of particles or flying out through the detector, and they all take a

07:27.200 --> 07:30.880
 trajectory and you can see from the detector where they've gone and they look like their little

07:30.880 --> 07:36.640
 bullets. So they behave that way, you know, a lot of the time. But when you really study them

07:36.640 --> 07:43.120
 carefully, you'll see that they are not little spheres, they are these ethereal disturbances

07:43.120 --> 07:49.920
 in these underlying fields. So this is, this is really how we think nature is, which is surprising,

07:49.920 --> 07:54.960
 but also I think kind of magic. So, you know, we are, our bodies are basically made up of like

07:54.960 --> 07:59.920
 little knots of energy in these invisible objects that are all around us.

08:01.520 --> 08:09.120
 And what is the story of the vacuum when it comes to LHC? So why did you mention the word

08:09.120 --> 08:15.360
 vacuum? Okay, so if we just, if we go back to like the physics, we do know. So atoms are made of

08:15.360 --> 08:20.000
 electrons, which were discovered 100 or so years ago. And then in the nucleus of the atom, you

08:20.000 --> 08:24.240
 have two other types of particles. There's an up something called an up quark and a down quark.

08:24.240 --> 08:30.160
 And those three particles make up every atom in the universe. So we think of these as ripples in

08:30.160 --> 08:36.400
 fields. So there is something called the electron field. And every electron in the universe is a

08:36.400 --> 08:40.640
 ripple moving about in this electron field. So the electron field is all around us. We can't see it,

08:40.640 --> 08:45.920
 but every electron in our body is a little ripple in this thing that's there all the time. And the

08:45.920 --> 08:49.360
 quark field is the same. So there's an up quark field and an up quark is a little ripple in the

08:49.360 --> 08:52.960
 up quark field. And the down quark is a little ripple in something else called the down quark

08:52.960 --> 08:58.480
 field. So these fields are always there. Now, there are potentially, we know about a certain

08:58.480 --> 09:01.840
 number of fields in what we call the standard model of particle physics. And the most recent one

09:01.840 --> 09:07.920
 we discovered was the Higgs field. And the way we discovered the Higgs field was to make a little

09:07.920 --> 09:13.760
 ripple in it. So what the LHC did, it fired two protons into each other very, very hard with

09:13.760 --> 09:19.440
 enough energy that you could create a disturbance in this Higgs field. And that's what shows up

09:19.440 --> 09:23.600
 as what we call the Higgs boson. So this particle that everyone was going on about eight or so years

09:23.600 --> 09:28.800
 ago is proof really, the particle in itself is, I mean, it's interesting, but the thing that's

09:28.800 --> 09:35.440
 really interesting is the field because it's the Higgs field that we believe is the reason that

09:35.440 --> 09:41.280
 electrons and quarks have mass. And it's that invisible field that's always there that gives

09:41.280 --> 09:46.320
 mass to the particles. The Higgs boson is just our way of checking it's there basically.

09:46.320 --> 09:51.840
 So the large electron collider, in order to get that ripple in the Higgs field,

09:51.840 --> 09:56.800
 you, it requires a huge amount of energy. Yeah, I suppose. And so that's why you need this huge,

09:56.800 --> 10:02.800
 that's why size matters here. So maybe there's a million questions here, but let's backtrack.

10:02.800 --> 10:14.400
 Why does size matter in the context of a particle collider? So why does bigger allow you for higher

10:14.400 --> 10:19.440
 energy collisions? Right. So the reason, well, it's kind of simple really, which is that there

10:19.440 --> 10:23.520
 are two types of particle accelerator that you can build. One is circular, which is like the LHC,

10:23.520 --> 10:29.840
 the other is a great long line. So the advantage of a circular machine is that you can send particles

10:29.840 --> 10:33.280
 around a ring and you can give them a kick every time they go around. So imagine you have a,

10:33.280 --> 10:37.440
 there's actually a bit of the LHC that's about only 30 meters long, where you have a bunch of

10:37.440 --> 10:43.280
 metal boxes, which have oscillating two million volt electric fields inside them, which are timed

10:43.280 --> 10:47.200
 so that when a proton goes through one of these boxes, the field it sees as it approaches is

10:47.200 --> 10:52.000
 attractive. And then as it leaves the box, it flips and comes repulsive. And the proton gets

10:52.000 --> 10:55.520
 attractive and kicked out the other side. So it gets a bit faster. So you send it,

10:55.520 --> 10:59.280
 but then you send it back around again. And it's incredible, like the timing of that,

10:59.280 --> 11:04.240
 the synchronization, wait, really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, I think there's going to be a

11:04.240 --> 11:10.560
 multiplicative effect on the questions I have. Okay, let me just take that attention for a second.

11:10.560 --> 11:16.640
 And how the orchestration of that, is that fundamentally a hardware problem or a software

11:16.640 --> 11:22.080
 problem? Like what, how do you get that perfectly? I mean, I should first of all say, I'm not an

11:22.080 --> 11:26.240
 engineer. So the guys, I did not build the LHC. So they're people much, much better at this stuff

11:26.240 --> 11:36.480
 than I could. For sure. But maybe, but from your sort of intuition, from the the echoes of what

11:36.480 --> 11:42.400
 you understand, what you heard of, how is design, what's your sense? What's the the engineering

11:42.400 --> 11:46.960
 aspects of the acceleration bit is not challenging. Okay, I mean, okay, there is always challenges

11:46.960 --> 11:52.320
 with everything. But basically, you have these, the beams that go around the LHC, the beams of

11:52.320 --> 11:57.600
 particles are divided into little bunches. So they're called, they're a bit like swarms of bees,

11:57.600 --> 12:04.320
 if you like. And there are around, I think it's something of the order 2000 bunches spaced around

12:04.320 --> 12:09.280
 the ring. And they, if you're, if you're a given point on the ring, counting bunches, you get 40

12:09.280 --> 12:14.080
 million bunches passing you every second. So they come in, like, you know, like cars going past on

12:14.080 --> 12:19.280
 a very fast motorway. So you need to have if you're electric field that you're using to accelerate

12:19.280 --> 12:24.720
 the particles that needs to be timed so that as a bunch of protons arrives, it's got the right

12:24.720 --> 12:29.360
 sign to attract them and then flips at the right moment. But I think the voltage in those boxes

12:29.360 --> 12:33.920
 oscillates at hundreds of megahertz. So the beams are like 40 megahertz, but it's oscillating much

12:33.920 --> 12:38.640
 more quickly than the beam. So I think, you know, it's difficult engineering, but in principle,

12:38.640 --> 12:42.000
 it's not, you know, a really serious challenge. The bigger problem.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.400
 This probably engineers like screaming at you right now.

12:44.400 --> 12:44.960
 Probably. Yeah.

12:46.080 --> 12:50.080
 Okay. So in terms of coming back to this thing, why is it so big? Well, the reason is,

12:50.080 --> 12:53.920
 you want to get the particles through that accelerating element over and over again.

12:53.920 --> 12:57.120
 So you want to bring them back round. That's why it's round. The question is, why couldn't you

12:57.120 --> 13:02.960
 make it smaller? Well, the basic answer is that these particles are going unbelievably quickly.

13:02.960 --> 13:12.160
 So they travel at 99.9999991% of the speed of light in the LHC. And if you think about,

13:12.160 --> 13:17.600
 say, driving your car around a corner at high speed, if you go fast, you need a very,

13:17.600 --> 13:21.120
 you need a lot of friction in the tires to make sure you don't slide off the road.

13:21.120 --> 13:27.120
 So the, the limiting factor is how powerful a magnet can you make? Because it's what we do

13:27.120 --> 13:32.000
 is magnets are used to bend the particles around the ring. And essentially the LHC,

13:32.000 --> 13:36.720
 when it was designed, was designed with the most powerful magnets that could conceivably be built

13:36.720 --> 13:41.280
 at the time. And so that's your kind of limiting factor. So if you wanted to make the machines

13:41.280 --> 13:45.680
 smaller, that means a tighter bend, you need to have a more powerful magnet. So it's this toss

13:45.680 --> 13:50.400
 up between how strong your magnets versus how big a tunnel can you afford, the bigger the tunnel,

13:50.400 --> 13:53.280
 the weaker the magnets can be, the smaller the tunnel, the stronger they've got to be.

13:53.920 --> 13:59.680
 Okay. So maybe can we backtrack to the standard model and say what kind of particles there are

13:59.680 --> 14:07.360
 period. And maybe the history of kind of assembling that the standard model of physics and then

14:07.360 --> 14:12.720
 how that leads up to the hopes and dreams and the accomplishments of the large hydrocolider.

14:12.720 --> 14:16.560
 Yeah, sure. Okay. So for all of 20th century physics in like five minutes.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.280
 Yeah, please.

14:17.280 --> 14:24.640
 Okay. So, okay, the story really begins properly. End of the 19th century, the basic view of matter

14:24.640 --> 14:30.080
 is that matter is made of atoms and that atoms are indestructible, immutable little spheres

14:30.080 --> 14:34.320
 like the things we were talking about that don't really exist. And there's one atom for every

14:34.320 --> 14:38.720
 chemical element. So there's an atom for hydrogen, for helium, for carbon, for iron, etc. And they're

14:38.720 --> 14:43.280
 all different. Then in 1897, experiments done at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, which is

14:43.280 --> 14:49.440
 where I'm still where I'm based, showed that there are actually smaller particles inside the atom,

14:49.440 --> 14:53.120
 which eventually became known as electrons. So these are these negatively charged things that

14:53.120 --> 14:58.480
 go around the outside. A few years later, Ernest Rutherford, very famous nuclear physicist,

14:58.480 --> 15:03.280
 one of the pioneers of nuclear physics, shows that the atom has a tiny nugget in the center,

15:03.280 --> 15:07.360
 which we call the nucleus, which is a positively charged object. So then by 1910,

15:07.360 --> 15:11.440
 11, we have this model of the atom that we learn in school, which is you've got a nucleus,

15:11.440 --> 15:16.720
 electrons go around it. Fast forward, you know, a few years, the nucleus, people start doing

15:16.720 --> 15:22.160
 experiments with radioactivity where they use alpha particles that are spat out of radioactive

15:22.160 --> 15:28.400
 elements as bullets, and they fire them at other atoms. And by banging things into each other,

15:28.400 --> 15:33.280
 they see that they can knock bits out of the nucleus. So these things come out called protons,

15:33.280 --> 15:37.920
 first of all, which are positively charged particles, about 2000 times heavier than the

15:37.920 --> 15:43.840
 electron. And then 10 years later, more or less, a neutral particle is discovered called the neutron.

15:43.840 --> 15:48.800
 So those are the three basic building blocks of atoms. You have protons and neutrons in the

15:48.800 --> 15:53.040
 nucleus that are stuck together by something called the strong force, the strong nuclear force.

15:53.040 --> 15:58.720
 You have electrons in orbit around that, held in by the electromagnetic force, which is one of the

15:58.720 --> 16:06.160
 forces of nature. That's sort of where we get to by like 1932, more or less. Then what happens is

16:06.160 --> 16:09.600
 physics is nice and neat. In 1932, everything looks great, got three particles in all the

16:09.600 --> 16:15.200
 atoms are made of, that's fine. But then cloud chamber experiments, these are devices that can

16:15.200 --> 16:19.440
 be used to the first devices capable of imaging subatomic particles. So you can see their tracks

16:19.440 --> 16:24.800
 and they're used to study cosmic rays, particles that come from outer space and bang into the atmosphere.

16:25.600 --> 16:30.240
 And in these experiments, people start to see a whole load of new particles. So they discover,

16:30.240 --> 16:34.800
 for one thing, antimatter, which is the sort of a mirror image of the particles. So we discover

16:34.800 --> 16:38.320
 that there's also, as well as a negatively charged electron, there's something called a positron,

16:38.320 --> 16:41.680
 which is a positively charged version of the electron. And there's an anti proton,

16:41.680 --> 16:46.320
 which is negatively charged. And then a whole load of other weird particles start to get discovered.

16:46.320 --> 16:50.880
 And no one really knows what they are. This is known as the zoo of particles.

16:50.880 --> 16:58.240
 Are these discoveries not the first theoretical discoveries, or they discoveries in experiment?

16:58.240 --> 17:02.800
 So like, well, yeah, what's the process of discovery for these early sets of?

17:02.800 --> 17:07.600
 It's a mixture. I mean, the early stuff around the atom is really experimentally driven. It's not

17:07.600 --> 17:12.240
 based on some theory. It's exploration in the lab using equipment. So it's really people just

17:12.240 --> 17:16.320
 figuring out getting hands on with the phenomena, figuring out what these things are. And the theory

17:16.320 --> 17:22.320
 comes a bit later. That's not always the case. So in the discovery of the anti electron, the positron,

17:22.320 --> 17:28.720
 that was predicted from quantum mechanics and relativity by a very clever theoretical

17:28.720 --> 17:33.760
 physicist called Paul Dirac, who was probably the second brightest physicist of the 20th century,

17:33.760 --> 17:37.920
 apart from Einstein, but isn't as well anywhere near as well known. So he predicted the existence of

17:37.920 --> 17:43.040
 the anti electron from basically a combination of the theories of quantum mechanics and relativity.

17:43.040 --> 17:45.760
 And it was discovered about a year after he made the prediction.

17:45.760 --> 17:49.040
 What happens when an electron meets a positron?

17:49.040 --> 17:54.240
 They annihilate each other. So if you, when you bring a particle and this anti particle together,

17:54.240 --> 17:58.320
 they react, well, they react, they just wipe each other out and they turn,

17:58.320 --> 18:03.360
 their mass is turned into energy, usually in the form of photons. So you get light produced.

18:03.360 --> 18:09.440
 So when you have that kind of situation, why does the universe exist at all if there's matter

18:09.440 --> 18:14.640
 in any matter? Oh God, now we're getting into really big questions. So defensive, do you want to

18:14.640 --> 18:20.400
 go there now? Maybe let's go there later. Cause I mean, that is a very big question.

18:20.400 --> 18:26.320
 Yeah, let's take it slow with the standard model. So okay, so there's matter and anti

18:26.320 --> 18:32.480
 matter in the 30s. So what else? So matter, anti matter, and then a load of new particles start

18:32.480 --> 18:39.120
 turning up in these cosmic ray experiments, first of all, and they don't seem to be particles that

18:39.120 --> 18:43.360
 make up atoms. They're something else. They all mostly interact with a strong

18:43.360 --> 18:49.600
 nuclear force. So they're a bit like protons and neutrons. And by in the 1960s in America,

18:49.600 --> 18:54.000
 particularly, but also in Europe and Russia, scientists start to call particle accelerators.

18:54.000 --> 18:57.600
 So these are the forerunners of the LHC. So big ring shaped machines that were,

18:57.600 --> 19:01.200
 you know, hundreds of meters long, which in those days was enormous. You never, you know,

19:01.200 --> 19:05.360
 most physics up until that point had been done in labs in universities, you know, with small bits

19:05.360 --> 19:09.600
 of kit. So this is a big change. And when these accelerators are built, they start to find they

19:09.600 --> 19:16.320
 can produce even more of these particles. So I don't know the exact numbers, but by around 1960,

19:16.320 --> 19:21.120
 there are of order 100 of these things that have been discovered. And physicists are kind of

19:21.680 --> 19:26.000
 tearing their hair out because physics is all about simplification. And suddenly

19:26.000 --> 19:30.320
 what was simple has become messy and complicated. And everyone sort of wants to understand what's

19:30.320 --> 19:34.640
 going on. That's a quick kind of a side and probably really dumb question. But

19:36.080 --> 19:43.120
 how is it possible to take something like a like a photon or electron and be able to control it

19:43.120 --> 19:50.720
 enough, like to be able to do a controlled experiment where you collide it against something

19:50.720 --> 19:58.160
 else? Yeah. Is that, is that that seems like an exceptionally difficult engineering challenge?

19:58.160 --> 20:03.120
 Because you mentioned vacuum too. So you basically want to remove every other distraction

20:03.120 --> 20:07.280
 and really focus on this collision. How difficult of an engineering challenge is that just to get

20:07.280 --> 20:12.320
 a sense? And it's very hard. I mean, in the early days, particularly when the first accelerators

20:12.320 --> 20:18.800
 are being built in like 1932, Ernest Lawrence builds the first, what we call a cyclotron,

20:18.800 --> 20:23.040
 which is like a little accelerator, this big or so. There's another one. That big? There's a

20:23.040 --> 20:30.240
 tiny little thing. Yeah. I mean, so most of the first accelerators were what we call fixed target

20:30.240 --> 20:34.480
 experiments. So you had a ring, you accelerate particles around the ring, and then you fire

20:34.480 --> 20:40.720
 them out the side into some target. So that makes the kind of the colliding bit is relatively

20:40.720 --> 20:44.480
 straightforward because you just fire it, whatever it is you want to fire it at. The hard bit is the

20:45.200 --> 20:48.480
 steering the beams with the magnetic fields getting, you know, strong enough electric

20:48.480 --> 20:52.880
 fields to accelerate them, all that kind of stuff. The first colliders where you have two beams

20:53.680 --> 21:01.120
 colliding head on, that comes later. And I don't think it's done until maybe the 1980s.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.200
 I'm not entirely sure, but it takes, it's much harder problem.

21:05.200 --> 21:10.960
 That's crazy because you have to like perfectly get them to hit each other. I mean, we're talking

21:10.960 --> 21:18.800
 about, I mean, what scale, what's the, I mean, the temporal thing is a giant mess, but the

21:19.680 --> 21:25.920
 spatially like the size is tiny. Well, to give you a sense of the LHC beams,

21:25.920 --> 21:33.520
 the cross sectional diameter is, I think around a dozen or so microns. So, you know,

21:33.520 --> 21:41.200
 10 millionths of a meter. And a beam, sorry, just to clarify, a beam contains how many,

21:41.200 --> 21:44.880
 is it the bunches that you mentioned? Is it multiple part or is it just one part?

21:44.880 --> 21:50.320
 Oh, no, no. The bunches contain say 100 billion protons each. So a bunch is, it's not really

21:50.320 --> 21:54.480
 bunch shaped, they're actually quite long. They're like 30 centimeters long, but thinner than a human

21:54.480 --> 21:59.520
 hair. So like very, very narrow, long sort of objects. So those are the things. So what happens

21:59.520 --> 22:06.640
 in the LHC is you steer the beams so that they cross in the middle of the detector. So they

22:06.640 --> 22:10.880
 basically have these swarms of protons that are flying through each other. And most of that,

22:10.880 --> 22:16.320
 you have to have 100 billion coming one way, 100 billion another way, maybe 10 of them will hit

22:16.320 --> 22:21.200
 each other. Okay. So this, okay, that makes a lot more sense. That's nice. So you're trying to use

22:21.200 --> 22:26.080
 sort of, it's like probabilistically, you're not, you can't make a single particle collide with a

22:26.080 --> 22:29.920
 single object. That's not an efficient way to do it. You'd be waiting a very long time to get

22:29.920 --> 22:36.880
 anything. Yeah. So you're basically right. So you're relying on probability to me that some

22:36.880 --> 22:43.440
 fraction of them are going to collide. And then you know, which is, it's a swarm of the same kind

22:43.440 --> 22:47.280
 of particle. So it doesn't matter which ones hit each other. Exactly. I mean, that that's not to

22:47.280 --> 22:51.520
 say it's not hard. You've got to, one of the challenges to make the collisions work is you

22:51.520 --> 22:56.080
 have to squash these beams to very, very, the basic, the narrower they are, the better because the

22:56.080 --> 23:01.360
 higher the chances of them colliding. If you think about two flocks of birds flying through each other,

23:01.360 --> 23:05.040
 the birds are all far apart in the flocks. There's not much chance that they'll collide if they're

23:05.040 --> 23:08.720
 all flying densely together, and they're much more likely to collide with each other. So

23:08.720 --> 23:12.240
 that's the sort of problem. And it's tuning those magnetic fields, getting them,

23:12.240 --> 23:15.920
 the magnetic fields powerful enough that you squash the beams and focus them so that you get

23:15.920 --> 23:20.400
 enough collisions. That's super cool. Do you know how much software is involved here? I mean,

23:20.400 --> 23:26.880
 it's sort of, I come from the software world and it's fascinating. This seems like it's a software

23:26.880 --> 23:32.480
 as buggy and messy and so like you almost don't want to rely on software too much. Like if you do,

23:32.480 --> 23:37.600
 it has to be like low level, like for trans style programming. Do you know how much software is in

23:37.600 --> 23:42.240
 the large Hadron Collider? I mean, it depends on which level a lot. I mean, the whole thing is

23:42.240 --> 23:47.040
 obviously computer controlled. So I mean, I don't know a huge amount about how the software for the

23:47.040 --> 23:51.760
 actual accelerator works. But you know, I've been in the control center. So that's certain,

23:51.760 --> 23:56.160
 there's this big control room, which is like a bit like a NASA mission control with big banks of

23:56.160 --> 23:59.920
 you know, desks where the engineers sit and they monitor the LHC because you obviously can't be in

23:59.920 --> 24:06.160
 the tunnel when it's running. So everything's remote. I mean, one sort of anecdote about the

24:06.160 --> 24:11.680
 sort of software side in 2008, when the LHC first switched on, they had this big launch event, and

24:11.680 --> 24:17.760
 then you know, big press conference party to inaugurate the machine. And about 10 days after

24:17.760 --> 24:23.600
 that, they were doing some tests. And the dramatic event happened where a huge explosion basically

24:23.600 --> 24:28.480
 took place in the tunnel that destroyed or damaged, badly damaged about about half a kilometer

24:28.480 --> 24:34.240
 of the machine. But the stories, the engineers are in the control room that day. One guy told me

24:34.240 --> 24:37.520
 this story about, you know, basically all these screens they have in the control room

24:37.520 --> 24:42.320
 started going red. So all these alarms like, you know, kind of in software going off. And then

24:42.320 --> 24:44.640
 they assume that there's something wrong with the software because there's no way

24:45.360 --> 24:50.320
 something this catastrophic could have could have happened. But I mean, when I worked on,

24:50.960 --> 24:56.240
 when I was a PhD student, one of my jobs was to help to maintain the software that's used

24:56.240 --> 25:01.840
 to control the detector that we work on. And that was it's relatively robust, not so you don't

25:01.840 --> 25:05.680
 want it to be too fancy, you don't want it to sort of fall over too easily. The more clever

25:05.680 --> 25:09.680
 stuff comes when you're talking about analyzing the data. And that's where the sort of, you know,

25:10.400 --> 25:12.960
 are we jumping around too much? Do we finish with a standard model?

25:12.960 --> 25:13.600
 We didn't know.

25:13.600 --> 25:16.800
 We didn't. So we even started talking about quarks.

25:16.800 --> 25:20.240
 We haven't talked about them yet. No, we got to the messy zoo of particles.

25:20.240 --> 25:22.880
 Let me, let's go back there if it's okay.

25:22.880 --> 25:23.600
 Okay, that's fine.

25:23.600 --> 25:27.600
 Can you take us to the rest of the history of physics in the 20th century?

25:27.600 --> 25:33.840
 Okay, sure. Okay, so circa 1960, you have this, you have these 100 or so particles. It's a bit

25:33.840 --> 25:38.240
 like the periodic table all over again. So you've got like, like having 100 elements, sort of a bit

25:38.240 --> 25:45.680
 like that. And people try to start to try to impose some order. So Murray Gelman, he's a theoretical

25:45.680 --> 25:51.440
 physicist American from New York. He realizes that there are these symmetries in these particles

25:51.440 --> 25:55.440
 that if you arrange them in certain ways, they relate to each other. And he uses these symmetry

25:55.440 --> 25:59.600
 principles to predict the existence of particles that haven't been discovered, which are then

25:59.600 --> 26:04.000
 discovered in accelerators. So this starts to suggest there's not just random collections of

26:04.000 --> 26:10.400
 crap. There's like, you know, actually some order to this underlying it a little bit later in 1960.

26:11.280 --> 26:17.200
 Again, it's around the 1960s. He proposes along with another physicist called George Zweig,

26:17.760 --> 26:23.680
 that these symmetries arise because just like the patterns in the periodic table arise because

26:23.680 --> 26:28.160
 atoms are made of electrons and protons, that these patterns are due to the fact that these

26:28.160 --> 26:32.640
 particles are made of smaller things. And they are called quarks. So these are the particles

26:32.640 --> 26:36.880
 they're predicted from theory. For a long time, no one really believes they're real. A lot of

26:36.880 --> 26:41.520
 people think that they're a kind of theoretical convenience that happened to fit the data, but

26:41.520 --> 26:46.960
 there's no evidence, no one's ever seen a quark in any experiment. And lots of experiments are

26:46.960 --> 26:51.520
 done to try to find quarks, to try to knock a quark out of her. So the idea if protons and

26:51.520 --> 26:55.360
 neutrons there made a quark, you should be able to knock a quark out and see the quark. That never

26:55.360 --> 27:01.520
 happens. And we still have never actually managed to do that. Really? No. So the way that it's done

27:01.520 --> 27:07.200
 in the end is this machine that's built in California at the Stanford lab, Stanford Linear

27:07.200 --> 27:13.440
 Accelerator, which is essentially a gigantic three kilometer long electron gun, fires electrons

27:13.440 --> 27:18.640
 almost the speed of light at protons. And when you do these experiments, what you find is at

27:18.640 --> 27:26.080
 very high energy, the electrons bounce off small hard objects inside the proton. So it's a bit like

27:26.080 --> 27:31.840
 taking an x ray of the proton, you're firing these very light high energy particles, and they're

27:31.840 --> 27:37.280
 pinging off little things inside the proton that are like ball bearings, if you like. So you actually,

27:37.280 --> 27:42.640
 that way, they resolve that there are three things inside the proton, which are quarks,

27:42.640 --> 27:47.680
 the quarks that Gellman and Zweig had predicted. So that's really the evidence that convinces people

27:47.680 --> 27:52.000
 that these things are real. The fact that we've never seen one in an experiment directly, they're

27:52.000 --> 27:58.640
 always stuck inside other particles. And the reason for that is essentially to do with a strong

27:58.640 --> 28:04.240
 force, the strong force is the force holds quarks together. And it's so strong, it's impossible to

28:04.240 --> 28:08.720
 actually liberate a quark. So if you try and pull a quark out of a proton, what actually ends up

28:08.720 --> 28:14.800
 happening is that the you kind of create this, that this spring like bond in the strong force,

28:14.800 --> 28:19.760
 you imagine two quarks that are held together by a very powerful spring, you pull and pull and pull,

28:19.760 --> 28:24.000
 more and more energy gets stored in that bond like stretching a spring. And eventually the

28:24.000 --> 28:30.480
 tension gets so great, the spring snaps, and the energy in that bond gets turned into two new quarks

28:30.480 --> 28:34.480
 that go on the broken ends. So you started with two quarks, you end up with four quarks.

28:34.480 --> 28:38.960
 So you never actually get to take a quark out, you just end up making loads more quarks in the

28:38.960 --> 28:44.720
 process. So how do we, again, forgive the dumb question, how do we know quarks are real then?

28:44.720 --> 28:49.600
 Well, A, from these experiments where we can scatter, you fire electrons into the protons,

28:49.600 --> 28:55.680
 they can borrow into the proton and knock off and they can bounce off these quarks. So you can see

28:55.680 --> 29:00.320
 from the angles the electrons come out. I see you can infer. You can infer that these things are

29:00.320 --> 29:05.760
 there. The quark model can also be used, it has a lot of success is that you can use it to predict

29:05.760 --> 29:10.720
 the existence of new particles that hadn't been seen. So, and it basically, there's lots of data

29:10.720 --> 29:14.720
 basically showing from, you know, when we fire protons at each other at the LHC,

29:16.240 --> 29:20.720
 a lot of quarks get knocked all over the place. And every time they try and escape from, say,

29:20.720 --> 29:26.240
 one of their protons, they make a whole jet of quarks that go flying off as bound up in other

29:26.240 --> 29:30.960
 sorts of particles made of quarks. So all the sort of the theoretical predictions from the

29:30.960 --> 29:35.280
 basic theory of the strong force and the quarks all agrees with what we are seeing experiments.

29:35.280 --> 29:39.680
 We've just never seen an actual quark on its own because unfortunately it's impossible to get them

29:39.680 --> 29:47.520
 out on their own. So quarks, these crazy smaller things, they're hard to imagine are real. So what

29:47.520 --> 29:52.320
 else? What else is part of the story here? So the other thing that's going on at the time around

29:52.320 --> 30:00.080
 the 60s is an attempt to understand the forces that make these particles interact with each other.

30:00.080 --> 30:04.080
 So you have the electromagnetic force, which is the force that was sort of discovered to some

30:04.080 --> 30:09.920
 extent in this room or at least in this building. So the first, what we call quantum field theory

30:09.920 --> 30:18.160
 of the electromagnetic force is developed in the 1940s and 50s by Feynman, Richard Feynman,

30:18.160 --> 30:23.280
 amongst other people, Julian Schringer, Thomas Nager, who come up with the first, what we call

30:23.280 --> 30:27.120
 a quantum field theory of the electromagnetic force. And this is where this description of,

30:27.120 --> 30:32.160
 which I gave you at the beginning, that particles are ripples in fields. Well, in this theory,

30:32.160 --> 30:36.480
 the photon, the particle of light is described as a ripple in this quantum field called the

30:36.480 --> 30:40.880
 electromagnetic field. And the attempt then is made to try, well, can we come up with a

30:40.880 --> 30:46.240
 quantum field theory of the other forces, of the strong force and the weak, the third force,

30:46.240 --> 30:51.120
 which we haven't discussed, which is the weak force, which is a nuclear force. We don't really

30:51.120 --> 30:55.120
 experience it in our everyday lives, but it's responsible for radioactive decay. It's the

30:55.120 --> 31:00.880
 force that allows, you know, an radioactive atom to turn into a different element, for example.

31:00.880 --> 31:06.800
 And I don't know if we've explicitly mentioned, but so there's technically four forces. Yes.

31:06.800 --> 31:11.760
 I guess three of them would be in the standard model, like the weak, the strong,

31:11.760 --> 31:15.440
 and the electromagnetic, and then there's gravity. And there's gravity, which we don't

31:15.440 --> 31:19.760
 worry about that, because it's too hard. Maybe we bring that up at the end. But yeah,

31:19.760 --> 31:24.160
 gravity so far, we don't have a quantum theory of, and if you can solve that problem, you'll

31:24.160 --> 31:27.680
 win a Nobel Prize. Well, we're going to have to bring up the graviton at some point. I'm going to

31:27.680 --> 31:35.600
 ask you, but let's leave that to the side for now. So those three, okay, Feynman electromagnetic

31:35.600 --> 31:41.840
 force, the quantum field, and where does the weak force come in?

31:41.840 --> 31:45.600
 So yeah, well, first of all, I mean, the strong force is a bit easier. So the strong force

31:45.600 --> 31:49.360
 is a little bit like the electromagnetic force. It's a force that binds things together. So that's

31:49.360 --> 31:54.880
 the force that holds quarks together inside the proton, for example. So a quantum field theory of

31:54.880 --> 32:02.160
 that force is discovered in the, I think it's in the 60s. And it predicts the existence of new

32:02.160 --> 32:08.000
 force particles called gluons. So gluons are a bit like the photon. The photon is the particle of

32:08.000 --> 32:14.720
 electromagnetism. Gluons are the particles of the strong force. And so there's, just like there's

32:14.720 --> 32:18.560
 an electromagnetic field, there's something called a gluon field, which is also all around us.

32:19.280 --> 32:23.520
 So these particles, some of these particles, I guess, are the force carriers or whatever.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.880
 They carry the... Well, it depends how you want to think about it. I mean, really, the field,

32:26.880 --> 32:31.920
 the strong force field, the gluon field is the thing that binds the quarks together.

32:32.720 --> 32:37.200
 The gluons are the little ripples in that field. So that, like, in the same way that the photon is

32:37.200 --> 32:43.440
 a ripple in the electromagnetic field. But the thing that really does the binding is the field.

32:43.440 --> 32:47.680
 I mean, you may have heard people talk about things like, as you've heard the phrase, virtual

32:47.680 --> 32:54.240
 particle. So sometimes if you hear people describing how forces are exchanged between

32:54.240 --> 32:57.840
 particles, they quite often talk about the idea that, you know, if you have an electron and

32:57.840 --> 33:02.960
 another electron, say, and they're repelling each other through the electromagnetic force,

33:02.960 --> 33:06.960
 you can think of that as if they're exchanging photons. So they're kind of firing photons

33:06.960 --> 33:10.320
 backwards and forwards between each other. And that causes them to repel.

33:10.960 --> 33:12.960
 That photon is then a virtual particle.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.680
 Yes, that's what we call a virtual particle. In other words, it's not a real thing. It doesn't

33:15.680 --> 33:20.560
 actually exist. So it's an artifact of the way theorists do calculations. So when they do

33:20.560 --> 33:24.960
 calculations in quantum field theory, rather than there's no one's discovered a way of just treating

33:24.960 --> 33:29.600
 the whole field, you have to break the field down into simpler things. So you can basically treat

33:29.600 --> 33:34.720
 the field as if it's made up of lots of these virtual photons. But there's no experiment that you

33:34.720 --> 33:40.320
 can do that can detect these particles being exchanged. What's really happening in reality

33:40.320 --> 33:45.840
 is that the electromagnetic field is warped by the charge of the electron, and that causes the

33:45.840 --> 33:51.200
 force. But the way we do calculations involves particles, so it's a bit confusing. But it's

33:51.200 --> 33:55.520
 really a mathematical technique. It's not something that corresponds to reality.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.080
 I mean, that's part, I guess, of the Feynman diagrams.

33:58.080 --> 33:58.560
 Yes.

33:58.560 --> 33:59.760
 Is this these virtual particles?

33:59.760 --> 34:00.000
 Okay.

34:00.000 --> 34:00.400
 That's right.

34:00.400 --> 34:00.800
 Yeah.

34:00.800 --> 34:03.440
 Some of these have mass. Some of them don't.

34:03.440 --> 34:10.800
 Mm hmm. What does that even mean, not to have mass? Maybe you can say which one of

34:10.800 --> 34:12.400
 them has mass and which don't.

34:14.000 --> 34:21.280
 And why is mass important or relevant in this field view of the universe?

34:21.840 --> 34:25.280
 Well, there are actually only two particles in the standard model that don't have mass,

34:25.280 --> 34:31.520
 which are the photon and the gluons. So they are massless particles. But the electron,

34:31.520 --> 34:34.880
 the quarks, and there are a bunch of other particles I haven't discussed. There's something

34:34.880 --> 34:39.920
 called a muon and a tau, which are basically heavy versions of the electron that are unstable.

34:39.920 --> 34:44.960
 You can make them in accelerators, but they don't form atoms or anything. They don't exist for long

34:44.960 --> 34:51.760
 enough. But all the matter particles, there are 12 of them, six quarks and six, what we call leptons,

34:51.760 --> 34:56.400
 which includes the electron and its two heavy versions and three neutrinos. All of them have

34:56.400 --> 35:02.160
 mass. And so do, this is the critical bit. So the weak force, which is the third of these

35:02.800 --> 35:11.520
 quantum forces, which is one of the hardest to understand, the force particles of that force

35:11.520 --> 35:17.600
 have very large masses. And there are three of them. They're called the W plus, the W minus,

35:17.600 --> 35:24.720
 and the Z boson. And they have masses of between 80 and 90 times that of the protons. They're

35:24.720 --> 35:30.080
 very heavy. Wow. The very heavy thing. What, the heaviest, I guess? They're not the heaviest.

35:30.080 --> 35:38.880
 The heaviest particle is the top quark, which has a mass of about 175 ish protons. So that's

35:38.880 --> 35:43.040
 really massive. And we don't know why it's so massive. But it's coming back to the weak force.

35:43.040 --> 35:50.400
 So the problem in the 60s and 70s was that the reason that the electromagnetic force is a force

35:50.400 --> 35:53.120
 that we can experience in our everyday lives. So if we have a magnet and a piece of metal,

35:53.120 --> 35:58.080
 you can hold it a meter apart if it's powerful enough and you'll feel a force. Whereas the weak

35:58.080 --> 36:03.840
 force only becomes apparent when you basically have two particles touching at the scale of

36:04.560 --> 36:10.880
 a nucleus. So we get to very short distances before this force becomes manifest. We don't get weak

36:10.880 --> 36:15.760
 forces going on in this room. We don't notice them. And the reason for that is that the particle,

36:15.760 --> 36:22.160
 well, the field that transmits the weak force, the particle that's associated with that field

36:22.160 --> 36:28.240
 has a very large mass, which means that the field dies off very quickly. Whereas an electric charge,

36:28.240 --> 36:31.360
 if you were to look at the shape of the electromagnetic field, it would fall off with

36:31.360 --> 36:36.640
 this thing called the inverse square law, which is the idea that the force halves every time you

36:36.640 --> 36:42.400
 double the distance. No, sorry, it doesn't halve. It quarters every time you double the distance

36:42.400 --> 36:46.720
 between, say, the two particles. Whereas the weak force, kind of, you move a little bit away from

36:46.720 --> 36:52.480
 the nucleus and just disappears. The reason for that is because these fields, the particles that

36:52.480 --> 37:00.160
 go with them, have a very large mass. But the problem that theorists faced in the 60s was that

37:00.160 --> 37:06.640
 if you tried to introduce massive force fields, the theory gave you nonsensical answers. So you'd

37:06.640 --> 37:12.320
 end up with infinite results for a lot of the calculations you tried to do. So it turned out

37:12.320 --> 37:17.680
 it seemed that quantum field theory was incompatible with having massive particles. Not just the

37:17.680 --> 37:24.080
 force particles, actually, but even the electron was a problem. So this is where the Higgs that we

37:24.080 --> 37:29.440
 sort of alluded to comes in. And the solution was to say, okay, well, actually, all the particles

37:29.440 --> 37:33.200
 in the standard model are mass. They have no mass. So the quarks, the electron, they don't have a mass.

37:33.200 --> 37:38.080
 Neither do these weak particles. They don't have mass either. What happens is they actually acquire

37:38.080 --> 37:42.400
 mass through another process. They get it from somewhere else. They don't actually have it

37:42.400 --> 37:47.760
 intrinsically. So this idea that was introduced by, well, Peter Higgs is the most famous, but

37:47.760 --> 37:51.040
 actually there are about six people that came up with the idea more or less at the same time,

37:52.000 --> 37:56.880
 is that you introduce a new quantum field, which is another one of these invisible things that's

37:56.880 --> 38:02.880
 everywhere. And it's through the interaction with this field that particles get mass. So you can

38:02.880 --> 38:10.720
 think of, say, an electron in the Higgs field. The Higgs field kind of bunches around the electron.

38:10.720 --> 38:15.680
 It's sort of drawn towards the electron. And that energy that's stored in that field around the

38:15.680 --> 38:21.520
 electron is what we see as the mass of the electron. But if you could somehow turn off the Higgs field,

38:21.520 --> 38:25.680
 then all the particles in nature would become massless and fly around at the speed of light.

38:25.680 --> 38:34.800
 So this idea of the Higgs field allowed other people, other theorists, to come up with a,

38:34.800 --> 38:41.760
 well, it was basically a unified theory of the electromagnetic force and the weak force. So

38:41.760 --> 38:46.240
 once you bring in the Higgs field, you can combine two of the forces into one. So it turns out the

38:46.240 --> 38:51.440
 electromagnetic force and the weak force are just two aspects of the same fundamental force.

38:51.440 --> 38:56.240
 And at the LHC, we go to high enough energies that you see these two forces

38:57.120 --> 38:58.960
 unifying effectively.

38:58.960 --> 39:06.000
 So first of all, it started as a theoretical notion. And then,

39:06.960 --> 39:10.080
 I mean, wasn't the Higgs called the God particle at some point?

39:10.080 --> 39:13.280
 It was by a guy trying to sell popular science books. Yeah.

39:13.280 --> 39:18.480
 Yeah. But I mean, I remember because when I was hearing it, I thought it would,

39:18.480 --> 39:25.600
 I mean, that would solve a lot of the, unify a lot of our ideas of physics. It was my notion.

39:26.240 --> 39:33.520
 But maybe you can speak to that. Is it as big of a leap? Is it as a God particle? Is it Jesus

39:33.520 --> 39:40.240
 particle? Which, you know, what's the big contribution of Higgs in terms of this unification

39:40.240 --> 39:45.120
 power? Yeah. I mean, to understand that, it maybe helps to know the history a little bit. So

39:45.120 --> 39:49.680
 when the, what we call electroweak theory was put together, which is where you unify

39:49.680 --> 39:53.840
 electromagnetism with the weak force and Higgs is involved in all of that. So that theory,

39:53.840 --> 40:00.080
 which was written in the mid 70s, predicted the existence of four new particles, the W plus

40:00.080 --> 40:04.640
 boson, the W minus boson, the Z boson and the Higgs boson. So there were these four particles

40:04.640 --> 40:11.040
 that came with the theory that were predicted by the theory. In 1983, 84, the W's and the Z

40:11.040 --> 40:15.840
 particles were discovered at an accelerator at CERN called the super proton synchrotron,

40:15.840 --> 40:22.080
 which was a seven kilometer particle collider. So three of the bits of this theory had already

40:22.080 --> 40:27.680
 been found. So people were pretty confident from the 80s that the Higgs must exist because it was

40:27.680 --> 40:33.600
 a part of this family of particles that this theoretical structure only works if the Higgs is

40:33.600 --> 40:39.520
 there. So what then happens? So this question about why is the LHC the size it is? Well,

40:39.520 --> 40:44.400
 actually, the tunnel that the LHC is in was not built for the LHC. It was built for a previous

40:44.400 --> 40:51.600
 accelerator called the large electron positron collider. So that began operation in the late

40:51.600 --> 40:57.440
 80s, early 90s. Basically, that's when they dug the 27 kilometer tunnel, they put this accelerator

40:57.440 --> 41:02.640
 into it, collider that fires electrons and anti electrons at each other, electrons and positrons.

41:02.640 --> 41:06.960
 So the purpose of that machine was, well, it was actually to look for the Higgs. That was one of

41:06.960 --> 41:11.840
 the things it was trying to do. It didn't have enough energy to do it in the end. But the main

41:11.840 --> 41:18.240
 thing it achieved was it studied the W and the Z particles at very high precision. So it made loads

41:18.240 --> 41:21.840
 of these things. Previously, you can only make a few of them at the previous accelerator. So you

41:21.840 --> 41:27.040
 could study these really, really precisely. And by studying their properties, you could really test

41:27.040 --> 41:31.680
 this electoral week theory that had been invented in the 70s and really make sure that it worked. So

41:31.680 --> 41:39.680
 actually by 1999, when this machine turned off, people knew, well, okay, you never know until

41:39.680 --> 41:44.000
 you, until you find the thing. But people were really confident this electoral week theory was

41:44.000 --> 41:49.600
 right. And that the Higgs almost the Higgs or something very like the Higgs had to exist,

41:49.600 --> 41:54.240
 because otherwise, the whole thing doesn't work. It'd be really weird if you could discover and

41:54.240 --> 41:58.160
 these particles, they all behave exactly the theory tells you this should, but somehow this

41:58.160 --> 42:04.320
 key piece of the picture is not there. So in a way, it depends how you look at it. The discovery

42:04.320 --> 42:10.640
 of the Higgs on its own is obviously a huge achievement in many both experimentally and

42:10.640 --> 42:16.160
 theoretically. On the other hand, it's this it's like having a jigsaw puzzle where every piece

42:16.160 --> 42:20.960
 has been filled in you've this beautiful image, there's one gap and you kind of know that that

42:20.960 --> 42:28.960
 piece must be there somewhere, right? So, so the discovery in itself, although it's important,

42:28.960 --> 42:34.960
 is not so interesting. It's like a confirmation of the obvious at that point. But what makes it

42:34.960 --> 42:39.280
 interesting is not that it just completes the standard model, which is a theory that we've

42:39.280 --> 42:47.200
 known had the basic layout of for 40 years or more. Now, it's that the Higgs actually is a

42:47.200 --> 42:52.880
 unique particle is very different to any of the other particles and standard model. And it's a

42:52.880 --> 42:59.120
 theoretically very troublesome particle, there are a lot of nasty things to do with the Higgs,

42:59.120 --> 43:03.440
 but also opportunities. So that we basically we don't really understand how such an object

43:04.160 --> 43:09.600
 can exist in the form that it does. So there are lots of reasons for thinking that the Higgs

43:09.600 --> 43:15.280
 must come with a bunch of other particles, or that it's perhaps made of other things. So it's not

43:15.280 --> 43:19.120
 a fundamental particle that it's made of smaller things. I can talk about that if you like a bit.

43:19.120 --> 43:24.880
 That's that's still a notion. So, yeah. So the Higgs might not be a fundamental particle that

43:24.880 --> 43:30.400
 there might be some in my oh man. So that that is an idea is not you know, it's not been demonstrated

43:30.400 --> 43:34.640
 to be true. But I mean, there's all of these ideas basically come from the fact that

43:36.640 --> 43:42.160
 it's a this is a problem that motivated a lot of development in physics in the last 30 years or so.

43:42.160 --> 43:47.120
 And there's this basic fact that the Higgs field, which is this field that's everywhere in the universe,

43:47.120 --> 43:50.560
 this is the thing that gives mass to the particles. And the Higgs field is different from every all

43:50.560 --> 43:55.040
 the other fields in that, let's say you take the electromagnetic field, which is you know,

43:55.040 --> 43:58.160
 if we actually were to measure the electromagnetic field in this room, we would measure all kinds

43:58.160 --> 44:02.000
 of stuff going on because there's light, there's going to be microwaves and radio waves and stuff.

44:02.000 --> 44:06.400
 But let's say we could go to a really, really remote part of empty space and shield it and

44:06.400 --> 44:10.400
 put a big box around it and then measure the electromagnetic field in that box, the field

44:10.400 --> 44:16.240
 would be almost zero, apart from some little quantum fluctuations. But basically it goes to naught.

44:16.800 --> 44:21.600
 The Higgs field has a value everywhere. So it's a bit like the whole is like the entire

44:21.600 --> 44:26.320
 space has got this energy stored in the Higgs field, which is not zero, it's it's finite,

44:26.320 --> 44:31.040
 it's got some it's a bit like having the the temperature of space raised to, you know, some

44:31.040 --> 44:37.440
 background temperature. And it's that energy that gives mass to the particles. So the reason that

44:37.440 --> 44:42.960
 electrons and quarks have mass is through the interaction with this energy that's stored in

44:42.960 --> 44:52.240
 the Higgs field. Now, it turns out that the precise value this energy has has to be very carefully

44:52.960 --> 44:59.520
 tuned. If you want a universe where interesting stuff can happen. So if you push the Higgs field

44:59.520 --> 45:04.880
 down, it has a tendency to collapse to what there's a tent if you do your sort of naive

45:04.880 --> 45:08.720
 calculations, they're basically two possible likely configurations for the Higgs field,

45:08.720 --> 45:12.960
 which is either it's zero everywhere, in which case you have a universe which is just

45:13.600 --> 45:17.200
 particles with no mass that can't form atoms and just fly about at the speed of light,

45:17.920 --> 45:22.720
 or it explodes to an enormous value, what we call the Planck scale, which is the scale of

45:22.720 --> 45:27.840
 quantum gravity. And at that point, if the Higgs field was that strong, even an electron would

45:27.840 --> 45:32.080
 become so massive that it would collapse into a black hole. And then you have a universe made

45:32.080 --> 45:38.960
 of black holes and nothing like us. So it seems that the strength of the Higgs field is to achieve

45:38.960 --> 45:43.440
 the value that we see requires what we call fine tuning of the laws of physics. You have to fiddle

45:43.440 --> 45:48.640
 around with the other fields and the standard model and their properties to just get it to this

45:48.640 --> 45:55.600
 right sort of Goldilocks value that allows atoms to exist. This is deeply fishy. People really

45:55.600 --> 46:03.680
 dislike this. So two explanations. One, there's a God that designed this perfectly and two is

46:04.240 --> 46:07.440
 there's an infinite number of alternate universes and we're just

46:08.240 --> 46:14.800
 happening to be in the one in which life is possible. So when you say life, any kind of

46:14.800 --> 46:22.800
 complexity, that's not either complete chaos or black holes. How does that make you feel? What

46:22.800 --> 46:28.640
 do you make of that? That's such a fascinating notion that this perfectly tuned field that's

46:28.640 --> 46:34.000
 the same everywhere is there. What do you make of that? Yeah, what do you make of that?

46:34.000 --> 46:36.480
 I mean, yeah, so you laid out two of the possible explanations.

46:36.480 --> 46:37.760
 Really? Is this a spec?

46:37.760 --> 46:42.640
 Yeah, I mean, well, someone, you know, some cosmic creator went, yeah, let's fix that to be at the

46:42.640 --> 46:46.080
 right level. That's one possibility, I guess. It's not a scientifically testable one, but,

46:46.080 --> 46:48.640
 you know, theoretically, I guess it's possible.

46:48.640 --> 46:52.640
 Sorry to interrupt, but there could also be not a designer, but couldn't there

46:52.640 --> 46:57.760
 be just, I guess I'm not sure what that would be, but some kind of force that

47:02.160 --> 47:11.120
 some kind of mechanism by which this kind of field is enforced in order to create complexity,

47:11.120 --> 47:19.200
 basically forces that pull the universe towards an interesting complexity.

47:19.200 --> 47:23.520
 I mean, yeah, I mean, there are people who have those ideas. I don't really subscribe to them.

47:23.520 --> 47:25.440
 As I'm saying, it sounds really stupid.

47:25.440 --> 47:28.240
 No, I mean, there are definitely people that make those kind of arguments.

47:29.040 --> 47:34.720
 You know, there's ideas that I think it's Lee Smolin's idea. I think that, you know,

47:35.280 --> 47:41.120
 universes are born inside black holes. And so universes, they basically have like Darwinian

47:41.120 --> 47:45.600
 evolution of the universe where universes give birth to other universes. And if universes where

47:45.600 --> 47:49.360
 black holes can form are more likely to give birth to more universes. So you end up with

47:49.360 --> 47:52.240
 universes which have similar laws. I mean, I don't know, whatever.

47:52.240 --> 48:01.600
 Well, I talked to Lee recently on this podcast, and he's a reminder to me that the physics community

48:02.320 --> 48:07.520
 has like so many interesting characters. It's fascinating. Anyway, sorry.

48:07.520 --> 48:11.520
 I mean, as an experimentalist, I tend to sort of think, these are interesting ideas, but

48:11.520 --> 48:15.200
 they're not really testable. So I tend not to think about them very much. So, I mean,

48:15.200 --> 48:20.080
 going back to the science of this, there is an explanation. There is a possible solution to

48:20.080 --> 48:25.200
 this problem of the Higgs, which doesn't involve multiverses or creators fiddling about with the

48:25.200 --> 48:31.760
 laws of physics. If the most popular solution was something called supersymmetry, which is a theory

48:31.760 --> 48:36.960
 which involves a new type of symmetry of the universe. In fact, it's one of the last types

48:36.960 --> 48:40.240
 of symmetries that it's possible to have that we haven't already seen in nature,

48:40.240 --> 48:46.240
 which is a symmetry between force particles and matter particles. So what we call fermions,

48:46.240 --> 48:50.240
 which are the matter particles and bosons, which are force particles. And if you have

48:50.240 --> 48:56.640
 supersymmetry, then there is a superpartner for every particle in the standard model. And without

48:56.640 --> 49:00.560
 going into the details, the effect of this basically is that you have a whole bunch of other fields,

49:01.200 --> 49:06.720
 and these fields cancel out the effect of the standard model fields, and they stabilize the

49:06.720 --> 49:12.400
 Higgs field at a nice sensible value. So in supersymmetry, you naturally, without any tinkering

49:12.400 --> 49:17.600
 about with the constants of nature or anything, you get Higgs field with a nice value, which is

49:17.600 --> 49:22.080
 the one we see. So this is one of the, and supersymmetry has also got lots of other things going

49:22.080 --> 49:27.760
 for it. It predicts the existence of a dark matter particle, which would be great. It potentially

49:27.760 --> 49:33.200
 suggests that the strong force and the electoral weak force unify high energy. So lots of reasons

49:33.200 --> 49:37.600
 people thought this was a productive idea. And when the LHC was just before it was turned on,

49:37.600 --> 49:42.800
 there was a lot of hype, I guess, a lot of an expectation that we would discover these super

49:42.800 --> 49:50.080
 partners, because particularly the main reason was that if supersymmetry stabilizes the Higgs field

49:50.080 --> 49:56.880
 at this nice Goldilocks value, these super particles should have a mass around the energy

49:56.880 --> 50:00.800
 that we're probing at the LHC, around the energy of the Higgs. So it was kind of thought you

50:00.800 --> 50:04.720
 discovered the Higgs, you probably discover super partners as well. So once you start creating

50:04.720 --> 50:09.760
 ripples in this Higgs field, you should be able to see these kinds of, you should be, yeah.

50:09.760 --> 50:12.160
 So these super fields would be there. And when I, without the very beginning, I said,

50:12.160 --> 50:15.920
 we're probing the vacuum. What I mean is really that, you know, okay, let's say these super

50:15.920 --> 50:19.920
 fields exist, the vacuum contains super fields, they're there, these supersymmetric fields.

50:19.920 --> 50:24.640
 If we hit them hard enough, we can make them vibrate. We see super particles come flying out.

50:24.640 --> 50:32.800
 That's the idea. That's the whole point. We haven't. But we haven't. So far, at least,

50:32.800 --> 50:41.600
 I mean, we've had now a decade of data taking at the LHC. No signs of super partners have

50:41.600 --> 50:45.440
 supersymmetric particles have been found. In fact, no signs of any physics, any new

50:45.440 --> 50:48.720
 particles beyond the standard model have been found. So supersymmetry is not the only thing

50:48.720 --> 50:53.040
 that can do this. There are other theories that involve additional dimensions of space,

50:53.040 --> 50:58.240
 or potentially involve the Higgs boson being made of smaller things, being made of other particles.

50:58.240 --> 51:02.160
 That's an interesting, you know, I haven't heard that before. That's really, that's an interesting

51:02.160 --> 51:07.760
 point. Can you maybe linger on that? Like what, what could be, what, what could the Higgs particle

51:07.760 --> 51:12.160
 be made of? Well, so the oldest, I think the original ideas about this was these theories

51:12.160 --> 51:18.000
 called Technicolor, which were basically like an analogy with the strong force. So the idea was

51:18.000 --> 51:24.720
 the Higgs boson was a bound state of two very strongly interacting particles that were a bit

51:24.720 --> 51:30.400
 like quarks. So like quarks, but I guess higher energy things with a super strong force and not

51:30.400 --> 51:34.640
 the strong force, but a new force that was very strong. And the Higgs was a bound state of, of

51:34.640 --> 51:39.760
 these, these objects. And the Higgs, in principle, if that was right, would be the first in a series

51:39.760 --> 51:46.640
 of Technicolor particles. Technicolor, I think, not being a theorist, but it's not, it's basically

51:46.640 --> 51:51.840
 not done very well, particularly since the LHC found the Higgs, that kind of, it rules out,

51:51.840 --> 51:54.720
 you know, a lot of these Technicolor theories. But there are other things that are a bit like

51:54.720 --> 52:01.840
 Technicolor. So there's a theory called partial compositeness, which is an idea that some of

52:01.840 --> 52:07.280
 my colleagues at Cambridge have worked on, which is a similar sort of idea that the Higgs is a

52:07.280 --> 52:12.800
 bound state of some strongly interacting particles, and that the standard model particles themselves,

52:12.800 --> 52:20.400
 the more exotic ones like the top quark are also sort of mixtures of these composite particles.

52:20.400 --> 52:25.680
 So it's a kind of an extension to the standard model, which explains this problem with the Higgs

52:25.680 --> 52:32.240
 bosons, Goldilocks value, but also helps us understand we have, we're in this situation now

52:32.240 --> 52:38.480
 again, a bit like the periodic table where we have six quarks, six leptons in this kind of,

52:38.480 --> 52:42.320
 you can arrange in this nice table and they, you can see these columns where the patterns repeat

52:42.320 --> 52:48.800
 and you go, okay, maybe there's something deeper going on here. And so this would potentially

52:48.800 --> 52:54.160
 be something this partial compositeness theory could explain a sort of enlarge this picture

52:54.160 --> 52:58.080
 that allows us to see the whole symmetrical pattern and understand what the ingredients,

52:58.080 --> 53:04.160
 why do we have, so one of the big questions in particle physics is, why are there three copies

53:04.160 --> 53:08.720
 of the matter particles? So in what we call the first generation, which is what we're made of,

53:08.720 --> 53:12.960
 there's the electron, the electron neutrino, the up quark and the down quark,

53:12.960 --> 53:17.680
 they're the most common matter particles in the universe. But then there are copies of these

53:17.680 --> 53:21.760
 four particles in the second and the third generations. So things like muons and top

53:21.760 --> 53:26.080
 quarks and other stuff, we don't know why we see these patterns, we have no idea where it comes

53:26.080 --> 53:32.800
 from. So that's another big question, you know, can we find out the deeper order that explains

53:32.800 --> 53:40.080
 this particular periodic table of particles that we see? Is it possible that the deeper order includes

53:40.080 --> 53:45.600
 like almost a single entity? So like something that I guess like string theory dreams about,

53:46.400 --> 53:54.000
 is this essentially the dream, is to discover something simple, beautiful and unifying?

53:54.000 --> 53:59.920
 Yeah, I mean, that is the dream. And I think for some people, for a lot of people, it still is the

53:59.920 --> 54:06.480
 dream. So there's a great book by Steven Weinberg, who is one of the theoretical physicists who was

54:06.480 --> 54:11.520
 instrumental in building the standard model. So he came up with some others with the electroweak

54:11.520 --> 54:15.520
 theory, the theory that unified electromagnetism and the weak force. And here at this book,

54:15.520 --> 54:19.920
 I think it was towards the end of the 80s, early 90s called Dreams of a Final Theory,

54:19.920 --> 54:26.480
 which is a very lovely, quite short book about this idea of a final unifying theory that brings

54:26.480 --> 54:30.640
 everything together. And I think you get a sense reading his book written at the end of the 80s,

54:30.640 --> 54:38.560
 early 90s, that there was this feeling that such a theory was coming. And that was the time when

54:38.560 --> 54:42.720
 string theory had been, was very exciting. So string theory, there's been this thing called

54:42.720 --> 54:46.480
 the super string revolution and theoretical physics getting very excited, they discovered

54:46.480 --> 54:50.960
 these theoretical objects, these little vibrating loops of string that in principle, not only was

54:50.960 --> 54:55.040
 a quantum theory of gravity, but could explain all the particles in the standard model and bring

54:55.040 --> 55:01.280
 it all together. And as you say, you have one object, the string, and you can pluck it. And

55:01.280 --> 55:05.840
 the way it vibrates gives you these different notes, each of which is a different particle.

55:05.840 --> 55:13.440
 So it's a very lovely idea. But the problem is that there's a few people discover that mathematics

55:13.440 --> 55:18.720
 is very difficult. So people have spent three decades and more trying to understand string

55:18.720 --> 55:22.240
 theory. And I think, you know, if you spoke to most string theorists, they would probably freely

55:22.240 --> 55:25.840
 admit that no one really knows what string theory is. Yeah, I mean, there's been a lot of work,

55:25.840 --> 55:31.760
 but it's not really understood. And the other problem is that string theory mostly makes

55:31.760 --> 55:38.800
 predictions about physics that occurs at energies far beyond what we will ever be able to probe

55:38.800 --> 55:44.960
 in the laboratory. Yeah, probably ever. By the way, so sorry, take a million tangents, but

55:45.840 --> 55:50.880
 is there room for complete innovation of how to build a particle collider that could give

55:50.880 --> 55:57.360
 us an order of magnitude increase in the kind of energies? Or do we need to keep just increasing

55:57.360 --> 56:02.240
 the size of thing? I mean, maybe, yeah, I mean, there are ideas to give you a sense of the gulf

56:02.240 --> 56:12.080
 that has to be bridged. So the LHC collides particles at an energy of what we call 14

56:12.080 --> 56:16.560
 terat electron volts. So that's basically the equivalent of you've accelerated a proton through

56:16.560 --> 56:23.120
 14 trillion volts. That gets us to the energies where the Higgs and these weak particles live.

56:23.120 --> 56:28.480
 They're very massive. The scale where strings become manifest is something called the Planck

56:28.480 --> 56:34.960
 scale, which I think is of the order 10 to the, hang on, get this right. It's 10 to the 18 giga

56:34.960 --> 56:42.400
 electron volts. So about 10 to the 15 terat electron volts. So you're talking, you know,

56:42.400 --> 56:48.560
 trillions of times more energy. Yeah, 10 to the 15 or 10 to the 14th larger.

56:50.720 --> 56:55.120
 It's a very big number. So, you know, we're not talking just an order of magnitude increase

56:55.120 --> 57:00.000
 in energy. We're talking 14 orders of magnitude energy increase. So to give you a sense of

57:00.000 --> 57:04.640
 what that would look like, were you to build a particle accelerator with today's technology?

57:04.640 --> 57:08.960
 Bigger or smaller than our solar system? The size of the galaxy.

57:08.960 --> 57:13.120
 The galaxy. So you need to put a particle accelerator that circled the Milky Way

57:13.120 --> 57:19.760
 to get to the energies where you would see strings if they exist. So that is a fundamental

57:19.760 --> 57:24.640
 problem, which is that most of the predictions of the unified, these unified theories, quantum

57:24.640 --> 57:30.320
 theories of gravity, only make statements that are testable at energies that we will not be able

57:30.320 --> 57:37.200
 to probe and barring some unbelievable, you know, completely unexpected technological or

57:37.200 --> 57:41.040
 scientific breakthrough, which is almost impossible to imagine. You never say never,

57:41.040 --> 57:46.800
 but it seems very unlikely. Yeah, I can just see the news story. Elon Musk decides to build

57:47.680 --> 57:52.000
 particle collider the size of our... It would have to be, we'd have to get together with all

57:52.000 --> 57:57.280
 our galactic neighbors to pay for it, I think. What is the exciting possibilities of the large

57:57.280 --> 58:04.560
 hydron collider? What is there to be discovered in this order of magnitude of scale? Is there

58:04.560 --> 58:11.920
 other bigger efforts on the horizon in this space? What are the open problems, the exciting

58:11.920 --> 58:17.440
 possibilities? You mentioned supersymmetry. Yeah. So, well, there are lots of new ideas.

58:17.440 --> 58:20.080
 Well, there are lots of problems that we're facing. So there's a problem with the Higgs field,

58:20.080 --> 58:26.560
 which supersymmetry was supposed to solve. There's the fact that 95% of the universe we know from

58:26.560 --> 58:31.760
 cosmology astrophysics is invisible, that it's made of dark matter and dark energy,

58:31.760 --> 58:35.920
 which are really just words for things that we don't know what they are. It's what Donald

58:35.920 --> 58:40.800
 Rumsfeld called a known unknown. So we know we don't know what they are. Well, that's better

58:40.800 --> 58:44.880
 than unknown unknown. Yeah, well, there may be some unknown unknowns, but we don't know what

58:44.880 --> 58:55.120
 those are. But the hope is a particle accelerator could help us make sense of dark energy, dark

58:55.120 --> 58:59.840
 matter. There's still some hope for that. There's hope for that. Yeah. So one of the hopes is the

58:59.840 --> 59:08.480
 LHC could produce a dark matter particle in its collisions. And it may be that the LHC will

59:08.480 --> 59:12.560
 still discover new particles that it might still supersymmetry could still be there. It's just

59:12.560 --> 59:17.760
 maybe more difficult to find than we thought originally. And dark matter particles might

59:17.760 --> 59:21.280
 be being produced, but we're just not looking in the right part of the data for them. That's

59:21.280 --> 59:25.200
 possible. It might be that we need more data, that these processes are very rare and we need

59:25.200 --> 59:29.920
 to collect lots and lots of data before we see them. But I think a lot of people would say now

59:29.920 --> 59:37.760
 that the chances of the LHC directly discovering new particles in the near future is quite slim.

59:37.760 --> 59:43.920
 It may be that we need a decade more data before we can see something or we may not see anything.

59:43.920 --> 59:49.200
 That's the that's where we are. So I mean, the physics, the experiments that I work on. So I

59:49.200 --> 59:53.520
 work on a detector called LHCB, which is one of these four big detectors that are spaced around

59:53.520 --> 59:58.720
 the ring. And we do slightly different stuff to the big guys. There's two big experiments called

59:58.720 --> 1:00:04.960
 Atlas and CMS, 3000 physicists and scientists and computer scientists on them, each, they are the

1:00:04.960 --> 1:00:08.480
 ones that discovered the Higgs and they look for supersymmetry and dark matter and so on.

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:14.160
 What we look at are standard model particles called bequarks, which depending on your your

1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:18.480
 preference is either bottom or beauty. We tend to say beauty because it sounds sexier.

1:00:18.480 --> 1:00:25.520
 Sure. Yeah, for sure. But these particles are interesting because they of you can make lots

1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:29.440
 of them, we make billions or billions, hundreds of billions of these things, you can therefore

1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:33.680
 measure their properties very precisely. So you can make these really lovely precision measurements.

1:00:34.320 --> 1:00:40.720
 And what we are doing really is a sort of complementary thing to the other big experiments,

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:44.960
 which is they if you think of the silver analogy that often uses, if imagine you're looking in

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:51.440
 you're in a jungle and you're looking for an elephant, say, and you are a hunter and you're

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:54.400
 kind of like, let's say there's the relevance very rare, you don't know where in the jungle,

1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:58.080
 the jungle is big. So there's two ways you go about this, either you can go wandering around

1:00:58.080 --> 1:01:01.680
 the jungle and try and find the elephant. The problem is if the elephant, if there's only one

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:06.000
 elephant in the jungle is big, the chances of running into it very small, or you could look

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:10.640
 on the ground and see if you see footprints left by the elephant. And if the elephants moving around,

1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:14.080
 you've got a chance that your better chance maybe of seeing the elephant's footprints. If you see

1:01:14.080 --> 1:01:18.160
 the footprints, you go, okay, there's an elephant, I maybe don't know what kind of elephant it is,

1:01:18.160 --> 1:01:22.560
 but I got a sense there's something out there. So that's sort of what we do. We are the footprint

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:29.360
 people. We are, we're looking for the footprints, the impressions that quantum fields that we haven't

1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:34.480
 managed to directly create the particle of the effects these quantum fields have on the ordinary

1:01:34.480 --> 1:01:39.600
 standard model fields that we already know about. So these these B particles, the way they behave

1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:44.640
 can be influenced by the presence of, say, super fields or dark matter fields or whatever you like.

1:01:45.440 --> 1:01:50.160
 And then the way they decay and behave can be altered slightly from what our theory tells us

1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:56.400
 they ought to behave. And it's easier to collect huge amounts of data on B quarks.

1:01:56.400 --> 1:02:00.160
 We get, you know, billions and billions of these things, you can make very precise measurements.

1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:05.120
 And the only place really at the LHC, or in really in high energy physics at the moment,

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:10.560
 where there's fairly compelling evidence that there might be something beyond the standard

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:18.720
 model is in these B, these beauty quarks decays. Just to clarify, which is the difference between

1:02:18.720 --> 1:02:23.040
 the different, the four experiments, for example, that you mentioned, is it the kind of particles

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:28.480
 that are being collided? Is it the energies of which they're collided? What's the fundamental

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:32.800
 difference between the different experiments? The collisions are the same. What's different

1:02:32.800 --> 1:02:37.760
 is the design of the detectors. So Atlas and CMS are called, they're called what are called

1:02:37.760 --> 1:02:43.040
 general purpose detectors. And they are basically barrel shaped machines. And the collisions happen

1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:47.200
 in the middle of the barrel. And the barrel captures all the particles that go flying out

1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:50.720
 in every direction. So in a sphere effectively, they can fly out and it can record all of those

1:02:50.720 --> 1:02:57.360
 particles. And what's the, sorry to be interrupting, but what's, what's the mechanism of the recording?

1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:03.040
 Oh, these detectors, if you've seen pictures of them, they're huge, like Atlas is 25 meters high

1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:09.600
 and 45 meters long. They're vast machines. Instruments, I guess you should call them really.

1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:14.800
 They are, they're kind of like onions. So they have layers, concentric layers of detector,

1:03:14.800 --> 1:03:19.440
 detectors, different sorts of detectors. So close into the beam pipe, you have what are called

1:03:19.440 --> 1:03:23.200
 usually made of silicon, they're tracking detectors. So they're little made of strips of

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:27.280
 silicon or pixels of silicon. And when a particle goes through the silicon, it gives a little

1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:30.880
 electrical signal. And you get these dots, you know, electrical dots through your detector,

1:03:30.880 --> 1:03:34.880
 which allows you to reconstruct the trajectory of the particle. So that's the middle. And then

1:03:34.880 --> 1:03:38.560
 the outsides of these detectors, you have things called calorimeters, which measure the energies

1:03:38.560 --> 1:03:43.680
 of the particles. And on the very edge, you have things called muon chambers, which basically

1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:47.520
 these muon particles, which are the heavy version of the electron, they are, they're like high

1:03:47.520 --> 1:03:51.360
 velocity bullets, and they can get right to the edge of the detectors. If you see something at

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:55.600
 the edge, that's a muon. So that's broadly how they work. And all of that is being recorded.

1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:00.000
 That's all being fed out to, you know, computers that data must be awesome. Okay.

1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:03.920
 So LHCB is different. So we because we're looking for these bequarks,

1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:10.560
 yes, bequarks tend to be produced along the beam line. So in a collision, the bequarks tend to fly

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:15.440
 sort of close to the beam pipe. So we built a detector that sort of pyramid cone shaped,

1:04:15.440 --> 1:04:20.160
 basically, that just looks in one direction. So we ignore, if you have your collision,

1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:23.280
 stuff goes everywhere, we ignore all the stuff over here and going off sideways,

1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:28.400
 we're just looking in this little region close to the beam pipe where most of these bequarks are

1:04:28.400 --> 1:04:36.000
 made. So is there a different aspect of the sensors involved in the collection of the bequark

1:04:36.560 --> 1:04:41.440
 trajectories? There are some differences. So one of the differences is that one of the ways you

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:45.840
 know you've seen a bequark is that bequarks are actually quite long lived by particle standards.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:50.640
 So they live for 1.5 trillionths of a second, which is if you're a fundamental particle is a

1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:56.640
 very long time because you know the Higgs boson I think lives for about a trillionth of a trillionth

1:04:56.640 --> 1:05:01.120
 of a second or maybe even less than that. So these are quite long lived things and they

1:05:01.120 --> 1:05:05.360
 will actually fly a little distance before they decay. So they will fly a few centimeters maybe

1:05:05.360 --> 1:05:09.840
 if you're lucky, then they'll decay into other stuff. So what we need to do in the middle of the

1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:14.480
 detector, you want to be able to see you have your place with the protons crashing to each other

1:05:14.480 --> 1:05:18.480
 and that produces loads of particles that come flying out. So you have loads of lines, loads of

1:05:18.480 --> 1:05:22.960
 tracks that point back to that proton collision. And then you're looking for a couple of other

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:27.040
 tracks, maybe two or three that point back to a different place that's maybe a few centimeters

1:05:27.040 --> 1:05:31.600
 away from the proton collision. And that's the sign that a little B particle has flown a few

1:05:31.600 --> 1:05:36.720
 centimeters and decayed somewhere else. So we need to be able to very accurately resolve the

1:05:36.720 --> 1:05:42.240
 proton collision from the B particle decay. So we are the middle of our detector is very sensitive

1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:47.360
 and it gets very close to the collision. So you have this really beautiful delicate silicon detector

1:05:47.360 --> 1:05:53.520
 that sits, I think it's seven mill millimeters from the beam. And the LHC beam has as much

1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:58.480
 energy as a jumbo jet at takeoff. So it's enough to melt a ton of copper. So you have this furiously

1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:04.960
 powerful thing sitting next to this tiny delicate, you know, silicon sensor. So those aspects of

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:10.160
 our detector that are specialized to just to measure these particular B quarks that we're

1:06:10.160 --> 1:06:14.240
 interested in. And is there, I mean, I remember seeing somewhere that there's some mention of

1:06:14.240 --> 1:06:21.280
 matter and antimatter connected to the B, these beautiful quarks, is that what's the connection?

1:06:23.520 --> 1:06:25.120
 Yeah, what's the connection there?

1:06:25.920 --> 1:06:31.680
 Yeah, so there is a connection, which is that when you produce these B particles,

1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:34.880
 it'll be these particles, because you don't see the B quark, you see the thing that B quark is

1:06:34.880 --> 1:06:39.360
 inside. So they're bound up inside what we call beauty particles, where the B quark is joined

1:06:39.360 --> 1:06:43.520
 together with another quark or two, maybe two other clocks, depending on what it is. There are

1:06:43.520 --> 1:06:50.800
 a particular set of these B particles that exhibit this property called oscillation. So if you make

1:06:50.800 --> 1:06:56.560
 a, for the sake of argument, a matter version of one of these B particles, as it travels,

1:06:56.560 --> 1:07:01.440
 because of the magic of quantum mechanics, it oscillates backwards and forwards between its

1:07:01.440 --> 1:07:06.720
 matter and antimatter versions. So it does this weird flipping about backwards and forwards.

1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:11.600
 And what we can use this for is a laboratory for testing the symmetry between matter and

1:07:11.600 --> 1:07:18.240
 antimatter. So if the symmetry between antimatter is precise, it's exact, then we should see these

1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:22.800
 B particles decaying as often as matter as they do as antimatter, because this oscillation should

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:28.320
 be even, it should spend as much time in each state. But what we actually see is that one of

1:07:28.320 --> 1:07:32.880
 the states, it spends more time in, it's more likely to decay in one state than the other. So

1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:38.160
 this gives us a way of testing this fundamental symmetry between matter and antimatter.

1:07:38.160 --> 1:07:44.800
 So what can you sort of return to the question before about this fundamental symmetry? It seems

1:07:44.800 --> 1:07:52.240
 like if there's perfect symmetry between matter and antimatter, if we have the equal amount

1:07:53.040 --> 1:07:59.120
 of each in our universe, it would just destroy itself. And just like you mentioned, we seem to

1:07:59.120 --> 1:08:05.200
 live in a very unlikely universe where it doesn't destroy itself. So do you have some intuition

1:08:05.200 --> 1:08:11.920
 about why that is? I mean, I'm not a theorist. I don't have any particular ideas myself. I mean,

1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:15.680
 I sort of do measurements to try and test these things. But I mean, so the terms of the basic

1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:19.680
 problem is that in the Big Bang, if you use the standard model to figure out what ought to have

1:08:19.680 --> 1:08:22.800
 happened, you should have got equal amounts of matter and antimatter made because whenever you

1:08:22.800 --> 1:08:27.440
 make a particle in our collisions, for example, when we collide stuff together, you make a particle,

1:08:27.440 --> 1:08:30.800
 you make an antiparticle, they always come together, they always annihilate together.

1:08:30.800 --> 1:08:35.280
 So there's no way of making more matter than antimatter that we've discovered so far. So that

1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:39.280
 means in the Big Bang, you get equal amounts of matter and antimatter. As the universe expands

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:44.080
 and cools down during the Big Bang, not very long after the Big Bang of I think a few seconds

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:48.240
 after the Big Bang, you have this event called the Great Annihilation, which is where all the

1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:53.920
 particles and antiparticles smack into each other, annihilate, turn into light mostly, and you end up

1:08:53.920 --> 1:08:58.000
 with a universe later. If that was what happened, then the universe we live in today would be black

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:03.840
 and empty, apart from some photons, that would be it. So there is stuff in the universe, it appears

1:09:03.840 --> 1:09:08.480
 to be just made of matter, so there's this big mystery as to how did this happen, and there are

1:09:08.480 --> 1:09:16.240
 various ideas which all involve sort of physics going on in the first trillionth of a second or so

1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:22.160
 of the Big Bang. So it could be that one possibility is that the Higgs field is somehow implicated in

1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:27.600
 this, that there was this event that took place in the early universe where the Higgs field

1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:34.160
 basically switched on, it acquired its modern value, and when that happened, this caused all

1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:37.920
 the particles to acquire mass, and the universe basically went through a phase transition where

1:09:37.920 --> 1:09:43.520
 you had a hot plasma of massless particles, and then in that plasma it's almost like a gas turning

1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:48.240
 into droplets of water, you get kind of these little bubbles forming in the universe where the

1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:54.000
 Higgs field has acquired its modern value, the particles have got mass, and this phase transition

1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.880
 in some models can cause more matter than antimatter to be produced, depending on

1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:02.640
 how matter bounces off these bubbles in the early universe. So that's one idea,

1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:06.640
 there's other ideas to do with neutrinos, that there are exotic types of neutrinos that can

1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:12.240
 decay in a biased way to just matter and not to antimatter, and people are trying to test these

1:10:12.240 --> 1:10:15.840
 ideas, that's what we're trying to do at LHCB, there's neutrino experiments planned that are

1:10:15.840 --> 1:10:20.000
 trying to do these sorts of things as well, so yeah, there are ideas, but at the moment no

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:25.440
 clear evidence for which of these ideas might be right. So we're talking about some incredible ideas,

1:10:25.440 --> 1:10:31.760
 by the way, never heard anyone be so eloquent about describing even just the standard model, so

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:40.800
 I'm in awe, just listening, just having fun enjoying it. So yes, the theoretical, the particle

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:45.520
 physics is fascinating here, to me one of the most fascinating things about the Large Hadron

1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:53.600
 Collider is the human side of it, that a bunch of brilliant people that probably have egos got

1:10:53.600 --> 1:10:59.840
 together and collaborate together, and countries I guess collaborate together for the funds,

1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:06.720
 and everything's just collaboration everywhere, because you may be, I don't know what the right

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:11.680
 question here to ask, what's your intuition about how is possible to make this happen,

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:16.400
 and what are the lessons we should learn for the future of human civilization in terms of

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:22.800
 our scientific progress, because it seems like this is a great, great illustration of us working

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:28.880
 together to do something big. Yeah, I think it's possibly the best example, maybe I can think of

1:11:28.880 --> 1:11:35.920
 of international collaboration that isn't for some unpleasant purpose, basically. So when I

1:11:35.920 --> 1:11:41.280
 started out in the fields in 2008, as a new PhD student, the LHC was basically finished,

1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:45.360
 so I didn't have to go around asking for money for it or trying to make the case,

1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:50.080
 so I have huge admiration for the people who managed that, because this was a project that

1:11:50.080 --> 1:11:55.360
 was first imagined in the 1970s, and the late 70s was when the first conversations about the LHC

1:11:55.360 --> 1:12:02.720
 were mooted, and it took two and a half decades of campaigning and fundraising and persuasion,

1:12:03.440 --> 1:12:08.160
 until they started breaking ground and building the thing in the early naughties in 2000. So

1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:14.560
 I mean, I think the reason, just from the point of view of the scientists there, I think the reason

1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:20.800
 it works, ultimately, is that everywhere, everyone there is there for the same reason, which is,

1:12:21.920 --> 1:12:26.000
 well, in principle, at least, they're there because they're interested in the world. They want to find

1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:31.680
 out what are the basic ingredients of our universe, what are the laws of nature, and so everyone is

1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:35.520
 pulling in the same direction. Now, of course, everyone has their own things they're interested

1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:39.680
 in. Everyone has their own careers to consider, and I wouldn't pretend that there isn't also a lot

1:12:39.680 --> 1:12:43.840
 of competition. So this is a funny thing in these experiments where you're collaborators,

1:12:43.840 --> 1:12:48.720
 you're 800 collaborators in LHCB, but you're also competitors because you're academics

1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:51.920
 in your various universities, and you want to be the one that gets the paper out on the most

1:12:51.920 --> 1:12:56.400
 exciting new measurements. So there's this funny thing where you're trying to stake out your

1:12:56.400 --> 1:13:00.800
 territory while also collaborating and having to work together to make the experiments work,

1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:07.440
 and it does work amazingly well, actually, considering all of that. I think McKinsey,

1:13:07.440 --> 1:13:12.240
 one of these big management consultancy firms, went into CERN maybe a decade or so ago to try to

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:16.800
 understand how these organizations function. Did they figure it out? I don't think they could.

1:13:17.760 --> 1:13:22.400
 One of the other interesting things about these experiments is they're big operations,

1:13:22.400 --> 1:13:27.200
 like, say Atlas has 3,000 people. Now, there was a person nominally who is the head of Atlas,

1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:34.080
 they're called the spokesperson. The spokesperson is elected usually by the collaboration,

1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:39.360
 but they have no actual power, really. I mean, they can't fire anyone. They're not anyone's

1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:46.160
 boss. My boss is a professor at Cambridge, not the head of my experiments. The head of my experiment

1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:50.720
 can't tell me what to do, really. There's all these independent academics who are their own

1:13:50.720 --> 1:13:59.360
 bosses, who somehow, nonetheless, by consensus and discussion and lots of meetings, these things

1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:04.480
 do happen and it does get done. It's like the queen here in the UK is the spokesperson.

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:10.400
 Except we don't elect her, no. No, we don't elect her. But everybody seems to love her,

1:14:10.400 --> 1:14:18.880
 I don't know, from my outside perspective. But yeah, giant egos, brilliant people,

1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:24.160
 and moving forward, do you think there's... Actually, I would pick up one thing you

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:27.680
 said just there, just the brilliant people thing, because I'm not saying that people aren't great,

1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:32.400
 but I think there is this sort of impression that physicists all have to be brilliant or

1:14:32.400 --> 1:14:38.480
 geniuses, which is not true, actually. And you have to be relatively bright, for sure. But a lot

1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.560
 of people, a lot of the most successful experimental physicists are not necessarily the

1:14:42.560 --> 1:14:46.560
 people with the biggest brains. They're the people who, particularly one of the skills

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:50.480
 that's most important in particle physics is the ability to work with others and to collaborate

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:54.800
 and exchange ideas and also to work hard. And it's a sort of, often it's more a determination

1:14:55.760 --> 1:14:59.840
 or a sort of other set of skills. It's not just being kind of some great brain.

1:15:01.360 --> 1:15:06.160
 Very true. So, I mean, there's parallels to that in the machine learning world. If you want to

1:15:06.160 --> 1:15:11.600
 solve any real world problems, which I see as the particle accelerators, essentially

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:19.680
 a real world instantiation of theoretical physics. And for that, you have to not necessarily be

1:15:19.680 --> 1:15:28.800
 brilliant, but be sort of obsessed, systematic, rigorous, sort of unboreable, stubborn, all

1:15:28.800 --> 1:15:34.160
 those kind of qualities that make for a great engineer. So, scientists purely speaking,

1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:38.800
 that practitioner of the scientific method. So, you're right. But nevertheless, to me that's

1:15:38.800 --> 1:15:45.120
 brilliant. My dad's a physicist. I argue with him all the time. To me, engineering is the highest

1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:49.760
 form of science. And he thinks that's all nonsense, that the real work is done by the

1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:55.920
 theoretician. So, in fact, we have arguments about like people like Elon Musk, for example,

1:15:55.920 --> 1:16:00.880
 because I think his work is quite brilliant. But he's fundamentally not coming up with any

1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:08.480
 serious breakthroughs. He's just creating in this world, implementing, like making ideas happen

1:16:08.480 --> 1:16:19.440
 to have a huge impact. To me, that's the Edison that to me is a brilliant work. But to him, it's

1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:24.160
 messy details that somebody will figure out anyway.

1:16:25.360 --> 1:16:29.520
 I mean, I don't know whether you think there is an actual difference in temperament between,

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:33.360
 say, a physicist and an engineer, whether it's just what you got interested in. I don't know.

1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:40.080
 I mean, a lot of what experimental physicists do is, to some extent, engineering. I mean,

1:16:40.080 --> 1:16:44.960
 it's not what I do. I mostly do data stuff. But a lot of people would be called electrical

1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:48.800
 engineers, but they trained as physicists, but they learned electrical engineering, for example,

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:52.800
 because they were building detectors. So, there's not such a clear divide, I think.

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:58.080
 Yeah, that's interesting. I mean, there does seem to be like you work with data. There does seem to

1:16:58.080 --> 1:17:04.240
 be a certain, like, I love data collection. There might be an OCD element or something that

1:17:04.240 --> 1:17:09.200
 you're more naturally predisposed to, as opposed to theory. Like, I'm not afraid of data. I love

1:17:09.200 --> 1:17:15.280
 data. And there's a lot of people in machine learning who are more like, they're basically

1:17:15.280 --> 1:17:19.760
 afraid of data collection, afraid of data sets, afraid of all that. They just want to stay in

1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:23.920
 more than theoretical and they're really good at it space. So, I don't know if that's the genetic

1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:30.160
 that you're upbringing the way you go to school, but looking into the future of LHC

1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:37.360
 and other colliders. So, there's in America, there's whatever it was called, the super,

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:40.720
 there's a lot of super. Superconducting supercollider. Yeah, superconducting.

1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:45.600
 The desertron. Yeah. Desertron. Yeah. So, that was canceled, the construction of that,

1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:54.720
 which is a sad thing. But what do you think is the future of these efforts? Will a bigger

1:17:54.720 --> 1:18:00.880
 collider be built? Will LHC be expanded? What do you think? Well, in the near future,

1:18:01.840 --> 1:18:05.520
 the LHC is going to get an upgrade. So, that's pretty much confirmed. I think it is confirmed,

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:10.960
 which is not an energy upgrade. It's what we call a luminosity upgrade. So, it basically means

1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:16.080
 increasing the data collection rate. So, more collisions per second, basically. Because

1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:19.760
 after a few years of data taking, you get this law of diminishing returns where each

1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:23.440
 year's worth of data is a smaller and smaller fraction of the lot you've already got. So,

1:18:23.440 --> 1:18:27.600
 to get a real improvement in sensitivity, you need to increase the data rate by an order of

1:18:27.600 --> 1:18:32.560
 magnitude. So, that's what this upgrade is going to do. LHCB at the moment, the whole detector

1:18:32.560 --> 1:18:37.840
 is basically being rebuilt to allow it to record data at a much larger rate than we could before.

1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:41.680
 So, that will make us sensitive to whole loads of new processes that we weren't able to study

1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:47.040
 before. And I mentioned briefly these anomalies that we've seen. So, we've seen a bunch of very

1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:55.680
 intriguing anomalies in these B quark decays, which may be hinting at the first signs of this

1:18:55.680 --> 1:19:01.120
 kind of the elephant, the signs of some new quantum field or fields maybe beyond the standard model.

1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:06.080
 It's not yet at the statistical threshold where you can say that you've observed something.

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:10.880
 But there's lots of anomalies in many measurements that all seem to be consistent with each other.

1:19:10.880 --> 1:19:16.080
 So, it's quite interesting. So, the upgrade will allow us to really home in on these things and see

1:19:16.080 --> 1:19:20.800
 whether these anomalies are real. Because if they are real, and this connects to your point

1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:27.360
 about the next generation of machines, what we will have seen then is we will have seen the tail

1:19:27.360 --> 1:19:33.360
 end of some quantum field in influencing these B quarks. What we then need to do is to build a

1:19:33.360 --> 1:19:40.080
 bigger collider to actually make the particle of that field. So, if these things really do exist.

1:19:40.080 --> 1:19:44.080
 So, that would be one argument. So, at the moment, Europe is going through this process of

1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:49.120
 thinking about the strategy for the future. So, there are a number of different proposals on

1:19:49.120 --> 1:19:54.800
 the table. One is for a higher energy upgrade of the LHC, where you just build more powerful

1:19:54.800 --> 1:20:00.000
 magnets and put them in the same tunnel. That's a cheaper, less ambitious possibility. Most people

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:03.440
 don't really like it because it's sort of a bit of a dead end. Because once you've done that, there's

1:20:03.440 --> 1:20:09.360
 nowhere to go. There's a machine called CLIC, which is a compact linear collider, which is a

1:20:09.360 --> 1:20:14.160
 electron positron collider that uses a novel type of acceleration technology to accelerate at

1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:18.880
 shorter distances. We're still talking kilometers long, but not like 100 kilometers long.

1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:24.240
 And then probably the project that is, I think, getting the most support, it'll be interesting

1:20:24.240 --> 1:20:29.440
 to see what happens. Something called the future circular collider, which is a really ambitious

1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:36.880
 long term multi decade project to build a 100 kilometer circumference tunnel under the Geneva

1:20:36.880 --> 1:20:42.320
 region. The LHC would become a kind of feeding machine. It would just feed. So, the same area.

1:20:42.320 --> 1:20:47.520
 So, it would be a feeder for the... Yeah. So, the edge of this machine would be where the LHC is,

1:20:47.520 --> 1:20:52.480
 but it would go under Lake Geneva and round to the Alps, basically, up to the edge of the Geneva

1:20:52.480 --> 1:20:57.040
 basin. So, it's basically the biggest tunnel you can fit in the region based on the geology.

1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:00.640
 Kilometers. Yeah. So, it's big. It'd be a long drive if you're... You know,

1:21:00.640 --> 1:21:03.760
 you experiment on one side. You've got to go back to CERN for lunch. So, that will be a pain.

1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:09.840
 So, this project is... In principle, it's actually two accelerators. The first thing you would do

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:14.640
 is put an electron positron machine in the 100 kilometer tunnel to study the Higgs. You'd make

1:21:14.640 --> 1:21:18.800
 lots of Higgs bosons, study it really precisely in the hope that you see it misbehaving and doing

1:21:18.800 --> 1:21:24.080
 something it's not supposed to. And then, in the much longer term, a hundred... That machine

1:21:24.080 --> 1:21:28.960
 gets taken out. You put in a proton, proton machine. So, it's like the LHC, but much bigger.

1:21:28.960 --> 1:21:33.840
 And that's the way you start going and looking for dark matter, or you're trying to recreate this

1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:38.080
 phase transition that I talked about in the early universe, but you can see

1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:40.640
 matter, antimatter being made, for example. There's lots of things you can do with these

1:21:40.640 --> 1:21:46.240
 machines. The problem is that they will take... The most optimistic, you're not going to have any

1:21:46.240 --> 1:21:51.680
 data from any of these machines until 2040, because they take such a long time to build,

1:21:51.680 --> 1:21:56.720
 and they're so expensive. So, there'll be a process of R&D design, and also the political

1:21:56.720 --> 1:22:04.000
 case being made. So, LHC, what costs a few billion? It depends how you count it. I think most of the

1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:07.440
 sort of more reasonable estimates that take everything into account properly, it's around the

1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:13.040
 sort of 10, 11, 12 billion euro mark. What would be the future... Sorry, I forgot the name already.

1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:15.360
 Future circular collider. Future circular collider.

1:22:15.360 --> 1:22:18.160
 Presumably they won't call it that when it's built, because it won't be the future anymore.

1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:25.200
 But I don't know what they'll call it then. Very big hadron collider, I don't know. But

1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:30.320
 that will... Now, I should know the numbers, but I think the whole project

1:22:30.320 --> 1:22:37.200
 is estimated at about 30 billion euros, but that's money spent over between now and 2070,

1:22:37.200 --> 1:22:41.680
 probably, which is when the last bit of it would be sort of finishing up, I guess.

1:22:41.680 --> 1:22:48.000
 So, you're talking a half a century of science coming out of this thing, shared by many countries.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:52.560
 So, the actual cost, the arguments that are made is that you could make this project fit within

1:22:52.560 --> 1:22:56.560
 the existing budget of CERN, if you didn't do anything else.

1:22:56.560 --> 1:22:59.440
 And CERN, by the way, we didn't mention. What is CERN?

1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:03.360
 CERN is the European Organization for Nuclear Research. It's an international

1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:08.880
 organization that was established in the 1950s in the wake of the Second World War as a kind of...

1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:14.080
 It was sort of like a scientific marshal plan for Europe. The idea was that you bring European

1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:20.160
 science back together for peaceful purposes, because what happened in the 40s was a lot of...

1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:23.440
 Particularly a lot of Jewish scientists, but a lot of scientists from Central Europe had fled to the

1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:28.400
 United States, and Europe had sort of seen this brain drain. So, it was a desire to bring the

1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:32.720
 community back together for a project that wasn't building nasty bombs, but was doing

1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:36.400
 something that was curiosity driven. And that has continued since then.

1:23:36.400 --> 1:23:42.640
 So, it's kind of a unique organization. To be a member as a country, you sort of sign up as a

1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:47.360
 member, and then you have to pay a fraction of your GDP each year as a subscription. I mean,

1:23:47.360 --> 1:23:51.440
 it's a very small fraction, relatively speaking. I think it's like... I think the UK's contribution

1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:56.320
 is 100 or 200 million quid, or something like that. Yeah, which is quite a lot, but not...

1:23:57.360 --> 1:24:02.160
 That's fascinating. I mean, just the whole thing that it is possible. It's a beautiful idea,

1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:07.200
 especially when there's no wars on the line. It's not like we're freaking out. It's actually

1:24:07.200 --> 1:24:11.760
 legitimately collaborating to do good science. One of the things I don't think we really mentioned

1:24:11.760 --> 1:24:16.720
 is on the final side, that sort of the data analysis side, is there breakthroughs possible

1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:22.960
 there in the machine learning side? Like, is there a lot more signal to be mined in more

1:24:22.960 --> 1:24:27.760
 effective ways from the actual raw data? Yeah, a lot of people are looking into that. I mean,

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:34.400
 so I use machine learning in my data analysis, but pretty noddy, basic stuff, because I'm not a

1:24:34.400 --> 1:24:38.560
 machine learning expert. I'm just a physicist who had to learn to do this stuff for my day job.

1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:45.040
 So what a lot of people do is they use off the shelf packages that you can train to do signal

1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:51.360
 noise. Just clean up all the data. But one of the big challenges is the big challenge of the data

1:24:51.360 --> 1:24:56.880
 is, A, it's volume. There's huge amounts of data. So the LHC generates... No, okay. I try to remember

1:24:56.880 --> 1:25:00.800
 what the actual numbers are. But if we don't record all our data, we record a tiny fraction

1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:06.240
 of the data. It's like of order one 10,000th or something, I think. Is that right? Around that.

1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:10.400
 So most of it gets thrown away. You couldn't record all the LHC data because it would fill up

1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:15.920
 every computer in the world in a matter of days, basically. So there's this process that happens

1:25:15.920 --> 1:25:20.720
 on live, on the detector, something called a trigger, which in real time, 40 million times

1:25:20.720 --> 1:25:24.960
 every second has to make a decision about whether this collision is likely to contain

1:25:24.960 --> 1:25:29.680
 an interesting object like a Higgs boson or a dark matter particle. And it has to do that very fast.

1:25:29.680 --> 1:25:36.800
 And the software algorithms in the past were quite relatively basic. They did things like

1:25:36.800 --> 1:25:41.040
 measure mementos and energies of particles and put some requirements. So you would say,

1:25:41.040 --> 1:25:44.960
 if there's a particle with an energy above some threshold, then record this collision. But if

1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:49.600
 there isn't, don't. Whereas now the attempt is to get more and more machine learning in at the

1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:54.160
 earliest possible stage because... That's cool. At the stage of deciding whether we want to keep this

1:25:54.160 --> 1:26:01.520
 data or not. But also even maybe even lower down than that, which is the point where... So generally

1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:07.440
 how the data is reconstructed is you start off with a set of digital hits in your detector. So

1:26:07.440 --> 1:26:11.600
 channels saying, did you see something? Did you not see something? That has to be then turned into

1:26:11.600 --> 1:26:16.000
 tracks, particles going in different directions. And that's done by using fits that fit through

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:19.840
 the data points. And then that's passed to the algorithms that then go, is this interesting

1:26:19.840 --> 1:26:24.000
 or not? What would be better is that you could train machine learning to just look at the raw hits

1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:27.680
 the basic, real base level information, not have any of the reconstruction

1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:32.560
 done. And it just goes and it can learn to do pattern recognition on this strange three dimensional

1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:37.440
 image that you get. And potentially that's where you could get really big gains because our triggers

1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:43.440
 tend to be quite inefficient because they don't have time to do the full whiz bang processing to

1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:46.640
 get all the information out that we would like because you have to do the decision very quickly.

1:26:46.640 --> 1:26:50.960
 So if you can come up with some clever machine learning technique, then potentially you can

1:26:50.960 --> 1:26:58.320
 massively increase the amount of useful data you record and get rid of more of the background

1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:02.000
 earlier in the process. Yeah, to me, that's an exciting possibility because then you don't have

1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:09.760
 to build a sort of, you can get a gain without having to... Without having to build any hardware,

1:27:09.760 --> 1:27:14.800
 I suppose. Hardware, yeah. Although you need lots of new GPU farms, I guess. So hardware still

1:27:14.800 --> 1:27:26.320
 helps. But I got to talk to you. I'm not sure how to ask, but you're clearly an incredible

1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:31.680
 science communicator. I don't know if that's the right term, but you're basically a younger Neil

1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:39.120
 deGrasse Tyson with a British accent. Can you say where we are today, actually?

1:27:39.120 --> 1:27:45.840
 Yeah. So today we're in the Royal Institution in London, which is a very old organization that's

1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:49.520
 been around for about 200 years now, I think. Maybe even I should know when it was founded,

1:27:49.520 --> 1:27:55.920
 but sort of early 19th century, it was set up to basically communicate science to the public. So

1:27:55.920 --> 1:28:01.440
 it was one of the first places in the world where famous scientists would come and give talks. So

1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:07.440
 very famously, Humphrey Davy, who you may know of, who was the person who discovered nitrous oxide,

1:28:07.440 --> 1:28:13.360
 he was a very famous chemist and scientist, also discovered electrolysis. So he used to do these

1:28:13.360 --> 1:28:16.720
 fantastic, he was a very charismatic speaker. So he used to appear here, there's a big desk

1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:22.000
 that they usually have in the theater, and he would do demonstrations to the folk of London

1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:26.000
 back in the early 19th century. And Michael Faraday, who I talked about, who was the person who did

1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:30.000
 so much work on electromagnetism, he lectured here. He also did experiments in the basement. So this

1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:35.360
 place has got a long history of both scientific research, but also communication of scientific

1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:41.040
 research. So you gave a few lectures here. How many, two? I've given a couple of lectures in

1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:47.840
 this theater before. So people should definitely go watch online. It's just the explanation of

1:28:47.840 --> 1:28:54.400
 particle physics. It's incredible. Your lectures are just incredible. I can't sing in enough praise.

1:28:54.400 --> 1:29:02.000
 So it was awesome. But maybe can you say, what does it feel like to lecture here,

1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:08.240
 to talk about that? And maybe from a different perspective, more kind of like how the sausage

1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:13.680
 is made is, how do you prepare for that kind of thing? How do you think about communication,

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:19.680
 the process of communicating these ideas in a way that's inspiring to what I would say,

1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:23.680
 your talks are inspiring to like the general audience. You don't actually have to be

1:29:24.240 --> 1:29:28.880
 a scientist. You can still be inspired without really knowing much of the... You start from

1:29:28.880 --> 1:29:34.720
 the very basics. So what's the preparation process? And then the romantic question is,

1:29:34.720 --> 1:29:40.720
 what do that feel like to perform here? I mean, the profession. Yeah. I mean, the process,

1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:44.400
 I mean, the talk, my favorite talk that I gave here was one called Beyond the Higgs,

1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:47.920
 which you can find on the Royal Institute's YouTube channel, which you should go and check out.

1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:50.960
 Yeah. I mean, and their channel's got loads of great talks with loads of great people as well.

1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:56.720
 I mean, that one, I sort of given a version of it many times. So part of it is just practice,

1:29:56.720 --> 1:30:00.480
 right? And actually, I don't have some great theory of how to communicate with people. It's

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:05.200
 more just that I'm really interested and excited by those ideas and I like talking about them.

1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:09.920
 And through the process of doing that, I guess I figured out stories that work and

1:30:09.920 --> 1:30:13.440
 explanations that work. When you say practice, you mean legitimately just giving...

1:30:13.440 --> 1:30:17.840
 Just giving talks. Yeah. And I started off, you know, when I was a PhD student doing talks in

1:30:17.840 --> 1:30:22.320
 schools and I still do that as well some of the time and doing things like I've even done a bit

1:30:22.320 --> 1:30:26.160
 of standup comedy, which was sort of went reasonably well, even if it was terrifying.

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:29.200
 And that's on YouTube as well. That's also on YouTube. I wouldn't necessarily recommend you

1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:35.280
 check that out. I'm going to post the links several places to make sure people click on it.

1:30:35.280 --> 1:30:41.120
 But it's basically, I kind of have a story in my head and I kind of, I have to think about what

1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:44.320
 I want to say. I usually have some images to support what I'm saying and I get up and do it.

1:30:44.320 --> 1:30:48.160
 And it's not really... I wish there was some kind of... I probably should have some proper

1:30:48.160 --> 1:30:51.200
 process. This is very sounds like I'm just making up as I go along and I sort of am.

1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:58.400
 Well, I think the fundamental thing that you said, I think it's like, I don't know if you know who

1:30:59.600 --> 1:31:05.120
 a guy named Joe Rogan is. Yes, I do. So he's also kind of sounds like you in a sense that

1:31:05.680 --> 1:31:11.760
 he's not very introspective about his process, but he's an incredibly engaging conversation

1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:18.000
 list. And I think one of the things that you and him share that I could see is like a genuine

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:26.720
 curiosity and passion for the topic. I think that could be systematically cultivated.

1:31:26.720 --> 1:31:30.320
 I'm sure there's a process to it, but you come to it naturally somehow.

1:31:30.320 --> 1:31:34.080
 I think maybe there's something else as well, which is to understand something.

1:31:34.080 --> 1:31:37.600
 There's this quote by Feynman, which I really like, which is what I cannot create. I do not

1:31:37.600 --> 1:31:44.640
 understand. So I'm not particularly super bright. So for me to understand something,

1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:49.680
 I have to break it down into its simplest element. And if I can then tell people about that,

1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:55.760
 that helps me understand it as well. So I've learned to understand physics a lot more from

1:31:55.760 --> 1:32:00.800
 the process of communicating because it forces you to really scrutinize the ideas that you're

1:32:00.800 --> 1:32:05.680
 communicating. It often makes you realize you don't really understand the ideas you're talking

1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:09.840
 about. And I'm writing a book at the moment. I had this experience yesterday where I realized

1:32:09.840 --> 1:32:14.560
 I didn't really understand a pretty fundamental theoretical aspect of my own subject. And I had

1:32:14.560 --> 1:32:18.720
 to go and I had to sort of spend a couple of days reading textbooks and thinking about it

1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:24.960
 in order to make sure that the explanation I gave got as close to what is actually happening in the

1:32:24.960 --> 1:32:29.840
 theory. And to do that, you have to really understand it properly. And there's layers

1:32:29.840 --> 1:32:38.080
 to understanding. It seems like there must be some kind of Feynman law. The more you

1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:46.000
 understand sort of the simpler you're able to really convey the essence of the idea, right?

1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:53.920
 So it's like this reverse effect that it's like, the more you understand the simpler,

1:32:53.920 --> 1:32:58.640
 the final thing that you actually convey. And so the more accessible somehow it becomes.

1:32:58.640 --> 1:33:04.800
 That's why Feynman's lectures are really accessible. It was just counterintuitive.

1:33:04.800 --> 1:33:10.720
 Yeah. Although there are some ideas that are very difficult to explain no matter how well

1:33:10.720 --> 1:33:16.160
 or badly you understand them. Like I still can't really properly explain the Higgs mechanism.

1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:22.960
 Because some of these ideas only exist in mathematics really. And the only way to really

1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:29.680
 develop an understanding is to go unfortunately into a graduate degree in physics. But you can get

1:33:29.680 --> 1:33:33.760
 kind of a flavor of what's happening, I think. And it's trying to do that in a way that isn't

1:33:33.760 --> 1:33:39.040
 misleading, but also intelligible. So let me ask them the romantic question of

1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:47.120
 what to you is the most perhaps an unfair question. What is the most beautiful idea in physics?

1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:54.560
 One that fills you with awe is the most surprising, the strangest, the weirdest.

1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:59.520
 There's a lot of different definitions of beauty. And I'm sure there's several for you. But is

1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:06.400
 there something that just jumps to mind that you think is just especially beautiful?

1:34:06.960 --> 1:34:09.920
 There's a specific thing in a more general thing. So maybe the specific thing first,

1:34:09.920 --> 1:34:15.840
 which is I came across as an undergraduate. I found this amazing. So this idea that the forces

1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:22.160
 of nature, electromagnetic and strong force, the weak force, they arise in our theories

1:34:22.160 --> 1:34:28.880
 as a consequence of symmetries. So symmetries in the laws of nature, in the equations essentially

1:34:28.880 --> 1:34:34.960
 that use to describe these ideas, the process whereby theories come up with these sorts of

1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:41.040
 models is they say, imagine the universe obeys particular type of symmetry is a symmetry that

1:34:41.040 --> 1:34:45.360
 isn't so far removed from a geometrical symmetry like the rotations of a cube. It's not you can't

1:34:45.360 --> 1:34:49.680
 think of it quite that way, but it's sort of a similar sort of idea. And you say, okay, if the

1:34:49.680 --> 1:34:55.840
 universe respects the symmetry, you find that you have to introduce a force, which has the properties

1:34:55.840 --> 1:35:00.640
 of electromagnetism or different symmetry, you get the strong force or different symmetry,

1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:05.760
 you get the weak force. So these interactions seem to come from some deeper, it suggests that

1:35:05.760 --> 1:35:09.680
 they come from some deeper symmetry principle. I mean, depends a bit how you look at it, because

1:35:09.680 --> 1:35:13.360
 it could be that we're actually just recognizing symmetries in the sea. But there's something

1:35:13.360 --> 1:35:17.520
 rather lovely about that. But I mean, I suppose a bigger thing that makes me wonder is actually,

1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:22.480
 if you look at the laws of nature, they look how particles interact when you get really close down

1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:26.400
 that they basically pretty simple things, they bounce off each other by exchanging through

1:35:26.400 --> 1:35:31.760
 force fields, and they move around in very simple ways. And somehow, these basic ingredients,

1:35:31.760 --> 1:35:36.560
 these few particles that we know about on the forces creates this universe, which is unbelievably

1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:42.880
 complicated and has things like you and me in it, and the earth and stars that make matter in their

1:35:42.880 --> 1:35:47.440
 cause by the gravitational energy of their own bulk that then gets sprayed into the universe

1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:53.440
 that forms other things. I mean, the fact that there's this incredibly long story that goes right

1:35:53.440 --> 1:35:58.800
 back to the beginning, we can take this story right back to a trillionth of a second after

1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:03.200
 the Big Bang, and we can trace the origins of the stuff that we're made from. And it all ultimately

1:36:03.200 --> 1:36:07.440
 comes from these simple ingredients with these simple rules. And the fact you can generate

1:36:07.440 --> 1:36:12.240
 such complexity from that is really mysterious, I think, and strange. And it's not even a question

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:17.680
 that physicists can really tackle because we are sort of trying to find these really elementary

1:36:17.680 --> 1:36:23.280
 laws. But it turns out that going from elementary laws in a few particles to something even as

1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:28.720
 complicated as a molecule becomes very difficult. So going from a molecule to a human being is a

1:36:28.720 --> 1:36:35.760
 problem that just can't be tackled, at least not at the moment. Yeah, the emergence of complexity

1:36:35.760 --> 1:36:43.440
 from simple rules is so beautiful and so mysterious. And we don't have good mathematics

1:36:43.440 --> 1:36:48.800
 to even try to approach that emergent phenomena. That's why we have chemistry and biology and

1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:55.760
 one of the other subjects is we have, guys. I don't think there's a better way to end it, Harry.

1:36:55.760 --> 1:37:02.640
 I mean, I think I speak for a lot of people that can't wait to see what happens in the next five,

1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:07.200
 10, 20 years with you. I think you're one of the great communicators of our time. So I hope you

1:37:07.200 --> 1:37:13.120
 continue that. And I hope that grows. And I'm definitely a huge fan. So it was an honor to

1:37:13.120 --> 1:37:18.960

 And now let me leave you with some words from Harry Cliff. You and I are leftovers. Every

1:37:52.240 --> 1:37:57.760
 particle in our bodies is a survivor from an almighty shootout between matter and antimatter

1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:03.440
 that happened a little after the Big Bang. In fact, only one in a billion particles created

1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:09.200
 at the beginning of time have survived to the present day. Thank you for listening and hope to

1:38:09.200 --> 1:38:23.680
 see you next time.
