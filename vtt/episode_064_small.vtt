00:00.000 --> 00:03.120
 The following is a conversation with Grant Sanderson.

00:03.120 --> 00:06.640
 He's a math educator and creator of Three Blue One Brown,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.000
 a popular YouTube channel

00:08.000 --> 00:11.000
 that uses programmatically animated visualizations

00:11.000 --> 00:14.280
 to explain concepts in linear algebra, calculus,

00:14.280 --> 00:17.000
 and other fields of mathematics.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.840
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:19.840 --> 00:22.080
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:22.080 --> 00:23.960
 give us five stars in Apple Podcasts,

00:23.960 --> 00:26.360
 follow us on Spotify, support on Patreon,

00:26.360 --> 00:28.360
 or simply connect with me on Twitter.

00:28.360 --> 00:32.200
 I'm Alex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

00:32.200 --> 00:34.000
 I recently started doing ads

00:34.000 --> 00:35.720
 at the end of the introduction.

00:35.720 --> 00:38.480
 I'll do one or two minutes after introducing the episode

00:38.480 --> 00:40.000
 and never any ads in the middle

00:40.000 --> 00:42.160
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

00:42.160 --> 00:43.600
 I hope that works for you

00:43.600 --> 00:46.240
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.640
 This show is presented by Cash App,

00:49.640 --> 00:52.040
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

00:52.040 --> 00:54.840
 I personally use Cash App to send money to friends,

00:54.840 --> 00:56.520
 but you can also use it to buy, sell,

00:56.520 --> 00:58.920
 and deposit Bitcoin in just seconds.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.480
 Cash App also has an investing feature.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.120
 You can buy fractions of a stock,

01:03.120 --> 01:06.760
 say $1 worth, no matter what the stock price is.

01:06.760 --> 01:09.560
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

01:09.560 --> 01:13.440
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.440
 I'm excited to be working with Cash App

01:15.440 --> 01:18.560
 to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,

01:18.560 --> 01:22.000
 best known for their FIRST robotics and Lego competitions.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.320
 They educate and inspire hundreds of thousands of students

01:25.320 --> 01:27.120
 in over 110 countries

01:27.120 --> 01:29.680
 and have a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

01:29.680 --> 01:31.640
 which means the donated money is used

01:31.640 --> 01:34.000
 to maximum effectiveness.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.920
 When you get Cash App from the App Store at Google Play

01:36.920 --> 01:40.160
 and use code LEX Podcast, you'll get $10

01:40.160 --> 01:42.840
 and Cash App will also donate $10 to FIRST,

01:42.840 --> 01:44.920
 which again is an organization

01:44.920 --> 01:47.640
 that I've personally seen inspire girls and boys

01:47.640 --> 01:51.400
 to dream of engineering a better world.

01:51.400 --> 01:55.240
 And now here's my conversation with Grant Sanderson.

01:56.240 --> 01:59.120
 If there's intelligent life out there in the universe,

01:59.120 --> 02:02.280
 do you think their mathematics is different than ours?

02:03.280 --> 02:04.320
 Jumping right in.

02:04.320 --> 02:08.320
 I think it's probably very different.

02:08.320 --> 02:09.200
 There's an obvious sense.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.240
 The notation is different, right?

02:11.240 --> 02:13.880
 I think notation can guide what the math itself is.

02:14.880 --> 02:16.080
 I think it has everything to do

02:16.080 --> 02:19.200
 with the form of their existence, right?

02:19.200 --> 02:20.760
 Do you think they have basic arithmetic?

02:20.760 --> 02:21.600
 So interrupt.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.200
 Yeah, so I think they count, right?

02:23.200 --> 02:24.560
 I think notions like one, two, three,

02:24.560 --> 02:27.160
 the natural numbers, that's extremely, well, natural.

02:27.160 --> 02:30.400
 That's almost why we put that name to it.

02:30.400 --> 02:31.720
 As soon as you can count,

02:31.720 --> 02:34.000
 you have a notion of repetition, right?

02:34.000 --> 02:37.280
 Cause you can count by two, two times or three times.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.760
 And so you have this notion of repeating

02:39.760 --> 02:42.120
 the idea of counting, which brings you addition

02:42.120 --> 02:43.760
 and multiplication.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.480
 I think the way that we extend to the real numbers,

02:47.480 --> 02:49.240
 there's a little bit of choice in that.

02:49.240 --> 02:50.760
 So there's this funny number system

02:50.760 --> 02:52.160
 called the surreal numbers,

02:52.160 --> 02:55.640
 that it captures the idea of continuity.

02:55.640 --> 02:57.560
 It's a distinct mathematical object.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.240
 You could very well, you know,

02:59.240 --> 03:01.520
 model the universe and motion of planets

03:01.520 --> 03:04.800
 with that as the backend of your math, right?

03:04.800 --> 03:06.480
 And you still have kind of the same interface

03:06.480 --> 03:10.560
 with the front end of what physical laws you're trying to,

03:10.560 --> 03:12.840
 or what physical phenomena you're trying to describe

03:12.840 --> 03:13.760
 with math.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.840
 And I wonder if the little glimpses that we have

03:15.840 --> 03:17.680
 of what choices you can make along the way

03:17.680 --> 03:19.320
 based on what different mathematicians

03:19.320 --> 03:20.440
 have brought to the table

03:20.440 --> 03:21.880
 is just scratching the surface,

03:21.880 --> 03:24.560
 surface of what the different possibilities are

03:24.560 --> 03:27.560
 if you have a completely different mode of thought, right?

03:27.560 --> 03:29.680
 Or a mode of interacting with the universe.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.520
 And you think notation is the key part of the journey

03:32.520 --> 03:33.880
 that we've taken through math?

03:33.880 --> 03:35.120
 I think that's the most salient part

03:35.120 --> 03:36.400
 that you'd notice at first.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.880
 I think the mode of thought is gonna influence things

03:38.880 --> 03:40.400
 more than like the notation itself.

03:40.400 --> 03:42.720
 But notation actually carries a lot of weight

03:42.720 --> 03:44.600
 when it comes to how we think about things

03:44.600 --> 03:47.120
 more so than we usually give a credit for.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.920
 I would be comfortable saying.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.040
 Do you have a favorite or least favorite piece of notation

03:52.040 --> 03:53.280
 in terms of its effectiveness?

03:53.280 --> 03:54.840
 Yeah, yeah, well, so least favorite,

03:54.840 --> 03:56.160
 one that I've been thinking a lot about

03:56.160 --> 03:58.200
 that will be a video I don't know when,

03:58.200 --> 04:00.840
 but we'll see the number E.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.400
 We write the function E to the X,

04:02.400 --> 04:04.120
 this general exponential function

04:04.120 --> 04:06.880
 with a notation E to the X that implies

04:06.880 --> 04:08.400
 you should think about a particular number,

04:08.400 --> 04:09.400
 this constant of nature,

04:09.400 --> 04:11.720
 and you repeatedly multiply it by itself.

04:11.720 --> 04:14.080
 And then you say, oh, what's E to the square root of two?

04:14.080 --> 04:15.680
 And you're like, oh, well, we've extended the idea

04:15.680 --> 04:17.040
 of repeated multiplication.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.000
 That's all nice.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.480
 That's all nice and well.

04:19.480 --> 04:22.640
 But very famously, you have like E to the pi I,

04:22.640 --> 04:24.400
 and you're like, well, we're extending the idea

04:24.400 --> 04:27.080
 of repeated multiplication into the complex numbers.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.760
 Yeah, you can think about it that way.

04:28.760 --> 04:31.840
 In reality, I think that it's just the wrong way

04:31.840 --> 04:34.720
 of notationally representing this function,

04:34.720 --> 04:36.200
 the exponential function,

04:36.200 --> 04:38.120
 which itself could be represented a number

04:38.120 --> 04:38.960
 of different ways.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.280
 You can think about it in terms of the problem it solves,

04:41.280 --> 04:43.240
 a certain very simple differential equation,

04:43.240 --> 04:45.600
 which often yields way more insight

04:45.600 --> 04:48.800
 than trying to twist to the idea of repeated multiplication,

04:48.800 --> 04:50.760
 like take its arm and put it behind its back

04:50.760 --> 04:51.600
 and throw it on the desk

04:51.600 --> 04:53.640
 and be like, you will apply to complex numbers, right?

04:53.640 --> 04:57.400
 That's not, I don't think that's pedagogically helpful.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.800
 So the repeated multiplication

04:58.800 --> 05:00.480
 is actually missing the main point,

05:00.480 --> 05:03.000
 the power of E to the X.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.920
 I mean, what it addresses is things where the rate

05:05.920 --> 05:10.160
 at which something changes depends on its own value,

05:10.160 --> 05:12.480
 but more specifically, it depends on it linearly.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.080
 So for example, if you have like a population

05:15.080 --> 05:16.680
 that's growing and the rate at which it grows

05:16.680 --> 05:18.440
 depends on how many members of the population

05:18.440 --> 05:19.280
 are already there.

05:19.280 --> 05:21.280
 It looks like this nice exponential curve.

05:21.280 --> 05:23.280
 It makes sense to talk about repeated multiplication,

05:23.280 --> 05:25.160
 because you say, how much is there after one year,

05:25.160 --> 05:27.400
 two years, three years, you're multiplying by something.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.480
 The relationship can be a little bit different sometimes

05:29.480 --> 05:33.960
 where let's say you've got a ball on a string,

05:33.960 --> 05:37.520
 like a game of tether ball going around a rope, right?

05:37.520 --> 05:40.760
 And you say, its velocity is always perpendicular

05:40.760 --> 05:42.200
 to its position.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.120
 That's another way of describing its rate of change

05:44.120 --> 05:47.120
 is being related to where it is,

05:47.120 --> 05:48.200
 but it's a different operation.

05:48.200 --> 05:49.040
 You're not scaling it.

05:49.040 --> 05:49.880
 It's a rotation.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.400
 It's this 90 degree rotation.

05:51.400 --> 05:53.920
 That's what the whole idea of like complex

05:53.920 --> 05:55.760
 explanation is trying to capture,

05:55.760 --> 05:57.680
 but it's obfuscated in the notation.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.080
 When what it's actually saying,

05:59.080 --> 06:01.440
 like if you really parse something like E to the Pi I,

06:01.440 --> 06:03.880
 what it's saying is choose an origin,

06:03.880 --> 06:06.520
 always move perpendicular to the vector

06:06.520 --> 06:08.360
 from that origin to you, okay?

06:09.360 --> 06:12.480
 Then when you walk Pi times that radius,

06:12.480 --> 06:14.200
 you'll be halfway around.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.880
 Like that's what it's saying.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.080
 It's kind of the you turn 90 degrees

06:18.080 --> 06:19.920
 and you walk, you'll be going in a circle.

06:19.920 --> 06:22.480
 That's the phenomenon that it's describing,

06:22.480 --> 06:25.400
 but trying to twist the idea of repeatedly multiplying

06:25.400 --> 06:26.800
 a constant into that.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.760
 Like I can't even think of the number of human hours,

06:30.760 --> 06:33.440
 of like intelligent human hours that have been wasted

06:33.440 --> 06:36.840
 trying to parse that to their own liking and desire

06:36.840 --> 06:39.520
 among like scientists or electrical engineers

06:39.520 --> 06:40.640
 or students have we were,

06:40.640 --> 06:42.760
 which if the notation were a little different

06:42.760 --> 06:45.640
 or the way that this whole function was introduced

06:45.640 --> 06:47.600
 from the get go were framed differently,

06:47.600 --> 06:50.000
 I think could have been avoided, right?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.040
 And you're talking about

06:51.040 --> 06:53.440
 the most beautiful equation in mathematics,

06:53.440 --> 06:55.080
 but it's still pretty mysterious, isn't it?

06:55.080 --> 06:58.640
 Like you're making it seem like it's a notational.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.760
 It's not mysterious.

06:59.760 --> 07:01.960
 I think the notation makes it mysterious.

07:01.960 --> 07:02.920
 I don't think it's,

07:02.920 --> 07:05.160
 I think the fact that it represents, it's pretty.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.680
 It's not like the most beautiful thing in the world,

07:06.680 --> 07:07.960
 but it's quite pretty.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.620
 The idea that if you take the linear operation,

07:10.620 --> 07:12.520
 of a 90 degree rotation,

07:12.520 --> 07:15.720
 and then you do this general exponentiation thing to it,

07:15.720 --> 07:18.520
 that what you get are all the other kinds of rotation,

07:19.480 --> 07:20.440
 which is basically to say,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.840
 if your velocity vector is perpendicular

07:22.840 --> 07:25.400
 to your position vector, you walk in a circle,

07:25.400 --> 07:26.360
 that's pretty.

07:26.360 --> 07:27.800
 It's not the most beautiful thing in the world,

07:27.800 --> 07:28.760
 but it's quite pretty.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.800
 The beauty of it, I think comes from,

07:30.800 --> 07:33.080
 perhaps the awkwardness of the notation,

07:33.080 --> 07:35.480
 somehow still nevertheless coming together nicely.

07:35.480 --> 07:38.760
 Cause you have like several disciplines coming together

07:38.760 --> 07:40.160
 in a single equation.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.000
 Well, I think.

07:41.000 --> 07:43.440
 In a sense, like historically speaking.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.280
 That's true.

07:44.280 --> 07:45.960
 So like the number E is significant.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.880
 Like it shows up in probability all the time.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.360
 It like shows up in calculus all the time.

07:49.360 --> 07:50.360
 It is significant.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.280
 You're seeing it sort of mated with pi,

07:52.280 --> 07:54.040
 this geometric constant and I,

07:54.040 --> 07:55.800
 like the imaginary number and such.

07:55.800 --> 07:57.640
 I think what's really happening there

07:57.640 --> 08:01.120
 is the way that E shows up is when you have things

08:01.120 --> 08:03.160
 like exponential growth and decay, right?

08:03.160 --> 08:06.080
 It's when this relation that something's rate of change

08:06.080 --> 08:10.440
 has to itself is a simple scaling, right?

08:10.440 --> 08:14.040
 A similar law also describes circular motion.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.320
 Because we have bad notation,

08:16.320 --> 08:19.080
 we use the residue of how it shows up

08:19.080 --> 08:21.040
 in the context of self reinforcing growth

08:21.040 --> 08:23.640
 like a population growing or compound interest.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.240
 The constant associated with that

08:25.240 --> 08:27.600
 is awkwardly placed into the context

08:27.600 --> 08:29.680
 of how rotation comes about

08:29.680 --> 08:32.240
 because they both come from pretty similar equations.

08:32.240 --> 08:36.120
 And so what we see is the E and the pi juxtaposed

08:36.120 --> 08:38.240
 a little bit closer than they would be

08:38.240 --> 08:40.960
 with a purely natural representation, I would think.

08:40.960 --> 08:43.320
 Here's how I would describe the relation between the two.

08:43.320 --> 08:45.760
 You've got a very important function we might call exp.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.680
 That's like the exponential function.

08:47.680 --> 08:49.280
 When you plug in one,

08:49.280 --> 08:50.880
 you get this nice constant called E

08:50.880 --> 08:53.280
 that shows up in like probability and calculus.

08:53.280 --> 08:55.280
 If you try to move in the imaginary direction,

08:55.280 --> 08:58.320
 it's periodic and the period is tau.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.520
 So those are these two constants

08:59.520 --> 09:02.120
 associated with the same central function,

09:02.120 --> 09:04.720
 but for kind of unrelated reasons, right?

09:04.720 --> 09:07.320
 And not unrelated, but like orthogonal reasons.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.320
 One of them is what happens

09:08.320 --> 09:09.680
 when you're moving in the real direction.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.520
 One's what happens when you move in the imaginary direction.

09:12.520 --> 09:14.160
 And like, yeah, those are related.

09:14.160 --> 09:17.160
 They're not as related as the famous equation

09:17.160 --> 09:18.520
 seems to think it is.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.520
 It's sort of putting all of the children in one bed

09:20.520 --> 09:22.480
 and they'd kind of like to sleep in separate beds

09:22.480 --> 09:24.560
 if they had the choice, but you see them all there.

09:24.560 --> 09:27.000
 And there is a family resemblance,

09:27.000 --> 09:28.320
 but it's not that close.

09:28.320 --> 09:33.320
 So actually thinking of it as a function is the better idea.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.680
 And that's a notational idea.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.760
 And yeah, like here's the thing.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.760
 The constant E sort of stands as this numerical representative

09:41.760 --> 09:42.920
 of calculus, right?

09:42.920 --> 09:43.760
 Yeah.

09:43.760 --> 09:46.720
 Calculus is the like study of change.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.560
 So at the very least,

09:47.560 --> 09:50.560
 there's a little cognitive dissonance using a constant

09:50.560 --> 09:52.520
 to represent the science of change.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.520
 I never thought of it that way.

09:53.520 --> 09:54.360
 Yeah.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.200
 Right?

09:55.200 --> 09:56.040
 Yeah.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.960
 But it makes sense why the notation came about that way.

09:59.960 --> 10:00.800
 Yes.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.080
 Because this is the first way that we saw it

10:02.080 --> 10:03.840
 in the context of things like population growth

10:03.840 --> 10:04.760
 or compound interest.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.040
 It is nicer to think about as repeated multiplication.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.680
 That's definitely nicer.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.000
 But it's more that that's the first application

10:11.000 --> 10:13.880
 of what turned out to be a much more general function

10:13.880 --> 10:15.200
 that maybe the intelligent life,

10:15.200 --> 10:17.160
 your initial question asked about

10:17.160 --> 10:18.520
 would have come to recognize

10:18.520 --> 10:21.120
 as being much more significant than the single use case,

10:21.120 --> 10:24.280
 which lends itself to repeated multiplication notation.

10:24.280 --> 10:28.480
 But let me jump back for a second to aliens

10:28.480 --> 10:30.040
 and the nature of our universe.

10:30.040 --> 10:30.880
 Okay.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.080
 Do you think math is discovered or invented?

10:35.080 --> 10:37.600
 So we're talking about the different kind of mathematics

10:37.600 --> 10:40.600
 that could be developed by the alien species.

10:40.600 --> 10:44.480
 The implied question is yeah,

10:44.480 --> 10:46.200
 is math discovered or invented?

10:46.200 --> 10:49.640
 Is fundamentally everybody going to discover

10:49.640 --> 10:53.120
 the same principles of mathematics?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.120
 So the way I think about it,

10:54.120 --> 10:55.360
 and everyone thinks about it differently,

10:55.360 --> 10:56.400
 but here's my take.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.880
 I think there's a cycle at play

10:57.880 --> 11:00.960
 where you discover things about the universe

11:00.960 --> 11:03.960
 that tell you what math will be useful.

11:03.960 --> 11:08.040
 And that math itself is invented in a sense.

11:08.040 --> 11:11.400
 But of all the possible maths that you could have invented,

11:11.400 --> 11:12.720
 it's discoveries about the world

11:12.720 --> 11:14.200
 that tell you which ones are.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.680
 So like a good example here is the Pythagorean theorem.

11:17.680 --> 11:18.520
 When you look at this,

11:18.520 --> 11:19.760
 do you think of that as a definition

11:19.760 --> 11:21.920
 or do you think of that as a discovery?

11:21.920 --> 11:24.320
 From the historical perspective, right, as a discovery?

11:24.320 --> 11:25.160
 Because they were,

11:25.160 --> 11:29.640
 but that's probably because they were using physical object

11:29.640 --> 11:31.200
 to build their intuition.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.520
 And from that intuition came the mathematics.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.360
 So the mathematics wasn't in some abstract world

11:37.360 --> 11:39.080
 detached from physics,

11:39.080 --> 11:43.520
 but I think more and more math has become detached from,

11:43.520 --> 11:46.120
 you know, when you even look at modern physics

11:46.120 --> 11:49.560
 from string theory to even general relativity.

11:49.560 --> 11:53.600
 I mean, all math behind the 20th and 21st century physics

11:53.600 --> 11:57.240
 kind of takes a brisk walk outside

11:57.240 --> 12:00.520
 of what our mind can actually even comprehend

12:00.520 --> 12:02.400
 in multiple dimensions, for example,

12:02.400 --> 12:05.920
 anything beyond three dimensions, maybe four dimensions.

12:05.920 --> 12:06.760
 No, no, no.

12:06.760 --> 12:08.760
 Higher dimensions can be highly, highly applicable.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.240
 I think this is a common misinterpretation

12:11.240 --> 12:13.360
 that if you're asking questions

12:13.360 --> 12:15.280
 about like a five dimensional manifold,

12:15.280 --> 12:16.720
 that the only way that that's connected

12:16.720 --> 12:17.880
 to the physical world

12:17.880 --> 12:20.240
 is if the physical world is itself

12:20.240 --> 12:22.960
 a five dimensional manifold or includes them.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.240
 Well, wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.240
 You're telling me you can imagine

12:28.960 --> 12:31.280
 a five dimensional manifold?

12:31.280 --> 12:32.520
 No, no, that's not what I said.

12:32.520 --> 12:35.000
 I would make the claim that it is useful

12:35.000 --> 12:37.240
 to a three dimensional physical universe

12:37.240 --> 12:39.440
 despite itself not being three dimensional.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.200
 So it's useful meaning to even understand

12:41.200 --> 12:42.720
 a three dimensional world,

12:42.720 --> 12:44.920
 it'd be useful to have five dimensional manifolds.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.080
 Yes, absolutely.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.160
 Because of state spaces.

12:47.160 --> 12:50.520
 But you're saying in some deep way for us humans,

12:50.520 --> 12:54.080
 it does always come back to that three dimensional world

12:54.080 --> 12:56.600
 for the usefulness of the dimensional world.

12:56.600 --> 12:59.960
 And therefore it starts with a discovery,

12:59.960 --> 13:02.080
 but then we invent the mathematics

13:02.080 --> 13:06.280
 that helps us make sense of the discovery in a sense.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.880
 Yes, I mean, just to jump off

13:07.880 --> 13:09.840
 of the Pythagorean theorem example,

13:09.840 --> 13:11.200
 it feels like a discovery.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.920
 You've got these beautiful geometric proofs

13:12.920 --> 13:14.640
 where you've got squares and you're modifying their areas.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.760
 It feels like a discovery.

13:16.760 --> 13:19.640
 If you look at how we formalize the idea of 2D space

13:19.640 --> 13:23.120
 as being R2, all pairs of real numbers,

13:23.120 --> 13:25.720
 and how we define a metric on it and define distance,

13:25.720 --> 13:26.680
 you're like, hang on a second,

13:26.680 --> 13:28.080
 we've defined a distance

13:28.080 --> 13:30.120
 so that the Pythagorean theorem is true

13:30.120 --> 13:32.480
 so that suddenly it doesn't feel that great.

13:32.480 --> 13:35.400
 But I think what's going on is the thing that informed us

13:35.400 --> 13:38.000
 what metric to put on R2,

13:38.000 --> 13:41.400
 to put on our abstract representation of 2D space

13:41.400 --> 13:43.280
 came from physical observations.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.640
 And the thing is there's other metrics

13:44.640 --> 13:45.480
 you could have put on it.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.200
 You could have consistent math

13:47.200 --> 13:49.160
 with other notions of distance.

13:49.160 --> 13:50.880
 It's just that those pieces of math

13:50.880 --> 13:53.640
 wouldn't be applicable to the physical world that we study

13:53.640 --> 13:54.600
 because they're not the ones

13:54.600 --> 13:56.200
 where the Pythagorean theorem holds.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.040
 So we have a discovery, a genuine bona fide discovery

13:59.040 --> 14:00.480
 that informed the invention,

14:00.480 --> 14:03.720
 the invention of an abstract representation of 2D space

14:03.720 --> 14:06.240
 that we call R2 and things like that.

14:06.240 --> 14:07.320
 And then from there,

14:07.320 --> 14:09.720
 you just study R2 as an abstract thing

14:09.720 --> 14:12.520
 that brings about more ideas and inventions and mysteries

14:12.520 --> 14:14.440
 which themselves might yield discoveries.

14:14.440 --> 14:17.040
 Those discoveries might give you insight

14:17.040 --> 14:19.440
 as to what else would be useful to invent

14:19.440 --> 14:21.040
 and it kind of feeds on itself that way.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.240
 That's how I think about it.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.200
 So it's not an either or.

14:24.200 --> 14:26.840
 It's not that math is one of these or it's one of the others.

14:26.840 --> 14:29.240
 At different times, it's playing a different role.

14:29.240 --> 14:33.160
 So then let me ask the Richard Feynman question.

14:33.160 --> 14:36.440
 Then along that thread is,

14:36.440 --> 14:40.360
 what do you think is the difference between physics and math?

14:40.360 --> 14:42.880
 There's a giant overlap.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.920
 There's a kind of intuition that physicists have

14:45.920 --> 14:49.000
 about the world that's perhaps outside of mathematics.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.680
 It's this mysterious art that they seem to possess.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.240
 We humans generally possess.

14:54.240 --> 14:58.040
 And then there's the beautiful rigor of mathematics

14:58.040 --> 15:01.800
 that allows you to, I mean, just like as we were saying,

15:02.840 --> 15:07.840
 invent frameworks of understanding our physical world.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.640
 So what do you think is the difference there

15:10.640 --> 15:11.840
 and how big is it?

15:11.840 --> 15:14.760
 Well, I think of math as being the study of abstractions

15:14.760 --> 15:17.360
 over patterns and pure patterns in logic.

15:17.360 --> 15:19.800
 And then physics is obviously grounded in a desire

15:19.800 --> 15:22.680
 to understand the world that we live in.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.040
 I think you're gonna get very different answers

15:24.040 --> 15:25.560
 when you talk to different mathematicians

15:25.560 --> 15:28.120
 because there's a wide diversity in types of mathematicians.

15:28.120 --> 15:31.480
 There are some who are motivated very much by pure puzzles.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.040
 They might be turned on by things like combinatorics.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.680
 And they just love the idea of building up a set

15:36.680 --> 15:40.880
 of problem solving tools applying to pure patterns.

15:40.880 --> 15:43.320
 There are some who are very physically motivated

15:43.320 --> 15:48.320
 who try to invent new math or discover math in veins

15:48.680 --> 15:50.960
 that they know will have applications to physics

15:50.960 --> 15:52.280
 or sometimes computer science.

15:52.280 --> 15:53.840
 And that's what drives them, right?

15:53.840 --> 15:55.560
 Like chaos theory is a good example of something

15:55.560 --> 15:57.680
 that's pure math, that's purely mathematical.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.160
 A lot of the statements being made,

15:59.160 --> 16:02.880
 but it's heavily motivated by specific applications

16:02.880 --> 16:05.360
 to largely physics.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.680
 And then you have a type of mathematician

16:06.680 --> 16:08.520
 who just loves abstraction.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.720
 They just love pulling into the more and more abstract things

16:10.720 --> 16:12.160
 the things that feel powerful.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.240
 These are the ones that initially invented like topology

16:15.240 --> 16:17.520
 and then later on get really into category theory

16:17.520 --> 16:20.400
 and go on about like infinite categories and whatnot.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.480
 These are the ones that love to have a system

16:23.480 --> 16:27.160
 that can describe truths about as many things as possible.

16:28.760 --> 16:30.800
 People from those three different veins

16:30.800 --> 16:32.160
 of motivation into math are gonna give you

16:32.160 --> 16:33.720
 very different answers about what the relation

16:33.720 --> 16:34.760
 at play here is.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.680
 Cause someone like Vladimir Arnold,

16:37.680 --> 16:40.560
 who has written a lot of great books,

16:40.560 --> 16:42.520
 many about like differential equations and such.

16:42.520 --> 16:45.680
 He would say, math is a branch of physics.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.160
 That's how he would think about it.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.160
 And of course he was studying like differential equations

16:49.160 --> 16:51.080
 related things because that is the motivator

16:51.080 --> 16:53.800
 behind the study of PDEs and things like that.

16:54.800 --> 16:56.680
 But you'll have others who like,

16:56.680 --> 16:58.280
 especially the category theorists

16:58.280 --> 17:01.400
 who aren't really thinking about physics necessarily.

17:01.400 --> 17:04.560
 It's all about abstraction and the power of generality.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.440
 And it's more of a happy coincidence

17:06.440 --> 17:08.360
 that that ends up being useful

17:08.360 --> 17:10.920
 for understanding the world we live in.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.880
 And then you can get into like, why is that the case?

17:12.880 --> 17:15.080
 It's sort of surprising that,

17:15.080 --> 17:17.840
 that which is about pure puzzles and abstraction

17:17.840 --> 17:21.080
 also happens to describe the very fundamentals

17:21.080 --> 17:23.140
 of quarks and everything else.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.880
 So what do you think the fundamentals of quarks

17:28.840 --> 17:33.240
 and the nature of reality is so compressible

17:33.240 --> 17:35.320
 into clean, beautiful equations

17:35.320 --> 17:39.280
 that are for the most part simple, relatively speaking.

17:39.280 --> 17:41.720
 A lot simpler than they could be.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.360
 So you have, we mentioned to me like Stephen Wolfram

17:45.360 --> 17:48.160
 who thinks that sort of,

17:48.160 --> 17:51.880
 there's incredibly simple rules underlying our reality,

17:51.880 --> 17:54.920
 but it can create arbitrary complexity.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.760
 But there is simple equations.

17:56.760 --> 17:59.200
 What, I'm asking a million questions

17:59.200 --> 18:00.640
 that nobody knows the answer to.

18:00.640 --> 18:02.040
 Yeah, I have no idea.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.240
 Why is it simple?

18:05.280 --> 18:07.080
 It could be the case that,

18:07.080 --> 18:08.480
 there's like a filter iteration at play.

18:08.480 --> 18:10.600
 The only things that physicists find interesting,

18:10.600 --> 18:11.680
 other ones that are simple enough,

18:11.680 --> 18:13.280
 they could describe it mathematically.

18:13.280 --> 18:15.120
 But as soon as it's a sufficiently complex system,

18:15.120 --> 18:16.920
 they're like, yeah, that's outside the realm of physics.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.320
 That's biology or whatever have you.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.400
 And of course, that's true, right?

18:21.400 --> 18:22.680
 You know, maybe there's something where it's like,

18:22.680 --> 18:26.520
 of course there will always be some thing that is simple

18:26.520 --> 18:31.400
 when you wash away the like non important parts

18:31.400 --> 18:33.400
 of whatever it is that you're studying.

18:33.400 --> 18:35.160
 Just from like an information theory standpoint,

18:35.160 --> 18:36.640
 there might be some like,

18:36.640 --> 18:39.440
 you get to the lowest information component of it.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.880
 But I don't know, maybe I'm just having

18:40.880 --> 18:43.000
 a really hard time conceiving of what it would even mean

18:43.000 --> 18:47.440
 for the fundamental laws to be like intrinsically complicated.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.600
 Like some set of equations

18:50.600 --> 18:52.520
 that you can't decouple from each other.

18:52.520 --> 18:56.760
 Well, no, it could be that sort of we take for granted

18:56.760 --> 18:59.960
 that the laws of physics, for example,

18:59.960 --> 19:03.480
 are for the most part the same everywhere

19:03.480 --> 19:05.320
 or something like that, right?

19:05.320 --> 19:10.320
 As opposed to the sort of an alternative could be

19:10.600 --> 19:15.400
 that the rules under which the world operates

19:15.400 --> 19:17.240
 is different everywhere.

19:17.240 --> 19:20.320
 It's like a deeply distributed system

19:20.320 --> 19:22.360
 where just everything is just chaos.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.520
 Like not in a strict definition of cast,

19:25.520 --> 19:30.360
 but meaning like just it's impossible for equations

19:30.360 --> 19:34.000
 to capture for to explicitly model the world

19:34.000 --> 19:36.000
 as cleanly as the physical does.

19:36.000 --> 19:38.040
 I mean, we almost take it for granted

19:38.040 --> 19:39.040
 that we can describe,

19:39.040 --> 19:41.200
 we can have an equation for gravity

19:41.200 --> 19:42.760
 for action at a distance.

19:42.760 --> 19:45.480
 We can have equations for some of these basic ways

19:45.480 --> 19:50.480
 the plan is moving just the low level

19:50.800 --> 19:54.000
 of the atomic scale, how the materials operate

19:54.000 --> 19:56.960
 at the high scale, how black holes operate.

19:56.960 --> 19:59.840
 But it seems like it could be,

19:59.840 --> 20:01.720
 there's infinite other possibilities

20:01.720 --> 20:05.080
 where none of it could be compressible into such equations.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.560
 It just seems beautiful.

20:06.560 --> 20:10.920
 It's also weird probably to the point you were making

20:10.920 --> 20:15.120
 that it's very pleasant that this is true for our minds.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.160
 So it might be that our minds are biased

20:17.160 --> 20:19.680
 to just be looking at the parts of the universe

20:19.680 --> 20:21.760
 that are compressible.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.560
 And then we can publish papers on and have nice

20:24.560 --> 20:26.480
 E equals empty squared equations.

20:26.480 --> 20:27.320
 Right.

20:27.320 --> 20:31.760
 Well, I wonder would such a world with uncompressible laws

20:31.760 --> 20:35.160
 allow for the kind of beings that can think about

20:35.160 --> 20:37.800
 the kind of questions that you're asking?

20:37.800 --> 20:38.640
 That's true.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.480
 Right.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.640
 Like an anthropic principle coming into play

20:40.640 --> 20:42.640
 at some weird way here.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.480
 I don't know.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.800
 Like I don't know what I'm talking about.

20:44.800 --> 20:48.040
 Well, maybe the universe is actually not so compressible,

20:48.040 --> 20:52.600
 but the way our brain evolved

20:52.600 --> 20:55.920
 were only able to perceive the compressible parts.

20:55.920 --> 20:58.440
 I mean, this is a sort of Chomsky argument.

20:58.440 --> 20:59.920
 We are just descendants of apes

20:59.920 --> 21:03.640
 over like really limited biological systems.

21:03.640 --> 21:04.720
 So it totally makes sense

21:04.720 --> 21:08.640
 that we're really limited little computers, calculators,

21:08.640 --> 21:10.280
 that are able to perceive certain kinds of things

21:10.280 --> 21:13.000
 and the actual world is much more complicated.

21:13.000 --> 21:16.720
 Well, but we can do pretty awesome things, right?

21:16.720 --> 21:18.360
 Like we can fly spaceships.

21:18.360 --> 21:21.640
 And we have to have some connection of reality

21:21.640 --> 21:25.040
 to be able to take our potentially oversimplified

21:25.040 --> 21:26.320
 models of the world,

21:26.320 --> 21:29.160
 but then actually twist the world to our will based on it.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.480
 So we have certain reality checks

21:30.480 --> 21:33.520
 that like physics isn't too far afield,

21:33.520 --> 21:35.520
 simply based on what we can do.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.360
 Yeah, the fact that we can fly is pretty good.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.200
 It's great.

21:38.200 --> 21:39.040
 Yeah.

21:39.040 --> 21:39.880
 And land.

21:39.880 --> 21:41.880
 It's a proof of concept that the laws

21:41.880 --> 21:44.960
 we're working with are working well.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.800
 So I mentioned to the internet that I'm talking to you.

21:47.800 --> 21:50.240
 And so the internet gave some questions.

21:50.240 --> 21:51.640
 So I apologize for these,

21:51.640 --> 21:54.560
 but do you think we're living in a simulation

21:54.560 --> 21:56.960
 that the universe is a computer

21:56.960 --> 22:00.040
 or the universe is a computation running on a computer?

22:01.280 --> 22:02.720
 It's conceivable.

22:02.720 --> 22:06.320
 What I don't buy is, you know, you'll have the argument that,

22:06.320 --> 22:07.920
 well, let's say that it was the case

22:07.920 --> 22:09.600
 that you can have simulations,

22:09.600 --> 22:12.600
 then the simulated world would itself

22:12.600 --> 22:15.360
 eventually get to a point where it's running simulations.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.240
 And then the second layer down

22:17.240 --> 22:19.440
 would create a third layer down and on and on and on.

22:19.440 --> 22:20.840
 So probabilistically,

22:20.840 --> 22:22.400
 you just throw a dart at one of those layers.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.960
 We're probably in one of the simulated layers.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.040
 I think if there's some sort of limitations

22:27.040 --> 22:28.560
 on like the information processing

22:28.560 --> 22:31.440
 of whatever the physical world is,

22:31.440 --> 22:32.720
 like it quickly becomes the case

22:32.720 --> 22:35.600
 that you have a limit to the layers that could exist there

22:35.600 --> 22:38.080
 because like the resources necessary

22:38.080 --> 22:41.680
 to simulate a universe like ours clearly is a lot.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.680
 Just in terms of the number of bits at play.

22:43.680 --> 22:46.800
 And so then you can ask, well, what's more plausible?

22:46.800 --> 22:49.120
 That there's an unbounded capacity

22:49.120 --> 22:50.360
 of information processing

22:50.360 --> 22:53.640
 in whatever the like highest up level universe is,

22:53.640 --> 22:56.080
 or that there's some bound to that capacity,

22:56.080 --> 22:58.880
 which then limits like the number of levels available.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.800
 How do you play some kind of probability distribution

23:00.800 --> 23:02.560
 on like what the information capacity is?

23:02.560 --> 23:03.720
 I have no idea.

23:03.720 --> 23:06.840
 But I don't, like people almost assume

23:06.840 --> 23:10.200
 a certain uniform probability over all of those meta layers

23:10.200 --> 23:11.880
 that could conceivably exist

23:11.880 --> 23:15.120
 when it's a little bit like a Pascal's wager

23:15.120 --> 23:16.960
 on like you're not giving a low enough prior

23:16.960 --> 23:20.840
 to the mere existence of that infinite set of layers.

23:20.840 --> 23:21.680
 Yeah, that's true.

23:21.680 --> 23:24.480
 But it's also very difficult to contextualize

23:24.480 --> 23:28.240
 the amount, so the amount of information processing power

23:28.240 --> 23:31.360
 required to simulate like our universe

23:31.360 --> 23:34.240
 seems like amazingly huge.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.920
 But you can always raise two to the power of that.

23:36.920 --> 23:37.760
 Yeah.

23:37.760 --> 23:40.480
 Yeah, like numbers get big.

23:40.480 --> 23:43.720
 And we're easily humbled by basically everything around us.

23:43.720 --> 23:48.720
 So it's very difficult to kind of make sense of anything

23:49.280 --> 23:50.960
 actually when you look up at the sky

23:50.960 --> 23:53.520
 and look at the stars and the immensity of it all

23:53.520 --> 23:57.040
 to make sense of us, the smallness of us,

23:57.040 --> 24:00.600
 the unlikeliness of everything that's on this earth

24:00.600 --> 24:04.960
 coming to be, then you could basically anything could be

24:04.960 --> 24:09.080
 all laws of probability go out the window to me

24:09.080 --> 24:14.080
 because I guess because the amount of information

24:14.160 --> 24:17.560
 under which we're operating is very low.

24:17.560 --> 24:22.080
 We basically know nothing about the world around us

24:22.080 --> 24:23.400
 relatively speaking.

24:23.400 --> 24:26.600
 And so when I think about the simulation hypothesis,

24:26.600 --> 24:29.200
 I think it's just fun to think about it.

24:29.200 --> 24:31.840
 But it's also, I think there is a thought experiment

24:31.840 --> 24:35.200
 kind of interesting to think of the power of computation

24:35.200 --> 24:38.920
 where there are the limits of a Turing machine,

24:38.920 --> 24:41.000
 sort of the limits of our current computers

24:41.000 --> 24:44.040
 when you start to think about artificial intelligence,

24:44.040 --> 24:45.880
 how far can we get with computers?

24:46.800 --> 24:50.800
 And that's kind of where the simulation hypothesis

24:50.800 --> 24:52.800
 used to me as a thought experiment

24:52.800 --> 24:55.080
 is the universe just a computer?

24:56.640 --> 24:58.560
 Is it just a computation?

24:58.560 --> 25:00.440
 Is all of this just a computation?

25:00.440 --> 25:02.360
 And sort of the same kind of tools we apply

25:02.360 --> 25:05.080
 to analyzing algorithms, can that be applied?

25:05.080 --> 25:07.320
 If we scale further and further and further,

25:07.320 --> 25:09.600
 will the arbitrary power of those systems

25:09.600 --> 25:12.000
 start to create some interesting aspects

25:12.000 --> 25:13.880
 that we see in our universe?

25:13.880 --> 25:15.960
 Or is something fundamentally different

25:15.960 --> 25:17.480
 needs to be created?

25:17.480 --> 25:20.360
 Well, it's interesting that in our universe,

25:20.360 --> 25:22.680
 it's not arbitrarily large, the power,

25:22.680 --> 25:24.320
 that you can place limits on, for example,

25:24.320 --> 25:27.320
 how many bits of information can be stored per unit area?

25:27.320 --> 25:29.920
 Right, like all of the physical laws,

25:29.920 --> 25:32.280
 we've got general relativity and quantum coming together

25:32.280 --> 25:36.200
 to give you a certain limit on how many bits you can store

25:36.200 --> 25:39.800
 within a given range before it collapses into a black hole.

25:39.800 --> 25:42.320
 Like the idea that there even exists such a limit

25:42.320 --> 25:44.200
 is at the very least thought provoking

25:44.200 --> 25:46.520
 when, naively, you might assume,

25:46.520 --> 25:48.840
 oh, well, technology could always get better and better,

25:48.840 --> 25:50.480
 we could get cleverer and cleverer,

25:50.480 --> 25:53.720
 and you could just cram as much information as you want

25:53.720 --> 25:55.800
 into a small unit of space.

25:55.800 --> 26:01.800
 That makes me think it's at least plausible

26:01.800 --> 26:05.800
 that whatever the highest level of existence is

26:05.800 --> 26:08.800
 doesn't admit too many simulations

26:08.800 --> 26:10.800
 or ones that are at the scale of complexity

26:10.800 --> 26:11.800
 that we're looking at.

26:11.800 --> 26:13.800
 Obviously, it's just as conceivable that they do

26:13.800 --> 26:18.800
 and that there are many, but I guess what I'm channeling

26:18.800 --> 26:20.800
 is the surprise that I felt upon learning that fact,

26:20.800 --> 26:23.800
 that information is physical in this way.

26:23.800 --> 26:25.800
 There's a finiteness to it.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.800
 Okay, let me just even go off on that

26:27.800 --> 26:31.800
 from a mathematics perspective and a psychology perspective.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.800
 How do you mix?

26:33.800 --> 26:36.800
 Are you psychologically comfortable

26:36.800 --> 26:38.800
 with the concept of infinity?

26:38.800 --> 26:39.800
 I think so.

26:39.800 --> 26:40.800
 Are you okay with it?

26:40.800 --> 26:41.800
 I'm pretty okay, yeah.

26:41.800 --> 26:42.800
 Are you okay?

26:42.800 --> 26:43.800
 No, not really.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.800
 It doesn't make any sense to me.

26:45.800 --> 26:46.800
 I don't know.

26:46.800 --> 26:51.800
 How many possible words do you think could exist

26:51.800 --> 26:54.800
 that are just like strings of letters?

26:54.800 --> 26:58.800
 That's a sort of mathematical statement as beautiful

26:58.800 --> 27:02.800
 and we use infinity in basically everything we do

27:02.800 --> 27:05.800
 in science, math and engineering, yes.

27:05.800 --> 27:08.800
 But you said exist.

27:08.800 --> 27:12.800
 The question is, you said letters or words?

27:12.800 --> 27:14.800
 I said words.

27:14.800 --> 27:17.800
 To bring words into existence to me,

27:17.800 --> 27:20.800
 you have to start saying them or writing them

27:20.800 --> 27:21.800
 or listing them.

27:21.800 --> 27:22.800
 That's an instantiation.

27:22.800 --> 27:23.800
 Okay.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.800
 How many abstract words exist?

27:25.800 --> 27:27.800
 Well, the idea of abstract.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.800
 The idea of abstract notions and ideas.

27:30.800 --> 27:32.800
 I think we should be clear on terminology.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.800
 You think about intelligence a lot,

27:34.800 --> 27:36.800
 like artificial intelligence.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.800
 Would you not say that what it's doing

27:38.800 --> 27:40.800
 is a kind of abstraction?

27:40.800 --> 27:44.800
 Abstraction is key to conceptualizing the universe.

27:44.800 --> 27:46.800
 You get this raw sensory data.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.800
 I need something that every time you move your face

27:48.800 --> 27:50.800
 a little bit, and they're not pixels,

27:50.800 --> 27:54.800
 but analog of pixels on my retina change entirely,

27:54.800 --> 27:56.800
 that I can still have some coherent notion

27:56.800 --> 27:58.800
 of this is Lex, I'm talking about Lex.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.800
 What that requires is you have a disparate set

28:00.800 --> 28:02.800
 of possible images hitting me

28:02.800 --> 28:05.800
 that are unified in a notion of Lex.

28:05.800 --> 28:07.800
 That's a kind of abstraction.

28:07.800 --> 28:10.800
 It's a thing that could apply to a lot of different images

28:10.800 --> 28:14.800
 that I see and it represents it in a much more compressed way

28:14.800 --> 28:16.800
 and one that's much more resilient to that.

28:16.800 --> 28:18.800
 I think in the same way, if I'm talking about

28:18.800 --> 28:20.800
 infinity as an abstraction,

28:20.800 --> 28:25.800
 I don't mean nonphysical, woo woo, ineffable or something.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.800
 What I mean is it's something that can apply

28:27.800 --> 28:29.800
 to a multiplicity of situations

28:29.800 --> 28:31.800
 that share a certain common attribute.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.800
 In the same way that the images of your face on my retina

28:33.800 --> 28:35.800
 share enough common attributes

28:35.800 --> 28:37.800
 that I can put this single notion to it.

28:37.800 --> 28:39.800
 In that way, infinity is an abstraction,

28:39.800 --> 28:41.800
 and it's very powerful.

28:41.800 --> 28:43.800
 It's only through such abstractions

28:43.800 --> 28:45.800
 that we can actually understand

28:45.800 --> 28:47.800
 the world and logic and things.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.800
 In the case of infinity, the way I think about it,

28:49.800 --> 28:51.800
 the key entity is the property

28:51.800 --> 28:53.800
 of always being able to add one more.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.800
 No matter how many words you can list,

28:55.800 --> 28:57.800
 you just throw an A at the end of one

28:57.800 --> 28:59.800
 and you have another conceivable word.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.800
 You don't have to think of all the words at once.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.800
 It's that property.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.800
 I could always add one more

29:05.800 --> 29:07.800
 that gives it this nature of infinitiveness

29:07.800 --> 29:09.800
 in the same way that there are certain properties

29:09.800 --> 29:13.800
 of your face that give it the lexness.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.800
 So, like, infinity should be no more worrying

29:16.800 --> 29:19.800
 than the I can always add one more sentiment.

29:19.800 --> 29:21.800
 That's a really elegant,

29:21.800 --> 29:23.800
 much more elegant way than I could put it.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.800
 So thank you for doing that as yet another abstraction.

29:26.800 --> 29:28.800
 And yes, indeed.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.800
 That's what our brain does.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.800
 That's what intelligence systems do.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.800
 That's what programming does.

29:34.800 --> 29:36.800
 That's what science does is build abstraction

29:36.800 --> 29:38.800
 on top of each other.

29:38.800 --> 29:40.800
 And yet, there is, at a certain point,

29:40.800 --> 29:43.800
 quote, woo, right?

29:43.800 --> 29:45.800
 Sort of.

29:45.800 --> 29:48.800
 And because we're now, it's like,

29:48.800 --> 29:51.800
 we built this stack of, you know,

29:51.800 --> 29:53.800
 the only thing that's true is the stuff

29:53.800 --> 29:54.800
 that's on the ground.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.800
 Everything else is useful for interpreting this.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.800
 And at a certain point,

29:58.800 --> 30:01.800
 you might start floating into ideas

30:01.800 --> 30:04.800
 that are surreal and difficult

30:04.800 --> 30:06.800
 and take us into areas that are

30:06.800 --> 30:08.800
 disconnected from reality

30:08.800 --> 30:10.800
 in a way that we could never get back.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.800
 What if instead of calling these abstract,

30:12.800 --> 30:14.800
 how different would it be in your mind

30:14.800 --> 30:15.800
 if we called them general?

30:15.800 --> 30:17.800
 And the phenomena that you're describing

30:17.800 --> 30:18.800
 is overgeneralization.

30:18.800 --> 30:19.800
 When you try to...

30:19.800 --> 30:20.800
 Generalization, yeah.

30:20.800 --> 30:22.800
 Have a concept or an idea that's so general

30:22.800 --> 30:24.800
 as to apply to nothing in particular

30:24.800 --> 30:25.800
 in a useful way.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.800
 Does that map to what you're thinking of

30:27.800 --> 30:28.800
 when you think of...

30:28.800 --> 30:29.800
 First of all, I'm playing a little

30:29.800 --> 30:30.800
 just for the fun of it.

30:30.800 --> 30:31.800
 Yeah, I know.

30:31.800 --> 30:32.800
 Devil's Advocate.

30:32.800 --> 30:35.800
 And I think our cognition,

30:35.800 --> 30:38.800
 our mind is unable to visualize.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.800
 So you do some incredible work

30:40.800 --> 30:41.800
 with visualization and video.

30:41.800 --> 30:45.800
 I think infinity is very difficult

30:45.800 --> 30:47.800
 to visualize for our mind.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.800
 We can delude ourselves

30:49.800 --> 30:52.800
 into thinking we can visualize it.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.800
 But we can't.

30:53.800 --> 30:54.800
 I don't...

30:54.800 --> 30:55.800
 I mean, I don't...

30:55.800 --> 30:57.800
 I would venture to say it's very difficult.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.800
 And so there's some concepts in mathematics

30:59.800 --> 31:01.800
 like maybe multiple dimensions.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.800
 We could sort of talk about it.

31:03.800 --> 31:07.800
 It's impossible for us to truly intuit.

31:07.800 --> 31:11.800
 And it just feels dangerous to me

31:11.800 --> 31:16.800
 to use these as part of our toolbox of abstractions.

31:16.800 --> 31:17.800
 On behalf of your listeners,

31:17.800 --> 31:19.800
 I almost fear we're getting too philosophical.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.800
 No.

31:20.800 --> 31:21.800
 Heck no.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.800
 Heck no.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.800
 But I think to that point,

31:24.800 --> 31:26.800
 for any particular idea like this,

31:26.800 --> 31:28.800
 there's multiple angles of attack.

31:28.800 --> 31:31.800
 I think when we do visualize infinity,

31:31.800 --> 31:34.800
 what we're actually doing, you write dot, dot, dot.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.800
 One, two, three, four, dot, dot, dot.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.800
 Those are symbols on the page

31:37.800 --> 31:42.800
 that are insinuating a certain infinity.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.800
 What you're capturing with a little bit of design there

31:45.800 --> 31:49.800
 is the I can always add one more property.

31:49.800 --> 31:52.800
 I'm just as uncomfortable with you are

31:52.800 --> 31:55.800
 if you try to concretize it so much

31:55.800 --> 31:58.800
 that you have a bag of infinitely many things

31:58.800 --> 31:59.800
 that I actually think of,

31:59.800 --> 32:01.800
 no, not one, two, three, four, dot, dot, dot.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.800
 One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

32:03.800 --> 32:05.800
 I try to get them all in my head and you realize,

32:05.800 --> 32:07.800
 oh, your brain would literally collapse

32:07.800 --> 32:09.800
 into a black hole, all of that.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.800
 And I honestly feel this with a lot of math

32:11.800 --> 32:14.800
 that I try to read where I don't think of myself

32:14.800 --> 32:18.800
 as like particularly good at math.

32:18.800 --> 32:20.800
 In some ways, I get very confused

32:20.800 --> 32:23.800
 often when I am going through some of these texts.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.800
 And often what I'm feeling in my head is like,

32:25.800 --> 32:27.800
 this is just so damn abstract.

32:27.800 --> 32:28.800
 I just can't wrap my head around it.

32:28.800 --> 32:31.800
 I just want to put something concrete to it

32:31.800 --> 32:32.800
 that makes me understand.

32:32.800 --> 32:34.800
 And I think a lot of the motivation for the channel

32:34.800 --> 32:37.800
 is channeling that sentiment of,

32:37.800 --> 32:40.800
 yeah, a lot of the things that you're trying to read out there,

32:40.800 --> 32:42.800
 it's just so hard to connect to anything

32:42.800 --> 32:44.800
 that you spend an hour banging your head

32:44.800 --> 32:46.800
 against a couple of pages and you come out

32:46.800 --> 32:48.800
 not really knowing anything more

32:48.800 --> 32:51.800
 other than some definitions maybe

32:51.800 --> 32:54.800
 and a certain sense of self defeat, right?

32:54.800 --> 32:57.800
 One of the reasons I focus so much on visualizations

32:57.800 --> 33:00.800
 is that I'm a big believer in,

33:00.800 --> 33:03.800
 I'm sorry, I'm just really hampering on this idea of abstraction,

33:03.800 --> 33:06.800
 being clear about your layers of abstraction, right?

33:06.800 --> 33:09.800
 It's always tempting to start an explanation

33:09.800 --> 33:11.800
 from the top to the bottom, okay?

33:11.800 --> 33:13.800
 You give the definition of a new theorem.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.800
 You're like, this is the definition of a vector space.

33:15.800 --> 33:17.800
 For example, that's how we'll start a course.

33:17.800 --> 33:19.800
 These are the properties of a vector space.

33:19.800 --> 33:21.800
 First from these properties,

33:21.800 --> 33:23.800
 we will derive what we need in order to do the math

33:23.800 --> 33:26.800
 of linear algebra or whatever it might be.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.800
 I don't think that's how understanding works at all.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.800
 I think how understanding works is you start

33:30.800 --> 33:32.800
 at the lowest level you can get at,

33:32.800 --> 33:34.800
 where rather than thinking about a vector space,

33:34.800 --> 33:36.800
 you might think of concrete vectors

33:36.800 --> 33:38.800
 that are just lists of numbers

33:38.800 --> 33:41.800
 or picturing it as like an arrow that you draw,

33:41.800 --> 33:44.800
 which is itself like even less abstract than numbers

33:44.800 --> 33:46.800
 because you're looking at quantities,

33:46.800 --> 33:48.800
 like the distance of the X coordinate,

33:48.800 --> 33:50.800
 the distance of the Y coordinate.

33:50.800 --> 33:52.800
 It's as concrete as you could possibly get

33:52.800 --> 33:54.800
 and it has to be if you're putting it in a visual, right?

33:54.800 --> 33:56.800
 It's an actual arrow.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.800
 It's an actual vector.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.800
 You're not talking about like a quote unquote vector

34:00.800 --> 34:02.800
 that could apply to any possible thing.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.800
 You have to choose one if you're illustrating it.

34:04.800 --> 34:06.800
 And I think this is the power of being

34:06.800 --> 34:08.800
 in a medium like video,

34:08.800 --> 34:10.800
 or if you're writing a textbook

34:10.800 --> 34:12.800
 and you force yourself to put a lot of images,

34:12.800 --> 34:14.800
 is with every image, you're making a choice

34:14.800 --> 34:16.800
 with each choice, you're showing a concrete example.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.800
 With each concrete example,

34:18.800 --> 34:20.800
 you're aiding someone's path to understanding.

34:20.800 --> 34:22.800
 I'm sorry to interrupt you,

34:22.800 --> 34:24.800
 but you just made me realize

34:24.800 --> 34:26.800
 that that's exactly right.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.800
 So the visualizations you're creating

34:28.800 --> 34:30.800
 while you're sometimes talking about abstractions,

34:30.800 --> 34:32.800
 the actual visualization

34:32.800 --> 34:34.800
 is an explicit low level example.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.800
 Yes.

34:36.800 --> 34:38.800
 So there's an actual, like in the code,

34:38.800 --> 34:40.800
 you have to say what the vector is.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.800
 What's the direction of the arrow?

34:42.800 --> 34:44.800
 What's the magnitude?

34:44.800 --> 34:46.800
 Yeah.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.800
 So you're going,

34:48.800 --> 34:50.800
 the visualization itself is actually going to the bottom

34:50.800 --> 34:52.800
 of that.

34:52.800 --> 34:54.800
 And I think that's very important.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.800
 I also think about this a lot in writing scripts

34:56.800 --> 34:58.800
 where even before you get to the visuals,

34:58.800 --> 35:00.800
 the first instinct is to,

35:00.800 --> 35:02.800
 I don't know why, I just always do,

35:02.800 --> 35:04.800
 I say the abstract thing,

35:04.800 --> 35:06.800
 I say the general definition, the powerful thing,

35:06.800 --> 35:08.800
 and then I fill it in with examples later.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.800
 Always, it will be more compelling

35:10.800 --> 35:12.800
 and easier to understand when you flip that.

35:12.800 --> 35:14.800
 And instead, you let someone's brain

35:14.800 --> 35:16.800
 do the pattern recognition.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.800
 You just show them a bunch of examples.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.800
 You're always going to feel a certain similarity between them.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.800
 Then by the time you bring in the definition,

35:22.800 --> 35:24.800
 or by the time you bring in the formula,

35:24.800 --> 35:26.800
 it's articulating a thing

35:26.800 --> 35:28.800
 that's already in the brain

35:28.800 --> 35:30.800
 that was built off of looking at a bunch of examples

35:30.800 --> 35:32.800
 with a certain kind of similarity.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.800
 And what the formula does is articulate

35:34.800 --> 35:36.800
 what that kind of similarity is,

35:36.800 --> 35:38.800
 rather than being

35:38.800 --> 35:40.800
 a high cognitive load

35:40.800 --> 35:42.800
 set of symbols that needs to be

35:42.800 --> 35:44.800
 populated with examples later on,

35:44.800 --> 35:46.800
 assuming someone's still with you.

35:46.800 --> 35:48.800
 What is the most beautiful

35:48.800 --> 35:50.800
 or awe inspiring idea

35:50.800 --> 35:52.800
 you've come across in mathematics?

35:52.800 --> 35:54.800
 I don't know, man.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.800
 Maybe it's an idea you've explored in your videos,

35:56.800 --> 35:58.800
 maybe not.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.800
 What just gave you pause?

36:00.800 --> 36:02.800
 What's the most beautiful idea?

36:02.800 --> 36:04.800
 Small or big.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.800
 So I think often the things that are most beautiful

36:06.800 --> 36:08.800
 are the ones that you

36:08.800 --> 36:10.800
 have a little bit of understanding of,

36:10.800 --> 36:12.800
 but certainly not an entire understanding.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.800
 It's a little bit of that mystery

36:14.800 --> 36:16.800
 that is what makes it beautiful.

36:16.800 --> 36:18.800
 Almost a moment of the discovery

36:18.800 --> 36:20.800
 for you personally, almost just that

36:20.800 --> 36:22.800
 leap of a ha ha moment.

36:22.800 --> 36:24.800
 So something that really caught my eye.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.800
 I remember when I was little,

36:26.800 --> 36:28.800
 there were these like,

36:28.800 --> 36:30.800
 I think the series was called like wooden books

36:30.800 --> 36:32.800
 or something, these tiny little books that

36:32.800 --> 36:34.800
 would have just a very short description of something

36:34.800 --> 36:36.800
 on the left and then a picture on the right.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.800
 I don't know who they're meant for, but maybe it's like

36:38.800 --> 36:40.800
 loosely children or something like that.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.800
 But it can't just be children because of some of the things

36:42.800 --> 36:44.800
 on the last page of one of them,

36:44.800 --> 36:46.800
 somewhere tiny in there was this little formula

36:46.800 --> 36:48.800
 that on the left hand

36:48.800 --> 36:50.800
 had a sum over all of the natural numbers.

36:50.800 --> 36:52.800
 You know, it's like one over

36:52.800 --> 36:54.800
 one to the s plus one over two to the s

36:54.800 --> 36:56.800
 plus one over three to the s on and on to the infinity.

36:56.800 --> 36:58.800
 Then on the other side

36:58.800 --> 37:00.800
 had a product over all of the primes

37:00.800 --> 37:02.800
 and it was a certain thing had to do with all the primes

37:02.800 --> 37:04.800
 and

37:04.800 --> 37:06.800
 like any good young math enthusiast,

37:06.800 --> 37:08.800
 I'd properly been indoctrinated with how chaotic

37:08.800 --> 37:10.800
 and confusing the primes are, which they are

37:10.800 --> 37:12.800
 and seeing this

37:12.800 --> 37:14.800
 equation where on one side you have something

37:14.800 --> 37:16.800
 that's as understandable as you could possibly get

37:16.800 --> 37:18.800
 the counting numbers and on the other side

37:18.800 --> 37:20.800
 is all the prime numbers. It was like this.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.800
 Whoa!

37:22.800 --> 37:24.800
 They're related like this?

37:24.800 --> 37:26.800
 There's a simple description that includes

37:26.800 --> 37:28.800
 all the primes getting wrapped together like this.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.800
 This is like the Euler product

37:30.800 --> 37:32.800
 for the zeta function as I later found out.

37:32.800 --> 37:34.800
 The equation itself

37:34.800 --> 37:36.800
 essentially encodes the fundamental theorem

37:36.800 --> 37:38.800
 of arithmetic that every number can be expressed

37:38.800 --> 37:40.800
 as a unique set of primes.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.800
 To me still,

37:42.800 --> 37:44.800
 I certainly don't understand this equation

37:44.800 --> 37:46.800
 or this function all that well.

37:46.800 --> 37:48.800
 The more I learn about it, the prettier it is.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.800
 The idea that

37:50.800 --> 37:52.800
 this is sort of what gets you

37:52.800 --> 37:54.800
 representations of primes

37:54.800 --> 37:56.800
 not in terms of primes themselves

37:56.800 --> 37:58.800
 but in terms of another set of numbers

37:58.800 --> 38:00.800
 that are like the non trivial zeros of the zeta function.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.800
 Again, I'm very

38:02.800 --> 38:04.800
 kind of in over my head in a lot of ways

38:04.800 --> 38:06.800
 as I try to get to understand it.

38:06.800 --> 38:08.800
 But the more I do,

38:08.800 --> 38:10.800
 it always leaves enough mystery

38:10.800 --> 38:12.800
 that it remains very beautiful to me.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.800
 Whenever there's a little bit of mystery

38:14.800 --> 38:16.800
 just outside of the understanding

38:16.800 --> 38:18.800
 and by the way,

38:18.800 --> 38:20.800
 the process of learning more about it,

38:20.800 --> 38:22.800
 how does that come about?

38:22.800 --> 38:24.800
 Just your own thought or are you

38:24.800 --> 38:26.800
 reading?

38:26.800 --> 38:28.800
 Or is the process of visualization itself

38:28.800 --> 38:30.800
 revealing more to you?

38:30.800 --> 38:32.800
 Visuals help.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.800
 In one time when I was just trying to understand

38:34.800 --> 38:36.800
 utilizing complex functions,

38:36.800 --> 38:38.800
 this is what led to a video

38:38.800 --> 38:40.800
 about this function.

38:40.800 --> 38:42.800
 It's titled something like visualizing the Riemann zeta function.

38:42.800 --> 38:44.800
 It's one that came about because

38:44.800 --> 38:46.800
 I was programming and

38:46.800 --> 38:48.800
 tried to see what a certain thing looked like

38:48.800 --> 38:50.800
 and then I looked at it and I'm like,

38:50.800 --> 38:52.800
 whoa, that's elucidating.

38:52.800 --> 38:54.800
 And then I decided to make a video about it.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.800
 But,

38:56.800 --> 38:58.800
 I mean, you try to

38:58.800 --> 39:00.800
 get your hands on as much reading as you can.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.800
 You,

39:02.800 --> 39:04.800
 if they have like a

39:04.800 --> 39:06.800
 math background of some, like they studied some

39:06.800 --> 39:08.800
 in college or something like that,

39:08.800 --> 39:10.800
 like the Princeton companion to math has a really good article

39:10.800 --> 39:12.800
 on analytic number theory

39:12.800 --> 39:14.800
 and that itself has a whole bunch of references

39:14.800 --> 39:16.800
 and, you know, anything has

39:16.800 --> 39:18.800
 more references and it gives you this, like, tree

39:18.800 --> 39:20.800
 to start plying through.

39:20.800 --> 39:22.800
 And, like, you know, you try to understand,

39:22.800 --> 39:24.800
 I try to understand things visually as I go.

39:24.800 --> 39:26.800
 That's not always possible,

39:26.800 --> 39:28.800
 but it's very helpful when it does.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.800
 You recognize when there's common themes,

39:30.800 --> 39:32.800
 cousins of the Fourier transform,

39:32.800 --> 39:34.800
 like, coming to play,

39:34.800 --> 39:36.800
 and you realize, oh, it's probably pretty important

39:36.800 --> 39:38.800
 to have deep intuitions of the Fourier transform,

39:38.800 --> 39:40.800
 even if it's not explicitly mentioned

39:40.800 --> 39:42.800
 in, like, these texts.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.800
 And you try to get a sense of what the common players are.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.800
 But I'll emphasize again, like,

39:46.800 --> 39:48.800
 I feel very in over my head

39:48.800 --> 39:50.800
 when I try to understand

39:50.800 --> 39:52.800
 the exact relation between,

39:52.800 --> 39:54.800
 like, the zeros of the Riemann Zeta function

39:54.800 --> 39:56.800
 and how they relate to the distribution of primes.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.800
 I definitely understand it better than I did a year ago.

39:58.800 --> 40:00.800
 I definitely understand it one one hundredth

40:00.800 --> 40:02.800
 as well as the experts on the matter do,

40:02.800 --> 40:04.800
 I assume.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.800
 But the slow path

40:06.800 --> 40:08.800
 towards getting there is, it's fun,

40:08.800 --> 40:10.800
 it's charming, and, like, to your question,

40:10.800 --> 40:12.800
 very beautiful.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.800
 And the beauty is in the, what,

40:14.800 --> 40:16.800
 in the journey versus the destination?

40:16.800 --> 40:18.800
 Well, it's that each thing doesn't feel arbitrary.

40:18.800 --> 40:20.800
 I think that's a big part.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.800
 Is that you have these unpredictable,

40:22.800 --> 40:24.800
 yeah, these very unpredictable patterns

40:24.800 --> 40:26.800
 where these intricate

40:26.800 --> 40:28.800
 properties of, like, a certain function.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.800
 But at the same time, it doesn't feel like

40:30.800 --> 40:32.800
 humans ever made an arbitrary choice

40:32.800 --> 40:34.800
 in studying this particular thing.

40:34.800 --> 40:36.800
 So, you know, it feels like

40:36.800 --> 40:38.800
 you're speaking to patterns themselves

40:38.800 --> 40:40.800
 or nature itself.

40:40.800 --> 40:42.800
 That's a big part of it.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.800
 I think things that are too arbitrary,

40:44.800 --> 40:46.800
 it's just hard for those to feel beautiful because

40:46.800 --> 40:48.800
 this is sort of what the word

40:48.800 --> 40:50.800
 contrived is meant to apply to, right?

40:52.800 --> 40:54.800
 And when they're not arbitrary,

40:54.800 --> 40:56.800
 it means it could be

40:56.800 --> 40:58.800
 you can have a clean

40:58.800 --> 41:00.800
 abstraction

41:00.800 --> 41:02.800
 and intuition

41:02.800 --> 41:04.800
 that allows you to comprehend it.

41:04.800 --> 41:06.800
 Well, to one of your first questions,

41:06.800 --> 41:08.800
 it makes you feel like if you came across

41:08.800 --> 41:10.800
 another intelligent civilization,

41:10.800 --> 41:12.800
 that they'd be studying the same thing.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.800
 Maybe with different notation.

41:14.800 --> 41:16.800
 Certainly, yeah.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.800
 I think you talked to that other civilization.

41:18.800 --> 41:20.800
 They're probably also studying the zeroes

41:20.800 --> 41:22.800
 of the Riemann Zeta function.

41:22.800 --> 41:24.800
 There's some variant thereof

41:24.800 --> 41:26.800
 that is like a

41:26.800 --> 41:28.800
 clearly equivalent cousin or something like that.

41:28.800 --> 41:30.800
 But that's probably on their

41:30.800 --> 41:32.800
 docket.

41:32.800 --> 41:34.800
 Whenever somebody does a lot of something

41:34.800 --> 41:36.800
 amazing,

41:36.800 --> 41:38.800
 I'm going to ask the question

41:38.800 --> 41:40.800
 that you've already been asked a lot,

41:40.800 --> 41:42.800
 that you'll get more and more asked in your life.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.800
 But what was your favorite

41:44.800 --> 41:46.800
 video to create?

41:46.800 --> 41:48.800
 Oh, favorite to create.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.800
 One of my favorites is

41:50.800 --> 41:52.800
 the title is Who Cares about Topology.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.800
 Do you want me to pull it up?

41:54.800 --> 41:56.800
 If you want, sure.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.800
 It is about

41:58.800 --> 42:00.800
 it starts by describing

42:00.800 --> 42:02.800
 an unsolved problem that's still unsolved in math

42:02.800 --> 42:04.800
 called the inscribed square problem.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.800
 You draw any loop and then you ask,

42:06.800 --> 42:08.800
 are there four points on that loop that make a square?

42:08.800 --> 42:10.800
 Totally useless, right? This is not

42:10.800 --> 42:12.800
 answering any physical questions.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.800
 It's mostly interesting that we can't answer that question.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.800
 And it seems like such a natural thing to ask.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.800
 Now, if you

42:18.800 --> 42:20.800
 weaken it a little bit and you ask,

42:20.800 --> 42:22.800
 can you always find a rectangle?

42:22.800 --> 42:24.800
 You choose four points on this curve.

42:24.800 --> 42:26.800
 Can you find a rectangle? That's hard.

42:26.800 --> 42:28.800
 But it's doable and the path to it

42:28.800 --> 42:30.800
 involves

42:30.800 --> 42:32.800
 things like looking at a

42:32.800 --> 42:34.800
 torus, this surface with a single hole in it,

42:34.800 --> 42:36.800
 like a donut, or looking at a mobius strip

42:36.800 --> 42:38.800
 in ways that feel so much less contrived

42:38.800 --> 42:40.800
 to when I first,

42:40.800 --> 42:42.800
 as like a little kid, learned about these surfaces

42:42.800 --> 42:44.800
 and shapes, like a mobius strip and a torus.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.800
 Like what you learn is,

42:46.800 --> 42:48.800
 oh, this mobius strip, you take a piece of paper,

42:48.800 --> 42:50.800
 put a twist, glue it together,

42:50.800 --> 42:52.800
 and now you have a shape with one edge and just one side.

42:52.800 --> 42:54.800
 And

42:54.800 --> 42:56.800
 as a student, you should think,

42:56.800 --> 42:58.800
 who cares, right?

42:58.800 --> 43:00.800
 How does that help me solve any problems?

43:00.800 --> 43:02.800
 I thought math was about problem solving.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.800
 So what I liked about

43:04.800 --> 43:06.800
 the piece of math that this was describing

43:06.800 --> 43:08.800
 that was in this paper

43:08.800 --> 43:10.800
 by a mathematician named Vaughn,

43:10.800 --> 43:12.800
 was that it arises very naturally.

43:12.800 --> 43:14.800
 It's clear what it represents.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.800
 It's not just doing something.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.800
 It's not just playing with construction paper.

43:18.800 --> 43:20.800
 And the way that it solves the problem

43:20.800 --> 43:22.800
 is really beautiful.

43:22.800 --> 43:24.800
 So kind of putting all of that down

43:24.800 --> 43:26.800
 and concretizing it, right?

43:26.800 --> 43:28.800
 Like I was talking about how

43:28.800 --> 43:30.800
 when you have to put visuals to it,

43:30.800 --> 43:32.800
 it demands that what's on screen is a very specific

43:32.800 --> 43:34.800
 example of what you're describing.

43:34.800 --> 43:36.800
 The construction here is very abstract in nature.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.800
 You describe this very abstract kind of surface

43:38.800 --> 43:40.800
 in 3D space.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.800
 So then when I was finding myself,

43:42.800 --> 43:44.800
 a graph that's built into OSX

43:44.800 --> 43:46.800
 for the 3D stuff,

43:46.800 --> 43:48.800
 to draw that surface,

43:48.800 --> 43:50.800
 you realize, oh man, the topology argument

43:50.800 --> 43:52.800
 is very nonconstructive.

43:52.800 --> 43:54.800
 You have to do a lot of extra work

43:54.800 --> 43:56.800
 in order to make the surface show up.

43:56.800 --> 43:58.800
 But then once you see it, it's quite pretty

43:58.800 --> 44:00.800
 and it's very satisfying to see a specific instance of it.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.800
 And you also feel like,

44:02.800 --> 44:04.800
 ah, I've actually added something

44:04.800 --> 44:06.800
 on top of what the original paper was doing,

44:06.800 --> 44:08.800
 that it shows something that's completely correct.

44:08.800 --> 44:10.800
 It's a very beautiful argument,

44:10.800 --> 44:12.800
 but you don't see what it looks like.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.800
 And I found something satisfying

44:14.800 --> 44:16.800
 in seeing what it looked like

44:16.800 --> 44:18.800
 that could only ever come about from the forcing function

44:18.800 --> 44:20.800
 of getting some kind of image on the screen

44:20.800 --> 44:22.800
 to describe the thing I was talking about.

44:22.800 --> 44:24.800
 So you almost weren't able to anticipate what it's going to look like.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.800
 I had no idea.

44:26.800 --> 44:28.800
 And it was wonderful.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.800
 It looks like a Sydney Opera House

44:30.800 --> 44:32.800
 or some sort of Frank Gary design.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.800
 You knew it was going to be something

44:34.800 --> 44:36.800
 and you can say various things about it,

44:36.800 --> 44:38.800
 like, oh, it touches the curve itself.

44:38.800 --> 44:40.800
 It has a boundary that's this curve on the 2D plane.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.800
 It all sits above the plane.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.800
 But before you actually draw it,

44:44.800 --> 44:46.800
 it's very unclear what the thing will look like.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.800
 And to see it, it's very,

44:48.800 --> 44:50.800
 it's just pleasing, right?

44:50.800 --> 44:52.800
 So that was fun to make, very fun to share.

44:52.800 --> 44:54.800
 I hope that it has elucidated

44:54.800 --> 44:56.800
 for some people out there

44:56.800 --> 44:58.800
 where these constructs of topology come from,

44:58.800 --> 45:00.800
 that it's not arbitrary play

45:00.800 --> 45:02.800
 with construction paper.

45:02.800 --> 45:04.800
 So let's, I think this is a good,

45:04.800 --> 45:06.800
 a good sort of example

45:06.800 --> 45:08.800
 to talk a little bit about your process.

45:08.800 --> 45:10.800
 So you have a list of ideas.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.800
 So that's sort of the

45:12.800 --> 45:14.800
 the curse of having

45:14.800 --> 45:16.800
 having an active and brilliant mind

45:16.800 --> 45:18.800
 is I'm sure you have a list

45:18.800 --> 45:20.800
 that's growing faster than you can utilize.

45:20.800 --> 45:22.800
 Now on the head.

45:22.800 --> 45:24.800
 Absolutely.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.800
 But there's some sorting procedure

45:26.800 --> 45:28.800
 depending on mood and interest and so on.

45:28.800 --> 45:30.800
 But okay, so you pick an idea

45:30.800 --> 45:32.800
 and then you have to try

45:32.800 --> 45:34.800
 to write a narrative arc

45:34.800 --> 45:36.800
 that's sort of

45:36.800 --> 45:38.800
 how do I elucidate out?

45:38.800 --> 45:40.800
 How do I make this idea beautiful

45:40.800 --> 45:42.800
 and clear and explain it?

45:42.800 --> 45:44.800
 And then there's a set of visualizations

45:44.800 --> 45:46.800
 that will be attached to it.

45:46.800 --> 45:48.800
 You've talked about some of this before

45:48.800 --> 45:50.800
 about sort of writing the story

45:50.800 --> 45:52.800
 attaching the visualizations.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.800
 Can you talk through

45:54.800 --> 45:56.800
 interesting, painful,

45:56.800 --> 45:58.800
 beautiful parts of that process?

45:58.800 --> 46:00.800
 Well, the most painful is

46:00.800 --> 46:02.800
 if you've chosen a topic that you do want to do,

46:02.800 --> 46:04.800
 but then it's hard to think of

46:04.800 --> 46:06.800
 I guess how to structure the script.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.800
 This is

46:08.800 --> 46:10.800
 sort of where I have been on one for like

46:10.800 --> 46:12.800
 the last two or three months and I think

46:12.800 --> 46:14.800
 ultimately the right resolution is just like set it aside

46:14.800 --> 46:16.800
 and instead do some other things

46:16.800 --> 46:18.800
 where the script comes more naturally.

46:18.800 --> 46:20.800
 Because you sort of don't want to overwork

46:20.800 --> 46:22.800
 a narrative

46:22.800 --> 46:24.800
 that the more you've thought about it

46:24.800 --> 46:26.800
 the less you can empathize with the student

46:26.800 --> 46:28.800
 who doesn't yet understand the thing you're trying to teach.

46:28.800 --> 46:30.800
 Who is the judge in your head?

46:30.800 --> 46:32.800
 Sort of the person,

46:32.800 --> 46:34.800
 the creature,

46:34.800 --> 46:36.800
 the essence that's saying

46:36.800 --> 46:38.800
 this sucks or this is good.

46:38.800 --> 46:40.800
 And you mentioned kind of the student

46:40.800 --> 46:42.800
 you're thinking about.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.800
 Who is that?

46:44.800 --> 46:46.800
 What is that thing?

46:46.800 --> 46:48.800
 That says the perfectionist

46:48.800 --> 46:50.800
 that says this thing sucks

46:50.800 --> 46:52.800
 you need to work on it for another two, three months.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.800
 I don't know.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.800
 I think it's my past self.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.800
 I think that's the entity that I'm most trying to empathize with

46:58.800 --> 47:00.800
 is like you take

47:00.800 --> 47:02.800
 because that's kind of the only person I know.

47:02.800 --> 47:04.800
 You don't really know anyone other than versions of yourself.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.800
 So I start with the version of myself

47:06.800 --> 47:08.800
 that I know who doesn't yet understand the thing.

47:08.800 --> 47:10.800
 And then

47:10.800 --> 47:12.800
 I just try to

47:12.800 --> 47:14.800
 view it with fresh eyes

47:14.800 --> 47:16.800
 a particular visual or a particular script.

47:16.800 --> 47:18.800
 Is this motivating? Does this make sense?

47:18.800 --> 47:20.800
 Which has its downsides

47:20.800 --> 47:22.800
 because sometimes I find myself

47:22.800 --> 47:24.800
 speaking to motivations

47:24.800 --> 47:26.800
 that only myself

47:26.800 --> 47:28.800
 would be interested in.

47:28.800 --> 47:30.800
 I did this project on quaternions

47:30.800 --> 47:32.800
 where what I really wanted

47:32.800 --> 47:34.800
 was to understand what are they doing in four dimensions.

47:34.800 --> 47:36.800
 Can we see what they're doing in four dimensions?

47:36.800 --> 47:38.800
 And I

47:38.800 --> 47:40.800
 had a way of thinking about it

47:40.800 --> 47:42.800
 that really answered the question in my head

47:42.800 --> 47:44.800
 that made me very satisfied and being able to think about

47:44.800 --> 47:46.800
 concretely with a 3D visual

47:46.800 --> 47:48.800
 what are they doing to a 4D sphere?

47:48.800 --> 47:50.800
 And so I'm like great this is exactly what my past self

47:50.800 --> 47:52.800
 would have wanted and I make a thing on it

47:52.800 --> 47:54.800
 and I'm sure it's what some other people wanted too.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.800
 But in hindsight I think most people

47:56.800 --> 47:58.800
 who want to learn about quaternions

47:58.800 --> 48:00.800
 are robotics engineers

48:00.800 --> 48:02.800
 or graphics programmers

48:02.800 --> 48:04.800
 who want to understand how they're used

48:04.800 --> 48:06.800
 to describe 3D rotations

48:06.800 --> 48:08.800
 and their use case was actually a little bit different

48:08.800 --> 48:10.800
 than my past self and in that way

48:10.800 --> 48:12.800
 I wouldn't actually recommend that video to

48:12.800 --> 48:14.800
 people who are coming at it from that angle

48:14.800 --> 48:16.800
 of wanting to know hey I'm a robotics programmer

48:16.800 --> 48:18.800
 how do these quaternion things

48:18.800 --> 48:20.800
 work to describe

48:20.800 --> 48:22.800
 position in 3D space.

48:22.800 --> 48:24.800
 I would say other great resources

48:24.800 --> 48:26.800
 for that if you ever find yourself

48:26.800 --> 48:28.800
 wanting to say like but hang on

48:28.800 --> 48:30.800
 in what sense are they acting in 4 dimensions

48:30.800 --> 48:32.800
 then come back but until then

48:32.800 --> 48:34.800
 it's a little different.

48:34.800 --> 48:36.800
 Yeah it's interesting because

48:36.800 --> 48:38.800
 you have incredible videos on neural networks

48:38.800 --> 48:40.800
 for example and from my sort of

48:40.800 --> 48:42.800
 perspective because I've probably

48:42.800 --> 48:44.800
 I mean I looked at the

48:44.800 --> 48:46.800
 it is sort of my field

48:46.800 --> 48:48.800
 and I've also looked at the basic

48:48.800 --> 48:50.800
 introduction of neural networks like a million

48:50.800 --> 48:52.800
 times from different perspectives

48:52.800 --> 48:54.800
 and it made me realize that there's a lot of ways

48:54.800 --> 48:56.800
 to present it so if you were sort of

48:56.800 --> 48:58.800
 you did an incredible job

48:58.800 --> 49:00.800
 I mean sort of the

49:00.800 --> 49:02.800
 but you could also do it

49:02.800 --> 49:04.800
 differently and also incredible

49:04.800 --> 49:06.800
 like to create

49:06.800 --> 49:08.800
 a beautiful presentation

49:08.800 --> 49:10.800
 of a basic concept

49:10.800 --> 49:12.800
 is requires sort of

49:12.800 --> 49:14.800
 creativity requires genius

49:14.800 --> 49:16.800
 and so on but you can take it

49:16.800 --> 49:18.800
 from a bunch of different perspectives

49:18.800 --> 49:20.800
 and you realize that

49:20.800 --> 49:22.800
 and just as you're saying

49:22.800 --> 49:24.800
 you kind of have a certain mindset

49:24.800 --> 49:26.800
 a certain view but

49:26.800 --> 49:28.800
 if you take a different view

49:28.800 --> 49:30.800
 from a physics perspective

49:30.800 --> 49:32.800
 from a neuroscience

49:32.800 --> 49:34.800
 perspective talking about neural networks

49:34.800 --> 49:36.800
 or from

49:36.800 --> 49:38.800
 a robotics perspective

49:38.800 --> 49:40.800
 or from let's see

49:40.800 --> 49:42.800
 from a pure learning theory

49:42.800 --> 49:44.800
 statistics perspective so you can create

49:44.800 --> 49:46.800
 totally different videos

49:46.800 --> 49:48.800
 with a few actually concepts

49:48.800 --> 49:50.800
 where you have taken different concepts

49:50.800 --> 49:52.800
 at the

49:52.800 --> 49:54.800
 at the Euler equation

49:54.800 --> 49:56.800
 you've taken different views of that

49:56.800 --> 49:58.800
 I think I've made three videos on it

49:58.800 --> 50:00.800
 and I definitely will make at least one more

50:00.800 --> 50:02.800
 never enough

50:02.800 --> 50:04.800
 never enough so you don't think it's

50:04.800 --> 50:06.800
 the most beautiful equation in mathematics

50:06.800 --> 50:08.800
 like I said

50:08.800 --> 50:10.800
 as we represent it it's one of the most hideous

50:10.800 --> 50:12.800
 it involves a lot of the most hideous

50:12.800 --> 50:14.800
 aspects of our notation I talked about E

50:14.800 --> 50:16.800
 the fact that we use pi instead of tau

50:16.800 --> 50:18.800
 the fact that we

50:18.800 --> 50:20.800
 call imaginary numbers imaginary

50:20.800 --> 50:22.800
 and then actually wonder

50:22.800 --> 50:24.800
 if we use the I because of imaginary

50:24.800 --> 50:26.800
 I don't know if that's historically accurate

50:26.800 --> 50:28.800
 but at least a lot of people they read the I

50:28.800 --> 50:30.800
 and they think imaginary

50:30.800 --> 50:32.800
 like all three of those facts it's like

50:32.800 --> 50:34.800
 those are things that have added more confusion than they needed to

50:34.800 --> 50:36.800
 and we're wrapping them up in one equation

50:36.800 --> 50:38.800
 like boy that's just very hideous

50:38.800 --> 50:40.800
 the ideas that it does

50:40.800 --> 50:42.800
 tie together when you wash away the notation

50:42.800 --> 50:44.800
 it's pretty it's nice

50:44.800 --> 50:46.800
 but it's not like

50:46.800 --> 50:48.800
 mind blowing greatest thing in the universe

50:48.800 --> 50:50.800
 which is maybe what I was thinking of when I said

50:50.800 --> 50:52.800
 like once you understand

50:52.800 --> 50:54.800
 something it doesn't have the same

50:54.800 --> 50:56.800
 beauty like I feel like I understand

50:56.800 --> 50:58.800
 Euler's formula

50:58.800 --> 51:00.800
 and I feel like I understand it enough to

51:00.800 --> 51:02.800
 sort of see the

51:02.800 --> 51:04.800
 the version that just woke up

51:04.800 --> 51:06.800
 that hasn't really gotten itself dressed

51:06.800 --> 51:08.800
 in the morning that's a little bit groggy and there's

51:08.800 --> 51:10.800
 bags under its eyes

51:10.800 --> 51:12.800
 you're past the dating

51:12.800 --> 51:14.800
 stage and you're no longer dating

51:14.800 --> 51:16.800
 I'm still dating the Zeta function

51:16.800 --> 51:18.800
 and she's beautiful

51:18.800 --> 51:20.800
 and we have fun

51:20.800 --> 51:22.800
 and it's that high dopamine part

51:22.800 --> 51:24.800
 but maybe at some point we'll settle into

51:24.800 --> 51:26.800
 the more mundane nature of the relationship

51:26.800 --> 51:28.800
 where I see her for who she truly is

51:28.800 --> 51:30.800
 and she'll still be beautiful in her own way

51:30.800 --> 51:32.800
 but it won't have the same romantic

51:32.800 --> 51:34.800
 pizzazz

51:34.800 --> 51:36.800
 that's the nice thing about mathematics

51:36.800 --> 51:38.800
 as long as you don't live forever

51:38.800 --> 51:40.800
 there will always be

51:40.800 --> 51:42.800
 enough mystery and fun with some of the equations

51:42.800 --> 51:44.800
 even if you do

51:44.800 --> 51:46.800
 the rate at which questions comes up is much faster

51:46.800 --> 51:48.800
 than the rate at which answers come up so

51:48.800 --> 51:50.800
 if you could live forever would you

51:50.800 --> 51:52.800
 I think so yeah

51:52.800 --> 51:54.800
 you don't think mortality is the thing that makes life

51:54.800 --> 51:56.800
 meaningful

51:56.800 --> 51:58.800
 would your life be four times as meaningful

51:58.800 --> 52:00.800
 if you died at 25

52:00.800 --> 52:02.800
 so this goes to infinity

52:02.800 --> 52:04.800
 I think you and I

52:04.800 --> 52:06.800
 that's really interesting so what I said is infinite

52:06.800 --> 52:08.800
 not four times longer

52:08.800 --> 52:10.800
 it's an infinite

52:10.800 --> 52:12.800
 so the actual existence

52:12.800 --> 52:14.800
 of the finiteness

52:14.800 --> 52:16.800
 the existence of the end

52:16.800 --> 52:18.800
 no matter the length

52:18.800 --> 52:20.800
 is the thing that may

52:20.800 --> 52:22.800
 for my comprehension of psychology

52:22.800 --> 52:24.800
 it's such a deeply

52:24.800 --> 52:26.800
 human

52:26.800 --> 52:28.800
 it's such a fundamental part of the human condition

52:28.800 --> 52:30.800
 the fact that we're mortal

52:30.800 --> 52:32.800
 that

52:32.800 --> 52:34.800
 the fact that things end

52:34.800 --> 52:36.800
 seems to be a crucial part of what gives them

52:36.800 --> 52:38.800
 meaning

52:38.800 --> 52:40.800
 at least for me

52:40.800 --> 52:42.800
 it's a very small percentage of my time

52:42.800 --> 52:44.800
 that mortality is salient

52:44.800 --> 52:46.800
 that I'm aware of the end of my life

52:46.800 --> 52:48.800
 what do you mean by me

52:48.800 --> 52:50.800
 I'm trolling

52:50.800 --> 52:52.800
 is it the ego, is it the id

52:52.800 --> 52:54.800
 or is it the superego

52:54.800 --> 52:56.800
 the reflective self

52:56.800 --> 52:58.800
 the vernici's area that puts all this stuff

52:58.800 --> 53:00.800
 into words

53:00.800 --> 53:02.800
 a small percentage of your mind

53:02.800 --> 53:04.800
 is actually aware of the true

53:04.800 --> 53:06.800
 motivations that drive you

53:06.800 --> 53:08.800
 but my point is that most of my life

53:08.800 --> 53:10.800
 I'm not thinking about death

53:10.800 --> 53:12.800
 but I still feel very motivated to make things

53:12.800 --> 53:14.800
 and to interact with people

53:14.800 --> 53:16.800
 like experience love or things like that

53:16.800 --> 53:18.800
 I'm very motivated

53:18.800 --> 53:20.800
 and it's strange that that motivation comes

53:20.800 --> 53:22.800
 while death is not in my mind at all

53:22.800 --> 53:24.800
 and this might just be because I'm young enough

53:24.800 --> 53:26.800
 that it's not salient

53:26.800 --> 53:28.800
 or it's in your subconscious

53:28.800 --> 53:30.800
 or that you construct an illusion

53:30.800 --> 53:32.800
 of reality by enjoying the moment

53:32.800 --> 53:34.800
 sort of the existential approach life

53:34.800 --> 53:36.800
 could be

53:36.800 --> 53:38.800
 gun to my head, I don't think that's it

53:38.800 --> 53:40.800
 another sort of way to say gun to the head

53:40.800 --> 53:42.800
 is sort of the deep psychological

53:42.800 --> 53:44.800
 introspection of what drives us

53:44.800 --> 53:46.800
 in some ways to me

53:46.800 --> 53:48.800
 when I look at math, when I look at science

53:48.800 --> 53:50.800
 is it kind of an escape from reality

53:50.800 --> 53:52.800
 in a sense that

53:52.800 --> 53:54.800
 it's so beautiful

53:54.800 --> 53:56.800
 it's such a beautiful

53:56.800 --> 53:58.800
 journey of discovery

53:58.800 --> 54:00.800
 that it allows you to actually

54:00.800 --> 54:02.800
 it allows you to achieve

54:02.800 --> 54:04.800
 a kind of immortality

54:04.800 --> 54:06.800
 of

54:06.800 --> 54:08.800
 explore ideas

54:08.800 --> 54:10.800
 and sort of connect yourself to the thing

54:10.800 --> 54:12.800
 that is seemingly infinite

54:12.800 --> 54:14.800
 like the universe

54:14.800 --> 54:16.800
 that it allows you to escape

54:16.800 --> 54:18.800
 the limited nature

54:18.800 --> 54:20.800
 of our little

54:20.800 --> 54:22.800
 of our bodies, of our existence

54:22.800 --> 54:24.800
 what else would give this podcast meaning?

54:24.800 --> 54:26.800
 that's right

54:26.800 --> 54:28.800
 the fact that it will end

54:28.800 --> 54:30.800
 this place closes in 40 minutes

54:30.800 --> 54:32.800
 and it's so much more meaningful for it

54:32.800 --> 54:34.800
 how much more

54:34.800 --> 54:36.800
 I love this room because we'll be kicked out

54:36.800 --> 54:38.800
 so

54:38.800 --> 54:40.800
 I understand

54:40.800 --> 54:42.800
 just because you're trolling me

54:42.800 --> 54:44.800
 doesn't mean I'm wrong

54:44.800 --> 54:46.800
 so

54:46.800 --> 54:48.800
 but I take your point

54:48.800 --> 54:50.800
 boy that would be a good Twitter bio

54:50.800 --> 54:52.800
 just because

54:52.800 --> 54:54.800
 you're trolling me doesn't mean I'm wrong

54:54.800 --> 54:56.800
 and

54:56.800 --> 54:58.800
 difference in backgrounds

54:58.800 --> 55:00.800
 I'm a bit Russian so we're a bit

55:00.800 --> 55:02.800
 melancholic and seem to maybe

55:02.800 --> 55:04.800
 assign a little too much value to

55:04.800 --> 55:06.800
 suffering immortality and things like that

55:06.800 --> 55:08.800
 makes for a better novel I think

55:08.800 --> 55:10.800
 oh yeah, you need

55:10.800 --> 55:12.800
 some sort of existential threat

55:12.800 --> 55:14.800
 to drive a plot

55:14.800 --> 55:16.800
 so when do you know when the video is done

55:16.800 --> 55:18.800
 when you're working on it?

55:18.800 --> 55:20.800
 that's pretty easy actually

55:20.800 --> 55:22.800
 because

55:22.800 --> 55:24.800
 I'll write the script

55:24.800 --> 55:26.800
 I want there to be some kind of aha moment

55:26.800 --> 55:28.800
 and then hopefully the script can revolve around

55:28.800 --> 55:30.800
 some kind of aha moment

55:30.800 --> 55:32.800
 and then from there you're putting visuals

55:32.800 --> 55:34.800
 to each sentence that exists

55:34.800 --> 55:36.800
 and then you narrate it, you edit it all together

55:36.800 --> 55:38.800
 so given that there's a script

55:38.800 --> 55:40.800
 the end becomes quite clear

55:40.800 --> 55:42.800
 and as I

55:42.800 --> 55:44.800
 animate it I often change

55:44.800 --> 55:46.800
 certainly the specific words

55:46.800 --> 55:48.800
 but sometimes the structure itself

55:48.800 --> 55:50.800
 but it's a very

55:50.800 --> 55:52.800
 deterministic process at that point

55:52.800 --> 55:54.800
 it makes it much easier to predict when something

55:54.800 --> 55:56.800
 will be done. How do you know when a script is

55:56.800 --> 55:58.800
 done? For problem solving videos

55:58.800 --> 56:00.800
 that's quite simple, it's once you feel

56:00.800 --> 56:02.800
 like someone who didn't understand the solution now

56:02.800 --> 56:04.800
 could. For things like neural networks

56:04.800 --> 56:06.800
 that was a lot harder because like you said

56:06.800 --> 56:08.800
 there's so many angles at which you could attack it

56:08.800 --> 56:10.800
 and there it's

56:10.800 --> 56:12.800
 just at some point you feel like

56:12.800 --> 56:14.800
 this asks

56:14.800 --> 56:16.800
 a meaningful question and it answers that question

56:16.800 --> 56:18.800
 right?

56:18.800 --> 56:20.800
 What is the best way to learn math for people

56:20.800 --> 56:22.800
 who might be at the beginning of that journey?

56:22.800 --> 56:24.800
 I think that's a question that a lot of folks

56:24.800 --> 56:26.800
 kind of ask and think about

56:26.800 --> 56:28.800
 and it doesn't even for folks who are not really

56:28.800 --> 56:30.800
 at the beginning of their journey

56:30.800 --> 56:32.800
 there might be actually

56:32.800 --> 56:34.800
 deep in their career

56:34.800 --> 56:36.800
 type of technology taking calculus and so on

56:36.800 --> 56:38.800
 but still want to sort of explore math

56:38.800 --> 56:40.800
 what would be your advice

56:40.800 --> 56:42.800
 instead of education at all ages?

56:42.800 --> 56:44.800
 Your temptation will be to

56:44.800 --> 56:46.800
 spend more time like watching lectures

56:46.800 --> 56:48.800
 reading

56:48.800 --> 56:50.800
 try to force yourself to do more problems

56:50.800 --> 56:52.800
 than you naturally would.

56:52.800 --> 56:54.800
 That's a big one.

56:54.800 --> 56:56.800
 The focus time that you're spending should be

56:56.800 --> 56:58.800
 on solving specific problems

56:58.800 --> 57:00.800
 and seek entities that have well

57:00.800 --> 57:02.800
 curated lists of problems.

57:02.800 --> 57:04.800
 So going to like a textbook almost

57:04.800 --> 57:06.800
 and the problems in the back of a textbook

57:06.800 --> 57:08.800
 and the back of a chapter.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.800
 So if you can take a little look through those

57:10.800 --> 57:12.800
 questions at the end of the chapter before you read the chapter

57:12.800 --> 57:14.800
 a lot of them won't make sense. Some of them might

57:14.800 --> 57:16.800
 those are the best ones to think about.

57:16.800 --> 57:18.800
 A lot of them won't but just take a quick look

57:18.800 --> 57:20.800
 and then read a little bit of the chapter and then maybe

57:20.800 --> 57:22.800
 take a look again and things like that.

57:22.800 --> 57:24.800
 And don't consider yourself done with the chapter

57:24.800 --> 57:26.800
 until you've actually worked

57:26.800 --> 57:28.800
 through a couple exercises.

57:28.800 --> 57:30.800
 And this is so hypocritical

57:30.800 --> 57:32.800
 because I put out videos that

57:32.800 --> 57:34.800
 pretty much never have associated

57:34.800 --> 57:36.800
 exercises. I just view myself

57:36.800 --> 57:38.800
 as a different part of the ecosystem

57:38.800 --> 57:40.800
 which means I'm kind of admitting

57:40.800 --> 57:42.800
 that you're not really learning

57:42.800 --> 57:44.800
 or at least this is only a partial part

57:44.800 --> 57:46.800
 of the learning process if you're watching these videos.

57:48.800 --> 57:50.800
 I think if someone's at the very beginning

57:50.800 --> 57:52.800
 like I do think Khan Academy does a good job

57:52.800 --> 57:54.800
 they have a pretty large set of

57:54.800 --> 57:56.800
 questions you can work through.

57:56.800 --> 57:58.800
 Just a very basic sort of

57:58.800 --> 58:00.800
 just picking up getting comfortable

58:00.800 --> 58:02.800
 with a very basic linear algebra or calculus

58:02.800 --> 58:04.800
 on Khan Academy.

58:04.800 --> 58:06.800
 Programming is actually I think a great

58:06.800 --> 58:08.800
 like learn to program and like

58:08.800 --> 58:10.800
 let the way that math is motivated from that

58:10.800 --> 58:12.800
 through. I know a lot of people who

58:12.800 --> 58:14.800
 didn't like math got into programming

58:14.800 --> 58:16.800
 in some way and that's what turned them on to math.

58:16.800 --> 58:18.800
 Maybe I'm biased because like I live in the Bay Area

58:18.800 --> 58:20.800
 so I'm more likely to run into someone

58:20.800 --> 58:22.800
 who has that phenotype

58:22.800 --> 58:24.800
 but I am

58:24.800 --> 58:26.800
 willing to speculate that that is a more generalizable path.

58:26.800 --> 58:28.800
 So you yourself

58:28.800 --> 58:30.800
 kind of in creating videos are using

58:30.800 --> 58:32.800
 programming to illuminate a concept

58:32.800 --> 58:34.800
 but for yourself as well.

58:34.800 --> 58:36.800
 So would you recommend somebody try to

58:36.800 --> 58:38.800
 make a sort of almost like

58:38.800 --> 58:40.800
 try to make videos?

58:40.800 --> 58:42.800
 So one thing I've heard before

58:42.800 --> 58:44.800
 I don't know if this is based on any actual study

58:44.800 --> 58:46.800
 this might be like a total fictional anecdote of

58:46.800 --> 58:48.800
 numbers but it rings in the mind as

58:48.800 --> 58:50.800
 being true. You remember about 10%

58:50.800 --> 58:52.800
 of what you read. You remember about 20%

58:52.800 --> 58:54.800
 of what you listen to. You remember

58:54.800 --> 58:56.800
 about 70% of what you actively interact

58:56.800 --> 58:58.800
 with in some way and then about 90%

58:58.800 --> 59:00.800
 of what you teach.

59:00.800 --> 59:02.800
 I think I heard again those numbers might be

59:02.800 --> 59:04.800
 meaningless but they ring true don't they?

59:04.800 --> 59:06.800
 I'm willing to say I

59:06.800 --> 59:08.800
 learned nine times better from teaching something

59:08.800 --> 59:10.800
 than reading. That might even be a low ball.

59:10.800 --> 59:12.800
 So doing something to teach

59:12.800 --> 59:14.800
 or to like actively try to explain things

59:14.800 --> 59:16.800
 is huge for consolidating the knowledge.

59:16.800 --> 59:18.800
 Outside of family and friends

59:18.800 --> 59:20.800
 is there a moment you can

59:20.800 --> 59:22.800
 remember that you would like

59:22.800 --> 59:24.800
 to relive because it made you truly happy

59:24.800 --> 59:26.800
 or it was

59:26.800 --> 59:28.800
 transformative in some

59:28.800 --> 59:30.800
 fundamental way? A moment that was

59:30.800 --> 59:32.800
 transformative.

59:32.800 --> 59:34.800
 Or made you truly happy?

59:34.800 --> 59:36.800
 Yeah, I think there's times

59:36.800 --> 59:38.800
 music used to be a much bigger part of my life

59:38.800 --> 59:40.800
 than it is now. Like when I was a

59:40.800 --> 59:42.800
 teenager and I can think of

59:42.800 --> 59:44.800
 sometimes in like playing music

59:44.800 --> 59:46.800
 there was one

59:46.800 --> 59:48.800
 my brother and a friend of mine so this

59:48.800 --> 59:50.800
 slightly violates the family and friends but

59:50.800 --> 59:52.800
 there was music that made me happy. They were just

59:52.800 --> 59:54.800
 accompanying.

59:54.800 --> 59:56.800
 We played a gig at a ski resort

59:56.800 --> 59:58.800
 such that you take a gondola

59:58.800 --> 1:00:00.800
 to the top and did a thing

1:00:00.800 --> 1:00:02.800
 and then on the gondola right down we decided to just jam

1:00:02.800 --> 1:00:04.800
 a little bit and

1:00:04.800 --> 1:00:06.800
 it was just like, I don't know, the gondola

1:00:06.800 --> 1:00:08.800
 sort of over came over a mountain

1:00:08.800 --> 1:00:10.800
 and you saw the city lights

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:12.800
 and we're just like jamming, like playing some

1:00:12.800 --> 1:00:14.800
 music. I wouldn't describe that as

1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:16.800
 transformative. I don't know why

1:00:16.800 --> 1:00:18.800
 but that popped into my mind as a moment of

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:20.800
 in a way that wasn't associated

1:00:20.800 --> 1:00:22.800
 with people I love but more with like a thing

1:00:22.800 --> 1:00:24.800
 I was doing, something that was

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:26.800
 just, it was just happy and it was just like

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:28.800
 a great moment.

1:00:28.800 --> 1:00:30.800
 I don't think I can give you anything deeper than

1:00:30.800 --> 1:00:32.800
 that though. Well as a musician

1:00:32.800 --> 1:00:34.800
 myself, I'd love to see

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:36.800
 as you mentioned before

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:38.800
 music enter back into your work

1:00:38.800 --> 1:00:40.800
 back into your creative work. I'd love to see that

1:00:40.800 --> 1:00:42.800
 I'm certainly allowing it

1:00:42.800 --> 1:00:44.800
 to enter back into mine and it's

1:00:44.800 --> 1:00:46.800
 a beautiful thing

1:00:46.800 --> 1:00:48.800
 for a mathematician, for a scientist

1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:50.800
 to allow music to enter their

1:00:50.800 --> 1:00:52.800
 work. I think only good

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:54.800
 things can happen. Alright, I'll try to promise

1:00:54.800 --> 1:00:56.800
 you a music video by 2020.

1:00:56.800 --> 1:00:58.800
 By 2020? By the end of 2020.

1:00:58.800 --> 1:01:00.800
 Okay, alright good. I'll give myself a longer window.

1:01:00.800 --> 1:01:02.800
 Alright, maybe

1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:04.800
 we can like collaborate on a

1:01:04.800 --> 1:01:06.800
 band type situation. What instruments do you play?

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:08.800
 The main instrument I play is violin

1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:10.800
 but I also love to dabble around on like guitar

1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:12.800
 and piano. Beautiful. Me too, guitar

1:01:12.800 --> 1:01:14.800
 and piano.

1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:16.800
 So in a mathematician's

1:01:16.800 --> 1:01:18.800
 lament, Paul Lockhart writes

1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:20.800
 the first thing to understand is that mathematics

1:01:20.800 --> 1:01:22.800
 is an art. The difference between

1:01:22.800 --> 1:01:24.800
 math and the other arts such as

1:01:24.800 --> 1:01:26.800
 music and painting

1:01:26.800 --> 1:01:28.800
 is that our culture does not recognize it

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:30.800
 as such. So I think I speak

1:01:30.800 --> 1:01:32.800
 for millions of people,

1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:34.800
 myself included,

1:01:34.800 --> 1:01:36.800
 in saying thank you for revealing

1:01:36.800 --> 1:01:38.800
 to us the art of mathematics.

1:01:38.800 --> 1:01:40.800
 So thank you for everything you do

1:01:40.800 --> 1:01:42.800
 and thanks for talking today. Well, thanks

1:01:42.800 --> 1:01:44.800
 for saying that and thanks for having me on.

1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:46.800

 Grant's and my favorite people,

1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:20.800
 Richard Feynman.

1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:22.800
 Nobody ever figures

1:02:22.800 --> 1:02:24.800
 out what this life is all about

1:02:24.800 --> 1:02:26.800
 and it doesn't matter.

1:02:26.800 --> 1:02:28.800
 Explore the world.

1:02:28.800 --> 1:02:30.800
 Nearly everything is really interesting

1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:32.800
 if you go into it deeply enough.
