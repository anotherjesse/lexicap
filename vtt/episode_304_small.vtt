00:00.000 --> 00:01.800
 When we're beyond good and evil, you know,

00:01.800 --> 00:04.760
 and all that's left is the will to power,

00:04.760 --> 00:07.840
 then why are we surprised that the powerful rise

00:07.840 --> 00:10.880
 and that they use the powerless for their purposes?

00:10.880 --> 00:13.740
 When we forget ideas like equality and rights,

00:13.740 --> 00:15.000
 which are grounded in God,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.020
 why are we surprised that death camps follow?

00:20.480 --> 00:24.040
 The following is a conversation with Bishop Robert Barron,

00:24.040 --> 00:26.080
 founder of Word on Fire

00:26.080 --> 00:29.200
 and one of the greatest educators in the world

00:29.200 --> 00:32.040
 on the beauty and wisdom within Catholicism,

00:32.040 --> 00:35.640
 Christianity, and religious faith in general.

00:35.640 --> 00:37.720
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

00:39.760 --> 00:41.120
 in the description.

00:41.120 --> 00:44.600
 And now, dear friends, here's Bishop Robert Barron.

00:45.520 --> 00:47.560
 Let's start with the big question.

00:47.560 --> 00:50.000
 Who is God?

00:50.000 --> 00:52.400
 According to Christianity, according to Catholicism,

00:52.400 --> 00:53.360
 who's God?

00:53.360 --> 00:55.320
 I'll give you time as acquaintance definition.

00:55.320 --> 00:57.840
 God is Ipsum Essay subsistence.

00:57.840 --> 01:01.400
 God is the subsistent act of to be itself.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.120
 Another way to state that in acquaintance

01:03.120 --> 01:06.880
 is God is that reality, unique, absolutely unique,

01:06.880 --> 01:09.760
 in which essence and existence coincide.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.280
 To be God is to be to be.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.480
 Those are all ways of talking about what we mean by God.

01:15.480 --> 01:18.560
 They are kind of gnomic, and that's on purpose.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.400
 There's almost a Zen koan kind of quality

01:20.400 --> 01:22.640
 about the way we talk about God.

01:22.640 --> 01:25.800
 I'm saying something that's substantive,

01:25.800 --> 01:28.080
 but it's more in like a via negativa mode.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.360
 It's more like what God is not,

01:29.360 --> 01:31.600
 because there's nothing in the world

01:31.600 --> 01:33.880
 that would correspond to those descriptions.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.840
 So anything in the world would be a being of some type,

01:36.840 --> 01:41.240
 or an event of some type, some particular mode of existence.

01:41.240 --> 01:44.720
 And God is not an entity in the world.

01:44.720 --> 01:46.800
 If I would say that's the fundamental mistake

01:46.800 --> 01:49.480
 that atheists all the new make all the time,

01:49.480 --> 01:53.080
 is they think of God as a big being.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.880
 When Aquinas says that God is not in any genus,

01:56.880 --> 01:59.160
 even the genus of being.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.640
 That's one of the strangest remarks

02:00.640 --> 02:02.640
 in the whole tradition, but it's really interesting.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.840
 So you say, well, at the very least,

02:03.840 --> 02:05.160
 God must be a being, right?

02:05.160 --> 02:09.080
 And Aquinas's answer is no, he's not in the genus of being.

02:09.080 --> 02:12.480
 So we talk about God being beyond being and so on.

02:12.480 --> 02:15.320
 To say in God, essence and existence coincide,

02:15.320 --> 02:18.440
 is to say, God's very nature is to be.

02:18.440 --> 02:21.720
 And that can't be true of any contingent thing in the world.

02:21.720 --> 02:23.680
 So what I'm doing there is I'm gesturing

02:23.680 --> 02:26.120
 the way the tradition does toward God,

02:26.120 --> 02:29.320
 using language that's at the same time,

02:29.320 --> 02:32.320
 philosophically precise and gnomic.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.840
 It's both accurate, it's true in God,

02:34.840 --> 02:36.720
 essence and existence coincide.

02:36.720 --> 02:40.800
 What God is is the same as God's active to be.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.280
 But now what does that mean?

02:42.280 --> 02:43.760
 I'm not quite sure because nothing

02:43.760 --> 02:46.800
 in our ordinary experience corresponds to that.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.280
 Everything in our experience is a being of some type.

02:50.280 --> 02:52.960
 So it's existence received according

02:52.960 --> 02:55.240
 to the mode of some essence.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.440
 That's not true of God.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.160
 Which is why you can't be found in the world.

03:00.160 --> 03:04.160
 And that's, as I say, the fundamental mistake is,

03:04.160 --> 03:05.760
 oh, I guess theists are those that believe

03:05.760 --> 03:08.560
 there's this being alongside the other beings

03:08.560 --> 03:09.400
 in the universe.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.320
 And then atheists say, oh no, there is no such being.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.240
 And that's precisely wrong, that's just a category error.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.240
 Dawkins, I think, cites Bertrand Russell.

03:20.240 --> 03:22.760
 To the effect that proving the nonexistence of God

03:22.760 --> 03:24.640
 is a bit like proving the nonexistence

03:24.640 --> 03:28.600
 of a China teapot orbiting between Earth and Mars.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.480
 No, that's precisely what God is not.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.080
 Some entity that's sort of hidden

03:34.080 --> 03:36.920
 among the other entities of the universe.

03:36.920 --> 03:41.120
 God is the reason why there's a contingent realm at all.

03:41.120 --> 03:42.560
 That's the way to put it.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.800
 In more theological language,

03:43.800 --> 03:45.840
 God's the creator of all things.

03:45.840 --> 03:50.240
 So if God is outside of our world, is it possible

03:50.240 --> 03:54.440
 for us to visualize, to comprehend, to know God?

03:54.440 --> 03:55.760
 Not utterly, of course.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.800
 And I would say our knowledge begins always in this world,

03:58.800 --> 04:00.440
 begins in ordinary experience.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.160
 But I think we can, through metaphysical analysis,

04:03.160 --> 04:05.120
 through philosophical reasoning,

04:05.120 --> 04:08.320
 can come to some knowledge of a reality

04:08.320 --> 04:10.560
 which is transcendent to our experience.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.560
 So we gesture toward it.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.160
 I always like Aquinas who says the language about God

04:15.160 --> 04:17.160
 that we use as analogical.

04:17.160 --> 04:21.360
 So it's not univocal, meaning what I say about that can

04:21.360 --> 04:23.600
 or about this bottle I can say about God.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.560
 No, that makes God an entity.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.440
 At the same time, it's not simply equivocal.

04:28.440 --> 04:31.600
 So if I say, well, that thing is and God is,

04:31.600 --> 04:33.400
 I mean totally different things.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.040
 No, no, I mean something analogous.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.280
 So to be God is to be to be.

04:38.280 --> 04:42.160
 So the real meaning of being is the being of God.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.400
 The being of that thing or this thing

04:44.400 --> 04:47.680
 or the being of galaxies or subatomic particles

04:47.680 --> 04:50.600
 would be analogous to God's manner of being.

04:50.600 --> 04:53.440
 So on that basis, I can make some statements.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.800
 I can theorize and even at the limit as you suggest,

04:57.800 --> 04:59.320
 I can visualize.

04:59.320 --> 05:01.200
 So we have metaphors for God

05:01.200 --> 05:04.320
 and the Bible is replete with those, right?

05:04.320 --> 05:07.440
 So God is a rock, God's like a lion,

05:07.440 --> 05:09.120
 God's like this and that.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.200
 The Bible will sometimes imagine God

05:11.200 --> 05:14.000
 as a human being walking around.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.960
 Now only the crudest fundamentalism would say,

05:15.960 --> 05:20.160
 well, that's a univocal, accurate description of God.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.440
 It's an image that's catching something

05:22.440 --> 05:23.920
 of God's manner of being.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.200
 Then what does it mean to believe in God?

05:31.280 --> 05:34.440
 So there's a word and we'll have to limit ourselves

05:34.440 --> 05:37.280
 to human interpretable words today.

05:37.280 --> 05:39.400
 There's a word called faith.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.960
 What does faith mean?

05:40.960 --> 05:44.800
 So if we can't really directly know God,

05:45.680 --> 05:50.080
 you kind of sneak up to the idea of God with metaphors.

05:50.080 --> 05:51.960
 Better, he sneaks up on us.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.760
 Cause I like the language of grace.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.880
 God's action comes first.

05:55.880 --> 06:00.560
 So if I stay perfectly within the realm of I'm seeking

06:00.560 --> 06:04.680
 with my kind of eagle eyes and my inquiring mind,

06:04.680 --> 06:06.160
 I'm not gonna find God that way.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.760
 I might find a path that opens up,

06:09.760 --> 06:12.160
 but I would say finally God finds me.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.000
 And I think then the language of faith

06:14.000 --> 06:15.360
 begins to make more sense.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.880
 I'm with Paul Tillich though, the Protestant theologian

06:18.880 --> 06:20.640
 said the most misunderstood word

06:20.640 --> 06:22.880
 in the religious vocabulary is faith.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.880
 Because he said the way we take it usually

06:24.880 --> 06:26.400
 is something subrational.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.320
 I have proof of this.

06:29.320 --> 06:32.320
 I really know this and I only kind of believe that.

06:32.320 --> 06:35.920
 Like that's just a personal opinion or impression.

06:35.920 --> 06:40.200
 But that's to identify faith with the kind of infrarational.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.760
 And that's not it.

06:41.760 --> 06:43.560
 I mean, I don't want something infrarational.

06:43.560 --> 06:47.320
 I don't want superstition or childish credulity.

06:47.320 --> 06:51.520
 So authentic faith is the darkness beyond reason.

06:51.520 --> 06:54.240
 And on the far side of reason, it's super irrational,

06:54.240 --> 06:55.840
 not infrarational.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.120
 And that's a very important move.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.960
 At the limit of what I can know,

06:59.960 --> 07:02.560
 at the limit of my striving and my vision,

07:02.560 --> 07:04.960
 there's this horizon that opens up.

07:04.960 --> 07:08.120
 And I think that's true even in ordinary ways of knowing.

07:08.120 --> 07:10.040
 There's a kind of a horizon that lures us

07:10.040 --> 07:11.600
 beyond what I've got.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.360
 Faith has to do more with that kind of darkness

07:14.360 --> 07:16.920
 rather than a darkness prior to reason.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.960
 The darkness beyond the horizon, prior to reason.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.400
 First of all, the poetry or your language is incredible.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.240
 To be to be, I have a million questions.

07:27.240 --> 07:28.520
 Yeah, go ahead.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.120
 I do too on this.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.400
 So first of all, let me just jump around.

07:32.400 --> 07:34.760
 You mentioned to be to be a few times.

07:34.760 --> 07:36.320
 What does that mean?

07:36.320 --> 07:39.640
 Well, to be me is to be a human being, right?

07:39.640 --> 07:41.680
 To be this to be a table, to be this to be a microphone.

07:41.680 --> 07:43.960
 So I'll use Aquinas's language.

07:43.960 --> 07:47.400
 It's the act of being poured, if you want,

07:47.400 --> 07:50.160
 into the receptacle of some essential principle.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.400
 So it's got a ontological structure.

07:52.400 --> 07:56.640
 It's an existent, it's a thing that exists,

07:56.640 --> 07:59.280
 but it's existing in a limited way

07:59.280 --> 08:01.080
 according to essential principle.

08:01.080 --> 08:04.920
 God, what's God?

08:04.920 --> 08:05.760
 What's God's name?

08:05.760 --> 08:06.880
 What kind of being is he?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.640
 We'll go back to Moses now.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.160
 When the Israelites ask me, what's your name?

08:13.160 --> 08:14.240
 What should I tell them?

08:14.240 --> 08:17.160
 And he says, famously, I am who I am.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.680
 But see, Aquinas reads that as a very accurate remark.

08:20.680 --> 08:24.080
 So Moses is wondering, okay, there's a lot of gods

08:24.080 --> 08:25.760
 and there's a lot of things, a lot of entities.

08:25.760 --> 08:26.600
 Which one are you?

08:26.600 --> 08:27.480
 You gotta be one of them.

08:27.480 --> 08:29.240
 So tell me your name.

08:29.240 --> 08:31.280
 In philosophical language, give me the essence

08:31.280 --> 08:34.480
 that receives your act of existing, right?

08:34.480 --> 08:37.320
 And God's answer blows the mind of Moses

08:37.320 --> 08:40.040
 and the whole tradition, I am who I am.

08:40.040 --> 08:41.840
 To be God is to be.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.560
 So I'm not this or that.

08:44.560 --> 08:45.400
 I'm not up or down.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.720
 I'm not here or there.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.440
 God is that who centers everywhere

08:48.440 --> 08:51.680
 and whose circumference is nowhere, as the mystics put it.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.520
 Now, can I get a clear and distinct idea of that?

08:54.520 --> 08:56.800
 No, and in a way, that's the whole point.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.160
 If I could, I'd be talking about a being of some kind.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.520
 So to be God is to be, to be is to,

09:02.520 --> 09:03.680
 and that's, you know, Moses,

09:03.680 --> 09:06.080
 take off your sandals, you're on holy ground.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.400
 So I'm gonna go over confidently

09:07.400 --> 09:09.800
 and find out what this thing is, this burning bush.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.520
 I'm gonna find out.

09:11.520 --> 09:12.960
 No, no, no.

09:12.960 --> 09:14.520
 Take off your shoes, you're on holy ground

09:14.520 --> 09:16.360
 because you're not in charge here.

09:16.360 --> 09:17.720
 You're not in command.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.960
 Because if you've got shoes on,

09:19.960 --> 09:21.240
 you can walk wherever you want.

09:21.240 --> 09:22.520
 You can walk with confidence,

09:22.520 --> 09:26.400
 but you take your shoes off, you're much more vulnerable.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.560
 And that's appropriate when you're talking about God, you know?

09:29.560 --> 09:30.680
 But here's another interesting thing,

09:30.680 --> 09:31.920
 I didn't think about the burning bush

09:31.920 --> 09:33.600
 in this connection before,

09:33.600 --> 09:37.760
 but it's a bush that's on fire, but not consumed.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.480
 Is beings are competitive with each other.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.920
 And so these can't be in the same place at the same time,

09:43.920 --> 09:44.760
 these two beings.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.760
 They're mutually exclusive if you want.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.840
 But as God comes close to a creature,

09:52.840 --> 09:55.800
 He doesn't destroy it or consume it,

09:55.800 --> 09:59.720
 but the creature becomes more beautiful and more radiant, right?

09:59.720 --> 10:02.840
 And so you compare it to the classical gods and goddesses.

10:02.840 --> 10:06.600
 When they come bursting into life and experience,

10:06.600 --> 10:09.160
 things are incinerated and people give way

10:09.160 --> 10:10.720
 and they're overwhelmed.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.720
 Then there's this biblical idea of God comes close

10:13.720 --> 10:17.080
 and sets things on fire, but doesn't burn them up.

10:17.080 --> 10:20.160
 And that's because he's not a competitive being in the world.

10:20.160 --> 10:24.520
 If he were a big being, then he'd be competing

10:24.520 --> 10:28.000
 for space, so to speak, on the same ontological grid.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.200
 But he's not like that.

10:30.200 --> 10:35.200
 So God can come close and we come more fully alive.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.280
 Now we're starting to gesture toward the incarnation.

10:37.280 --> 10:38.840
 I mean, the central Christian doctrine

10:38.840 --> 10:42.400
 that God can actually become a human

10:42.400 --> 10:46.000
 without overwhelming the human he becomes, right?

10:46.000 --> 10:48.000
 So I mean, that's kind of the next step.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.800
 But the basic idea of God is noncompetitively

10:51.800 --> 10:53.360
 transcendent to the world.

10:53.360 --> 10:54.880
 That's another way to get at it.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.880
 Noncompetitively transcendent to the world.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.720
 So it's beyond being, it's the source of being.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.960
 Right.

11:02.960 --> 11:06.080
 Let me make it maybe more imagistic.

11:06.080 --> 11:10.480
 I think a really good analogy would be author to book, right?

11:10.480 --> 11:13.120
 So like Tolkien or someone that writes

11:13.120 --> 11:16.240
 one of these big sprawling novels.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.560
 And Tolkien's good too, because he creates a whole world.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.160
 He creates a new nature, a new language, new history,

11:21.160 --> 11:23.320
 all that, thinking of the thousands of characters

11:23.320 --> 11:25.320
 and the plots and subplots and all of it.

11:26.320 --> 11:30.120
 Tolkien is utterly responsible for every bit

11:30.120 --> 11:31.520
 of that story, right?

11:31.520 --> 11:34.200
 Every character, every plot, every subplot,

11:34.200 --> 11:36.760
 every description, he's completely responsible.

11:36.760 --> 11:39.600
 He's involved in every nook and cranny of it.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.800
 But he's not in the story.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.120
 He's not in the book.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.760
 You're not gonna find him as a character in the book.

11:45.760 --> 11:48.440
 So that's the category mistake of the atheist in a way

11:48.440 --> 11:50.520
 is I'm looking for God, he's a character

11:50.520 --> 11:51.880
 in the story somewhere.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.640
 No, he's the author of the story.

11:54.640 --> 11:58.520
 Mysteriously present to every aspect of the story,

11:58.520 --> 12:00.760
 but not a character in it.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.960
 Right, he is deeply in the story somehow.

12:03.960 --> 12:08.720
 He's present, but he's not, even if he is a character,

12:08.720 --> 12:13.080
 he's not really, the full embodiment is not a character.

12:13.080 --> 12:18.080
 And people inside the book can't really know about the author.

12:18.520 --> 12:19.760
 Right.

12:19.760 --> 12:20.600
 No, right.

12:20.600 --> 12:23.800
 Well, see, Augustine says God is simultaneously

12:23.800 --> 12:26.840
 intimier intimo male at superior sumo male.

12:26.840 --> 12:30.280
 He's closer to me than I am to myself.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.360
 And he's higher than anything I could possibly imagine

12:33.360 --> 12:34.360
 at the same time.

12:34.360 --> 12:38.240
 But once you get the insight that God is the sheer act

12:38.240 --> 12:40.240
 of to be, well, of course that's true.

12:40.240 --> 12:45.240
 So right now, God is sustaining us in existence, true.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.240
 Aquinas says God is in all things by essence, presence,

12:49.240 --> 12:51.240
 and power, and most intimately so.

12:51.240 --> 12:55.240
 And, and he's nowhere in this room.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.240
 Okay, well, where's God that he's nowhere in this room.

12:58.240 --> 13:02.240
 He's totalitarian, we say he's totally other.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.240
 Same time, but once you crack that code though,

13:05.240 --> 13:08.240
 I think you see it of like why that would be true.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.240
 As he now I'm getting from more philosophical language

13:11.240 --> 13:12.240
 to more mystical language,

13:12.240 --> 13:14.240
 because all the mystics talk that way.

13:14.240 --> 13:18.240
 In these high paradoxes about God's availability

13:18.240 --> 13:20.240
 and unavailability.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.240
 I've often thought in the Bible, story after story,

13:23.240 --> 13:28.240
 God can neither be grasped nor hidden from.

13:29.240 --> 13:32.240
 So the first sinful instinct is to grasp at God's.

13:32.240 --> 13:35.240
 I've got him, I understand him, I can manipulate him.

13:35.240 --> 13:39.240
 No, no, no, story after story is told, you can't do that.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.240
 Well, then the other extreme of the center, all right,

13:41.240 --> 13:43.240
 then I'm gonna run from God.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.240
 I'm gonna avoid God.

13:45.240 --> 13:49.240
 Jonah and the whale, you know, so he has the call from God.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.240
 And it's a, no, no, I'm gonna refuse that.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.240
 I'm gonna run as far away.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.240
 I'm gonna go to Tarshish, which meant like Timbuktu for them

13:55.240 --> 13:57.240
 at the end of the world.

13:57.240 --> 13:59.240
 God's gonna, the whale swallows him up

13:59.240 --> 14:01.240
 and brings him right back where God wants him.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.240
 It's a, you know, poetic way of saying

14:03.240 --> 14:05.240
 you can't escape the press of God.

14:05.240 --> 14:07.240
 At the same time, Tower of Babel,

14:07.240 --> 14:09.240
 I'm gonna build a tower up to God.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.240
 I'm gonna grab hold of God.

14:11.240 --> 14:13.240
 I don't know, you can't do that either.

14:13.240 --> 14:15.240
 So live in the space in between those two things,

14:15.240 --> 14:19.240
 which would be the space of friendship with God,

14:19.240 --> 14:21.240
 falling in love with God,

14:21.240 --> 14:25.240
 is neither grasping nor hiding from God.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.240
 You mentioned, again, a lot of beautiful poetic things.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.240
 You mentioned grace.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.240
 Yeah.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.240
 You mentioned sin.

14:32.240 --> 14:35.240
 You mentioned incarnation.

14:35.240 --> 14:37.240
 Is there a philosophical, pragmatic way

14:37.240 --> 14:40.240
 to start talking about the pillars of Christianity?

14:40.240 --> 14:42.240
 What are the defining things

14:42.240 --> 14:45.240
 that make Christianity to you

14:45.240 --> 14:48.240
 and broadly speaking,

14:48.240 --> 14:51.240
 to those that follow the religion?

14:51.240 --> 14:53.240
 You know, in a way, what we're doing so far

14:53.240 --> 14:55.240
 is a necessary propodotic,

14:55.240 --> 14:57.240
 because we're talking about God.

14:57.240 --> 15:00.240
 What makes Christianity distinctive, of course,

15:00.240 --> 15:02.240
 is the claim of the incarnation.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.240
 So we come up out of Judaism.

15:04.240 --> 15:06.240
 We come up out of this great monotheistic tradition.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.240
 And, you know, the Bible itself

15:08.240 --> 15:10.240
 and all the great commentaries within Judaism,

15:10.240 --> 15:13.240
 I think, would agree with this basic,

15:13.240 --> 15:15.240
 theistic stuff that I've been talking about.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.240
 Take most of my mononies, for example.

15:18.240 --> 15:21.240
 Now, what makes Christianity distinct?

15:21.240 --> 15:23.240
 This supremely weird claim

15:23.240 --> 15:26.240
 that God becomes one of us.

15:26.240 --> 15:29.240
 God becomes a creature,

15:29.240 --> 15:31.240
 but without ceasing to be God

15:31.240 --> 15:34.240
 and without overwhelming the integrity of the creature he becomes.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.240
 What we see in the burning bush,

15:36.240 --> 15:38.240
 which obtains across the board.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.240
 So the closer God comes to me,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.240
 the more radiant I become, right?

15:42.240 --> 15:44.240
 But take that now to the nth degree,

15:44.240 --> 15:46.240
 would be what we mean by the incarnation,

15:46.240 --> 15:48.240
 the incarnation of the Son of God

15:48.240 --> 15:51.240
 becoming a creature

15:51.240 --> 15:54.240
 in such a way as to make humanity

15:54.240 --> 15:57.240
 radiant and beautiful.

15:57.240 --> 15:59.240
 That's the pillar of Christianity.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.240
 It's the incarnation, you know.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.240
 And what follows from that

16:03.240 --> 16:05.240
 is the redemption of all of reality.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.240
 So not just of human beings,

16:07.240 --> 16:10.240
 but in becoming a creature.

16:10.240 --> 16:14.240
 God divinizes the world, you know.

16:14.240 --> 16:16.240
 The Greek fathers always said,

16:16.240 --> 16:19.240
 God became human that humans might become God.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.240
 And that's a good way to sum up,

16:21.240 --> 16:23.240
 I think, the essence of Christianity.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.240
 Why is this such an important thing?

16:25.240 --> 16:27.240
 So it's a distinctive thing.

16:27.240 --> 16:30.240
 But why is it so important philosophically

16:30.240 --> 16:33.240
 to what it means to be a Christian?

16:33.240 --> 16:36.240
 What impact did that have on our world,

16:36.240 --> 16:39.240
 on human civilization, on human nature,

16:39.240 --> 16:42.240
 on our morals, of why live,

16:42.240 --> 16:44.240
 what to live for, the meaning of it all?

16:44.240 --> 16:46.240
 Like, why is incarnation so important?

16:46.240 --> 16:48.240
 Well, I think it's massively important

16:48.240 --> 16:50.240
 because it's the divinization principle

16:50.240 --> 16:52.240
 that God wants to divinize His creation

16:52.240 --> 16:54.240
 and sort of in this concentrated point

16:54.240 --> 16:56.240
 of Jesus of Nazareth.

16:56.240 --> 16:58.240
 But then we talk about the mystical body of Jesus.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.240
 So that goes right back to Paul.

17:00.240 --> 17:02.240
 As we're grafted on to Christ,

17:02.240 --> 17:04.240
 we talk about that as the church.

17:04.240 --> 17:08.240
 We become like cells and molecules in an organism.

17:08.240 --> 17:10.240
 That's the church, it's not an organization.

17:10.240 --> 17:14.240
 That's a deformation of ecclesiology.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.240
 The church is this organism that begins with Jesus

17:17.240 --> 17:20.240
 and then He's drawing all of humanity,

17:20.240 --> 17:23.240
 but ultimately all of nature,

17:23.240 --> 17:26.240
 all of creation to Himself.

17:26.240 --> 17:28.240
 When the Son of Man is lifted up,

17:28.240 --> 17:30.240
 He will draw all things to Himself.

17:30.240 --> 17:34.240
 That's the gathering in of a scattered creation.

17:34.240 --> 17:36.240
 So in that way, it's at the heart of it.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.240
 Then there's all kinds of things.

17:38.240 --> 17:40.240
 If God becomes human,

17:40.240 --> 17:42.240
 that means there's a dignity to humanity

17:42.240 --> 17:44.240
 which goes beyond anything any humanist

17:44.240 --> 17:46.240
 of any stripe has ever said, right?

17:46.240 --> 17:49.240
 Ancient, medieval, modern, contemporary.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.240
 Christianity is the greatest humanism imaginable.

17:52.240 --> 17:56.240
 God became one of us in order to divinize us.

17:56.240 --> 17:59.240
 The goal of my life is not just to be a good person,

17:59.240 --> 18:02.240
 not just to be materially successful,

18:02.240 --> 18:05.240
 not just to be a member of society.

18:05.240 --> 18:09.240
 The goal of my life is to become a participant in the divine nature.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.240
 I don't think there is a humanism greater than that,

18:12.240 --> 18:14.240
 even conceivably.

18:14.240 --> 18:18.240
 That's where I think humanism is profoundly influenced

18:18.240 --> 18:20.240
 by the incarnation.

18:20.240 --> 18:25.240
 Just our notion of God is noncompetitive to us.

18:25.240 --> 18:29.240
 This is so important because I think in so many systems from mythology onward,

18:29.240 --> 18:32.240
 you have these competitive understandings of God.

18:32.240 --> 18:35.240
 When Jesus says to his disciples, the night before he dies,

18:35.240 --> 18:38.240
 I no longer call you servants but friends.

18:38.240 --> 18:40.240
 It's an extraordinary moment.

18:40.240 --> 18:43.240
 Because every God who's ever been served,

18:43.240 --> 18:48.240
 well, that's the best we can hope for is that we'll be his servant of God.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.240
 You know, I try to obey you, Lord.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.240
 I'll try to do what you want.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.240
 He says, I no longer call you servants or slaves.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.240
 He would have said in the Greek there, you know.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.240
 But friends, I don't know.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.240
 I can't imagine anything greater than that, becoming God's friend.

19:04.240 --> 19:08.240
 That's a call to become one with God.

19:08.240 --> 19:12.240
 It's possible to become one with God.

19:12.240 --> 19:16.240
 Now, I should mention, you're one of the greatest religious communicators

19:16.240 --> 19:19.240
 I've ever experienced that a huge number of people are fans of yours.

19:19.240 --> 19:23.240
 You've done a lot of great conversations.

19:23.240 --> 19:29.240
 You've done Reddit AMAs, which is a very unique, bold, brave thing.

19:29.240 --> 19:33.240
 And on one of them, somebody asked,

19:33.240 --> 19:37.240
 what's the most challenging of the seven deadly sins?

19:37.240 --> 19:41.240
 So first, what are the seven deadly sins?

19:41.240 --> 19:43.240
 What do they have to do with Christianity?

19:43.240 --> 19:47.240
 How essential, how crucial they are to the religion?

19:47.240 --> 19:51.240
 And what's the most challenging in our modern day?

19:51.240 --> 19:55.240
 Yeah, to name them, pride, envy, anger,

19:55.240 --> 20:00.240
 sloth, avarice, gluttony, and lust are the seven deadly sins.

20:00.240 --> 20:03.240
 We're called capital sins sometimes.

20:03.240 --> 20:06.240
 They're the head sins from which things tend to flow.

20:06.240 --> 20:10.240
 The most fundamental is pride.

20:10.240 --> 20:13.240
 Probably most people today, if you talk about vice,

20:13.240 --> 20:16.240
 or you talk about deadly sin, they would think about lust.

20:16.240 --> 20:21.240
 But the classical authors, including Dante, who does this pictorially,

20:21.240 --> 20:23.240
 that's the least of the deadly sins is lust,

20:23.240 --> 20:26.240
 because it's the one that's most sort of dependent upon the body

20:26.240 --> 20:28.240
 and its passions and so on.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.240
 The most important is pride.

20:30.240 --> 20:32.240
 Pride is the deadliest of the deadly sins.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.240
 And it's very simple to see why.

20:34.240 --> 20:36.240
 Pride is the, Augustine calls it,

20:36.240 --> 20:40.240
 in crevatis and sei, I'm caved in around myself,

20:40.240 --> 20:44.240
 like a black hole, right, to get into the scientific.

20:44.240 --> 20:46.240
 But the black hole to me is a great symbol,

20:46.240 --> 20:50.240
 that it's so heavy that it draws everything, including light,

20:50.240 --> 20:52.240
 nothing can escape from it.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.240
 See, that's the sinner.

20:54.240 --> 20:55.240
 We're all sinners.

20:55.240 --> 21:00.240
 We're like black holes, that we draw everything into ourselves.

21:00.240 --> 21:04.240
 So as a sinner, and I'll confess I'm a sinner,

21:04.240 --> 21:08.240
 the temptation is, okay, this is the Bishop Barron moment,

21:08.240 --> 21:13.240
 and I'm drawing you now into my world and so on.

21:13.240 --> 21:18.240
 What that does is it kills us off, and it darkens life,

21:18.240 --> 21:23.240
 and it makes it small and heavy and awful, right?

21:23.240 --> 21:28.240
 It's like, but see, compared to the contrasting thing,

21:28.240 --> 21:31.240
 is when you're lost in a moment,

21:31.240 --> 21:33.240
 you're not concerned about the impression I'm making,

21:33.240 --> 21:35.240
 you're not concerned about drawing the world into yourself,

21:35.240 --> 21:38.240
 you're not concerned about the smoky on my back

21:38.240 --> 21:41.240
 that's always telling me, you know, look good and sound right,

21:41.240 --> 21:44.240
 but you're lost in something.

21:44.240 --> 21:47.240
 You're just talking to a friend and the two of you together

21:47.240 --> 21:50.240
 are discovering something true or beautiful.

21:50.240 --> 21:52.240
 You're lost in a movie or you're lost in a book.

21:52.240 --> 21:54.240
 Those are the best moments in life.

21:54.240 --> 21:58.240
 Those are the best because they're the least prideful moments, right?

21:58.240 --> 22:00.240
 That's when the light comes out.

22:00.240 --> 22:05.240
 I become radiant because I'm overcoming this tendency

22:05.240 --> 22:07.240
 to fall in on myself.

22:07.240 --> 22:12.240
 Dante is so good because the way he pictures Satan

22:12.240 --> 22:15.240
 in Divine Comedy, and he's at the center of the earth,

22:15.240 --> 22:18.240
 like a black hole that way, he's at the center of gravity,

22:18.240 --> 22:22.240
 he's at the heaviest place, and there's not fire where he is,

22:22.240 --> 22:25.240
 but ice, it's a much, much better image

22:25.240 --> 22:28.240
 that you're frozen in place and you're stuck,

22:28.240 --> 22:31.240
 and he's got wings, right?

22:31.240 --> 22:33.240
 They used to be angel wings because he's an angel,

22:33.240 --> 22:35.240
 but now they're like bat wings for Dante,

22:35.240 --> 22:38.240
 and they're flapping, and all they're doing

22:38.240 --> 22:40.240
 is making the world around him colder

22:40.240 --> 22:43.240
 because he's ice, he's stuck in his own iciness,

22:43.240 --> 22:45.240
 and then he's beating his wings over the ice,

22:45.240 --> 22:47.240
 making everyone else colder.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.240
 It's a great image.

22:49.240 --> 22:52.240
 And then he has, this is cool too, he has three faces, Satan,

22:52.240 --> 22:55.240
 because he's the simulacrum of the Trinity.

22:55.240 --> 22:58.240
 So every sinner thinks he's God, so I pretend I'm God.

22:58.240 --> 23:03.240
 So he's got the three faces, and from all six eyes he weeps.

23:03.240 --> 23:07.240
 Also from all three mouths, he's chewing a sinner.

23:07.240 --> 23:11.240
 He's got Cassius, Brutus, and Judas in the three mouths,

23:11.240 --> 23:13.240
 you know, the three traders.

23:13.240 --> 23:17.240
 But I thought it's just a great image of all of us sinners

23:17.240 --> 23:22.240
 is we're stuck, it's heavy, it's cold,

23:22.240 --> 23:25.240
 we're chewing on our past resentments,

23:25.240 --> 23:27.240
 we're weeping in our sadness,

23:27.240 --> 23:29.240
 and we're making the world around us colder.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.240
 It's beautiful, it's a great, so that's pride.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.240
 See, that's an image of pride,

23:33.240 --> 23:35.240
 because Satan, that's his great sin, pride,

23:35.240 --> 23:39.240
 which is why he needed Michael, right, Michael, who's like God,

23:39.240 --> 23:43.240
 so that the great challenge to him, which we need all the time,

23:43.240 --> 23:46.240
 is someone to say, wait a minute, wait a minute, you're not God.

23:46.240 --> 23:50.240
 But the minute we say I'm God, black hole,

23:50.240 --> 23:54.240
 I now cave in on myself, I suck everything into myself,

23:54.240 --> 23:57.240
 and I turn into Dante's Satan.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.240
 So that's a great image, that's pride,

23:59.240 --> 24:01.240
 that's the most fundamental,

24:01.240 --> 24:03.240
 that's the uber capital sin,

24:03.240 --> 24:06.240
 all the other ones flow from that in a way.

24:06.240 --> 24:09.240
 So in general, empathy, humility, compassion,

24:09.240 --> 24:14.240
 love thy neighbor is the way to fight the sin of pride.

24:14.240 --> 24:16.240
 Right, which is why the masters tend to say,

24:16.240 --> 24:19.240
 this was Bernard, Saint Bernard was asked,

24:19.240 --> 24:21.240
 what are the three most important virtues?

24:21.240 --> 24:24.240
 And he said, humilitas, humilitas, and humilitas,

24:24.240 --> 24:26.240
 because it's the opposite of pride.

24:26.240 --> 24:29.240
 But they're bringing Aquinas in again,

24:29.240 --> 24:32.240
 because we think, humility, I'm no good.

24:32.240 --> 24:33.240
 That's not what it means at all.

24:33.240 --> 24:35.240
 It means what I was describing before,

24:35.240 --> 24:39.240
 when you're just lost in something, you're just lost in it.

24:39.240 --> 24:42.240
 My image, I live out in Santa Barbara,

24:42.240 --> 24:44.240
 and I like to walk on the beach out there,

24:44.240 --> 24:48.240
 and there's a section of the beach where they let the dogs run free without leashes.

24:48.240 --> 24:52.240
 And when you see a dog, and he's well cared for,

24:52.240 --> 24:54.240
 and his master's right there,

24:54.240 --> 24:56.240
 and the master's throwing the tennis ball, and the surf,

24:56.240 --> 24:58.240
 and the dog was galloping out into the surf,

24:58.240 --> 25:01.240
 and he gets it with a big smile, and comes running back.

25:01.240 --> 25:02.240
 That's humility.

25:02.240 --> 25:06.240
 That's an image of heaven, because he's just lost in that moment.

25:06.240 --> 25:08.240
 He doesn't care about impressing anybody,

25:08.240 --> 25:11.240
 he doesn't care about what people think of him.

25:11.240 --> 25:13.240
 He's just lost in it.

25:13.240 --> 25:14.240
 That's it.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.240
 That's heaven, right?

25:16.240 --> 25:19.240
 And those moments in our life, when we get that,

25:19.240 --> 25:21.240
 it's a little hint of paradise.

25:21.240 --> 25:24.240
 But the troubles most of us live, frankly, most of the time,

25:24.240 --> 25:27.240
 in various levels of hell, you know,

25:27.240 --> 25:29.240
 and we're dealing with these deadly sins.

25:29.240 --> 25:32.240
 Like, envy flows from pride, because if I'm prideful,

25:32.240 --> 25:35.240
 I'm a black hole, I'm in corvatus and se, I'm collapsed in.

25:35.240 --> 25:37.240
 What am I really going to be concerned about?

25:37.240 --> 25:39.240
 That guy's getting more attention than I am.

25:39.240 --> 25:40.240
 That guy's richer than I am.

25:40.240 --> 25:43.240
 That lady, she's got a bigger reputation than I do,

25:43.240 --> 25:46.240
 and why don't I have that, right?

25:46.240 --> 25:50.240
 So, envy is a very close daughter of pride.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.240
 Anger flows from me.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.240
 Why do I get angry?

25:53.240 --> 25:55.240
 The dog isn't getting angry on the beach

25:55.240 --> 25:57.240
 when he's running after the tennis ball.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.240
 But I get angry all the time.

25:58.240 --> 26:00.240
 I sputter with anger when things aren't going my way

26:00.240 --> 26:02.240
 and you're insulting me and you're not doing what I want

26:02.240 --> 26:04.240
 and I'm being hurt, my reputation.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.240
 So, anger flows from pride, you know?

26:07.240 --> 26:08.240
 All of them do.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.240
 All of the deadly sins do.

26:10.240 --> 26:13.240
 So, you said, I'm a sinner.

26:13.240 --> 26:15.240
 So, we're all sinners.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.240
 Yeah.

26:17.240 --> 26:19.240
 And you mentioned Satan.

26:19.240 --> 26:22.240
 So, there's heaven and hell.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.240
 There's God and Satan.

26:25.240 --> 26:30.240
 Where's the line between what it means to be good

26:30.240 --> 26:34.240
 and not good enough?

26:34.240 --> 26:38.240
 Or, I hesitate to use the word sort of evil,

26:38.240 --> 26:42.240
 but maybe overwhelmingly sinful.

26:42.240 --> 26:45.240
 Where's the line between hell and heaven?

26:45.240 --> 26:47.240
 Think of it as limit concepts maybe.

26:47.240 --> 26:48.240
 They're like heuristic devices.

26:48.240 --> 26:49.240
 Yes.

26:49.240 --> 26:53.240
 So, heaven would name this ultimate friendship with God.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.240
 So, think of the dog on the beach who is just,

26:55.240 --> 26:58.240
 he's fallen in love with his environment,

26:58.240 --> 26:59.240
 with his master, with the surf.

26:59.240 --> 27:01.240
 He's just lost in it, right?

27:01.240 --> 27:03.240
 He's forgotten himself.

27:03.240 --> 27:06.240
 He's transcended himself and is now lost in the wonder

27:06.240 --> 27:08.240
 of the beauty of that place.

27:08.240 --> 27:13.240
 Now, imagine the limit of that is the friendship with God

27:13.240 --> 27:14.240
 that we talked about.

27:14.240 --> 27:16.240
 That I become the friend of God.

27:16.240 --> 27:19.240
 I become so, I forgetful of myself,

27:19.240 --> 27:22.240
 so lost in the beauty and truth and goodness of God

27:22.240 --> 27:26.240
 that I found Beatitudo, right?

27:26.240 --> 27:30.240
 I found joy, the beatific vision, we call it.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.240
 That's the limit case.

27:31.240 --> 27:32.240
 That's where we're tending.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.240
 That's where God wants us to go.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.240
 Think of hell as the limit case in the opposite direction.

27:36.240 --> 27:39.240
 That's Carvatus and Se, that's the black hole.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.240
 And we're all sinners, meaning we're somewhere on that spectrum.

27:42.240 --> 27:45.240
 You know, we have good days and bad days,

27:45.240 --> 27:47.240
 and we have good moments and bad moments.

27:47.240 --> 27:50.240
 And I can be drawn toward sin.

27:50.240 --> 27:54.240
 What's God's purpose on Christianity's reading

27:54.240 --> 27:56.240
 is to bring us out of that, you know?

27:56.240 --> 27:57.240
 Now, where did he go?

27:57.240 --> 28:00.240
 He went all the way into it to get us out of it.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.240
 It's like pulling the sock back out.

28:02.240 --> 28:03.240
 Socks inside out.

28:03.240 --> 28:05.240
 You have to go all the way in and pull it back out.

28:05.240 --> 28:08.240
 And so God had to go all the way down, you know?

28:08.240 --> 28:13.240
 And there's the trajectory of the incarnation.

28:13.240 --> 28:16.240
 Though he was in the form of God, you know, this is St. Paul,

28:16.240 --> 28:19.240
 Jesus did not deem equality with God a thing to be grasped at,

28:19.240 --> 28:21.240
 but rather emptied himself and took the form of a slave,

28:21.240 --> 28:23.240
 being born the likeness of men.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.240
 But then he was known to be of human estate,

28:26.240 --> 28:30.240
 and he accepted even death, death on a cross.

28:30.240 --> 28:34.240
 And so Paul imagines that the incarnation is downward journey

28:34.240 --> 28:36.240
 in order to get all of us, right?

28:36.240 --> 28:40.240
 All of us who were stuck, were stuck in our sin.

28:40.240 --> 28:44.240
 And so again, Paul says he became sin on the cross.

28:44.240 --> 28:46.240
 It's a really, really powerful idea.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.240
 He wasn't a sinner, then he'd need to be saved too.

28:49.240 --> 28:53.240
 He's not a sinner, but he entered into our dysfunction

28:53.240 --> 28:55.240
 in order to pull us back out of it.

28:55.240 --> 29:01.240
 So that's a really powerful message and embodiment,

29:01.240 --> 29:06.240
 sort of educating the world about sin.

29:06.240 --> 29:12.240
 That said, day to day, there's like oscillations

29:12.240 --> 29:15.240
 in terms of how much each human sins,

29:15.240 --> 29:17.240
 and there's a struggle against that.

29:17.240 --> 29:23.240
 So, you know, that dog that loses himself on the beach,

29:23.240 --> 29:26.240
 may have had a lot of sex with other dogs leading up to that.

29:26.240 --> 29:30.240
 That was, may have been not the best dog

29:30.240 --> 29:32.240
 he could be leading up to that.

29:32.240 --> 29:35.240
 So how, you know, if it's a math equation,

29:35.240 --> 29:38.240
 what does the final calculation look like

29:38.240 --> 29:40.240
 in terms of ending up in heaven?

29:40.240 --> 29:44.240
 What does it mean to live a good life in the end?

29:44.240 --> 29:49.240
 Is it the average amount of sin you do is low?

29:49.240 --> 29:52.240
 Are you allowed to make mistakes?

29:52.240 --> 29:56.240
 Yeah, you know, the metric is love, right?

29:56.240 --> 29:59.240
 And love is not a feeling, it's an act of the will.

29:59.240 --> 30:01.240
 To will the good of the other.

30:01.240 --> 30:02.240
 That's Aquinas again.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.240
 To will the good of the other as other.

30:04.240 --> 30:07.240
 You see, that's the anti black hole principle.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.240
 When I, I don't...

30:08.240 --> 30:11.240
 Will the good of the other as other.

30:11.240 --> 30:13.240
 See, because if I'm willing, you're good

30:13.240 --> 30:15.240
 because it's good for me.

30:15.240 --> 30:17.240
 So, again, you know, it's good for you

30:17.240 --> 30:18.240
 that I'm on this program, I guess.

30:18.240 --> 30:19.240
 I'm willing you're good,

30:19.240 --> 30:21.240
 but that's because it's going to be down to my benefit.

30:21.240 --> 30:23.240
 That's just an indirect egotism.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.240
 That's why see, love is really rare and strange

30:26.240 --> 30:32.240
 that I really want what's good for you as other.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.240
 So not connected to the black hole tendency

30:34.240 --> 30:36.240
 of my own prideful ego.

30:36.240 --> 30:39.240
 When I've broken that, I've forgotten self

30:39.240 --> 30:42.240
 and I've moved into the space of your own good.

30:42.240 --> 30:44.240
 That's what love is.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.240
 Now, God wants us to be, you know, by this,

30:47.240 --> 30:48.240
 they will know that you're my disciples,

30:48.240 --> 30:50.240
 that you love one another, Jesus says.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.240
 So that's it.

30:51.240 --> 30:55.240
 Now, I mean, life is ups and downs and back and forth

30:55.240 --> 30:59.240
 and we're better or worse at that.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.240
 The point of a church is to graft us onto Christ

31:02.240 --> 31:05.240
 that we might become more and more conformed to love.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.240
 But, you know, the final calculus, I'll leave that to God.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.240
 I mean, like, but use love as the metric.

31:09.240 --> 31:12.240
 At the end of the day, when you examine your conscience,

31:12.240 --> 31:14.240
 did I will the good of the other today?

31:14.240 --> 31:17.240
 How effective was I at that?

31:17.240 --> 31:19.240
 And be just like Ignatius of Loyola,

31:19.240 --> 31:21.240
 be brutally honest.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.240
 Or was I just willing someone's good because it was good for me?

31:24.240 --> 31:28.240
 Where were those moments where I was like the dog on the beach?

31:28.240 --> 31:30.240
 See, and as you play at the what,

31:30.240 --> 31:33.240
 not so much God, the lawgiver surveying

31:33.240 --> 31:35.240
 and you did, you know, three of those and four,

31:35.240 --> 31:38.240
 it's God wants us to be fully alive.

31:38.240 --> 31:40.240
 St. Irenaeus is one of my great heroes,

31:40.240 --> 31:42.240
 ancient, you know, patristic figure.

31:42.240 --> 31:46.240
 And his famous line is Gloria de Homo Vivens, right?

31:46.240 --> 31:50.240
 The glory of God is a human being fully alive.

31:50.240 --> 31:53.240
 See, and that gets us over this sort of obsession

31:53.240 --> 31:55.240
 with the legalism and did I do enough?

31:55.240 --> 31:57.240
 And is that that's a big enough sin?

31:57.240 --> 32:00.240
 And God wants us fully alive.

32:00.240 --> 32:03.240
 The key to that is willing the good of the other.

32:03.240 --> 32:08.240
 He died that we might come to a richer appropriation of that.

32:08.240 --> 32:14.240
 So to be fully alive is to be in love with the world

32:14.240 --> 32:17.240
 or to love the world deeply.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.240
 And what love means is the other.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.240
 Get out of yourself, right?

32:22.240 --> 32:26.240
 It's the humility, yeah, getting out of yourself.

32:26.240 --> 32:31.240
 But that somehow is not, that's not even selfless

32:31.240 --> 32:35.240
 because the word selfless requires her to be a self.

32:35.240 --> 32:38.240
 It's almost like just letting go.

32:38.240 --> 32:40.240
 Yeah, I might talk about like a gift of self

32:40.240 --> 32:43.240
 that you yourself aware, but you give a gift of yourself.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.240
 Your self becomes not a magnet drawing things into itself,

32:46.240 --> 32:49.240
 but it becomes a radiant source of life for others.

32:49.240 --> 32:52.240
 Like Mother Teresa would have had a keen sense of herself,

32:52.240 --> 32:55.240
 it seems to me, but it was to light other people

32:55.240 --> 32:59.240
 up so that they might be radiant.

32:59.240 --> 33:01.240
 That's the game.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.240
 So you probably articulated that way too.

33:03.240 --> 33:06.240
 Yeah, I love love.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.240
 It's such an interesting thing.

33:08.240 --> 33:10.240
 But we have to be hard nosed about it.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.240
 Like your friend Dostoevsky,

33:11.240 --> 33:13.240
 love is a harsh and dreadful thing, right?

33:13.240 --> 33:15.240
 It's not a feeling.

33:15.240 --> 33:17.240
 And our culture is so sentimentalized love

33:17.240 --> 33:19.240
 that it's having warm feelings or doing what people want.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.240
 And that's not it at all.

33:21.240 --> 33:24.240
 Love is always correlated to the order of the good

33:24.240 --> 33:26.240
 because if I'm willing the good of the other,

33:26.240 --> 33:28.240
 I have to know what that good is, right?

33:28.240 --> 33:29.240
 So a parent says,

33:29.240 --> 33:31.240
 I'll give the kid whatever she wants.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.240
 Well, that's not love.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.240
 That's indulgence or that's sentimentality.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.240
 But I have to know what the goods really are

33:37.240 --> 33:39.240
 if I'm going to will them for you, right?

33:39.240 --> 33:42.240
 Yeah, in some sense, you're absolutely right.

33:42.240 --> 33:46.240
 A component of love is the struggle to know the other.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.240
 It's the struggle to understand.

33:49.240 --> 33:52.240
 I mean, that's something to me by empathy.

33:52.240 --> 33:57.240
 It's not, yeah, it's not Valentine's Day romantic gifts.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.240
 It's a struggle.

33:59.240 --> 34:02.240
 It's like trying to understand,

34:02.240 --> 34:04.240
 trying to perturb your own mind

34:04.240 --> 34:06.240
 and that of another human being

34:06.240 --> 34:08.240
 to try to figure out who they are,

34:08.240 --> 34:10.240
 what they want,

34:10.240 --> 34:12.240
 what makes them happy,

34:12.240 --> 34:14.240
 what are they afraid of,

34:14.240 --> 34:16.240
 what are they hoping for?

34:16.240 --> 34:18.240
 And it's like a dance,

34:18.240 --> 34:19.240
 a dance of conversation,

34:19.240 --> 34:23.240
 a dance of just shared experiences

34:23.240 --> 34:24.240
 and all that kind of stuff.

34:24.240 --> 34:27.240
 And all of that requires for you to be,

34:27.240 --> 34:30.240
 I guess, yeah, empathize.

34:30.240 --> 34:35.240
 Imagine yourself in their place

34:35.240 --> 34:38.240
 and then love that person

34:38.240 --> 34:41.240
 when you're living inside that person.

34:41.240 --> 34:43.240
 Several minutes ago about the Pillars of Christianity.

34:43.240 --> 34:44.240
 So we talked about God,

34:44.240 --> 34:45.240
 we talked about incarnation,

34:45.240 --> 34:48.240
 but you're getting now to a third key one,

34:48.240 --> 34:50.240
 namely the Trinity,

34:50.240 --> 34:52.240
 because we're monotheists, right?

34:52.240 --> 34:55.240
 But we don't think God is monolithically one.

34:55.240 --> 34:57.240
 We think God is a play of persons

34:57.240 --> 35:02.240
 and the Father from all eternity

35:02.240 --> 35:05.240
 by a great mental act

35:05.240 --> 35:08.240
 forms his interior word as Aquinas puts it.

35:08.240 --> 35:10.240
 And that's the Logos, right?

35:10.240 --> 35:11.240
 That's the Verbum,

35:11.240 --> 35:13.240
 that's the word by which the Father knows himself

35:13.240 --> 35:14.240
 and we call it the Son.

35:14.240 --> 35:17.240
 So the Imago, it's the image of the Father.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.240
 See, the great thing is that Imago

35:19.240 --> 35:21.240
 is not like just a dead image on a mirror

35:21.240 --> 35:24.240
 or a dead image at a pond or something.

35:24.240 --> 35:29.240
 It's a full reflection of the Father's being.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.240
 He's one in being with the Father.

35:31.240 --> 35:34.240
 Therefore, the Son has everything the Father has

35:34.240 --> 35:35.240
 except being the Father.

35:35.240 --> 35:38.240
 But that means that the two of them look at each other

35:38.240 --> 35:41.240
 and they're just crazy in love with each other

35:41.240 --> 35:45.240
 because the Father is the fullness of being.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.240
 The Son is the fullness of being.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.240
 And they're so crazy in love with each other

35:48.240 --> 35:52.240
 that they, this is Fulton, she put it this way,

35:52.240 --> 35:54.240
 that there's this...

35:54.240 --> 35:57.240
 They just, they love each other with this sigh

35:57.240 --> 35:59.240
 and we call that the Spiritus Sanctus.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.240
 That's the Holy Breath, right?

36:01.240 --> 36:05.240
 The Holy sigh of love between the Father and the Son.

36:05.240 --> 36:10.240
 And that's one being, one essence we say of God.

36:10.240 --> 36:12.240
 But in these three persons,

36:12.240 --> 36:15.240
 but all your language of like dance and play and community,

36:15.240 --> 36:18.240
 the Greek Father's talked about perichoracis,

36:18.240 --> 36:20.240
 which means God, the three persons kind of sit

36:20.240 --> 36:22.240
 in a choir together.

36:22.240 --> 36:26.240
 So they sing together, you know?

36:26.240 --> 36:31.240
 And that's why, see, Christianity is unique in this claim

36:31.240 --> 36:34.240
 that God is love.

36:34.240 --> 36:37.240
 So every religion will say God loves, you know, in some way.

36:37.240 --> 36:39.240
 Love is an attribute of God.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.240
 God is, or love is a thing that God does sometimes.

36:42.240 --> 36:45.240
 But Christianity is unique in all the religions

36:45.240 --> 36:47.240
 in saying that God is love.

36:47.240 --> 36:51.240
 And somehow the Holy Trinity embodies that idea.

36:51.240 --> 36:56.240
 I mean, that philosophically has always been confusing to me.

36:56.240 --> 37:00.240
 What it means to be three things

37:00.240 --> 37:04.240
 and at the same time be one God,

37:04.240 --> 37:07.240
 the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit.

37:07.240 --> 37:10.240
 What is this dance between these three?

37:10.240 --> 37:13.240
 What exact, like how do you visualize,

37:13.240 --> 37:14.240
 how do you understand this?

37:14.240 --> 37:15.240
 Yeah.

37:15.240 --> 37:19.240
 This very fascinating, essential thing for Christianity.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.240
 The first thing I'd say is what we already have been

37:21.240 --> 37:23.240
 sort of talking about is if you say God is love,

37:23.240 --> 37:25.240
 and most people probably say, yeah, I like that.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.240
 That's a good idea.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.240
 God is love.

37:27.240 --> 37:30.240
 But it's very peculiar because if he is love,

37:30.240 --> 37:35.240
 there has to be in his unity a lover, a beloved,

37:35.240 --> 37:37.240
 and the love that they share.

37:37.240 --> 37:40.240
 Otherwise, he isn't love by his very essence.

37:40.240 --> 37:43.240
 He would love, it would be an attribute of God

37:43.240 --> 37:45.240
 or an action of God.

37:45.240 --> 37:46.240
 But if it's his very nature,

37:46.240 --> 37:49.240
 there has to be lover, beloved, and love, share.

37:49.240 --> 37:52.240
 And the tradition eventually came to see that.

37:52.240 --> 37:55.240
 The image I was using before of the Father,

37:55.240 --> 37:57.240
 his Imago, the Son,

37:57.240 --> 38:00.240
 well, that's born of God's infinite mind.

38:00.240 --> 38:02.240
 So of course God has an image of himself.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.240
 Heck, I've got an image of myself.

38:04.240 --> 38:06.240
 That's something I can pull off as a puny little creature.

38:06.240 --> 38:11.240
 God, in his infinity, has a perfect Imago of himself.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.240
 And they have to fall in love with each other.

38:13.240 --> 38:14.240
 What else can they do?

38:14.240 --> 38:17.240
 Because they're in the presence of infinite good.

38:17.240 --> 38:21.240
 And so it has to follow that you then have the shared love

38:21.240 --> 38:22.240
 that connects them.

38:22.240 --> 38:24.240
 And that's how we generate, if you want,

38:24.240 --> 38:27.240
 the idea of the three persons in God.

38:27.240 --> 38:30.240
 Let me ask you about the church.

38:30.240 --> 38:34.240
 One of the defining characteristics of Catholicism

38:34.240 --> 38:37.240
 is the Catholic church.

38:37.240 --> 38:40.240
 What is the Catholic church?

38:40.240 --> 38:43.240
 I would say it's the mystical body of Jesus.

38:43.240 --> 38:45.240
 So as I said before, it's not an organization.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.240
 If we do it that way, we're going to miss it.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.240
 It's got organizational elements to it.

38:49.240 --> 38:50.240
 So I'm a bishop.

38:50.240 --> 38:53.240
 I'm an office holder within the church.

38:53.240 --> 38:57.240
 But the church is an organism, not an organization.

38:57.240 --> 39:01.240
 So it's a organism of interconnected cells,

39:01.240 --> 39:04.240
 but namely all of the baptized gathered around Christ

39:04.240 --> 39:06.240
 in a mystical union.

39:06.240 --> 39:07.240
 That's the church.

39:07.240 --> 39:10.240
 But there's buildings, there's titles.

39:10.240 --> 39:11.240
 Sure.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.240
 Because it manifests itself institutionally then.

39:14.240 --> 39:18.240
 So are the sort of heavy things about that

39:18.240 --> 39:19.240
 all have to do with pride?

39:19.240 --> 39:20.240
 Yeah, sure.

39:20.240 --> 39:22.240
 Whatever is corrupt in the church.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.240
 Whatever is corrupt in the church,

39:24.240 --> 39:26.240
 of course it comes from pride, from sin.

39:26.240 --> 39:28.240
 And one thing I like about, you know,

39:28.240 --> 39:30.240
 the New Testament is so clear on that.

39:30.240 --> 39:32.240
 It's in his little tiny communities.

39:32.240 --> 39:35.240
 So before there was a Vatican or dioceses or anything.

39:35.240 --> 39:37.240
 Apologies, little tiny communities of Christians

39:37.240 --> 39:39.240
 like in Corinth and Ephesus, you know.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.240
 What's the one thing we know about them?

39:41.240 --> 39:42.240
 Is they fought with each other.

39:42.240 --> 39:45.240
 Because Paul's always upgrading them and telling them,

39:45.240 --> 39:47.240
 come on, would you people get it together?

39:47.240 --> 39:49.240
 And, you know, who's bewitched you?

39:49.240 --> 39:52.240
 And so from the beginning we've been fighting with each other

39:52.240 --> 39:54.240
 because we're made up of sinners.

39:54.240 --> 39:58.240
 And, you know, so one thing we do in Catholic ecclesiology

39:58.240 --> 40:00.240
 is the official name for the study of the church,

40:00.240 --> 40:04.240
 is to talk about the treasure in earthen vessels.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.240
 Paul's language again.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.240
 The treasure is Christ.

40:06.240 --> 40:10.240
 The treasure is the love he's bequeathed to the world.

40:10.240 --> 40:12.240
 That's the treasure that we have.

40:12.240 --> 40:15.240
 But it's always held in these really fragile vessels,

40:15.240 --> 40:16.240
 namely us.

40:16.240 --> 40:18.240
 And so it's going to be marked by corruption and stupidity

40:18.240 --> 40:20.240
 and pride and everything else.

40:20.240 --> 40:23.240
 Well, nevertheless, there's a hierarchy.

40:23.240 --> 40:25.240
 There's titles and so on.

40:25.240 --> 40:28.240
 If we remove pride from the picture,

40:28.240 --> 40:31.240
 so the best possible interpretation of the hierarchy

40:31.240 --> 40:35.240
 that makes up this one organism, this living organism,

40:35.240 --> 40:39.240
 what's the role of the pope, for example?

40:39.240 --> 40:43.240
 What is the role of a bishop, for example?

40:43.240 --> 40:45.240
 Like what is the role of the hierarchy

40:45.240 --> 40:49.240
 in terms of the broader vision of Christianity,

40:49.240 --> 40:51.240
 Catholicism as a religion?

40:51.240 --> 40:54.240
 I'm a devoutee of this guy named Johann Adam Müller

40:54.240 --> 40:57.240
 who was a theologian early part of the 19th century.

40:57.240 --> 41:00.240
 And he was part of the kind of romantic movement.

41:00.240 --> 41:04.240
 And he said the purpose of the pope is to symbolize

41:04.240 --> 41:10.240
 and embody and draw together the unity of the entire church.

41:10.240 --> 41:13.240
 So he's the personal symbol of the unity of the church.

41:13.240 --> 41:14.240
 Who's a bishop?

41:14.240 --> 41:19.240
 The bishop is the personal symbol of the unity of the diocese.

41:19.240 --> 41:20.240
 Who's a pastor of a parish?

41:20.240 --> 41:24.240
 He's the personal symbol of the unity of that parish.

41:24.240 --> 41:27.240
 So he understood it not so much organizationally

41:27.240 --> 41:28.240
 as organically again.

41:28.240 --> 41:34.240
 It was like that around which the pattern organizes itself.

41:34.240 --> 41:37.240
 And if you don't have that unifying figure,

41:37.240 --> 41:39.240
 the community will kind of precipitate.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.240
 And you see that all the time without headship, we would say.

41:42.240 --> 41:47.240
 So it's more symbolic and organic than it is organizational.

41:47.240 --> 41:52.240
 So symbols for community, but there's such fascinating

41:52.240 --> 41:55.240
 peculiarities to each individual symbol.

41:55.240 --> 41:58.240
 There's different characteristics that make up the different people.

41:58.240 --> 42:01.240
 They have different ways of communicating.

42:01.240 --> 42:06.240
 They have different hopes and fears and all that kind of stuff.

42:06.240 --> 42:12.240
 If they're all symbols, what's the role of the different

42:12.240 --> 42:17.240
 peculiarities of those symbols of being an inspiring uniter

42:17.240 --> 42:26.240
 versus maybe a stronger type of more judgmental kind of

42:26.240 --> 42:28.240
 communicator, all that kind of stuff.

42:28.240 --> 42:34.240
 Can you maybe speak to the human part of these symbols?

42:34.240 --> 42:35.240
 Yeah.

42:35.240 --> 42:38.240
 Well, I might just shift to another image of shepherd.

42:38.240 --> 42:40.240
 So that's a classic biblical image.

42:40.240 --> 42:42.240
 As a bishop, I walk around with this thing called a crozier,

42:42.240 --> 42:44.240
 which is a shepherd's staff.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.240
 So it's the symbol of the bishop's office.

42:46.240 --> 42:51.240
 And the crozier, though, is a kind of in your face thing in a way

42:51.240 --> 42:56.240
 because it's got the end of it was meant to hold off wild animals

42:56.240 --> 43:01.240
 and then the crook part of it was meant to bring sheep back to the fold.

43:01.240 --> 43:03.240
 So I walk in with them, oh, this is nice.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.240
 Look at the bishop coming in.

43:04.240 --> 43:08.240
 But that's a kind of in your face symbol that I'm here to defend

43:08.240 --> 43:10.240
 the church against predators.

43:10.240 --> 43:14.240
 And I'm also here to draw people in who are wandering too far away.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.240
 So that's okay.

43:15.240 --> 43:18.240
 I mean, that's part of the role of the hierarchy and the pope

43:18.240 --> 43:20.240
 and bishops and pastors.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.240
 Pastor just means shepherd, right?

43:22.240 --> 43:24.240
 So I'm the shepherd of a parish.

43:24.240 --> 43:25.240
 So that's okay.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.240
 It's not like just all, you know, sunshine and light

43:27.240 --> 43:29.240
 and what a pretty image.

43:29.240 --> 43:33.240
 The one who embodies the unity of the community is also the shepherd.

43:33.240 --> 43:40.240
 Okay, but again, leaning on the human thing, the church is an institution.

43:40.240 --> 43:47.240
 And I don't know if you've heard, but there is an element to power that corrupts.

43:47.240 --> 43:51.240
 An absolute power corrupts, absolutely, as the old saying goes.

43:51.240 --> 43:57.240
 Let me ask you something else that came up on the reddit AMA,

43:57.240 --> 44:00.240
 mega churches and the prosperity gospel.

44:00.240 --> 44:04.240
 And you've mentioned that you may not be a fan.

44:04.240 --> 44:06.240
 What are your views on this?

44:06.240 --> 44:09.240
 And what are your views in general of money and power

44:09.240 --> 44:12.240
 corrupting the heads of these institutions?

44:12.240 --> 44:18.240
 I don't like the prosperity gospel because the gospel is about Jesus journey

44:18.240 --> 44:22.240
 into radical self forgetfulness on the cross.

44:22.240 --> 44:27.240
 And he never makes a promise of earthly well being.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.240
 Can you explain what the prosperity gospel is?

44:29.240 --> 44:33.240
 Yeah, the view that, you know, if I follow Jesus and I follow God with great trust

44:33.240 --> 44:38.240
 that I will be rewarded with wealth and position and status in this world.

44:38.240 --> 44:40.240
 It might be God's will that I get that.

44:40.240 --> 44:44.240
 But, you know, Aquinas said this, if I look at a very sinful person,

44:44.240 --> 44:47.240
 I say, God, he's got a great house and he's richer than I am and all that.

44:47.240 --> 44:50.240
 Aquinas says, yeah, but maybe that's a punishment

44:50.240 --> 44:53.240
 because maybe all that is leading him away from God.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.240
 And actually that's God's way of punishing him.

44:55.240 --> 44:57.240
 And the fact that you don't have wealth in a big house

44:57.240 --> 45:02.240
 is actually a great gift to you because now it frees you for doing God's will.

45:02.240 --> 45:08.240
 So we can't read, you know, God's favor in worldly terms.

45:08.240 --> 45:13.240
 I would say God's favor is, am I awakened to deeper love?

45:13.240 --> 45:15.240
 Then I know that I'm finding God's favor.

45:15.240 --> 45:18.240
 Now God might decide, sure, I want you to have this and that.

45:18.240 --> 45:20.240
 I want to provide this to you.

45:20.240 --> 45:22.240
 Fine. Then I say, thank you, Lord.

45:22.240 --> 45:25.240
 How can I use it as an instrument of love?

45:25.240 --> 45:27.240
 All the masters talk about detachment.

45:27.240 --> 45:29.240
 And that's another reason I don't like the prosperity gospel

45:29.240 --> 45:33.240
 is though I'm getting attached now to all these material advantages.

45:33.240 --> 45:36.240
 And I'm even seeing them as a sign of God's favor.

45:36.240 --> 45:38.240
 Let go of all that.

45:38.240 --> 45:40.240
 You let go of it and use it as a vehicle of love.

45:40.240 --> 45:43.240
 So if you're rich, the right question is, okay, Lord,

45:43.240 --> 45:45.240
 why did you allow me to become rich?

45:45.240 --> 45:47.240
 So what can I do?

45:47.240 --> 45:49.240
 How can my riches be an expression of love?

45:49.240 --> 45:53.240
 If I am popular, if I am healthy, okay, why am I popular?

45:53.240 --> 45:56.240
 Why am I healthy? How can I use that for your good?

45:56.240 --> 45:58.240
 I'm sick in bed.

45:58.240 --> 45:59.240
 I'm suffering.

45:59.240 --> 46:03.240
 Okay, Lord, how can I use that as an expression of love?

46:03.240 --> 46:07.240
 So I'd rather measure it that way than through worldly success.

46:07.240 --> 46:09.240
 That's why I'm against the prosperity gospel.

46:09.240 --> 46:10.240
 Okay.

46:10.240 --> 46:15.240
 So there is, don't seek worldly possessions,

46:15.240 --> 46:19.240
 but whatever happens to you, good or bad,

46:19.240 --> 46:24.240
 seek how that could be used to increase the amount of love in the world.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.240
 Right.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.240
 The image I love for this is the Wheel of Fortune,

46:27.240 --> 46:30.240
 which is a device on a lot of the Gothic cathedrals,

46:30.240 --> 46:32.240
 and it's this great circle, right, this wheel.

46:32.240 --> 46:34.240
 At the top of it is a king,

46:34.240 --> 46:36.240
 and then it turns this way, and as the king has lost his crown,

46:36.240 --> 46:38.240
 and the bottom is a pauper,

46:38.240 --> 46:42.240
 and then over here is a king, is a guy climbing up to power, right?

46:42.240 --> 46:45.240
 And then in the middle is a depiction of Christ.

46:45.240 --> 46:49.240
 And the idea is very simple, but very profound, that the wheel is life, you know?

46:49.240 --> 46:51.240
 It's sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down.

46:51.240 --> 46:54.240
 Sometimes you have power and popularity and prestige.

46:54.240 --> 46:56.240
 Other times you're losing it, you're going down.

46:56.240 --> 46:57.240
 Other times you've got none of it.

46:57.240 --> 46:59.240
 Other times you're coming back up.

46:59.240 --> 47:00.240
 Okay.

47:00.240 --> 47:01.240
 Don't live on the rim of the wheel.

47:01.240 --> 47:02.240
 It'll make you crazy.

47:02.240 --> 47:05.240
 Every point on the rim of the wheel is a point of anxiety.

47:05.240 --> 47:09.240
 Where you should live is the center of the wheel, where Christ is, right?

47:09.240 --> 47:13.240
 Because that's the link now to the eternity of God.

47:13.240 --> 47:17.240
 That's the point of love, where love can flow through you to the world.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.240
 And then you can look at the wheel.

47:19.240 --> 47:21.240
 You're a Beatles fan, right?

47:21.240 --> 47:22.240
 I think I discovered that.

47:22.240 --> 47:23.240
 I love the Beatles.

47:23.240 --> 47:27.240
 And the song that always comes to my mind when I think of that image is John Lennon,

47:27.240 --> 47:29.240
 the end of his life.

47:29.240 --> 47:33.240
 So a guy that, I mean, rode the Wheel of Fortune like crazy, you know?

47:33.240 --> 47:36.240
 He was at the top of the world in every way.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.240
 And then Beatles break up, and he kind of loses it,

47:39.240 --> 47:42.240
 and then he's at the lost weekend in the 70s at the very bottom.

47:42.240 --> 47:45.240
 When he died, he was just kind of coming back up again.

47:45.240 --> 47:48.240
 But the song I always think of is watching the wheels, right?

47:48.240 --> 47:50.240
 I'm just sitting here watching the wheels go round and round.

47:50.240 --> 47:54.240
 I really love to watch them roll, because I'm no longer riding on the merry go round.

47:54.240 --> 47:59.240
 That's right out of the medieval mystics, that he's not riding on the wheel.

47:59.240 --> 48:01.240
 He's just watching it go round and round.

48:01.240 --> 48:08.240
 That's the point of the Greeks call it apothea, and the Latins call it indifference, you know?

48:08.240 --> 48:16.240
 Not like I'm blasé, it just means I'm detached from success, failure, less success, more success.

48:16.240 --> 48:18.240
 I'm detached from that.

48:18.240 --> 48:22.240
 I'm sitting here watching the wheels go round and round, because I'm not riding on it anymore.

48:22.240 --> 48:25.240
 The mystics have always made that transition.

48:25.240 --> 48:34.240
 Let me ask you a difficult question about the darker side of human nature, of human power, of institutions.

48:34.240 --> 48:41.240
 What's your view on the long history and widespread reports of sexual abuse of children by a Catholic priest?

48:41.240 --> 48:45.240
 So this is a difficult topic, but maybe an important one to shine the light on.

48:45.240 --> 48:47.240
 Yeah, it's awful, you know?

48:47.240 --> 48:52.240
 And it's been a problem, go back to Peter Damian, back in the 11th century, who was talking about it.

48:52.240 --> 48:59.240
 So it's been a problem, and whenever really sinful human beings have been in close proximity to children, we find this issue.

48:59.240 --> 49:00.240
 Has it been around the church?

49:00.240 --> 49:09.240
 Yes. Has it surfaced in a kind of sickening way in the last 30 years? Absolutely.

49:09.240 --> 49:13.240
 I'm glad the church has made important strides, and it has.

49:13.240 --> 49:24.240
 Back in 2002, there was, I think, all the Dallas Accords where the bishops of America put a lot of these protocols in place that really have been effective at ameliorating this problem.

49:24.240 --> 49:29.240
 The numbers spiked in the 70s and 80s, and that's been demonstrated over and over again.

49:29.240 --> 49:31.240
 And then they fell dramatically after that.

49:31.240 --> 49:36.240
 So that's not to excuse anything, but it's to say I think progress has been made with it.

49:36.240 --> 49:38.240
 What's the impulse to secrecy?

49:38.240 --> 49:43.240
 Yeah, well, to protect institutions, you know, and that's always, that's a sinful instinct.

49:43.240 --> 49:52.240
 I'm not altogether, I mean, sure, an institution is worth protecting, but if it reaches the point where you're indifferent to people's well being, then you're in trouble.

49:52.240 --> 50:01.240
 So institutions role should be transparent and honest with the sins of its members and of itself.

50:01.240 --> 50:04.240
 Sure. Yeah.

50:04.240 --> 50:21.240
 So maybe you can speak to the fact as a priest, a bishop, as part of Catholicism, you're not allowed to marry, you're not allowed to have sex, you're sworn to celibacy.

50:21.240 --> 50:33.240
 What is behind that idea? What is the sort of, we talked about some broad stroke ideas of love, what's behind the idea of celibacy?

50:33.240 --> 50:35.240
 And that's a good way to get at it. It's a path of love.

50:35.240 --> 50:42.240
 So the church is always in favor of inculcating love. Marriage is a path of love, but so is celibacy.

50:42.240 --> 50:53.240
 St. Paul talks about someone who is preoccupied with the things of this world and family and those who are free from that are free or for doing the work of God.

50:53.240 --> 50:58.240
 So that's kind of a pragmatic justification for celibacy. And we still, I think, take that seriously.

50:58.240 --> 51:09.240
 Look at my own life. I mean, celibacy has enabled me to do all kinds of things and go places and minister in a way that I could not if I had been married.

51:09.240 --> 51:17.240
 So I get it. I get the pragmatic side, but I'm more interested in the sort of mystical side of it.

51:17.240 --> 51:22.240
 Ever Jesus was challenged about the person who had, you know, a whole series of husbands and then they all died.

51:22.240 --> 51:26.240
 And so in heaven, which one will, you know, which husband will the wife have?

51:26.240 --> 51:31.240
 And his answer is in heaven, people don't marry and they're not given in marriage.

51:31.240 --> 51:37.240
 There's a higher way of love. It's a more radical way of love. It's not tied to a particular.

51:37.240 --> 51:40.240
 But I think through God is tied to everybody.

51:40.240 --> 51:50.240
 The celibate, and this has been to the beginning of the church, not as a law, but there were, there were celibates from the very beginning of the church, including Jesus, of course, and Paul.

51:50.240 --> 51:58.240
 They sense something that that way of living mystically anticipates the way we'll love in heaven.

51:58.240 --> 52:04.240
 It's a sign even now within this world of how we will all love in heaven.

52:04.240 --> 52:09.240
 So in that way, it's a bit like pacifists.

52:09.240 --> 52:18.240
 I'm glad there are pacifists in the church, and I've known some, you know, some very powerful witnesses to pacifism.

52:18.240 --> 52:31.240
 I'm glad there are pacifists because they witness even now to how we will be in heaven when every tear is wiped away and we beat our swords into plowshares and, you know, heaven's a place of radical peace, that some people even now live it.

52:31.240 --> 52:45.240
 At the same time, I'm glad not everyone's a pacifist because I would hold with the church to just war theory that there's sometimes all we can do in this finite world is to fight, you know, manifest wickedness.

52:45.240 --> 52:49.240
 And just in the same way there's just sex?

52:49.240 --> 52:54.240
 Well, no, right. I'm glad there are celibates, but I'm glad not everyone's a celibate. I wouldn't want that.

52:54.240 --> 53:03.240
 I mean, because married love is a marvelous expression of the divine love. So that's why it's good there are some. And it's always been a small number.

53:03.240 --> 53:18.240
 The actual experience of it, would you, the spiritual nature of it, is it similar to fasting? So I've been enjoying fasting recently, so not eating for several days, that kind of stuff.

53:18.240 --> 53:26.240
 And that somehow brings you even deeper. I'm in general in love with everything and with nature and everything. I see the beauty in the world.

53:26.240 --> 53:31.240
 But there's a greater intensity to that when you're fasting, for example.

53:31.240 --> 53:36.240
 Yeah, I might use the language of, you know, sublimation or redirection of energy and all that.

53:36.240 --> 53:50.240
 I think that's true. There's a certain sublimation of energies into prayer, into mysticism, into ministry, a redirection of energies.

53:50.240 --> 53:57.240
 So it's meant to be life enhancing. The same way fasting is, it's meant ultimately to be life enhancing and make you healthier and happier.

53:57.240 --> 54:02.240
 So celibacy is a path of love. And I think it does involve you a certain redirection of energies.

54:02.240 --> 54:12.240
 Don't you think, do you think it's a heavy burden for some humans to bear, for some priests to bear?

54:12.240 --> 54:21.240
 Is that the thing, given the sexual abuse scandal, is that the thing that breaks?

54:21.240 --> 54:27.240
 No, I wouldn't tie that to celibacy. And that's been demonstrated over and over again.

54:27.240 --> 54:34.240
 There's a priest named Andrew Greeley, who was a priest from my home diocese of Chicago. And Andy did a lot of research, he was a sociologist of religion.

54:34.240 --> 54:42.240
 He did a lot of research into that very question. And there really is not a correlation between celibacy per se and the sexual abuse of children or of anybody.

54:42.240 --> 54:44.240
 So I wouldn't make that correlation.

54:44.240 --> 54:48.240
 So bad people, sinful people are going to do what they're going to do.

54:48.240 --> 55:00.240
 I think people who have a tendency toward abusing children sexually are drawn to situations where they get ready access to kids and they get institutional cover.

55:00.240 --> 55:08.240
 So that's the thing I'm going to go through the list of, you know, from sports and boy scouts, et cetera. And that's been proven again and again.

55:08.240 --> 55:11.240
 So I would tie it more to that. I wouldn't tie it to celibacy.

55:11.240 --> 55:25.240
 So the challenge, of course, there's all kinds of, you said institutional cover, there's all kinds of institutions that cover for people that don't, that do evil onto the world to do sinful things onto the world.

55:25.240 --> 55:40.240
 But there's something about the church, which is the, as an organism is supposed to be an embodiment of good in this world, of love in this world, and it breaks people's hearts to see this kind of even a small amount.

55:40.240 --> 55:48.240
 This kind of thing happened within the church. It wakes you up to the cruelty, the absurdity of the world sometimes.

55:48.240 --> 55:59.240
 It's back to the question of why do bad things happen to good people? Why does God allow this kind of thing to happen?

55:59.240 --> 56:04.240
 And sort of maybe unanswerable question. Do you have an answer to that question?

56:04.240 --> 56:15.240
 I can gesture toward it using rather abstract language, which is true enough. It's completely emotionally unsatisfying, but it's naming it truthfully enough.

56:15.240 --> 56:23.240
 And it goes back to Augustine, which is God permits evil to bring about a greater good.

56:23.240 --> 56:32.240
 Now, again, I know how unsatisfying that sort of spare austere language can sound, but it gets us off the horns of a dilemma.

56:32.240 --> 56:38.240
 Aquinas, you know, when he lays out a question, he always has the objections first. So is there a God?

56:38.240 --> 56:46.240
 Well, objection one, objection two, objection three. And he's really talk about steel manning and argument. Aquinas is great at that.

56:46.240 --> 56:51.240
 One of the really steel manned arguments. Is that the right grammatical form?

56:51.240 --> 56:55.240
 One of the, what's the past participle of the steel man?

56:55.240 --> 57:01.240
 But one of the best arguments, he formulates it this way.

57:01.240 --> 57:06.240
 If one of two contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed.

57:06.240 --> 57:11.240
 And as example from his medieval physics, he goes, if there were an infinite heat, there'd be no cold, right?

57:11.240 --> 57:18.240
 But God is described as infinitely good. Therefore, if God exists, there should be no evil.

57:18.240 --> 57:25.240
 But there is evil. Therefore, God does not exist. That's a darn good argument. That's a really persuasive argument.

57:25.240 --> 57:31.240
 And I think, I've done this for a long time in apologetics and in sort of higher philosophy.

57:31.240 --> 57:37.240
 That's the best argument against God. But here's something, I press head with it.

57:37.240 --> 57:44.240
 Something I find really interesting. I think the three best arguments against God all come from within the religious tradition.

57:44.240 --> 57:52.240
 Namely, the book of Job. So Job, he's great. I mean, he's a great guy. He does everything right.

57:52.240 --> 58:00.240
 He's God's great servant. And he's punished in every possible way. He has every possible suffering.

58:00.240 --> 58:06.240
 Aquinas is argument from the summa. And then, to your friend and mine, Dostoevsky.

58:06.240 --> 58:13.240
 I think in the brothers Karamazov, Ivan's argument when he's trying to wreck the faith of Alyosha.

58:13.240 --> 58:24.240
 And it's these examples drawn, they think, from Dostoevsky, from the headlines of his own time of the most abject cruelty to children.

58:24.240 --> 58:34.240
 Like an innocent child being made to suffer. How in God's name could that happen if God exists and he's all good?

58:34.240 --> 58:41.240
 So I get it. But see, the book of Job, Thomas Aquinas, Dostoevsky, these are all profoundly believing people.

58:41.240 --> 58:50.240
 And I hear Stephen Fry, the famously atheist writer, he will bring out this argument with great authority.

58:50.240 --> 58:58.240
 He does. Children with bone cancer and worms that go into the eyes of children and blind them before they kill them.

58:58.240 --> 59:06.240
 But he's been preceded by the author of Job, Thomas Aquinas and Dostoevsky, who stood right.

59:06.240 --> 59:12.240
 And think of Job in the whirlwind. He stands there in the whirlwind.

59:12.240 --> 59:20.240
 So you can't blame the Christian tradition for not dealing with this problem, for like brushing it under the carpet.

59:20.240 --> 59:23.240
 I mean, it has stood in the whirlwind of this problem.

59:23.240 --> 59:29.240
 It's still a difficult problem to deal with that there's all this cruelty of the world.

59:29.240 --> 59:40.240
 There's a lot of example through history, just in my own family history with the Soviet Union, with Stalin.

59:40.240 --> 59:52.240
 The atrocities that Stalin has brought onto the people of the Soviet Union throughout the 20th century is nearly immeasurable.

59:52.240 --> 1:00:02.240
 And yet, when you look at the entirety of human history, you'll see progress, not just the Soviet Union, but the entirety of the civilization throughout the 20th century.

1:00:02.240 --> 1:00:05.240
 And Stalin has a role to play.

1:00:05.240 --> 1:00:14.240
 There's a dark aspect to somehow evil that helps us make progress.

1:00:14.240 --> 1:00:18.240
 And I don't know how to put that in the calculation.

1:00:18.240 --> 1:00:23.240
 On the local scale, I want to alleviate suffering.

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:31.240
 I'm probably heavily lean pacifist, not out of weakness, but out of strength.

1:00:31.240 --> 1:00:41.240
 But man, it does seem that history sprinkled with evil and that evil does somehow nudges towards good.

1:00:41.240 --> 1:00:44.240
 Yes, sometimes we can see it.

1:00:44.240 --> 1:00:53.240
 And that's where the idea comes from, that evil is permitted to bring about some greater good, and we can sometimes really see it.

1:00:53.240 --> 1:00:55.240
 Can we always see it? No.

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:57.240
 In fact, typically we don't see it.

1:00:57.240 --> 1:01:02.240
 But now you bring another factor into this, which is the difference between our minds and God's mind.

1:01:02.240 --> 1:01:11.240
 So our minds, I mean, look, even they're remarkably capacious, but they take in a tiny, tiny, tiny swath of space and time.

1:01:11.240 --> 1:01:22.240
 And even our eyes can take in so much of the light spectrum and these little ape sensorium that we have that can just take in a little tiny bit of reality, really.

1:01:22.240 --> 1:01:28.240
 How are we ever in a position to say, oh no, there's no possible good that would ever come from that?

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:34.240
 Even the greatest evil that Dostoevsky can conjure up and Stephen Frye.

1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:42.240
 Still, how could we have the arrogance to say, I know there's no good that could ever come from that.

1:01:42.240 --> 1:01:47.240
 I know there's no morally justifiable reason why God would ever permit that.

1:01:47.240 --> 1:01:51.240
 Because I think that's hubris to the nth degree for us to say that.

1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:57.240
 And that's the assumption behind this claim that God can permit evil to bring about a greater good.

1:01:57.240 --> 1:02:09.240
 Now, God understands it, but we're like little kids, you know, like a four year old and their parents make a decision and we say, what, why in the world would you do this to me?

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:12.240
 This is my pastoral experience.

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:18.240
 Years ago, there was a young father and his son was like three or something and he was in the hospital for something.

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:21.240
 I forgot what it was, but he had to undergo surgery, right?

1:02:21.240 --> 1:02:31.240
 So after the surgery, he's in great pain, this poor kid, this three year old kid, and the dad was there with him, you know, holding his hand and, you know, and the son, this is what the father told me.

1:02:31.240 --> 1:02:35.240
 He said, he's looking at me like, what gives here?

1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:37.240
 I mean, why would you, you love me?

1:02:37.240 --> 1:02:39.240
 I've always assumed that.

1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:46.240
 And yet you're presiding over this somehow, you're approving of this and doing nothing to get me out of it, right?

1:02:46.240 --> 1:02:55.240
 And he said the kid couldn't articulate that, but his eyes did and his, and the father said, it was just killing me because I knew I couldn't explain it to him.

1:02:55.240 --> 1:02:56.240
 And it's true.

1:02:56.240 --> 1:03:05.240
 I mean, he could vaguely gesture toward, but the kid didn't understand surgery and cutting his body and taking things out of it and that this was going to, you know, make him much better in the long run.

1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:12.240
 But I remember thinking, that's a great metaphor for us vis a vis God is, here's God, infinitely loving God who's with us all the time.

1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:16.240
 And we say, what are you doing? Why aren't you taking this away from me?

1:03:16.240 --> 1:03:23.240
 And the answer, I mean, ultimately is trust, trust me, trust me, surrender to me.

1:03:23.240 --> 1:03:30.240
 And when we don't, that's getting trouble with the old pride and the hubris and all that kind of stuff.

1:03:30.240 --> 1:03:31.240
 Yeah.

1:03:31.240 --> 1:03:36.240
 No, but trust me when I tell you, I mean, I completely get it in my own life.

1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:41.240
 And as a priest, you're dealing with suffering all the time with people in pain all the time.

1:03:41.240 --> 1:03:47.240
 I remember as a young priest, there was a, there was a policeman in our parish.

1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:52.240
 So he had a gun and inexplicably, no one had any clue.

1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:56.240
 He got up one night and shot his son to death and then shot himself.

1:03:56.240 --> 1:03:58.240
 This is my parish.

1:03:58.240 --> 1:04:00.240
 So I went to the, the wake.

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:04.240
 I remember I show up and I'm this young, you have 27 year old goofball priest.

1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:10.240
 I'm like, we're on the collar and I, I walk in and there were two coffins, the two coffins in the room.

1:04:10.240 --> 1:04:16.240
 There's the son and the father and the mother was there and she, she went like this to me.

1:04:16.240 --> 1:04:18.240
 Like, like, she saw me.

1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:20.240
 Like, you're the, you're the religious guy here.

1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:21.240
 Yeah.

1:04:21.240 --> 1:04:22.240
 What?

1:04:22.240 --> 1:04:26.240
 And just by instinct, I, I went like that too.

1:04:26.240 --> 1:04:29.240
 I'm like, I don't, I don't know what to tell.

1:04:29.240 --> 1:04:32.240
 I can't, I don't have an answer for you.

1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:36.240
 But, but I was there and I'm not saying to pat myself on the back.

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:41.240
 That's, that's where the church goes because Jesus went there.

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:45.240
 And now we're gesturing toward a more theological response.

1:04:45.240 --> 1:04:47.240
 The first one's more austerely philosophical.

1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:49.240
 God permits evil to bring about a good.

1:04:49.240 --> 1:04:52.240
 But the theological response is that's where Christ went.

1:04:52.240 --> 1:04:54.240
 Is he went all the way down?

1:04:54.240 --> 1:05:04.240
 He went all the way down into our suffering and see the cross as the limit case of, of evil.

1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:12.240
 Humiliation and cruelty and institutional injustice and psychological suffering and spiritual suffering and death.

1:05:12.240 --> 1:05:13.240
 It's all there.

1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:15.240
 And that's where the son of God went.

1:05:15.240 --> 1:05:19.240
 And I would say that's why as, as a priest, I went there.

1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:21.240
 That's my job is to go to those places, you know.

1:05:21.240 --> 1:05:25.240
 So that's the ultimate answer to the problem.

1:05:25.240 --> 1:05:33.240
 So there is, we can't comprehend it, but there is meaning to the suffering and the injustice.

1:05:33.240 --> 1:05:34.240
 We trust this.

1:05:34.240 --> 1:05:38.240
 We trust it because we know on other grounds of God's existence.

1:05:38.240 --> 1:05:42.240
 Yeah, I would resist the claim that, well, this is such a, such a knockdown argument.

1:05:42.240 --> 1:05:43.240
 So now we know there is no God.

1:05:43.240 --> 1:05:46.240
 I would say, no, there are all kinds of other rational warrants for God.

1:05:46.240 --> 1:05:49.240
 And so I, I know that God exists.

1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:51.240
 I know that God is infinite love.

1:05:51.240 --> 1:05:53.240
 And now I got to square that with this experience.

1:05:53.240 --> 1:06:00.240
 And the way I do that is by a trusting confidence that God knows what he's about.

1:06:00.240 --> 1:06:04.240
 You know, again, I know how, how inadequate that always seems to anyone who's suffering,

1:06:04.240 --> 1:06:07.240
 including myself, when I'm in great suffering.

1:06:07.240 --> 1:06:11.240
 But I think that's the best that we've done in the great tradition.

1:06:11.240 --> 1:06:17.240
 So if you were to steal man, the case against God or the existence of God,

1:06:17.240 --> 1:06:22.240
 you find the most convincing argument is there's evil in the world.

1:06:22.240 --> 1:06:23.240
 Yeah.

1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:24.240
 Therefore there's no God.

1:06:24.240 --> 1:06:25.240
 There's too much of it.

1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:26.240
 Yeah.

1:06:26.240 --> 1:06:28.240
 If I were to steal man, that argument, I do what Stephen Fry does.

1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:30.240
 I would do what Dostoevsky's Yvon does.

1:06:30.240 --> 1:06:31.240
 I would do exactly that.

1:06:31.240 --> 1:06:34.240
 I would say there's just too much.

1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:37.240
 And then if you want to keep pressing it, animal suffering.

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:43.240
 So we talk about human suffering, but the suffering of animals over the eons and so on.

1:06:43.240 --> 1:06:49.240
 Isn't there just too much suffering to be reconciled with an infinitely good God?

1:06:49.240 --> 1:06:51.240
 And that's, again, Thomas Aquinas.

1:06:51.240 --> 1:06:54.240
 I've just used his very steal manned argument.

1:06:54.240 --> 1:07:03.240
 You mentioned that, again, on Reddit, somebody asked who your favorite communicator of atheist ideas was,

1:07:03.240 --> 1:07:05.240
 and you mentioned Christopher Hitchens.

1:07:05.240 --> 1:07:06.240
 Yeah.

1:07:06.240 --> 1:07:14.240
 Are there other ideas for atheism that you find particularly challenging?

1:07:14.240 --> 1:07:16.240
 Well, that's the one.

1:07:16.240 --> 1:07:17.240
 It's the problem of evil.

1:07:17.240 --> 1:07:22.240
 The other objection in Aquinas, which has a lot of contemporary resonance,

1:07:22.240 --> 1:07:26.240
 is can't we just explain everything through natural causes?

1:07:26.240 --> 1:07:30.240
 Why would you have to invoke a cause beyond the causes in the world?

1:07:30.240 --> 1:07:36.240
 So as I'm trying to explain, let's say for Aquinas, motion, causality, finality,

1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:39.240
 can I just do that with natural causes?

1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:41.240
 Wouldn't that suffice to explain it?

1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:46.240
 So I get like when naturalists are speaking or people that are pure materialists,

1:07:46.240 --> 1:07:54.240
 they'll just say, no, that's perfectly adequate, a scientific account of reality is utterly adequate to our experience.

1:07:54.240 --> 1:07:59.240
 So I would steal man that and say, well, show me why we need something more.

1:07:59.240 --> 1:08:03.240
 And to do that, you got to get out of Plato's cave, it seems to me,

1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:15.240
 because my objection to naturalism is it's staying within the realm of the immediately empirically observable

1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:19.240
 and making the mistake of saying, that's all there is to being.

1:08:19.240 --> 1:08:22.240
 That's all there is that needs to be explained.

1:08:22.240 --> 1:08:27.240
 And long before we get to religion, just stay with Plato.

1:08:27.240 --> 1:08:32.240
 The first step out of the cave, if you combine it now with the parable of the line, is mathematical objects.

1:08:32.240 --> 1:08:39.240
 And I'm with those, the many people that would say, mathematics is an experience of the immaterial.

1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:48.240
 I've stepped out of a merely empirical, physical, naturalistic world the minute I understand a pure number

1:08:48.240 --> 1:08:55.240
 or a pure equation or a pure mathematical relationship, which would obtain in any possible world,

1:08:55.240 --> 1:08:58.240
 which are not tied to space and time.

1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:01.240
 That's a first step out of the cave.

1:09:01.240 --> 1:09:05.240
 And then that leads to the more metaphysical reflections.

1:09:05.240 --> 1:09:09.240
 For example, on the nature of being, so I could talk about this thing as a physical object

1:09:09.240 --> 1:09:15.240
 and I can analyze it at all kinds of levels and follow all the scientists up and down through this thing.

1:09:15.240 --> 1:09:17.240
 Fine, fine, but I'm still in Plato's cave.

1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:20.240
 I'm still looking at the flickering images on the wall.

1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:27.240
 But when I step out of that into the mathematical realm, I have entered a different realm of being, seems to me.

1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:32.240
 Do you think it's possible for the cave to expand so large that it encompasses the whole world?

1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:41.240
 Meaning, is it possible that we're just clueless right now in terms of scientifically speaking

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:44.240
 with most of the world we haven't figured out yet?

1:09:44.240 --> 1:09:50.240
 But do you think it's possible through science to know God to look outside the world?

1:09:50.240 --> 1:09:57.240
 So it's fundamentally the limit of the empirical scientific method is that we can't know some of these very big questions.

1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:02.240
 No, I'm not a scientist and I was never all that good at science.

1:10:02.240 --> 1:10:06.240
 I was more of a humanities guy, but I love and respect the scientists, but I hate scientism.

1:10:06.240 --> 1:10:13.240
 And scientism is rampant today with especially young people, the reduction of all knowledge to the scientific form of knowledge.

1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:16.240
 And I'm a vehement opponent of that.

1:10:16.240 --> 1:10:24.240
 There are dimensions of being that are not capturable through a scientific method of mere observation, hypothesis formation, experimentation, etc.

1:10:24.240 --> 1:10:29.240
 As great as that is, as wonderful as that is, but it's still, I think, within Plato's cave.

1:10:29.240 --> 1:10:31.240
 And that's not to say it's not real.

1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:34.240
 It's just at a relatively low level of reality.

1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:37.240
 You step out of Plato's cave when you go into the impure mathematics.

1:10:37.240 --> 1:10:42.240
 That's why you know that article, I just came across it recently and discovered this whole literature around it,

1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:50.240
 is Eugene Wigner's article in 1960 called the unreasonable applicability of mathematics to the physical sciences.

1:10:50.240 --> 1:10:51.240
 I think that's the title of it.

1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:53.240
 Or effectiveness or something like that.

1:10:53.240 --> 1:10:54.240
 Yeah.

1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:56.240
 But what's so cool is that he's not a religious man.

1:10:56.240 --> 1:11:01.240
 He was kind of a secular Jew, but yet he uses the word miracle like eight times in that article.

1:11:01.240 --> 1:11:13.240
 And because he just is so impressed by the fact that high complex mathematics describes so accurately the physical world and could be used to create things and to manipulate.

1:11:13.240 --> 1:11:15.240
 And why should that be true?

1:11:15.240 --> 1:11:19.240
 That there's something very weirdly mysterious about that relationship.

1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:25.240
 And I would say it's because you stepped into a higher order of being, which is inclusive of a lower level of being.

1:11:25.240 --> 1:11:32.240
 That's the Platonic approach is that as you move, now I'm going to different metaphor, you move to higher levels, they're inclusive of the lower levels.

1:11:32.240 --> 1:11:44.240
 Yeah, there's some magic there that seems to at least in our current understanding of science to be not quite capturable, even consciousness, the idea of consciousness.

1:11:44.240 --> 1:11:47.240
 Can I ask you, where do you think the laws of nature come from?

1:11:47.240 --> 1:11:55.240
 So I mean, sort of the Wigner question, where does the deep mathematical structure of things come from?

1:11:55.240 --> 1:11:56.240
 How do you explain that?

1:11:56.240 --> 1:12:03.240
 The mathematical structure or the fact that the structures is somehow pleasing and beautiful.

1:12:03.240 --> 1:12:05.240
 Because those are different.

1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:06.240
 Those are two different.

1:12:06.240 --> 1:12:07.240
 We'll do the first one.

1:12:07.240 --> 1:12:10.240
 I'm curious, where do you think it comes from?

1:12:10.240 --> 1:12:14.240
 I tend to believe even in terms of physics, we don't really know what's going on.

1:12:14.240 --> 1:12:18.240
 There's so, so, so much more to be discovered.

1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:23.240
 We're walking around in the dark trying to figure out a little puzzles here and there.

1:12:23.240 --> 1:12:27.240
 And we're patting ourselves in the back and how many puzzles we've discovered so far.

1:12:27.240 --> 1:12:29.240
 Even Gato's in completeness theorem.

1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:32.240
 What are the limits of mathematics, axiomatic systems?

1:12:32.240 --> 1:12:36.240
 I don't know what is the purpose of mathematics.

1:12:36.240 --> 1:12:45.240
 What is the power of mathematics? Is it just a useful tool to study the world around us?

1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:49.240
 Or is it something deeper that we're just discovering?

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:54.240
 All I know from my emotional perspective, now I am an engineer.

1:12:54.240 --> 1:12:56.240
 I'm a robotics AI person.

1:12:56.240 --> 1:12:59.240
 From an emotional perspective, I just find the whole thing beautiful.

1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:01.240
 Yeah, but that's really cool to me.

1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:03.240
 That's a very interesting clue.

1:13:03.240 --> 1:13:07.240
 One of the arguments for God is based on the intelligibility of the world.

1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:10.240
 It's like Wigner. It's a very peculiar fact.

1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:12.240
 It seems to me that the world is so radically intelligible.

1:13:12.240 --> 1:13:14.240
 Why should that be true?

1:13:14.240 --> 1:13:18.240
 Why should it be the case that being has this intelligible structure to it?

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:21.240
 So it corresponds to an inquiring mind.

1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:27.240
 So Aquinas can say that the intelligible enact is the intellect enact.

1:13:27.240 --> 1:13:32.240
 Meaning there's some deep correspondence between this and that.

1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:34.240
 And I'm with Wigner.

1:13:34.240 --> 1:13:38.240
 That's, I think, really weird and unreasonable and strange.

1:13:38.240 --> 1:13:45.240
 Now, my answer is because the creator of the universe is a great mind

1:13:45.240 --> 1:13:50.240
 and has stamped the world with intelligibility.

1:13:50.240 --> 1:13:52.240
 In the beginning was the word, right?

1:13:52.240 --> 1:13:55.240
 And the word was with God and all things came to be through the word.

1:13:55.240 --> 1:13:58.240
 We shouldn't picture that so much.

1:13:58.240 --> 1:14:01.240
 It's gesturing in this very powerful direction.

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:07.240
 There's an intelligence that has imbued the world with intelligibility.

1:14:07.240 --> 1:14:09.240
 And we discover that, you know?

1:14:09.240 --> 1:14:12.240
 There's something about the simplicity of the way the world works.

1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:15.240
 That's where the beauty comes from.

1:14:15.240 --> 1:14:20.240
 And yes, there's something profound to the mechanism, whatever that is.

1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:23.240
 God that brought that to be.

1:14:23.240 --> 1:14:25.240
 That thought it into being.

1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:28.240
 That the world has been, when the Bible says that God said,

1:14:28.240 --> 1:14:31.240
 let there be light and there was light, God said, well, again,

1:14:31.240 --> 1:14:36.240
 we don't literalize the poetry, but it's very rich that God spoke the world into being.

1:14:36.240 --> 1:14:41.240
 So that means it's been imbued with intelligibility from the beginning.

1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:46.240
 They say that, you know, the condition for the possibility of the western physical sciences

1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:50.240
 was a basically Christian idea, namely that the world is not God.

1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:53.240
 Therefore, I can analyze it, experiment upon it.

1:14:53.240 --> 1:14:55.240
 I don't divinize it.

1:14:55.240 --> 1:14:57.240
 I don't have a mystical relation to the world.

1:14:57.240 --> 1:14:58.240
 It's not God.

1:14:58.240 --> 1:15:03.240
 But secondly, that it's absolutely and every nook and cranny intelligible.

1:15:03.240 --> 1:15:06.240
 And those two ideas are correlated to the idea of creation.

1:15:06.240 --> 1:15:07.240
 So it's been created.

1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:08.240
 It's not God.

1:15:08.240 --> 1:15:09.240
 It's other than God.

1:15:09.240 --> 1:15:13.240
 But yet it's touched in every dimension by God's mind.

1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:16.240
 And when those two things are in place, the sciences get underway.

1:15:16.240 --> 1:15:19.240
 You know, I don't worship the world anymore,

1:15:19.240 --> 1:15:22.240
 but I'm also utterly confident I can come to know it.

1:15:22.240 --> 1:15:24.240
 And those are theological ideas.

1:15:24.240 --> 1:15:30.240
 Well, we live in this world, so we can solve quite a lot of problems of this world

1:15:30.240 --> 1:15:34.240
 by making the assumption that this world is fully understandable.

1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:37.240
 And we don't need to worry about what's outside the world in some sense

1:15:37.240 --> 1:15:43.240
 in order to build bridges and rockets and computers and all that kind of stuff.

1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:49.240
 It's only when we get to the questions that are deeper about why we're here at all.

1:15:49.240 --> 1:15:51.240
 What does it mean to be good?

1:15:51.240 --> 1:15:54.240
 All those kinds of things do we need to reach outside of this world?

1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:56.240
 Well, can I interrupt another one?

1:15:56.240 --> 1:15:57.240
 So I talked about mathematics.

1:15:57.240 --> 1:15:58.240
 I think it's stepping out of the cave.

1:15:58.240 --> 1:16:02.240
 It's stepping out of just the purely empirical, you know, world.

1:16:02.240 --> 1:16:06.240
 But the very fact that we use a word like universe, to me, is very interesting.

1:16:06.240 --> 1:16:13.240
 Even if you say multiple universes, to me, it's like, well, whatever the whole is, the totality.

1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:17.240
 Universum, turn toward the one.

1:16:17.240 --> 1:16:18.240
 Why would we call it that?

1:16:18.240 --> 1:16:20.240
 Why would we just call it an aggregate?

1:16:20.240 --> 1:16:22.240
 You know, it's just an aggregate of stuff.

1:16:22.240 --> 1:16:23.240
 It's an aggregate of all kinds.

1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:25.240
 But we call it a universe.

1:16:25.240 --> 1:16:30.240
 And my answer from the classical metaphysical tradition is, it's the intuition of being.

1:16:30.240 --> 1:16:35.240
 So I immediately experience things here, the color and shape, and I can measure them.

1:16:35.240 --> 1:16:39.240
 But when I've really stepped out of the cave and I've now engaged beyond mathematics even,

1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:41.240
 I'm now into metaphysical reflection.

1:16:41.240 --> 1:16:46.240
 I'm interested not just in this thing as an object and how it's colored and shaped

1:16:46.240 --> 1:16:48.240
 and what its atoms and quarks and all that are.

1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:49.240
 That's fine.

1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:53.240
 But I'm interested now in, what does it mean to say this thing is real?

1:16:53.240 --> 1:16:55.240
 So what makes this a being?

1:16:55.240 --> 1:16:58.240
 And then what are the characteristics of being?

1:16:58.240 --> 1:17:02.240
 So now from Aristotle to Heidegger, you know, this question of the nature of being.

1:17:02.240 --> 1:17:07.240
 I would say we call it a universe because it's turned toward the one of being.

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:12.240
 It's this intuition that whatever, from quarks to galaxies to whatever,

1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:17.240
 give me a billion other universes, it would still be existence, right?

1:17:17.240 --> 1:17:22.240
 It's turned toward the one that being unites our experience.

1:17:22.240 --> 1:17:24.240
 And so now I'm at the metaphysical level of analysis.

1:17:24.240 --> 1:17:27.240
 I've taken another step out of the cave.

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:31.240
 In Plato's language, I'm at the formal level now beyond mathematics level of forms.

1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:36.240
 And the formal is inclusive of the mathematical, which is inclusive of the physical.

1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:40.240
 And I think that's Eugene Wigner, is that the mathematical includes the physical.

1:17:40.240 --> 1:17:43.240
 It is metaphysically prior to it.

1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:48.240
 But here we are sitting in the physical trying to make sense of why the unreasonable effectiveness

1:17:48.240 --> 1:17:51.240
 of the thing that's beyond, which is the mathematics.

1:17:51.240 --> 1:17:52.240
 My answer is God.

1:17:52.240 --> 1:17:54.240
 And I don't know a better answer.

1:17:54.240 --> 1:17:58.240
 And as I read Wigner, he wasn't ready to say that.

1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:01.240
 But I think the language is gesturing.

1:18:01.240 --> 1:18:05.240
 I was reading someone recently, some very well known physicist who said,

1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:12.240
 his answer to Wigner's question is that whoever is responsible for the universe must be a mathematician.

1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:16.240
 And I thought, yeah, that's right.

1:18:16.240 --> 1:18:18.240
 Let me ask you about Jordan Peterson.

1:18:18.240 --> 1:18:20.240
 You had a great conversation with him.

1:18:20.240 --> 1:18:26.240
 He has a complicated nuanced view of faith or faith period.

1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:35.240
 He has said that he believes in Jesus, the person and the myth and some of the full richness and complexity that you've talked about.

1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:37.240
 But he's surprised by his faith.

1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:39.240
 He's not sure what to make of it.

1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:43.240
 He's almost like meta struggling with what the heck is faith means.

1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:49.240
 He's a super powerful intellect that can't compute the faith that he's experiencing.

1:18:49.240 --> 1:18:59.240
 So what are some interesting differences between the two of you or some commonalities in terms of your understanding of faith?

1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:00.240
 He's a very interesting guy.

1:19:00.240 --> 1:19:08.240
 I've had a couple of conversations with him and I do think he's moving in the direction of faith and his lectures in the Bible are very fine, I think.

1:19:08.240 --> 1:19:15.240
 He reminds me of the church fathers because the church fathers would have looked at the moral sense of the scripture.

1:19:15.240 --> 1:19:17.240
 Peterson probably called it the psychological meaning.

1:19:17.240 --> 1:19:19.240
 But I think he's doing a lot of that.

1:19:19.240 --> 1:19:25.240
 As I read him and talk to him, I think he's kind of at a Kantian level in regard to Jesus.

1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:31.240
 What I mean there is, for Kant, Jesus is not so much the historical Jesus, this figure from long ago.

1:19:31.240 --> 1:19:35.240
 It's Jesus as an archetype of the moral life.

1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:39.240
 He says he's the image of the person perfectly pleasing to God.

1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:47.240
 And so Jesus inhabits our kind of moral imagination as a heuristic, as a goal that we're tending toward.

1:19:47.240 --> 1:19:52.240
 But the historical person of Jesus for Kant is like, well, let's not fuss about that so much.

1:19:52.240 --> 1:19:54.240
 It's this figure.

1:19:54.240 --> 1:20:00.240
 And as I read Peterson especially and talk to him, I think he's kind of there with the archetype of Jesus.

1:20:00.240 --> 1:20:05.240
 And even language of, like, live as though God exists.

1:20:05.240 --> 1:20:10.240
 That's the alzob of Kant, you know, the kind of as if attitude.

1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:14.240
 And where I press him when we talk is in the direction of, no, that's not Christianity yet.

1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:17.240
 I mean, that's enlightenment, moral philosophy.

1:20:17.240 --> 1:20:26.240
 But Christianity is very interested in this historical figure and very interested that God really became one of us.

1:20:26.240 --> 1:20:29.240
 And he's not just an archetype of the moral life.

1:20:29.240 --> 1:20:37.240
 He's someone, he's a person who's invaded our world and gone all the way to the bottom of sin and thereby saved us, you know.

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:40.240
 So the facticity of Jesus and the resurrection.

1:20:40.240 --> 1:20:45.240
 So like, Peterson will talk about the resurrection as a myth and all that.

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:47.240
 And you can find that in different cultures, etc.

1:20:47.240 --> 1:20:51.240
 But Christianity is saying something else.

1:20:51.240 --> 1:20:56.240
 So in Christianity, when we're talking about who is Jesus, it's not just an archetype.

1:20:56.240 --> 1:21:08.240
 It's not just a myth, it's a historical figure and the very grounded fact that God became one of us is fundamental to this idea of what Christianity is.

1:21:08.240 --> 1:21:09.240
 What it means to be a Christian.

1:21:09.240 --> 1:21:15.240
 It's the sin and the love that came here down to earth.

1:21:15.240 --> 1:21:17.240
 It means we can be one with God.

1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:18.240
 So that's essential.

1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:19.240
 It's not just an archetype.

1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:20.240
 That's right.

1:21:20.240 --> 1:21:27.240
 You know, it always strikes me the difference between, let's say, mythic expressions and the New Testament.

1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:35.240
 It reads someone like, you know, Carl Jung and then Joseph Campbell, whom he influenced and then now Jordan Peterson, who's very Jungian.

1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:37.240
 And this sort of archetypal reading of the scriptures.

1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:38.240
 And great.

1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:41.240
 I mean, I think it's very interesting and there's a lot going on there.

1:21:41.240 --> 1:21:44.240
 There's a sort of calmness though about it.

1:21:44.240 --> 1:21:45.240
 Like, yeah, interesting.

1:21:45.240 --> 1:21:47.240
 And that's in this culture, in that culture.

1:21:47.240 --> 1:21:51.240
 And it's the form of the moral life and I understand all that.

1:21:51.240 --> 1:21:53.240
 Then you read the New Testament.

1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:57.240
 Whatever those people are talking about, it's not that.

1:21:57.240 --> 1:22:06.240
 They are grabbing you by the shoulders and shaking you to get your attention to tell you about something that happened to them, right?

1:22:06.240 --> 1:22:13.240
 Like the resurrection, the myth of the dying and rising God and how powerful it is and shaping our consciousness.

1:22:13.240 --> 1:22:14.240
 That's fascinating.

1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:16.240
 That's not the New Testament.

1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:18.240
 The Testament is, did you hear?

1:22:18.240 --> 1:22:26.240
 Jesus of Nazareth, whom they put to death, God raised him from the dead and he was seen by 500 and he was seen by Peter.

1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:29.240
 And then lastly, I saw him.

1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:31.240
 That's how Paul talks.

1:22:31.240 --> 1:22:37.240
 It's not the detached, you know, psychologist musing on archetypal things.

1:22:37.240 --> 1:22:41.240
 And I think that makes a huge difference when it comes to Christianity.

1:22:41.240 --> 1:22:46.240
 The intensity of the historical details are essential here.

1:22:46.240 --> 1:22:56.240
 So if you look at Hitler in Nazi Germany, it's not enough to say, well, power corrupts and sometimes sort of looking at the archetype of Hitler.

1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:03.240
 It's much, much more important, much more powerful to look at the details of how he came to power.

1:23:03.240 --> 1:23:06.240
 What are the ways he did evil onto the world?

1:23:06.240 --> 1:23:15.240
 And then you can get really intense about your struggle with some of the complexities of human nature and power on institutions and all that kind of stuff.

1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:18.240
 So the historical nature of the Bible.

1:23:18.240 --> 1:23:20.240
 We're an historical religion.

1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:21.240
 It's important.

1:23:21.240 --> 1:23:24.240
 We generate philosophical reflection.

1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:27.240
 We can find common ground with archetypal thinking and all that.

1:23:27.240 --> 1:23:28.240
 We can.

1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:33.240
 And the church fathers used, you know, Greek philosophy and Aquinas uses Aristotle and all that's great.

1:23:33.240 --> 1:23:35.240
 But we're an historical religion.

1:23:35.240 --> 1:23:37.240
 And that matters immensely.

1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:40.240
 Is the Bible the literal word of God?

1:23:40.240 --> 1:23:44.240
 How do you make sense of the words that make up the Bible?

1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:48.240
 I think the best way to get at the Bible is to think of it as a library, not a book.

1:23:48.240 --> 1:23:50.240
 So it's a collection of books, right?

1:23:50.240 --> 1:23:56.240
 From a wide variety of periods, different authors, different audiences and different genre.

1:23:56.240 --> 1:24:03.240
 So in the Bible, you find poetry, you find song, you find something like history, not in our sense, but something like history.

1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:05.240
 You find gospel, it's its own genre.

1:24:05.240 --> 1:24:08.240
 You find epistolary literature like Paul.

1:24:08.240 --> 1:24:10.240
 You find apocalyptic.

1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:12.240
 There's all this in the Bible.

1:24:12.240 --> 1:24:15.240
 So is the Bible literally the word of God?

1:24:15.240 --> 1:24:18.240
 It's like saying, is the library literally true?

1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:20.240
 It depends on what section you're in, right?

1:24:20.240 --> 1:24:27.240
 So parts of like one and two Samuel, one and two Kings, number plates in the Old Testament.

1:24:27.240 --> 1:24:29.240
 Are there elements of the historical in there?

1:24:29.240 --> 1:24:30.240
 Sure.

1:24:30.240 --> 1:24:32.240
 But it's theologically interpreted history.

1:24:32.240 --> 1:24:40.240
 It's like our sense of history of, you know, give me 10,000 foot notes and, you know, I'm going to look at all the source material I can possibly find.

1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:44.240
 It's more like ancient history, like Herodotus, people like that.

1:24:44.240 --> 1:24:49.240
 But then there's poetry and there's myth and there's legend and there's song and all that stuff in the Bible.

1:24:49.240 --> 1:24:55.240
 So God breathes through all of it, I would say.

1:24:55.240 --> 1:24:57.240
 He inspired all of it, right?

1:24:57.240 --> 1:24:58.240
 Inspirare.

1:24:58.240 --> 1:25:00.240
 He's breathing through all of it.

1:25:00.240 --> 1:25:02.240
 God is speaking through all of it.

1:25:02.240 --> 1:25:04.240
 But he speaks in different voices.

1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:09.240
 He uses different human instruments and he uses different genre and different types of language.

1:25:09.240 --> 1:25:12.240
 So we have to be sensitive to that when we're interpreting the Bible.

1:25:12.240 --> 1:25:17.240
 So the different instruments are more or less, some are more perfect than others.

1:25:17.240 --> 1:25:18.240
 No, I wouldn't say that.

1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:19.240
 I wouldn't say more perfect.

1:25:19.240 --> 1:25:20.240
 I'd say they're just different.

1:25:20.240 --> 1:25:25.240
 It's like a symphony and God's like a conductor and there's all kinds of different instruments in the orchestra.

1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:27.240
 And he loves his debris through the Psalms.

1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:31.240
 I prayed to Psalms this morning, I do every day in my office.

1:25:31.240 --> 1:25:32.240
 Those are songs.

1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:35.240
 They probably were literally sung, most of them at one point.

1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:38.240
 He breathes through Apocalyptic.

1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:43.240
 We're reading the book of Revelation now in the Easter season and it's this wild and wooly book.

1:25:43.240 --> 1:25:47.240
 It should be filmed by Spielberg or somebody today.

1:25:47.240 --> 1:25:49.240
 And he speaks through the Gospels.

1:25:49.240 --> 1:25:53.240
 The Gospels correspond in genre to what I call ancient biography.

1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:55.240
 That's the genre of the Gospels.

1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:59.240
 It's wrong to call them like mythic or simply literary.

1:25:59.240 --> 1:26:01.240
 They're like ancient biographies.

1:26:01.240 --> 1:26:08.240
 You have the Pauline letters, which are about in all particular cities that Paul was visiting and particular people he knew.

1:26:08.240 --> 1:26:11.240
 So you just got to be sensitive to the genre all the time.

1:26:11.240 --> 1:26:18.240
 Let's return back to human institutions and talk about history of human civilization and politics.

1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:25.240
 So one question to ask is, was America founded as a Christian nation in your view?

1:26:25.240 --> 1:26:30.240
 If we look at the Declaration of Independence, what did the words mean?

1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:34.240
 We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal,

1:26:34.240 --> 1:26:38.240
 that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights,

1:26:38.240 --> 1:26:43.240
 that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

1:26:43.240 --> 1:26:47.240
 It seems like God is breathing through those words too.

1:26:47.240 --> 1:26:49.240
 Yeah, I think so.

1:26:49.240 --> 1:26:53.240
 The founders would be some kind of combination of deism.

1:26:53.240 --> 1:26:57.240
 Certainly Christianity is coming up through them.

1:26:57.240 --> 1:27:01.240
 Enlightenment, rationalism, all in kind of a mix.

1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:05.240
 So you're not going to find in our founding fathers simply a Thomas Aquinas

1:27:05.240 --> 1:27:08.240
 or like a purely classically Christian understanding.

1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:12.240
 It's Christianity in those various expressions.

1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:17.240
 I would see the Enlightenment as a sort of child of Christianity, we could talk about that.

1:27:17.240 --> 1:27:24.240
 But having said all that, yes, I think they are expressing at least the residue

1:27:24.240 --> 1:27:32.240
 of a once deeply integrated Christian sense of things that our rights are not created by the government.

1:27:32.240 --> 1:27:35.240
 They're not doled out by the government.

1:27:35.240 --> 1:27:37.240
 They come from God.

1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:42.240
 And the other thing I find really interesting is equality because looking classical philosophy,

1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:47.240
 political philosophy, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, it's not equality.

1:27:47.240 --> 1:27:50.240
 For them, it's our inequality that's really interesting.

1:27:50.240 --> 1:27:55.240
 So Plato divides us into these three classes and Aristotle says only a tiny little coterie of property,

1:27:55.240 --> 1:27:59.240
 males of sufficient education should be in the political life.

1:27:59.240 --> 1:28:03.240
 The rest should all be in private life, you know, and then some are suited for slavery.

1:28:03.240 --> 1:28:08.240
 So I mean, he divides us dramatically, same with Cicero and so on.

1:28:08.240 --> 1:28:12.240
 Where does this come from, this weird idea that we're all equal?

1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:16.240
 I mean, how we're not equal in beauty, not equal in strength, we're not equal in moral attainment,

1:28:16.240 --> 1:28:18.240
 we're not equal in intelligence.

1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:20.240
 So what is it?

1:28:20.240 --> 1:28:27.240
 And I think the residue especially comes through in that little word that all men are created equal.

1:28:27.240 --> 1:28:31.240
 That's our equality that we're all equally children of God.

1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:33.240
 So take God out of the picture.

1:28:33.240 --> 1:28:38.240
 I think we are going to slide rapidly into an embrace of inequality.

1:28:38.240 --> 1:28:42.240
 Now, in the classical world, yes, but heck, look at the 20th century.

1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:48.240
 I mean, when God is excluded in a very systematic way, I think you saw the suspension of rights

1:28:48.240 --> 1:28:51.240
 and the suspension of equality like mad.

1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:57.240
 So no, I think it's very important that God is in the picture and that we're a nation under God.

1:28:57.240 --> 1:28:58.240
 It matters enormously.

1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:00.240
 That's not Pius Boilerplate.

1:29:00.240 --> 1:29:03.240
 That's at the rational foundations of our democracy.

1:29:03.240 --> 1:29:12.240
 So do you think Nietzsche was onto something with the idea, looking into the 20th century, that God is dead?

1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:19.240
 That there is a cultural distancing from a belief in God?

1:29:19.240 --> 1:29:23.240
 Yeah, I'd be somewhat sympathetic to Jordan Peterson's reading of Nietzsche there.

1:29:23.240 --> 1:29:28.240
 Namely, it's not Nietzsche crowing from the mountaintop, hey, God is dead.

1:29:28.240 --> 1:29:31.240
 It's more of a lament, you know, God is dead and we've killed him.

1:29:31.240 --> 1:29:35.240
 And what will happen in the wake of that?

1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:46.240
 And I think, yeah, much of the totalitarianism of the 20th century follows from that questioning of God and the dismissal of God from public life.

1:29:46.240 --> 1:29:49.240
 So I would be sympathetic with that.

1:29:49.240 --> 1:29:54.240
 When we're beyond good and evil, you know, and all that's left is the will to power.

1:29:54.240 --> 1:30:00.240
 And then why are we surprised that the powerful rise and that they use the power less for their purposes?

1:30:00.240 --> 1:30:08.240
 When we forget ideas like equality and rights, which are grounded in God, why are we surprised that death camps follow?

1:30:08.240 --> 1:30:11.240
 So I think there's a correlation there for sure.

1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:12.240
 I don't know.

1:30:12.240 --> 1:30:17.240
 I believe that there's a capacity to do good in all of us and a capacity to do evil.

1:30:17.240 --> 1:30:21.240
 And there's something that tends towards good, whatever that is.

1:30:21.240 --> 1:30:30.240
 I tend to think that if that community, that love that we talked about, they find each other, they find the good.

1:30:30.240 --> 1:30:43.240
 If you don't constrain the resources, if you don't push them, if you don't artificially create conflict through power centers and evil charismatic leaders, then people will be good to each other.

1:30:43.240 --> 1:30:55.240
 And whether that's God or some other source of deep moral meaning, that seems to be essential for functioning civilization.

1:30:55.240 --> 1:30:56.240
 Yeah.

1:30:56.240 --> 1:30:57.240
 And it's hard.

1:30:57.240 --> 1:30:58.240
 I mean, that's what humans are.

1:30:58.240 --> 1:31:01.240
 We're searching for what that God is, what that means.

1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:02.240
 You know what that triggers in my mind?

1:31:02.240 --> 1:31:07.240
 I wonder if you agree with this, that the modern sciences drew their strength from their narrowness.

1:31:07.240 --> 1:31:16.240
 And what I mean there is they almost completely bracketed formal and final causality in the Aristotelian sense, and they focused on efficient and material causality.

1:31:16.240 --> 1:31:20.240
 And that gave, as I say, great strength, but from the narrowness of focus.

1:31:20.240 --> 1:31:24.240
 But for Aristotle, the more important causes are the final and the formal causes.

1:31:24.240 --> 1:31:28.240
 And so final causality there, what's drawing us?

1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:39.240
 So for Aristotle, he'd look at someone like me and say, okay, you have an intelligible structure, and that leads you to seek certain things for the perfection of that structure.

1:31:39.240 --> 1:31:40.240
 Fair enough.

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:41.240
 I think that's right.

1:31:41.240 --> 1:31:42.240
 So I seek the good.

1:31:42.240 --> 1:31:44.240
 Right now, I'm seeking the good of being with you.

1:31:44.240 --> 1:31:49.240
 I said, yeah, I'll sit down with Lex Friedman and we'll talk about deep and important things.

1:31:49.240 --> 1:31:52.240
 That's the good I sought this morning when I woke up.

1:31:52.240 --> 1:31:54.240
 Now, why am I seeking that?

1:31:54.240 --> 1:32:05.240
 Well, for a higher reason, a higher good, because it's part of my work, my ministry is to the church reaching out beyond itself to the wider culture.

1:32:05.240 --> 1:32:08.240
 Okay, well, why do you want that?

1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:14.240
 Well, because I want to bring more and more people into what I think is beautiful and true and good in the church.

1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:16.240
 Well, how come you want that?

1:32:16.240 --> 1:32:21.240
 Well, because a long time ago, I was kind of myself brought into that realm and find it very compelling.

1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:25.240
 Yeah, but then why do you want that? Well, because ultimately, I want to be friends with God.

1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:32.240
 Now, I've given you one example there, but any act of the will, it seems to me, has to be analyzed that way.

1:32:32.240 --> 1:32:34.240
 The will seeks something.

1:32:34.240 --> 1:32:36.240
 It seeks the good, right, by definition.

1:32:36.240 --> 1:32:42.240
 But the good always nests like a Russian doll in a higher good, right, which then nests in a still higher good.

1:32:42.240 --> 1:32:50.240
 Until you come, this is Aquinas, to some, in this sense, uncaused cause, an uncaused final cause.

1:32:50.240 --> 1:32:56.240
 There has to be some sumum bonum, right, some supreme good that you're looking for.

1:32:56.240 --> 1:32:59.240
 And that's God, by the way.

1:32:59.240 --> 1:33:06.240
 That's another, I think, rational path to God, is every single moment, every day, we are implicitly seeking God.

1:33:06.240 --> 1:33:15.240
 So with your Word on Fire ministries and the website and the communication efforts, what is the thing you're seeking?

1:33:15.240 --> 1:33:22.240
 Just you, if we can pause, and for a brief moment, allow you to be prideful.

1:33:22.240 --> 1:33:27.240
 Or, of course, just joking, but what is your local efforts?

1:33:27.240 --> 1:33:35.240
 Your small little pocket of the world with smalling quotes, with Word on Fire.

1:33:35.240 --> 1:33:41.240
 Yeah, it's just using the media, especially the new media, the social media, to get the gospel out.

1:33:41.240 --> 1:33:47.240
 So I started, what, 20 some years ago, just on a radio show in Chicago, a 5.15 on Sunday morning.

1:33:47.240 --> 1:33:49.240
 I had a 15 minute sermon show.

1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:56.240
 And I asked the people in this parish I was at, I said, I need $50,000 to get on for 15 minutes at 5.15 on Sunday morning.

1:33:56.240 --> 1:33:59.240
 And they all laughed when I proposed that, but they gave me the money.

1:33:59.240 --> 1:34:02.240
 So that's how I got started, just doing a sermon on the radio.

1:34:02.240 --> 1:34:05.240
 And then it branched off into video stuff and TV.

1:34:05.240 --> 1:34:11.240
 And then I did a documentary, I went all over the world and kind of told the story of Catholicism.

1:34:11.240 --> 1:34:12.240
 So that's how we started.

1:34:12.240 --> 1:34:15.240
 And now I'm using all the new media and social media.

1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:24.240
 But what I really love, what we're doing today is something I really like, which is having a conversation outside of just the narrow Catholic world, or even the narrow Christian world.

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:31.240
 But to look out to the wider culture and, you know, who's talking about interesting things and how can the church engage there?

1:34:31.240 --> 1:34:35.240
 And, you know, so that's the purpose of Word on Fire.

1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:49.240
 Is it overwhelming to face so many different sort of atheists than complex thinkers like Jordan Peterson and some of the more political style thinkers that you've spoken with?

1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:58.240
 Is that, what is it, Dave Rubin, who's also has a way different worldview as well?

1:34:58.240 --> 1:35:03.240
 Is that terrifying? Is that exciting to you? Is it challenging?

1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:06.240
 Yeah, maybe all of the above, but more exciting.

1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:09.240
 You know, I would say I like doing that. I was a teacher for a long time.

1:35:09.240 --> 1:35:11.240
 I taught in the seminary for like 20 years.

1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:13.240
 And so, you know, I've been engaging these questions for a long time.

1:35:13.240 --> 1:35:15.240
 I'm a writer. I've written about 20 some books.

1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:19.240
 And I write some at a popular level. I write some at a high academic level.

1:35:19.240 --> 1:35:21.240
 And I like doing all that.

1:35:21.240 --> 1:35:23.240
 So I love those ideas.

1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:24.240
 I love those questions.

1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:26.240
 Love engaging people.

1:35:26.240 --> 1:35:34.240
 And I find my own experience, you do run into, of course, a lot of the, you know, vitriol and kind of just stupidity and all that online.

1:35:34.240 --> 1:35:35.240
 And I get it.

1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:39.240
 And religion is such a magnet for people's hostility for different reasons.

1:35:39.240 --> 1:35:40.240
 So I get that.

1:35:40.240 --> 1:35:42.240
 Like you read it, we talked about it.

1:35:42.240 --> 1:35:47.240
 You have to wade through, you know, swamps of obscenity and everything.

1:35:47.240 --> 1:35:49.240
 But, but I do it.

1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:50.240
 I like it.

1:35:50.240 --> 1:35:55.240
 And it's worthwhile because in that read it experience, so many of the issues that preoccupy young people.

1:35:55.240 --> 1:35:58.240
 I can name them for you exactly what they are.

1:35:58.240 --> 1:35:59.240
 It comes to religion.

1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:00.240
 How do you know there's a God?

1:36:00.240 --> 1:36:01.240
 So the God question.

1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:05.240
 Secondly, why is there so much suffering in the world?

1:36:05.240 --> 1:36:08.240
 Third question, why do you think your religion is the right religion?

1:36:08.240 --> 1:36:10.240
 Fourth, why are you so mean to gay people?

1:36:10.240 --> 1:36:15.240
 So those are the four things that I again and again come up when dealing with young people.

1:36:15.240 --> 1:36:18.240
 I, I've told my brother, bishops and priests about that.

1:36:18.240 --> 1:36:24.240
 I said, structure your adult education programs or structure your youth outreach around those four questions.

1:36:24.240 --> 1:36:27.240
 Well, let me ask you about gay marriage.

1:36:27.240 --> 1:36:36.240
 How do we make sense of the love between a man and a man and the woman and the woman and the institution of marriage?

1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:40.240
 We love friendship and friendship is at the heart of things.

1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:44.240
 And so nothing wrong with friendship between, you know, a man and a man, a woman and a woman.

1:36:44.240 --> 1:36:56.240
 But go back to Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas about natural finalities and intelligible forms that there's a certain form to human being, which includes the physical and includes the sexual.

1:36:56.240 --> 1:36:57.240
 It has a proper finality.

1:36:57.240 --> 1:37:02.240
 And so we'd recognize that finality is twofold, both unitive and procreative.

1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:07.240
 And so those two we recognize as the appropriate expression of human sexuality.

1:37:07.240 --> 1:37:17.240
 So that's why the church holds to sex between a man and a woman within the context of marriage is the is the right expression.

1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:28.240
 We reach out to everybody in love and in respect and deep understanding and seeking to understand their lives from the inside.

1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:36.240
 So I mean, all of that, I agree with the bridge building that we need to do to people like in the gay community and people in gay marriage and so on.

1:37:36.240 --> 1:37:47.240
 So the church holds to the the intelligible structure, if you want, of human sexuality and it reaches out to real human beings always in an attitude of invitation and love and so on.

1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:51.240
 So it's somewhere in there that the church takes its stance.

1:37:51.240 --> 1:37:58.240
 And so there's probably variation in the stances that it takes.

1:37:58.240 --> 1:38:08.240
 So you're saying the institution of marriage is about the unitive, which is like the friendship, the deep connection between two humans and the procreative.

1:38:08.240 --> 1:38:13.240
 So being able to have children and all that kind of stuff.

1:38:13.240 --> 1:38:14.240
 It's interesting.

1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:19.240
 So is our gay couple seen as sinful?

1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:26.240
 So does the church acknowledge the love that's the deep love that's possible between a man and a woman?

1:38:26.240 --> 1:38:40.240
 I think so. Yeah, which is why the church says in its official teaching, it's the physical expression, let's say, of sexual passion between two men that is problematic, not their friendship, not their love for each other.

1:38:40.240 --> 1:38:43.240
 So I think, yeah, we confirm the first.

1:38:43.240 --> 1:38:46.240
 Well, let me ask you another difficult topic that's just happened.

1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:49.240
 Unlike the other ones we talked about.

1:38:49.240 --> 1:39:02.240
 That's going on in the news now as we sit here today, the Supreme Court has voted to overturn abortion rights in a draft majority opinion, striking down the landmark Roe versus Wade decision.

1:39:02.240 --> 1:39:04.240
 What are your thoughts on this?

1:39:04.240 --> 1:39:20.240
 First of all, the human institution of the Supreme Court making these decisions throughout its history. And second of all, just the idea, the really powerful, the controversial, the difficult idea of abortion.

1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:23.240
 Yeah, I mean, I'm against abortion.

1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:25.240
 I'm pro life.

1:39:25.240 --> 1:39:33.240
 The church recognizes from the moment of conception we're dealing with a human life that's worthy of respect and protection.

1:39:33.240 --> 1:39:44.240
 And really, as you see the unfolding of that person, you know, across a pregnancy, but at every stage, we recognize the beauty and the dignity of that human being.

1:39:44.240 --> 1:39:49.240
 And so we stand opposed to this, the outright killing of the innocent.

1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:52.240
 So that's the church's view.

1:39:52.240 --> 1:40:05.240
 Again, reaching out always in love and understanding and compassion to those who are dealing and believe me, every single pastor, every single priest understands that because we deal with people all the time who are in these painful situations.

1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:08.240
 But that's the moral, you know, side of it.

1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:11.240
 The legal side, I think Roe v. Wade was terribly decided.

1:40:11.240 --> 1:40:15.240
 I think one of the worst expressions of American law since the Dred Scott decision.

1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:20.240
 So I stand in favor of overturning Roe v. Wade and Casey, I think they were terrible.

1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:30.240
 The Casey decision is instructive to me that it belongs to the nature of freedom that that decision says to determine the meaning of one's own life.

1:40:30.240 --> 1:40:34.240
 And even I don't get the language exactly right, but end of the universe.

1:40:34.240 --> 1:40:40.240
 Like it gives this staggering scope to our freedom that we can determine the meaning.

1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:47.240
 See, but that's we're pugnant to everything we've just talked about that I'm inventing the meaning of my life and of the universe.

1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:59.240
 And so Casey, though, was instructive in a way because it tips its hat toward the problem culturally is that I think in my freedom, I can determine everything.

1:40:59.240 --> 1:41:01.240
 My choice is all that matters.

1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:06.240
 And I would say, no, your choice should be correlated to the order of the good.

1:41:06.240 --> 1:41:07.240
 It's not sovereign.

1:41:07.240 --> 1:41:12.240
 It doesn't reign sovereignly over being and it makes its own decisions.

1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:18.240
 So I think Casey was terrible law and it was backing up Roe v. Wade, which is terrible law.

1:41:18.240 --> 1:41:20.240
 So I'm in favor of the overturning of those.

1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:22.240
 I've spoken out that many times.

1:41:22.240 --> 1:41:24.240
 Now it'll return it to the individual states.

1:41:24.240 --> 1:41:27.240
 It's not going to, you know, solve the problem.

1:41:27.240 --> 1:41:29.240
 The individual states will have to decide.

1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:34.240
 I just heard yesterday we were up in Sacramento, the bishops having our annual meeting.

1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:41.240
 And so we got the word, you know, from the governor and the legislators that they're going to push for a constitutional amendment in California.

1:41:41.240 --> 1:41:48.240
 So basically to make any attempt to limit abortion in any way, just illegal, you know, I think that's barbaric, you know.

1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:51.240
 So I stand radically opposed to that.

1:41:51.240 --> 1:42:07.240
 It's such an interesting line because if you believe that there's a, it's a line that struggles with the question of what does it mean to be a living being or to give life to something.

1:42:07.240 --> 1:42:18.240
 Because if you believe that at the moment of conception, you're basically creating a human life, then abortion is murder.

1:42:18.240 --> 1:42:30.240
 And then if you don't, then it's a sort of basic biological choice that's not taking away of a life.

1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:45.240
 And the gap between those two beliefs is so vast that it's hard and yet so fundamental to the question of what it means to be alive and the fundamental question about the respect for human life and human dignity.

1:42:45.240 --> 1:42:48.240
 It's interesting to see.

1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:53.240
 And also about freedom to, you know, all of those things are mixed in there.

1:42:53.240 --> 1:42:54.240
 Right.

1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:55.240
 It's a beautiful struggle.

1:42:55.240 --> 1:43:07.240
 Maybe the freedom is the most important, you know, the sort of freedom run amok or, you know, in classical philosophy and theology, freedom is not self determination.

1:43:07.240 --> 1:43:19.240
 Freedom is the disciplining of desire so as to make the achievement of the good first possible and then effortless.

1:43:19.240 --> 1:43:20.240
 You know what I'm saying?

1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:26.240
 So modern freedom and the roots of that are people like William Joachim in the late Middle Ages.

1:43:26.240 --> 1:43:28.240
 Freedom means I hover above the yes and the no.

1:43:28.240 --> 1:43:29.240
 Do I do yes or no?

1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:32.240
 And I'm the sovereign subject of that choice.

1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:35.240
 And on no basis, I will say yes or no.

1:43:35.240 --> 1:43:39.240
 I'm like Louis XIV, you know, I'm like Stalin or something, you know.

1:43:39.240 --> 1:43:42.240
 But Aquinas wouldn't have recognized that as freedom.

1:43:42.240 --> 1:43:49.240
 For him, it's, I got this desire, you know, in me, I've got this will and it's pushing toward the good.

1:43:49.240 --> 1:43:56.240
 But the trouble is I got so many attachments and I'm so stupid and I'm so conditioned by my sin that I can't achieve it.

1:43:56.240 --> 1:44:03.240
 So I need to be disciplined in my desire so as to make that achievement possible and then effortless.

1:44:03.240 --> 1:44:08.240
 So right now, I'm freely speaking English to you.

1:44:08.240 --> 1:44:14.240
 And, you know, you had the experience and I've had a too of learning a foreign language and don't you feel unfree?

1:44:14.240 --> 1:44:17.240
 You know, like when you're, you're struggling with a language.

1:44:17.240 --> 1:44:23.240
 When I was over in Paris doing my doctoral work and, you know, I was okay with French, but, you know, my first time in a seminar,

1:44:23.240 --> 1:44:28.240
 and there's all these like, you know, intelligent francophones around the table and they're all just,

1:44:28.240 --> 1:44:31.240
 and I'm trying to say my little thing in my awkward French.

1:44:31.240 --> 1:44:39.240
 And I felt unfree because I, my desire wasn't, wasn't directed, you know.

1:44:39.240 --> 1:44:44.240
 But then over time, I became freer and freer speaker of French.

1:44:44.240 --> 1:44:47.240
 I was ordered more to the good.

1:44:47.240 --> 1:44:51.240
 That's a better understanding of freedom than sort of sovereign self determination.

1:44:51.240 --> 1:44:55.240
 But our country is now, I think, really in the grip of that.

1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:56.240
 I decide.

1:44:56.240 --> 1:44:59.240
 And that's why the Nietzschean thing comes to my mind of, you know, the will to power.

1:44:59.240 --> 1:45:01.240
 There's, I'm beyond good and evil.

1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:03.240
 It's just up to me to decide.

1:45:03.240 --> 1:45:05.240
 God help us.

1:45:05.240 --> 1:45:10.240
 No, it's the values that we intuit around us, intellectual, moral and aesthetic, the values.

1:45:10.240 --> 1:45:12.240
 Think of the dog on the beach again.

1:45:12.240 --> 1:45:18.240
 And that you get ordered to those by your education, by your family, by your religion.

1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:19.240
 And that's beautiful.

1:45:19.240 --> 1:45:20.240
 That makes you free.

1:45:20.240 --> 1:45:23.240
 Now I can freely enter into this.

1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:28.240
 So this sovereign self determination business, that's not my game.

1:45:28.240 --> 1:45:33.240
 The values come in part from the tradition carried through the generations.

1:45:33.240 --> 1:45:38.240
 Let me ask you to put on your wise hat and give advice to young folks.

1:45:38.240 --> 1:45:40.240
 So high school and college.

1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:41.240
 Yeah.

1:45:41.240 --> 1:45:45.240
 Thinking about, you know, what to do with their life, career.

1:45:45.240 --> 1:45:48.240
 There's so many options out there.

1:45:48.240 --> 1:45:56.240
 How can they have a career they can be proud of or even just a life they can be proud of?

1:45:56.240 --> 1:46:00.240
 I think I say, find something you're good at.

1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:01.240
 Because that's from God.

1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:03.240
 It's a gift that God's given you.

1:46:03.240 --> 1:46:05.240
 And then dedicate it to love.

1:46:05.240 --> 1:46:06.240
 You know what I'm saying?

1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:11.240
 So you're good at science or math or sports or whatever.

1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:17.240
 Okay, I'm going to use that now for my aggrandizement, for my wealth, for my privileges and to become famous.

1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:18.240
 No, no, no.

1:46:18.240 --> 1:46:23.240
 Find what you're good at, but now dedicate it to willing the good of the other.

1:46:23.240 --> 1:46:32.240
 So use your science and use your mathematics and use your sports and use your musicianship to benefit the world, you know?

1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:33.240
 That's how I'd say them.

1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:35.240
 So find what you're good at.

1:46:35.240 --> 1:46:36.240
 That's from God.

1:46:36.240 --> 1:46:37.240
 That's a tricky one.

1:46:37.240 --> 1:46:41.240
 Finding what you're good at, because it's not just raw skill.

1:46:41.240 --> 1:46:43.240
 It's also what you connect with.

1:46:43.240 --> 1:46:55.240
 And it's also like this iterative process of if you want to add love to the world, you have to see how can you be effective at doing that.

1:46:55.240 --> 1:46:57.240
 So it's not just the things you're good at.

1:46:57.240 --> 1:47:02.240
 There's like, you know, I'm good at building bridges out of toothpicks.

1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:05.240
 I'm not exactly sure that's going to be useful for the world.

1:47:05.240 --> 1:47:11.240
 Then again, to push back on that, the joy brings me maybe somehow the joy radiates out.

1:47:11.240 --> 1:47:13.240
 Yeah, well, you're good at what you're doing right now.

1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:20.240
 And you've dedicated that to bringing more light and illumination and joy to the world.

1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:21.240
 That's true.

1:47:21.240 --> 1:47:23.240
 But that was a searching.

1:47:23.240 --> 1:47:27.240
 That's the process of trying stuff and figuring it out.

1:47:27.240 --> 1:47:37.240
 And ultimately, yes, asking the question, how is this making the world at all better at every step of the way as opposed to enriching yourself and all those kinds of things.

1:47:37.240 --> 1:47:38.240
 Right.

1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:40.240
 I think that's the name of the game, you know, but it's tricky.

1:47:40.240 --> 1:47:44.240
 And if we don't have moral mentors and intellectual mentors, it becomes hard.

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:48.240
 And if you tell a kid, that's deadly to me, just decide for yourself.

1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:50.240
 Just, you know, just off you go.

1:47:50.240 --> 1:47:52.240
 And you make your own choices.

1:47:52.240 --> 1:47:59.240
 And again, if your choice has to be disciplined or your desire has got to be directed, you know, then you'll find your creative path.

1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:01.240
 Everyone does it in its own way.

1:48:01.240 --> 1:48:03.240
 But it's a guided choice.

1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:05.240
 Your freedom is not sovereign.

1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:07.240
 It's a guided freedom.

1:48:07.240 --> 1:48:17.240
 So in the struggle and the suffering you've seen in the world, let me ask you the question of death.

1:48:17.240 --> 1:48:22.240
 Have you, how often do you think about your own mortality?

1:48:22.240 --> 1:48:23.240
 Every day.

1:48:23.240 --> 1:48:28.240
 And one, are you afraid of it?

1:48:28.240 --> 1:48:30.240
 The uncertainty of it?

1:48:30.240 --> 1:48:32.240
 And what do you think happens after you die?

1:48:32.240 --> 1:48:33.240
 Sure, I'm afraid of it.

1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:37.240
 I mean, because it's, I don't know what's next.

1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:39.240
 I mean, I can't know it the way I know you.

1:48:39.240 --> 1:48:41.240
 So of course I'm afraid of it.

1:48:41.240 --> 1:48:43.240
 And I think of it every day.

1:48:43.240 --> 1:48:45.240
 That's true.

1:48:45.240 --> 1:48:48.240
 My prayer life compels me.

1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:52.240
 You know, we have this, the Hail Mary prayer, you know, you pray the rosary.

1:48:52.240 --> 1:48:54.240
 Now and at the hour of our death, amen.

1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:56.240
 Now and at the hour of our death, amen.

1:48:56.240 --> 1:48:58.240
 Now at the hour of our death, amen.

1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:00.240
 You pray the whole rosary 50 times.

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:03.240
 You remind yourself of your own death.

1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:06.240
 But I do, I think about it because it's the ultimate limit.

1:49:06.240 --> 1:49:09.240
 It's why it's beguiled every artist and writer and philosopher.

1:49:09.240 --> 1:49:12.240
 It's the ultimate limit, you know, question.

1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:14.240
 But yeah, sure.

1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:17.240
 I'm afraid of it because it's the unknown.

1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:20.240
 What do I think happens?

1:49:20.240 --> 1:49:26.240
 I think I'm drawn into the deeper embrace of God's love.

1:49:26.240 --> 1:49:30.240
 You know, and that's stating it kind of in a more poetic way.

1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:32.240
 Do you know John Polkinghorn's work?

1:49:32.240 --> 1:49:33.240
 Do you know that name?

1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:36.240
 John Polkinghorn was a very interesting, he just died recently.

1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:39.240
 He was a Cambridge University particle physicist, right?

1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:43.240
 High, high level scientist who at midlife

1:49:43.240 --> 1:49:45.240
 became an Anglican priest.

1:49:45.240 --> 1:49:47.240
 He left his job at Cambridge and went to the seminary,

1:49:47.240 --> 1:49:49.240
 became an Anglican priest, right?

1:49:49.240 --> 1:49:52.240
 And then wrote, I think some of the best stuff on science and religion

1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:54.240
 because he really knew the science from the inside.

1:49:54.240 --> 1:49:58.240
 Here's Polkinghorn's account that I've always found persuasive.

1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:03.240
 He said, what survives after we die?

1:50:03.240 --> 1:50:06.240
 So this body clearly dies and goes into the ground

1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:08.240
 or it's burned up or it goes away, right?

1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:10.240
 But what's preserved?

1:50:10.240 --> 1:50:13.240
 And he says, what Aristotle would have called the form,

1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:15.240
 Polkinghorn calls it the pattern.

1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:18.240
 So the pattern that's organized,

1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:21.240
 the matter that's made me up over all these years,

1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:23.240
 that's obviously not the same as it was,

1:50:23.240 --> 1:50:26.240
 even, I mean, you would know how often it all changed,

1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:28.240
 all your atoms and cells and, you know,

1:50:28.240 --> 1:50:31.240
 there was the little, you know, Bobby Barron

1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:33.240
 who was growing up in Birmingham, Michigan,

1:50:33.240 --> 1:50:36.240
 I can have a picture of him and then there's me.

1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:38.240
 And I say, oh, that's the same person.

1:50:38.240 --> 1:50:40.240
 I'm not materially speaking, not at all.

1:50:40.240 --> 1:50:42.240
 Completely different.

1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:44.240
 But there's a unity to whatever that pattern is

1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:48.240
 by which all of that materiality has been kind of organized.

1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:54.240
 So Polkinghorn says, I think that pattern is remembered by God.

1:50:54.240 --> 1:50:56.240
 And remember, it's the wrong word.

1:50:56.240 --> 1:50:57.240
 It's like derivative.

1:50:57.240 --> 1:50:59.240
 I mean, it's known by God.

1:50:59.240 --> 1:51:03.240
 And so God can therefore reembody me

1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:06.240
 according to that pattern at a higher pitch

1:51:06.240 --> 1:51:09.240
 than what we call the resurrected body.

1:51:09.240 --> 1:51:12.240
 So Paul talks about a spiritual body.

1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:13.240
 It's body for sure.

1:51:13.240 --> 1:51:16.240
 I mean, because he believes in the resurrection of Jesus.

1:51:16.240 --> 1:51:19.240
 But it's not a body like ours from this world.

1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:22.240
 It's a body at a higher pitch.

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:26.240
 So something, some pattern that's there persists.

1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:28.240
 The pattern persists in the mind of God

1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:32.240
 and then is used as the ground of the reembodyment of me.

1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:35.240
 So it's not like I've just become a Platonic form.

1:51:35.240 --> 1:51:38.240
 I'm going to be reembodied because the Christian hope

1:51:38.240 --> 1:51:42.240
 is not for Platonic escape of soul from matter.

1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:43.240
 That's never the Christian hope.

1:51:43.240 --> 1:51:46.240
 It's for the resurrection of the body, we say.

1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:48.240
 And he said, what a fantastic idea.

1:51:48.240 --> 1:51:49.240
 Well, I don't know.

1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:53.240
 I mean, this body is being reconstituted all the time

1:51:53.240 --> 1:51:55.240
 according to this pattern, right?

1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:56.240
 It's not the same matter.

1:51:56.240 --> 1:52:01.240
 And so might there be another sort of higher material

1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:04.240
 that is organized according to the same pattern,

1:52:04.240 --> 1:52:06.240
 which has been remembered by God.

1:52:06.240 --> 1:52:09.240
 So therefore we can hang on to the language of body and soul,

1:52:09.240 --> 1:52:11.240
 if you want, or matter and form.

1:52:11.240 --> 1:52:14.240
 But it's the form remembered by God

1:52:14.240 --> 1:52:17.240
 and then reconstituted in an embodied way by God

1:52:17.240 --> 1:52:21.240
 that we call heaven, the heavenly state.

1:52:21.240 --> 1:52:22.240
 That's what I hope for.

1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:25.240
 That's my Christian faith, my Christian hope.

1:52:25.240 --> 1:52:29.240
 Let me ask you about the big question of meaning.

1:52:29.240 --> 1:52:31.240
 We've talked about it in different directions,

1:52:31.240 --> 1:52:33.240
 from different perspectives.

1:52:33.240 --> 1:52:36.240
 What's the meaning of our existence here on earth?

1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:39.240
 What's the meaning of life?

1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:40.240
 Love.

1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:42.240
 God is love.

1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:44.240
 And the purpose of my life is to become God's friend.

1:52:44.240 --> 1:52:47.240
 And that means I'm more conformed to love.

1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:49.240
 And so my life finds meaning in the measure

1:52:49.240 --> 1:52:52.240
 that I become more on fire with the divine love.

1:52:52.240 --> 1:52:54.240
 I'm like the burning bush,

1:52:54.240 --> 1:52:57.240
 is to become more and more radiant with the presence of God.

1:52:57.240 --> 1:52:59.240
 That's what gives life meaning.

1:52:59.240 --> 1:53:02.240
 Meaning is to live in a purposive relationship to a value,

1:53:02.240 --> 1:53:03.240
 I would say.

1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:05.240
 So there's all kinds of values, as I say,

1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:07.240
 moral, aesthetic, intellectual values.

1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:09.240
 And when I have a purposive relationship,

1:53:09.240 --> 1:53:10.240
 so right now you and I,

1:53:10.240 --> 1:53:13.240
 we have a purposive relationship to the value of, let's say,

1:53:13.240 --> 1:53:15.240
 finding out the truth of things

1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:17.240
 and we're speaking together to seek that.

1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:18.240
 Well, good.

1:53:18.240 --> 1:53:20.240
 What's the ultimate value?

1:53:20.240 --> 1:53:22.240
 The value of values is God.

1:53:22.240 --> 1:53:25.240
 The supreme good, the supremely knowable,

1:53:25.240 --> 1:53:27.240
 the supremely intelligible is God.

1:53:27.240 --> 1:53:30.240
 And so to be conformed to God

1:53:30.240 --> 1:53:32.240
 is to have a fully meaningful life.

1:53:32.240 --> 1:53:34.240
 And who's God?

1:53:34.240 --> 1:53:35.240
 God is love.

1:53:35.240 --> 1:53:38.240
 So that's where I would fit the package together that way.

1:53:38.240 --> 1:53:41.240
 You're adding a lot of love to this world

1:53:41.240 --> 1:53:43.240
 and which is something I deeply appreciate

1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:45.240
 and that you would sit down with me

1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:47.240
 given how valuable your time is.

1:53:47.240 --> 1:53:48.240
 It's a huge honor.

1:53:48.240 --> 1:53:49.240
 Thank you so much.

1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:50.240
 My great pleasure.

1:53:50.240 --> 1:53:51.240
 I loved it.

1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:52.240
 Lex, thank you.

1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:54.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

1:53:54.240 --> 1:53:55.240
 with Bishop Robert Barron.

 And now let me leave you with some words

1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:02.240
 from Bishop Robert Barron himself,

1:54:02.240 --> 1:54:05.240
 which reminds me of the Dostoevsky line

1:54:05.240 --> 1:54:07.240
 spoken through Prince Mishkin

1:54:07.240 --> 1:54:08.240
 that, quote,

1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:10.240
 beauty will save the world.

1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:12.240
 Robert says,

1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:14.240
 begin with the beautiful

1:54:14.240 --> 1:54:16.240
 which leads to the good

1:54:16.240 --> 1:54:19.240
 which leads you to truth.

1:54:19.240 --> 1:54:21.240
 Thank you for listening

1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:31.240
 and hope to see you next time.
