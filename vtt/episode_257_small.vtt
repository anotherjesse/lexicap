00:00.000 --> 00:03.960
 The following is a conversation with Brian Keating, experimental physicist at

00:03.960 --> 00:09.680
 USASD and author of Losing the Nobel Prize and Into the Impossible.

00:10.240 --> 00:15.320
 Plus, he's a host of the amazing podcast of the same name called Into the

00:15.320 --> 00:19.600
 Impossible. This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it,

00:19.800 --> 00:21.880
 please check out our sponsors in the description.

00:22.160 --> 00:25.800
 And now here's my conversation with Brian Keating.

00:25.800 --> 00:29.520
 As an experimental physicist,

00:29.560 --> 00:34.000
 what do you think is the most amazing or maybe the coolest measurement device

00:34.640 --> 00:38.760
 you've ever worked with or humans have ever built? Maybe for now,

00:38.760 --> 00:43.760
 let's exclude the background imaging of cosmic extra galactic

00:43.760 --> 00:47.360
 polarization instruments. Yeah. Absolutely biased towards that particular

00:47.360 --> 00:49.400
 instrument. Talk about that in a little bit. Yeah.

00:49.600 --> 00:54.680
 But certainly the telescope to me as is a lever that has literally moved the

00:54.680 --> 00:57.960
 earth throughout history. So the OG telescope.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.640
 The OG telescope. Yeah. The one invented not by Galileo, as most people think,

01:02.040 --> 01:05.320
 but by this guy Hans Lippertje in the Netherlands.

01:05.880 --> 01:12.040
 And it was kind of interesting because in the 1600s, 14, 1500, 1600s,

01:12.400 --> 01:16.240
 it was the beginning of movable type. And so people for the first time in

01:16.240 --> 01:20.520
 history had a standard by which they could appraise their eyesight.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.360
 So looking at a printed word now, we just take it for granted.

01:23.360 --> 01:26.400
 12 point font, whatever. And that's what the eye charts are based on.

01:26.400 --> 01:30.240
 They're just fixed height. But back then there was no way to adjust your eyesight

01:30.240 --> 01:32.840
 if you didn't have perfect vision.

01:33.280 --> 01:36.080
 And there was no way to even tell if you had perfect vision or not until

01:36.240 --> 01:40.320
 the Gutenberg Bible and movable type. And at that time, people realized,

01:40.320 --> 01:43.280
 hey, wait, I can't read this. My priest or my friend over here,

01:43.280 --> 01:46.080
 he can read it. She can read it. I can't read it. What's going on?

01:46.400 --> 01:51.080
 And that's when these people in Venice and in the Netherlands saw that

01:51.080 --> 01:54.720
 they could take this kind of glass material and hold it up and maybe put

01:54.720 --> 01:56.840
 another piece of glass material and it would make it clearer.

01:57.440 --> 02:00.640
 And what was so interesting is that nobody thought to take that exact same

02:00.640 --> 02:04.880
 device, you know, two lenses and go like, let me go like this and look

02:04.880 --> 02:08.120
 at that bright thing in the sky over there until Galileo.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.400
 So Galileo didn't invent it, but he did something kind of amazing.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.720
 He improved on it by a factor of 10. So he 10xed it,

02:16.080 --> 02:19.760
 which is almost as good as going from zero to one is going from one to 10.

02:19.760 --> 02:26.280
 And when he did that, he really transformed both how we look at

02:26.280 --> 02:30.000
 the universe and think about it, but also who we are as a species,

02:30.000 --> 02:34.520
 because we're using tools not to get food faster or to, you know,

02:34.520 --> 02:39.280
 preserve, you know, our legacy for future generations,

02:39.280 --> 02:42.640
 but actually to increase the benefit to the human mind.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.200
 Somebody mentioned this idea that if humans weren't able to see the stars,

02:47.200 --> 02:51.440
 maybe there was some, some kind of a make above the atmosphere,

02:51.440 --> 02:55.520
 which for the early humans made it impossible to see the stars that we

02:55.520 --> 02:59.120
 would never develop human civilization, or at least raising the question of how

02:59.120 --> 03:04.080
 important is it to look up to the sky and wonder what's out there as opposed to

03:05.120 --> 03:09.120
 maybe this is an over romanticized notion, but like looking at the ground,

03:09.120 --> 03:12.840
 it feels like a little bit too much focused on survival and not being eaten

03:12.840 --> 03:17.240
 by a bear slash lion. If you look up to the stars, you start to wonder,

03:17.240 --> 03:18.520
 what is my place in the universe?

03:18.520 --> 03:21.320
 Do you think, do you think that's modern humans romanticized?

03:21.320 --> 03:24.120
 I think it's a little romantic, because they also took the same,

03:25.560 --> 03:27.880
 they took the same two lenses and they looked inward, right?

03:27.880 --> 03:28.920
 They looked at bacteria.

03:28.920 --> 03:32.120
 They looked at, you know, hairs and in other words, they made the microscope

03:32.120 --> 03:33.560
 and we're still doing that.

03:33.560 --> 03:37.320
 And so, you know, to have a telescope is, it serves a dual purpose.

03:37.320 --> 03:41.640
 It's, it's not only a way of looking out, it's looking in,

03:41.640 --> 03:43.240
 but it's also looking back in time.

03:43.240 --> 03:44.520
 In other words, you didn't see a microscope.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.520
 You don't think, oh, I'm, I'm seeing this thing as it was, you know,

03:46.520 --> 03:49.960
 one nanosecond ago, light travels one foot per nanosecond.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.640
 I'm seeing it, no, you don't think about it like that.

03:51.640 --> 03:54.200
 But when you see something that's happening, you know, on Jupiter,

03:54.200 --> 03:56.680
 the moon and drama in a galaxy, you're seeing things, you know,

03:56.680 --> 03:59.320
 back when Lucy was walking around the Serengeti Plains.

03:59.880 --> 04:03.960
 And for that, I think that took then the knowledge of, you know,

04:03.960 --> 04:06.680
 relativity and time travel and so forth.

04:06.680 --> 04:10.120
 It took that before we could really say, oh, we really

04:10.120 --> 04:12.120
 unlock some cheat codes in the human brain.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.240
 So I think that might be a little too much, but, but nevertheless,

04:15.240 --> 04:17.240
 I mean, what's better than having a time machine?

04:17.240 --> 04:19.160
 You know, it's like, we can look back in time.

04:19.160 --> 04:21.560
 We see things as they were, not as they are.

04:21.560 --> 04:24.520
 And that allows us to do many things, including speculate about that.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.440
 But one of the coolest things, I don't know if you're familiar with,

04:26.440 --> 04:27.800
 so I'm a radio astronomer.

04:27.800 --> 04:31.480
 I don't actually look through telescopes very often, except, you know,

04:31.480 --> 04:35.000
 on rare occasions when I, when I take one out to show the kids.

04:35.000 --> 04:39.720
 But, but a radio telescope is even more sort of visceral.

04:39.720 --> 04:41.400
 I mean, it's much less cool because you look at it and you're like,

04:41.400 --> 04:42.120
 all right, it looks cool.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.560
 It's kind of weird shaped thing.

04:43.560 --> 04:44.920
 It looks like it belongs in sci fi.

04:44.920 --> 04:48.040
 It's going to blast, you know, the Death Star or whatever.

04:48.040 --> 04:51.960
 But when you, when you realize that when you point a radio telescope

04:51.960 --> 04:55.800
 at a distant object, if that object fills up what's called the beam,

04:55.800 --> 04:59.320
 which is basically the field of view of a radio telescope,

04:59.320 --> 05:00.440
 it's called this beam.

05:00.440 --> 05:03.480
 If you fill up the beam and you put a resistor,

05:03.480 --> 05:07.640
 just a simple absorbing piece of material at the focus of the radio telescope,

05:07.640 --> 05:11.080
 that resistor will come to the exact same temperature

05:11.080 --> 05:13.800
 as the object that's looking at, which is pretty amazing.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.040
 It means you're actually remotely measuring,

05:16.040 --> 05:20.040
 you're taking the temperature of Jupiter or whatever in, in effect.

05:20.040 --> 05:23.560
 And so it's, it's, it's allowing you to basically teleport.

05:23.560 --> 05:25.960
 And there's no other science that you can really do that, right?

05:25.960 --> 05:28.440
 If you're an archeologist, you can, let me get into my, you know,

05:28.440 --> 05:31.720
 my, my time machine and go back and see what was Lucy really like,

05:31.720 --> 05:32.920
 you know, it's not possible.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.680
 So the same thing happens.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.240
 This is where I've learned about this from March of the Penguins

05:37.240 --> 05:40.440
 when the penguins huddle together, they, you know,

05:40.440 --> 05:43.160
 the, the body temperature arrives to the same place.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.760
 So you're, you're doing this remotely.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.760
 The March of the Penguins, but remote.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.040
 And we do it from Antarctica too.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.720
 So there are some penguins around when we do it.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.560
 Okay, excellent.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.400
 You mentioned time machine.

05:53.400 --> 05:56.120
 I think in your book, Losing the Nobel Prize,

05:57.000 --> 05:59.560
 you talk about time machines.

05:59.560 --> 06:04.440
 So let me ask you the question of, take us back in time.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.320
 What happened at the beginning of our universe?

06:07.320 --> 06:08.040
 Ah, okay.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.040
 That's a, usually people preface this by saying,

06:10.040 --> 06:11.080
 I have a simple question.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.360
 So, you know, what happened before the universe began?

06:14.360 --> 06:15.080
 What happened?

06:15.080 --> 06:17.160
 Brian Keating teaching me about comedy.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.480
 I have a simple question for you.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.760
 Let's take two.

06:20.760 --> 06:21.880
 I have a simple question.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.560
 What happened at the beginning of our universe?

06:23.560 --> 06:24.200
 There you go.

06:24.200 --> 06:25.000
 All right, good.

06:25.000 --> 06:29.480
 So when we think about what, what happened, it's more correct.

06:29.480 --> 06:30.440
 It's more logical.

06:30.440 --> 06:34.520
 It's more practical to go back in time starting from today.

06:34.520 --> 06:40.360
 So if you go back 13.874 billion years from today,

06:40.360 --> 06:41.480
 that's some day, right?

06:41.480 --> 06:43.240
 I mean, you could translate into some day, right?

06:43.240 --> 06:46.280
 So on that day, something happened earlier than,

06:46.280 --> 06:49.000
 than, you know, than the moment exactly now,

06:49.000 --> 06:51.320
 let's say we're talking around one o clock.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.560
 So at some point during that day,

06:54.360 --> 06:57.000
 the universe started to become a fusion reactor.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.960
 It started to fuse light elements and isotopes

06:59.960 --> 07:01.560
 into heavier elements and isotopes

07:01.560 --> 07:02.440
 of those heavier elements.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.920
 After that period of time, you know,

07:04.920 --> 07:06.440
 going forward back closer to today,

07:06.440 --> 07:08.840
 less, you know, 10 minutes earlier, 10 minutes earlier,

07:09.480 --> 07:11.800
 or later rather coming towards us today,

07:11.800 --> 07:14.200
 we know more and more about what the universe was like.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.360
 And in fact, all the hydrogen, you know,

07:16.360 --> 07:19.960
 to very good approximation in the water molecules in this bottle,

07:19.960 --> 07:22.920
 almost all of them were produced during that first 20 minute period.

07:23.480 --> 07:27.720
 So I would say, you know, the actual fusion and production

07:27.720 --> 07:30.440
 of the lightest elements on the periodic table

07:30.440 --> 07:32.200
 occurred in a time period shorter

07:32.200 --> 07:34.280
 than the TV show, The Big Bang Theory.

07:34.280 --> 07:35.000
 Well done, sir.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.120
 You know, most of those light elements,

07:38.120 --> 07:40.360
 besides hydrogen, aren't really used in your,

07:40.360 --> 07:41.560
 you know, in your encounter, right?

07:41.560 --> 07:43.560
 We don't encounter helium that often,

07:43.560 --> 07:45.160
 unless you go to a lot of birthday parties

07:45.160 --> 07:46.360
 or pilot a blimp.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.240
 You don't need lithium, hopefully, you know,

07:49.240 --> 07:50.120
 but other than that,

07:50.120 --> 07:51.480
 those are the kind of things that were produced

07:51.480 --> 07:52.120
 during that moment.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.120
 The question became, how did the heavier things

07:54.120 --> 07:56.680
 like iron, carbon, nickel, we can get to that later.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.640
 And I brought some samples for us to discuss

07:59.640 --> 08:02.120
 and how those came from a very different type of process

08:02.120 --> 08:03.960
 called a different type of fusion reactor

08:04.520 --> 08:06.920
 and a different type of process explosion as well

08:06.920 --> 08:07.800
 and called the supernova.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.960
 However, if you go back to the,

08:09.960 --> 08:11.480
 beyond those first three minutes,

08:11.480 --> 08:13.800
 we really have to say almost nothing

08:13.800 --> 08:15.800
 because we are not capable,

08:15.800 --> 08:17.400
 in other words, going backwards

08:17.400 --> 08:18.680
 from the first three minutes,

08:18.680 --> 08:21.000
 as famous Stephen Weinberg titled his book,

08:21.800 --> 08:25.080
 we actually marks a point where ignorance takes over.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.200
 In other words, we can't speculate on what happened

08:28.200 --> 08:30.840
 three minutes before the preponderance of hydrogen

08:30.840 --> 08:32.280
 was formed in our universe.

08:32.280 --> 08:34.600
 We just don't know enough about that epoch.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.200
 There are many people, most people,

08:36.200 --> 08:38.680
 most practicing card carrying cosmologists

08:38.680 --> 08:41.080
 believe the universe began in what's called the singularity

08:41.960 --> 08:43.560
 and we can certainly talk about that.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.360
 However, singularity is so far removed

08:46.360 --> 08:49.080
 from anything we can ever hope to prove,

08:49.080 --> 08:51.320
 hope to confront or hope to observe with evidence

08:52.120 --> 08:54.760
 and really only occurs in two instantiations,

08:54.760 --> 08:56.920
 the big bang and the core of a black hole,

08:56.920 --> 08:58.120
 neither of which is observable.

08:58.840 --> 08:59.960
 And so for that reason,

08:59.960 --> 09:02.200
 there are now flourishing alternatives that say,

09:02.760 --> 09:05.160
 you can actually for the first time ask the question,

09:05.160 --> 09:10.680
 that day, Tuesday, in the first moments of our universe,

09:10.680 --> 09:12.440
 there was a Tuesday a week before that,

09:13.240 --> 09:15.320
 24 hours times seven days before that.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.800
 That has a perfectly well understood meaning

09:19.800 --> 09:23.560
 in models of cosmology promoted by some of the more

09:23.560 --> 09:25.800
 eminent of cosmologists working today.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.520
 When I was in grad school over 25 years ago,

09:28.520 --> 09:31.000
 no one really considered anything besides that big bang,

09:31.000 --> 09:34.200
 that there was a singularity and people would have to say,

09:34.200 --> 09:35.800
 as I said, we just don't know.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.160
 But they would say some future incarnation

09:39.160 --> 09:41.160
 of some experimental tell us the answer.

09:41.160 --> 09:43.320
 But now there are people that are saying,

09:43.320 --> 09:45.720
 there is an alternative to the big bang.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.120
 And it's not really fringe science as it once was,

09:48.840 --> 09:51.240
 50, 80 years ago, when these models,

09:51.240 --> 09:54.120
 by the way, the first cosmology in history

09:54.120 --> 09:56.040
 was not a singular universe.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.360
 The first cosmology in history goes back to

09:58.360 --> 10:03.480
 Akhenaten Ra and the temples of Egypt in the third millennium BC.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.520
 And in that, they talked about cyclical universes.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.480
 So I always joke, that guy Akhenaten's court,

10:09.480 --> 10:11.880
 he'd have a pretty high H index right about now,

10:11.880 --> 10:14.680
 because people have been using that cyclical model

10:14.680 --> 10:18.120
 from Penrose to Paul Steinhart and Aegis

10:18.120 --> 10:20.840
 and right up until this very moment.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.760
 Can you maybe explore the possible alternatives

10:25.480 --> 10:27.720
 to the big bang theory?

10:27.720 --> 10:30.200
 So there are many alternatives starting with,

10:30.200 --> 10:34.040
 so the singularity, quantum cosmologically demanding

10:34.040 --> 10:36.280
 singular origin of the universe,

10:36.280 --> 10:39.160
 that stands in contrast to these other models

10:39.160 --> 10:40.920
 in which time does not have a beginning.

10:42.920 --> 10:45.480
 Many of them feature cycles, at least one cycle,

10:45.480 --> 10:47.080
 possibly infinite number of cycles,

10:47.880 --> 10:49.240
 called by Sir Roger Penrose.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.200
 And they all have things in common, these alternatives,

10:52.200 --> 10:55.320
 as does the dominant paradigm of cosmogenesis,

10:55.320 --> 10:56.520
 which is inflation.

10:56.520 --> 11:00.360
 Inflation can be thought of as this spark

11:00.360 --> 11:03.240
 that ignites the hot big bang that I said we understood.

11:03.240 --> 11:04.840
 So it's an earlier condition,

11:04.840 --> 11:06.840
 but it's still not an initial condition.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.960
 In physics, imagine I show you a grandfather clock

11:09.960 --> 11:11.720
 or pendulum swinging back and forth.

11:11.720 --> 11:14.600
 You look away for a second, you come into the room,

11:14.600 --> 11:15.720
 pendulum swinging back and forth.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.160
 Alex, tell me, where did it start?

11:17.160 --> 11:19.320
 How many cycles is it going to make before the end?

11:19.320 --> 11:20.520
 Or you can't answer that question

11:20.520 --> 11:23.640
 without knowing the initial conditions in a very simple system

11:23.640 --> 11:25.880
 like a one dimensional simple harmonic oscillator,

11:25.880 --> 11:26.840
 like a pendulum.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.840
 Think about understanding the whole universe

11:28.840 --> 11:30.920
 without understanding the initial conditions.

11:30.920 --> 11:34.440
 It's a tremendous lacuna gap that we have as scientists

11:34.440 --> 11:38.120
 that we may not be able to, in the inflationary cosmology,

11:38.120 --> 11:42.520
 determine the quantitative physical properties of the universe

11:42.520 --> 11:44.600
 prior to what's called the inflationary epoch.

11:44.600 --> 11:47.720
 So you're saying for the pendulum in that epoch, we can't,

11:47.720 --> 11:50.520
 because you can infer things about the pendulum

11:50.520 --> 11:54.200
 before you shut up to the room in our current epoch, correct?

11:54.200 --> 11:54.600
 Right.

11:54.600 --> 11:56.360
 Yeah, so if you look at it right now,

11:56.360 --> 11:58.200
 but if I said, well, when will it stop oscillating?

11:58.200 --> 12:00.600
 So that depends on how much energy it got initially,

12:00.600 --> 12:02.600
 and you can measure its dissipation, its air resistance,

12:02.600 --> 12:04.920
 yet infrared camera, you can see it's getting hotter, maybe,

12:04.920 --> 12:06.600
 and you could do some calculations.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.920
 But to know the two things in physics

12:08.920 --> 12:10.600
 to solve a partial differential equation

12:10.600 --> 12:12.600
 are the initial conditions and the boundary conditions.

12:12.600 --> 12:14.600
 Boundary conditions were here on Earth,

12:14.600 --> 12:16.600
 it has a gravitational field, it's not going to excurs,

12:16.600 --> 12:20.600
 or make excursions wildly beyond the length of the pendulum.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.600
 It has simple properties.

12:22.600 --> 12:26.600
 But in this, in other words, you can't tell me

12:26.600 --> 12:28.600
 when did the solar system start orbiting

12:28.600 --> 12:30.600
 in the way that it does now.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.600
 In other words, when did the moon acquire the exact angular momentum

12:32.600 --> 12:34.600
 that it has now?

12:34.600 --> 12:36.600
 Now, that's a pretty pedestrian example.

12:36.600 --> 12:40.600
 But what I'm telling you is that the inflationary epoch purports

12:40.600 --> 12:44.600
 and is successful at providing a lot of explanations

12:44.600 --> 12:48.600
 for how the universe evolved after inflation took place and ended,

12:48.600 --> 12:52.600
 but it says nothing about how it itself took place.

12:52.600 --> 12:54.600
 And that's really what you're asking me.

12:54.600 --> 12:56.600
 I mean, you don't really...

12:56.600 --> 12:58.600
 Look, what you care about, like, Big Bang Nuclear Synthesis

12:58.600 --> 13:00.600
 and the elements got made and these fusion reactors

13:00.600 --> 13:02.600
 and the whole universe was a fusion reactor,

13:02.600 --> 13:04.600
 but, like, don't you really care about what happened

13:04.600 --> 13:08.600
 at the beginning of time, at the first moment of time?

13:08.600 --> 13:11.600
 And the problem is we can't really answer that

13:11.600 --> 13:13.600
 in the context of the Big Bang.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.600
 We can answer that in the context of these alternatives.

13:15.600 --> 13:17.600
 So you asked me about some of the alternatives.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.600
 So one is A on theory, the conformal cyclic cosmology

13:19.600 --> 13:21.600
 of Sir Roger Penrose.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600
 Another one that's...

13:23.600 --> 13:25.600
 It was really popular in the 60s and 70s

13:25.600 --> 13:28.600
 until the discovery of the primary component

13:28.600 --> 13:31.600
 of my research field, the cosmic microwave background radiation,

13:31.600 --> 13:33.600
 or CMB, the three kelvin, all pervasive signal

13:33.600 --> 13:36.600
 that astronomers detected in 1965.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.600
 That kind of spelled the death knell, in some sense,

13:39.600 --> 13:43.600
 to what was called the quasi steady state universe.

13:43.600 --> 13:47.600
 And then there was another model

13:47.600 --> 13:49.600
 that kind of came out of that.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
 You hear the word quasi, so it's not steady state.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.600
 Steady state means always existed.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.600
 That was a cosmology Einstein believed until Hubble

13:55.600 --> 13:58.600
 showed him evidence for the expansion of the universe.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.600
 And most scientists believed in that for millennia, basically.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.600
 The universe was eternal, static, unchanging.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.600
 They couldn't believe that after Hubble,

14:07.600 --> 14:11.600
 so they had to append onto it, concatenate this new feature

14:11.600 --> 14:14.600
 that it wasn't steady, it was quasi steady.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.600
 So the universe was making a certain amount of hydrogen

14:16.600 --> 14:19.600
 every century in a given volume of space.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.600
 And that amount of hydrogen that was produced was constant,

14:22.600 --> 14:24.600
 but because it was producing more and more every century,

14:24.600 --> 14:26.600
 the centuries pile up and the volume piles up,

14:26.600 --> 14:28.600
 the universe could expand.

14:28.600 --> 14:29.600
 And so that's how they developed.

14:29.600 --> 14:30.600
 That's slowly.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.600
 Very slowly.

14:31.600 --> 14:33.600
 And it doesn't match observational evidence,

14:33.600 --> 14:35.600
 but that is an alternative.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.600
 By the way, did Einstein think the steady state universe

14:38.600 --> 14:39.600
 is infinite or finite?

14:39.600 --> 14:40.600
 Do you know?

14:40.600 --> 14:43.600
 I would assume that he thought it was infinite

14:43.600 --> 14:45.600
 because there was really, you know,

14:45.600 --> 14:48.600
 if something had a no beginning in time,

14:48.600 --> 14:50.600
 then it'll be very unlikely we're in like the center of it

14:50.600 --> 14:54.600
 or it's bounded or it has, in that case, a finite edge to it.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.600
 I wonder what he thought about infinity,

14:56.600 --> 14:57.600
 because that's such an uncomfortable.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.600
 No, it's a silly joke.

14:58.600 --> 15:00.600
 I'm sure you're familiar with a silly joke, right?

15:00.600 --> 15:02.600
 It's a silly joke was that there are only two things

15:02.600 --> 15:06.600
 that are infinite, the universe and human stupidity,

15:06.600 --> 15:08.600
 and I'm not sure about the universe.

15:08.600 --> 15:10.600
 Well, me saying I'm not aware of the joke

15:10.600 --> 15:12.600
 is a good example of the joke.

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
 It's very meta.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.600
 Okay, so, sorry, you were saying about quasi...

15:17.600 --> 15:18.600
 All the alternatives.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.600
 All the alternatives in the quasi steady state.

15:20.600 --> 15:23.600
 And the most kind of promising, although I hate to say that,

15:23.600 --> 15:24.600
 you know, people say like,

15:24.600 --> 15:26.600
 well, that's your favorite alternative, right?

15:26.600 --> 15:28.600
 This is not investment advice.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.600
 Inflation is not transitory.

15:31.600 --> 15:33.600
 It is quasi permanent.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.600
 So, a very prominent...

15:35.600 --> 15:36.600
 Sorry to interrupt.

15:36.600 --> 15:37.600
 We were talking about cosmic inflation.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.600
 So, calm down, cryptocurrency folks.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.600
 That's right.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.600
 Although the first Nobel Prize,

15:42.600 --> 15:44.600
 and one of the first Nobel Prizes in economics

15:44.600 --> 15:47.600
 was awarded for inflation, not of the cosmological kind.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
 So, most people don't know that.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.600
 Inflation is already won a Nobel Prize.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.600
 It's a good topic to work on if you want a Nobel Prize.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.600
 It doesn't matter the field.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.600
 Exactly, it's time translation and bearing.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.600
 So, when we look at the alternative that's called

15:59.600 --> 16:02.600
 the bouncing or cyclic cosmologies,

16:02.600 --> 16:07.600
 these have serious virtues according to some.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
 One of the virtues to me, just as a human,

16:09.600 --> 16:12.600
 I'm just speaking, you know, as a human,

16:12.600 --> 16:18.600
 one of the founders of the new version of the cyclic cosmology

16:18.600 --> 16:22.600
 called the bouncing cosmology is Paul Steinhardt.

16:22.600 --> 16:24.600
 He's the Einstein Professor of Natural Sciences

16:24.600 --> 16:25.600
 at Princeton University.

16:25.600 --> 16:26.600
 You may have heard of it.

16:26.600 --> 16:30.600
 And he was one of the originators of what was called

16:30.600 --> 16:31.600
 new inflation.

16:31.600 --> 16:35.600
 In other words, he was one of the founding fathers of inflation,

16:35.600 --> 16:39.600
 who now not only has no belief or support for inflation,

16:39.600 --> 16:44.600
 he actively claims that inflation is baroque, pernicious,

16:44.600 --> 16:47.600
 dangerous, malevolent, not to science,

16:47.600 --> 16:50.600
 not just to cosmology, but to society.

16:50.600 --> 16:54.600
 So, here's a man who created a theory that's captivated

16:54.600 --> 16:56.600
 the world, the universe of cosmologists, such as it is,

16:56.600 --> 16:59.600
 not a huge universe, but they're more podcasters

16:59.600 --> 17:01.600
 than cosmologists, some do both.

17:01.600 --> 17:06.600
 But this man created this theory with collaborators.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.600
 And now he's like, I joke, I'm like, Paul,

17:08.600 --> 17:10.600
 you're denying paternity.

17:10.600 --> 17:11.600
 You're like a deadbeat dad.

17:11.600 --> 17:15.600
 Now you're saying inflation is bogus.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.600
 But he doesn't just attack.

17:17.600 --> 17:20.600
 See, this is what's very important about approaching things

17:20.600 --> 17:21.600
 as an experimentalist.

17:21.600 --> 17:22.600
 You've got a lot of theorists on.

17:22.600 --> 17:23.600
 And that's wonderful.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.600
 And I think that's a huge service.

17:24.600 --> 17:27.600
 An experimentalist has to say no.

17:27.600 --> 17:30.600
 He or she has to be confident to say, like, I don't care

17:30.600 --> 17:34.600
 if I prove you right or I prove your enemy wrong or whatever.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.600
 We have to be like exterminators.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.600
 And nobody likes to exterminate until they need one, right?

17:39.600 --> 17:41.600
 Or the garbage collectors, right?

17:41.600 --> 17:45.600
 But it's vital that we be completely kind of unpersuaded

17:45.600 --> 17:48.600
 by the beauty and the magnificence and the symmetry

17:48.600 --> 17:49.600
 and the simplicity of some idea.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.600
 Like inflation is a beautiful idea.

17:51.600 --> 17:53.600
 But it also has consequences.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.600
 And what Paul claims, I don't agree with him fully on this point,

17:56.600 --> 17:58.600
 is that those consequences are dangerous

17:58.600 --> 18:00.600
 because they lead to things like the multiverse,

18:00.600 --> 18:02.600
 which is outside the purview of science.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.600
 And in that sense, I can see support for what he does.

18:06.600 --> 18:09.600
 But none of that detracts from my respect for a man.

18:09.600 --> 18:14.600
 Imagine, like, Elon comes up with this really great idea space.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.600
 And then he's like, actually, it's not going to work.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.600
 But like, here's this better idea.

18:19.600 --> 18:20.600
 And he's like, SpaceX is not going to work.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.600
 But he's now creating an alternative to it.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.600
 It's extremely hard to do what Paul has done.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.600
 It doesn't mean he's right.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.600
 It doesn't mean I'm going to, like, have more and more attention

18:30.600 --> 18:33.600
 paid to it because he's my friend or because I respect the idea

18:33.600 --> 18:36.600
 or I respect the man and his colleague, Ana Aegis,

18:36.600 --> 18:38.600
 who works really hard with him.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.600
 But nevertheless, this has certain attractions to it.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.600
 And what it does most foremost is that it removes

18:45.600 --> 18:49.600
 the quantum gravity aspect from cosmology.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.600
 So it takes away 50% of the motivation

18:52.600 --> 18:54.600
 for a theory of quantum gravity.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.600
 You talked a lot about quantum gravity.

18:56.600 --> 18:59.600
 You talked people, eminent people on the show.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.600
 Always latent in those conversations is sort of the

19:02.600 --> 19:06.600
 teleological expectation that there is a theory of everything.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.600
 There is a theory of quantum gravity.

19:08.600 --> 19:12.600
 But there's no law that says we have to have a theory of quantum gravity.

19:12.600 --> 19:17.600
 So that kind of implicit expectation has to do ultimately

19:17.600 --> 19:20.600
 with the inflationary theory, so in cosmic inflation.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.600
 So is that at the core?

19:23.600 --> 19:24.600
 OK.

19:24.600 --> 19:29.600
 Maybe you can speak to what is the negative impacts on society

19:29.600 --> 19:33.600
 from believing in cosmic inflation.

19:33.600 --> 19:37.600
 So one of the more kind of robust predictions of inflation,

19:37.600 --> 19:39.600
 according to its other two patriarchs,

19:39.600 --> 19:41.600
 considered to be its patriarchs, Alan Gooth at MIT

19:41.600 --> 19:45.600
 and Andre Linde at Stanford, although he was in the USSR

19:45.600 --> 19:49.600
 when he came up with these ideas, along with Paul Steinhardt,

19:49.600 --> 19:54.600
 was that the universe has to eventually get into a quantum state.

19:54.600 --> 19:56.600
 It has to exist in this Hilbert space,

19:56.600 --> 19:58.600
 and the Hilbert space has certain features.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.600
 And those features are quantum mechanical,

20:00.600 --> 20:02.600
 endowed with quantum mechanical properties.

20:02.600 --> 20:06.600
 And then it becomes very difficult to turn inflation off.

20:06.600 --> 20:11.600
 So inflation can get started, but then it's like one of SpaceX rockets.

20:11.600 --> 20:13.600
 It's hard to turn off a solid rocket booster.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.600
 It continues the thrusting.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.600
 You need another mechanism to douse the flames

20:18.600 --> 20:20.600
 of the inflationary expansion,

20:20.600 --> 20:23.600
 which means that if inflation kicks off somewhere,

20:23.600 --> 20:26.600
 it will kick off potentially everywhere at all times,

20:26.600 --> 20:31.600
 including now, spawning an ever increasing set of universes.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.600
 Some will die stillborn.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.600
 Some will continue and flourish,

20:35.600 --> 20:38.600
 and this is known as the multiverse paradigm.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.600
 It's a robust, seemingly robust consequence,

20:40.600 --> 20:42.600
 not only of inflationary cosmology,

20:42.600 --> 20:45.600
 but more and more, we're seeing it in string theory as well.

20:45.600 --> 20:49.600
 Sometimes two branches coming to the same conclusion

20:49.600 --> 20:51.600
 is taken as evidence for its reality.

20:51.600 --> 20:56.600
 So one of the negative consequences is it creates phenomena

20:56.600 --> 21:00.600
 that are outside the reach of experimental science.

21:00.600 --> 21:07.600
 Or is it that the multiverse somehow has a philosophical negative effect on humanity?

21:07.600 --> 21:13.600
 Like it makes life seem more meaningless?

21:13.600 --> 21:16.600
 Is that where he's getting at a little bit?

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
 Or is it not reaching that far?

21:18.600 --> 21:21.600
 No, I think those are both kind of perceptive.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.600
 The answer is a little both,

21:23.600 --> 21:28.600
 because in one sense, it's meant kind of to explain this fine tuning problem

21:28.600 --> 21:31.600
 that we find ourselves in a universe that's particularly façade.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.600
 It has features consistent with our existence.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.600
 And how could we be otherwise, the sort of weak anthropic principle?

21:38.600 --> 21:42.600
 On the other hand, a theory that predicts everything,

21:42.600 --> 21:45.600
 literally everything, can be said to predict nothing.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.600
 Like if I say, Lex, you've been working out.

21:48.600 --> 21:54.600
 You look like you're about somewhere under 10,000 kilograms.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.600
 Like, all right, yeah, you're right, but that's completely horribly imprecise.

21:57.600 --> 21:58.600
 So what good is that?

21:58.600 --> 21:59.600
 That's meaningless.

21:59.600 --> 22:05.600
 I don't contribute any what's called surprise or reduction of your ignorance about the system.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.600
 You know exactly how much you weigh.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.600
 So me telling you that tells you nothing.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.600
 In this case, it's basically saying that we're living in a universe

22:12.600 --> 22:18.600
 because the overwhelming odds of our existence dictate that we would exist.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.600
 There has to be at least one place that we exist.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.600
 But the problem is it's a manifestation of infinity.

22:23.600 --> 22:29.600
 So humans, and I'm sure you know this from your work with AI and L and everything else,

22:29.600 --> 22:37.600
 that humans, as far as we know, really are the only entities capable of contemplating infinity.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.600
 But we do so very imperfectly, right?

22:40.600 --> 22:44.600
 So if I say to you, like, what's bigger the number of water molecules in this thing

22:44.600 --> 22:46.600
 or the number of real numbers?

22:46.600 --> 22:48.600
 Or if I say, what's bigger the number of real numbers or rational numbers?

22:48.600 --> 22:52.600
 They're all different classifications of the amount of infinities that there could be.

22:52.600 --> 22:54.600
 Infinity to the infinity power.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.600
 You know, when you have kids someday, they'll tell you, I love you, infinity.

22:56.600 --> 22:59.600
 You have to come back. I love you, infinity plus one, right?

22:59.600 --> 23:03.600
 But the human brain can't really contemplate infinity.

23:03.600 --> 23:04.600
 Let me illustrate that.

23:04.600 --> 23:10.600
 They say in the singularity, the universe had an infinite temperature, right?

23:10.600 --> 23:12.600
 So let me ask you a question.

23:12.600 --> 23:17.600
 Is there anything that you can contemplate in the observed, you know, Einstein's little quip aside

23:17.600 --> 23:21.600
 that's infinite, like a physical property, density, pressure, temperature.

23:21.600 --> 23:24.600
 Energy. That's infinite.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.600
 And if you can think of such thing, I'd like to know it.

23:27.600 --> 23:30.600
 But if you can, how does it go to infinity minus one?

23:30.600 --> 23:32.600
 You know, the opposite direction I go with my kids.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.600
 How does it go from, like, to half of infinity?

23:34.600 --> 23:35.600
 Because that's still infinity.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.600
 How did it cool down?

23:36.600 --> 23:39.600
 How did it get more and more tenuous and rarefied?

23:39.600 --> 23:42.600
 So now it's only infinity over two in terms of past.

23:42.600 --> 23:44.600
 Less infinite, more infinite.

23:44.600 --> 23:53.600
 Yeah, I mean, it's, that's one of the biggest troubling things to me about infinity is you can't truly hold it inside our minds.

23:53.600 --> 23:57.600
 It's a mathematical construct that doesn't, it feels like intuition fails.

23:57.600 --> 24:05.600
 But nevertheless, we use it nonchalantly and then use, like physicists, their incredible intuition machines.

24:05.600 --> 24:11.600
 And then they'll play with this infinity as if they can play with it on the level of intuition as opposed to on the level of math.

24:11.600 --> 24:20.600
 You know, yeah, maybe something cyclical you can imagine infinity just going around the same kind of like a mobius strip situation.

24:20.600 --> 24:25.600
 But then the question then arises, how do you make it more or less infinite?

24:25.600 --> 24:28.600
 Yeah, all of that intuition fails completely.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.600
 And I mean, how do you represent it in a computer, right?

24:30.600 --> 24:39.600
 It's either some placeholder for infinity or it's one divided by a very, the smallest, you know, possible, you know, rat real number that you can represent in the memory.

24:39.600 --> 24:45.600
 Well, that's basically my undergraduate studying computer science is how to represent a floating point in a computer.

24:45.600 --> 24:48.600
 I think I took 17 courses on this topic. It was very useful.

24:48.600 --> 24:53.600
 I came to the right place, but, but, you know, in terms of what a physicist will mean, you're right.

24:53.600 --> 25:00.600
 I mean, physicists will blindly, nonchalantly subtract infinity, you know, renormalization and do things to get finite answers.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.600
 And it's, it's, it's miraculous.

25:02.600 --> 25:07.600
 But, you know, at a certain point, you have to ask, well, what are the consequences for the real world?

25:07.600 --> 25:11.600
 And one of them, you ask, you know, what, what's the problem? Does it make us more meaningless?

25:11.600 --> 25:14.600
 They purport many of the people that support it, like Andre Lindy.

25:14.600 --> 25:22.600
 In fact, Andre Lindy says, you have a bias. You, Lex, me, Brian, you have a bias that you believe in a universe.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.600
 But shouldn't you believe in a, in a multiverse?

25:25.600 --> 25:28.600
 What, what evidence do you have that there's not a multiverse?

25:28.600 --> 25:29.600
 So he turns it around.

25:29.600 --> 25:35.600
 Whereas Paul Steinhart will say, no, if anything can happen, then there's no predictive power within the theory.

25:35.600 --> 25:45.600
 Because you can always say, well, this value of the inflationary field did not produce sufficient gravitational wave energy for us to detect it with Bicep or Simon's Observatory or whatever.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.600
 But that doesn't mean that inflation didn't happen.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.600
 And that's logically 100% correct.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.600
 But it's like, it's like kind of chewing, you know, Wonder, Wonder Bread.

25:53.600 --> 25:57.600
 You know, I'm sorry, I apologize if they're one of your sponsors, but, you know.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.600
 Wonder Bread slash Lex.com.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.600
 Type in code, Kleb, right?

26:02.600 --> 26:06.600
 It's my favorite Russian word is like, would you like a piece of bread?

26:06.600 --> 26:14.600
 By the way, even that, that word, which means bread and Russian, as you say it, like you're jokingly saying it now.

26:14.600 --> 26:19.600
 It made me hungry because it made me remember how much I loved bread and I was in the Soviet Union.

26:19.600 --> 26:23.600
 When you were like, hungry, that was the sort, that was the things you dreamed about.

26:23.600 --> 26:24.600
 I don't know.

26:24.600 --> 26:32.600
 You know, what's amazing is how many of the Soviet scientists contributed to so much of what we understand today.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.600
 And they were completely in hiding.

26:33.600 --> 26:34.600
 There was no Google.

26:34.600 --> 26:35.600
 They couldn't look up on Scholar.

26:35.600 --> 26:36.600
 They had nothing.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.600
 They had to wait for journals to get approved by the Communist Party to get approved.

26:39.600 --> 26:45.600
 And then, and then, and only then, if they weren't a member of some class, I'm sure you know, like Jewish scientists, you had a passport.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.600
 I said, Jew on your passport.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.600
 Yeah.

26:48.600 --> 26:55.600
 And then, you know, Zeldovich, the famous Yakov Borisovich Zeldovich, he was the advisor, one of my advisors, Alexander Polnarev.

26:55.600 --> 27:03.600
 And he had to only because he was like at a noble level and, you know, was one of the fathers of the Soviet atomic bomb program.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.600
 Could he even get his Jewish student?

27:05.600 --> 27:06.600
 He was Jewish too.

27:06.600 --> 27:15.600
 But, but only by virtue of his standing, of his intellectual accomplishments, would they give him the dispensation to let his student, you know, travel to Georgia or something.

27:15.600 --> 27:20.600
 And it makes what we complain about, I complain about academia and it's like, oh, well, what can I talk about?

27:20.600 --> 27:27.600
 We have no idea of how good it is and that they were able to create things like inflation, completely isolated from the West.

27:27.600 --> 27:32.600
 I mean, some of these people wouldn't, didn't meet like people like Stephen Hawking until, you know, he was almost dead.

27:32.600 --> 27:38.600
 And they just learned this thing through smuggled in, you know, it's, it's, it's a work of heroism, especially in cosmology.

27:38.600 --> 27:44.600
 There's so many cosmologists that worked incredibly hard, probably because they were working the, they could, they could pass off as well.

27:44.600 --> 27:47.600
 We're doing stuff for the atomic bomb program as well, which they were.

27:47.600 --> 27:56.600
 At the same time, there is interesting incentives in the Soviet system that maybe you can take this tangent for a brief moment.

27:56.600 --> 28:06.600
 That because there's a dictatorship authoritarian regime throughout the history of the 20th century for the Soviet Union, science was prioritized.

28:06.600 --> 28:15.600
 And because the state prioritized it through the propaganda machine, through the news and so on, it actually was really cool to be a scientist.

28:15.600 --> 28:17.600
 Like you were highly valued in society.

28:17.600 --> 28:19.600
 Maybe that's a better way to say it.

28:19.600 --> 28:24.600
 And I would say you're saying like we have it easy now in that sense.

28:24.600 --> 28:33.600
 It was kind of beneficial to be a scientist in that society because you were seen as a hero as there's, there's, there's famous hero of the Soviet Republic.

28:33.600 --> 28:36.600
 And that, you know, there's positives to that.

28:36.600 --> 28:45.600
 I mean, I'm not saying I would take the negative to the positives, but it is interesting to see a world in which science was highly prized.

28:45.600 --> 29:00.600
 In, in the capitalist system, or maybe not capitalist, let's just say the American system, the celebrities are the, the athletes, the actors and actresses, maybe business leaders, musicians.

29:00.600 --> 29:07.600
 And, you know, the people we elect are sort of lawyers and lawyers.

29:07.600 --> 29:20.600
 So it's interesting to think of a world where science was highly prized, but they had to do that science within the constraints of always having big brother watching.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.600
 Yeah.

29:21.600 --> 29:22.600
 Same in Germany.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
 Germany had, you know, highly prized.

29:23.600 --> 29:31.600
 I mean, one of the most famous tragic to me cases is Fritz Haber, who invented the, you know, Haber Bosch process that allowed us to, I don't know, have you eaten yet?

29:31.600 --> 29:32.600
 You look, you look slim.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.600
 I mean, I know you fast, intermittent fast every day.

29:34.600 --> 29:40.600
 And you do that, you know, I said club and you got, it's a little drool, but he says I'm lifting and I look slim.

29:40.600 --> 29:41.600
 This is amazing.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.600
 I'm going to clip this out and put it on Tinder.

29:43.600 --> 29:44.600
 I think that's a website.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.600
 You gotta swipe left or right for that.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
 I don't know.

29:47.600 --> 29:55.600
 But when you think about like, you know, what he did and created the fertilizer process that we all enjoy and we eat from every day.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.600
 He was a German nationalist, first and foremost, even though he was a Jew.

29:59.600 --> 30:08.600
 And he personally went to witness the application of ammonia chlorine gas applied during trench warfare in 1916 and battles in Brussels and whatever.

30:08.600 --> 30:14.600
 And he was, they had a whole contract of Nobel laureates in chemistry and physics, you know, that would go and witness these atrocities.

30:14.600 --> 30:23.600
 But that was also, they were, they were almost putting science above, I don't want to say human dignity, but, but of like the fact that he would later be suppressed.

30:23.600 --> 30:31.600
 And actually some of his relatives would die in Auschwitz because of the chemical that he invented also called Zycon B.

30:31.600 --> 30:32.600
 And so it's just, it's just unbelievable.

30:32.600 --> 30:43.600
 So I feel like that does have resonance today in this worship of, of science, you know, and listen to science and follow the science, which is more like scientism.

30:43.600 --> 30:54.600
 And there is still a danger, you know, I always say, just because you're an atheist doesn't mean you don't have a religion, you know, just because you, you know, in my case, in my books, I talk a lot about the Nobel Prize.

30:54.600 --> 30:59.600
 It's kind of like a kosher idol is something that you can worship, you know, it doesn't do any harm.

30:59.600 --> 31:12.600
 And we want those people that are so significant in their intellectual accomplishments because there is a core of America and the Western world in general that does worship and really look at science predominantly because it gives us technology.

31:12.600 --> 31:14.600
 But there's something really cool about that.

31:14.600 --> 31:29.600
 And so for me, it's hard to find that balance point between, between looking to science for wisdom, which I don't think it has, there are two different words, but, but also recognizing how much good and transformative power maybe our only hope comes from science.

31:29.600 --> 31:45.600
 You opened so many doors, because you also bring up our Ernest Becker in that book. So there's a lot of elements of religiosity to science and to the Nobel Prize that's fascinating to explore.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.600
 And we will.

31:47.600 --> 31:53.600
 And we still haven't finished the discussion of the beginning of the, of the universe, which we will return to.

31:53.600 --> 32:00.600
 But now, since you opened the book, wow, pun unintended of losing the Nobel Prize.

32:00.600 --> 32:10.600
 Can you tell me the story of bicep, the background imaging of cosmic extra galactic polarization experiment, bicep one and bicep two.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.600
 And then maybe you can talk about bicep three.

32:12.600 --> 32:18.600
 But the, the thing that you cover in your book, the human story of it, what happened?

32:18.600 --> 32:34.600
 Yeah, that book is in contradiction to the second book. That's like a memoir. It's really a description of what it's like to feel, what it feels like to be a scientist and to come up with the ignorance, uncertainty, imposter syndrome, which, which I cover in the later

32:34.600 --> 32:39.600
 book in more detail, but to really feel like you're doing something.

32:39.600 --> 32:49.600
 And it's all you think about. It is all consuming. And it's something I couldn't have done now because I have too many other, you know, wonderful, delightful demands of my time.

32:49.600 --> 33:05.600
 But to go back to that moment when I was first captivated by the night sky, who has a 12 year old, 13 year old, and really mixed together throughout my scientific story has always been wanting to approach the greatest mystery of all, which I think is the existence or non existence of God.

33:05.600 --> 33:15.600
 So I call myself a practicing agnostic. In other words, I do things that are that religious people do, and I don't do things that atheist people do.

33:15.600 --> 33:23.600
 And I once had this conversation, you know, with my first podcast guest, actually, I shouldn't say, oh, I was just, just having a conversation with Freeman Dyson, but he was actually my first guest.

33:23.600 --> 33:23.600
 Yeah.

33:23.600 --> 33:24.600
 And I miss him.

33:24.600 --> 33:25.600
 Name drop.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.600
 Name drop. Yes. I'm sure there's going to be plenty of comments.

33:28.600 --> 33:42.600
 So in case people don't know, Brian Keating is the host of Into the Impossible podcast where he's talked to some of the greatest scientists in history of science, physicists, especially in the history of science.

33:42.600 --> 33:50.600
 So when I talked to Freeman, I said, you know, Freeman, you're, you call yourself an agnostic too. Can you tell me something like what, what do you do on Saturday, on Sundays?

33:50.600 --> 34:01.600
 Do you go to church? It's like, no, I don't go to church. And I'm like, well, imagine there was like an intelligent alien, and he was looking down or she was, I don't know, it thing was looking down.

34:01.600 --> 34:08.600
 And it's off Freeman. And on Sundays, like a group of people go to church, but Freeman doesn't go to church. And then there's another group of people that don't go to church.

34:08.600 --> 34:17.600
 And those are called atheists. But Freeman calls himself an agnostic, but he does the things that the Richard Dawkins, he doesn't go to the same church that Richard Dawkins doesn't go to.

34:17.600 --> 34:27.600
 Right. So I said, how would you distinguish yourself if not practice? So I'm a behaviorist. I believe you can change your mentality, you can, you can influence your mind, view your bodily physical actions.

34:27.600 --> 34:36.600
 So when I was a 12 year old, I got my first telescope, I was actually an altar boy in the Catholic church, which is kind of strange for a Jewish kid who grew up in New York, maybe we'll get into that, maybe not.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.600
 But I was just fascinated by these, these.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.600
 Can we get into it for a second?

34:42.600 --> 34:44.600
 Okay, yeah, let's go.

34:44.600 --> 34:52.600
 All right, let's go there. Let's go to baby Brian or young Brian, the new sitcom on CBS.

34:52.600 --> 34:59.600
 Young Brian born to two Jewish parents. My father was a professor at SUNY Stony Brook, he was a mathematician, eminent mathematician.

34:59.600 --> 35:05.600
 And my mother was an eminent mom and brilliant English major, etc.

35:05.600 --> 35:13.600
 And they raised that they were secular and they think, you know, we'd go to Iowa's job, we'd go to, we'd go to synagogue, you know, two times a year on Christmas and Easter.

35:13.600 --> 35:18.600
 No, no, we would go, you know, Yom Kippur, Rosh Hashanah, right? That's the typical two day a year Jews.

35:18.600 --> 35:22.600
 And, you know, we'd have, we'd have matzahs once a year on Pam Passover.

35:22.600 --> 35:27.600
 And that was about it. And for years, I was like that until my parents got divorced.

35:27.600 --> 35:33.600
 My mother remarried and she married an Irish Catholic man by the name of Ray Keating, my father's name is James X.

35:33.600 --> 35:39.600
 So when she remarried Ray Keating, I was immediately adopted.

35:39.600 --> 35:45.600
 I'm actually adopted into the Keating family and he had nine brothers and sisters and just warm and gregarious.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.600
 They, you know, did Christmas and Easter.

35:48.600 --> 35:53.600
 It was one of the most wonderful experiences I had and I do things with great gusto.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.600
 Whatever I do, I want to take it all the way.

35:55.600 --> 35:59.600
 So to me, that meant really learning about Christianity, in this case Catholicism.

35:59.600 --> 36:03.600
 So I was baptized, confirmed, and I said, I want to go all the way.

36:03.600 --> 36:06.600
 I became an altar boy in the Catholic Church.

36:06.600 --> 36:09.600
 And you're going to be the best altar boy there ever was.

36:09.600 --> 36:12.600
 I had like serious skills. You passed that collection basket.

36:12.600 --> 36:16.600
 I could push people and get them to two extra contributions.

36:16.600 --> 36:19.600
 But in this case, I was 13.

36:19.600 --> 36:22.600
 I don't know if you remember, you know, when you were 13.

36:22.600 --> 36:27.600
 But if you extrapolate the next level up, you know, it's like you go graduate student, postdoc, professor.

36:27.600 --> 36:31.600
 The next level up from, you know, confirmation altar boy is priest.

36:31.600 --> 36:36.600
 And I don't know if you're aware of this, but priests are not entitled to have relations with women.

36:36.600 --> 36:44.600
 And as a 13 year old boy, kind of like future forecasting what life's going to be like for myself if I continue on my path.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.600
 I found it, maybe I...

36:46.600 --> 36:47.600
 The math is not up.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.600
 That's right.

36:48.600 --> 36:53.600
 There was a serious gap in that future and that future.

36:53.600 --> 36:59.600
 And instead, when I should have been preparing for my bar mitzvah, you know, as most Jewish boys would be a 12, 13 year old boy,

36:59.600 --> 37:04.600
 I actually got a telescope and became infatuated with all the things you could see with it.

37:04.600 --> 37:07.600
 It wasn't bigger than that one over there that you're hedgehogs looking through.

37:07.600 --> 37:09.600
 Is that a hedgehog?

37:09.600 --> 37:12.600
 It's a hedgehog, hedgehog in the fog.

37:12.600 --> 37:15.600
 I should mention, and we'll go one by one, these things.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.600
 You've given me some incredible gifts.

37:17.600 --> 37:25.600
 Maybe this is a good place to ask about the telescope that put some clamps on and let the hedgehogs look and using...

37:25.600 --> 37:27.600
 Now you're officially an experimental astrophysicist by the way.

37:27.600 --> 37:29.600
 Why experimentalist versus an engineer?

37:29.600 --> 37:34.600
 Because you assembled this telescope, you gave it a mount and you connected it to a very powerful...

37:34.600 --> 37:36.600
 Yeah, but there's no experiment going on.

37:36.600 --> 37:38.600
 It's just engineering for show.

37:38.600 --> 37:39.600
 It's very shallow.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.600
 Experiment is taking it to the next level and actually achieving something.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.600
 Here, I just built a thing for show.

37:44.600 --> 37:45.600
 Well, that's always a joke.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.600
 People say, oh, you're an experimental cosmologist.

37:47.600 --> 37:49.600
 I'm like, yeah, I build a lot of universes.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.600
 Actually, most of my time is putting clamps on things, soldering things.

37:52.600 --> 37:59.600
 It's not actually doing the stroking of my non existent beard, contemplating the cyclic versus the bouncing cosmological model.

37:59.600 --> 38:03.600
 Yeah, and just like most of robotics is just using Velcro for things.

38:03.600 --> 38:04.600
 Right, yeah.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.600
 It's not like having dancing dogs and whatever, right?

38:07.600 --> 38:08.600
 So telescope.

38:08.600 --> 38:09.600
 Yes, this telescope.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.600
 What's the story of this little telescope?

38:11.600 --> 38:14.600
 This telescope's a very precious thing in some ways.

38:14.600 --> 38:20.600
 It's a symbol of what brought me all the blessings I have in my life.

38:20.600 --> 38:22.600
 It came from a telescope.

38:22.600 --> 38:26.600
 And I always advise parents or even people for themselves.

38:26.600 --> 38:32.600
 You right here, wherever we are, at Biggest City on Earth, Manhattan, where I was growing up as a 12 year old outside of Manhattan.

38:32.600 --> 38:40.600
 You can see the exact same craters on the moon, the same rings of sounder and the same moons of Jupiter, the same phases of...

38:40.600 --> 38:45.600
 You can see the Andromeda galaxy lacks two and a half million light years away from Earth.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.600
 You can do that with that little thing over there.

38:47.600 --> 38:51.600
 You know, one that's a little more expensive, get one that has a mount and you can attach now your smartphone.

38:51.600 --> 38:52.600
 What the hell is that?

38:52.600 --> 38:54.600
 I wouldn't have known what that was in 1984.

38:54.600 --> 39:02.600
 And with that, you can do something that no other science to my knowledge can really replicate, maybe biology in some sense.

39:02.600 --> 39:12.600
 But you can experience the physical sensation that Galileo experienced when he turned a telescope like that to Jupiter and saw these four dots around it.

39:12.600 --> 39:22.600
 Or that Saturn had ears, as he called it, or that the moon was not crystalline polished smooth and made of this heavenly substance, the quintessence substance, right?

39:22.600 --> 39:27.600
 So where else can you be viscerally connected with the first person to ever make that discovery?

39:27.600 --> 39:29.600
 Try doing that with the Higgs boson.

39:29.600 --> 39:35.600
 You know, get yourself an LHC and smash together, you know, high luminosity, you know, call a paracliff and say, you know, I want to replicate.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.600
 How did you feel?

39:36.600 --> 39:37.600
 He didn't feel anything.

39:37.600 --> 39:38.600
 None of them felt anything.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.600
 It took years to go, Mila, you can't do it.

39:41.600 --> 39:44.600
 But with this, you can feel the exact same emotions.

39:44.600 --> 39:45.600
 That's fascinating.

39:45.600 --> 39:49.600
 It's almost like maybe there's another one like that is fire.

39:49.600 --> 39:50.600
 Yes.

39:50.600 --> 39:53.600
 Like when you build a bonfire, like, can you actually get it?

39:53.600 --> 40:01.600
 See, if you use a lighter, I think if you actually, by rubbing sticks together or however you do it without any of the modern tools, that's probably what that's like.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.600
 Yeah.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.600
 And then you get to experience the magic of it.

40:04.600 --> 40:06.600
 Of what, like, early humans.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.600
 Yeah, you feel what Ag felt when he did it that first time.

40:10.600 --> 40:11.600
 By the way, is this a gift?

40:11.600 --> 40:12.600
 This is a gift, of course.

40:12.600 --> 40:16.600
 You need a little bit of a swag upgrade, so I got you some gifts.

40:16.600 --> 40:23.600
 Yeah, this is a, I'm pulling a Putin, like, asked if this is a gift, making it very uncomfortable for you.

40:23.600 --> 40:24.600
 Not really.

40:24.600 --> 40:27.600
 This is actually my childhood telescope here.

40:27.600 --> 40:29.600
 But now I'm keeping it.

40:29.600 --> 40:30.600
 That's right.

40:30.600 --> 40:34.600
 So looking through this telescope was when your love for science was first born.

40:34.600 --> 40:43.600
 Change my life, because not only was I doing that, I was replicating what Galileo did, but I was, and I'm 100% not comparing myself to Galileo Galileo.

40:43.600 --> 40:44.600
 Okay, if there's any confusion out there.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.600
 But I did replicate exactly what he did, and I was like, holy crap, this is weird.

40:48.600 --> 40:49.600
 Let me write it down.

40:49.600 --> 40:54.600
 So it had another effect, which all good scientists, budding scientists should do, and all parents should do.

40:54.600 --> 40:57.600
 Get your kid a book, a little notebook, tape a pencil to it.

40:57.600 --> 41:01.600
 Write down what you see, what you hypothesize, what you think it's going to be.

41:01.600 --> 41:07.600
 Not like in the high school, you know, like hypothesis, thesis, but just like, wow, how did I feel?

41:07.600 --> 41:09.600
 Better yet, astronomy is a visual science.

41:09.600 --> 41:14.600
 Sketch what you see, the Lagoon Nebula, the Pleiades Seven Sisters.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.600
 You can see them anywhere on Earth.

41:16.600 --> 41:24.600
 And when you do that, again, you're connecting two different hemispheres of your brain, as I understand it, and you're connecting them through your fingertips.

41:24.600 --> 41:30.600
 You literally have the knowledge in your fingertips, in your connection between what you see, what you observe, and what you write down.

41:30.600 --> 41:33.600
 Then you do research, right?

41:33.600 --> 41:37.600
 The goal of science is not to just replicate what other people did, is do something new.

41:37.600 --> 41:41.600
 And that's what we call it, research, and not just like studying, you know, Wikipedia.

41:41.600 --> 41:47.600
 And in so doing, you start to train a kid at age 12 or 13 for 50 bucks.

41:47.600 --> 41:48.600
 It's unbelievable.

41:48.600 --> 41:52.600
 And now we can do even better, because you can share it on Instagram or whatever.

41:52.600 --> 41:59.600
 And you can, by doing so, have an entree into the world of what does it really mean to be a scientist and do so viscerally?

41:59.600 --> 42:09.600
 You know, I often say, I was taught this by my English teacher, Mrs. Tompkins, in ninth grade, that the word educate, it doesn't mean to pour into.

42:09.600 --> 42:12.600
 Let me pour in some facts into lex and, you know, it's not like machine learning.

42:12.600 --> 42:16.600
 You're just showing like billions of cats or, you know, you're not like forcing it in.

42:16.600 --> 42:17.600
 You're bringing it out.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.600
 It means to pour out of in Latin, edukare.

42:19.600 --> 42:24.600
 And what more could a teacher want than to have something that the kid is just like gushing?

42:24.600 --> 42:25.600
 You're not going to see like...

42:25.600 --> 42:26.600
 To inspire the kid.

42:26.600 --> 42:27.600
 Yes.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.600
 Inspire.

42:28.600 --> 42:29.600
 That's awesome.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.600
 Mrs. Tompkins.

42:30.600 --> 42:31.600
 Yeah, Mrs. Tompkins.

42:31.600 --> 42:32.600
 She's watching.

42:32.600 --> 42:33.600
 Yeah.

42:33.600 --> 42:34.600
 She's a big fan.

42:34.600 --> 42:35.600
 Me, she doesn't care for it, but you.

42:35.600 --> 42:36.600
 Yeah, excellent.

42:36.600 --> 42:38.600
 We take those we love for granted.

42:38.600 --> 42:40.600
 This is in Manhattan.

42:40.600 --> 42:42.600
 This is in Westchester County, New York.

42:42.600 --> 42:43.600
 Got it.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.600
 So, okay.

42:44.600 --> 42:46.600
 So, but then that's where the dream is born.

42:46.600 --> 42:47.600
 Yeah.

42:47.600 --> 42:51.600
 But then there is the pragmatic journey of a scientist.

42:51.600 --> 42:57.600
 So, going to university, graduate school, postdoc, and all the way to where you are today.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.600
 What's that?

42:59.600 --> 43:02.600
 What are some notable moments in that journey?

43:02.600 --> 43:04.600
 So, I call that the academic hunger games.

43:04.600 --> 43:09.600
 You know, because it's like you're competing against like these people, you know, who are

43:09.600 --> 43:12.600
 just getting smarter all the time as you're getting smarter all the time.

43:12.600 --> 43:15.600
 They want to get into a fewer and fewer number of slots.

43:15.600 --> 43:18.600
 Like there's fewer slots to get into college than in high school.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.600
 There's fewer slots in graduate school.

43:20.600 --> 43:22.600
 There's fewer, very fewer slots to be a postdoc.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.600
 And many, many, maybe infinitesimal number.

43:25.600 --> 43:30.600
 You know, we just did a faculty search at UC San Diego, 400 applicants for one position.

43:30.600 --> 43:32.600
 It's almost getting impossible.

43:32.600 --> 43:36.600
 Like I almost can't conceive of doing what these new brilliant young people applying to

43:36.600 --> 43:39.600
 become an assistant professor at a state university that they're doing.

43:39.600 --> 43:42.600
 Like it takes so much courage to do that.

43:42.600 --> 43:46.600
 So, I went from, you know, this kid in New York thinking I would never be a professional

43:46.600 --> 43:47.600
 astronomer.

43:47.600 --> 43:49.600
 A, because I didn't know any.

43:49.600 --> 43:50.600
 I'd never seen any.

43:50.600 --> 43:52.600
 I didn't even know that they existed.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.600
 And I thought, who the hell is going to pay me to look at the stars?

43:55.600 --> 43:57.600
 Like, won't they pay me to be like an ice cream taster?

43:57.600 --> 44:00.600
 Like, it's just not something I could conceive of getting paid to do, even if I had the

44:00.600 --> 44:03.600
 brilliance to do it, which I didn't feel I did.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.600
 And then I went to graduate school.

44:05.600 --> 44:11.600
 And during graduate school, I had this kind of on again, off again, relationship with

44:11.600 --> 44:12.600
 my father.

44:12.600 --> 44:14.600
 And I knew that he was a mathematician.

44:14.600 --> 44:17.600
 He had left and gotten remarried himself and moved across the country.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.600
 I didn't see him for 15 years.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.600
 And in that time, I learned a lot about him.

44:22.600 --> 44:25.600
 And I learned that he had gotten very interested, not in pure mathematics, which he had been

44:25.600 --> 44:31.600
 a number theorist and contributed seminal work on the Fantine equations, which play a role

44:31.600 --> 44:33.600
 in Turing's work, you may have seen.

44:33.600 --> 44:37.600
 But anyway, he had become interested, turned completely away from that into the foundations

44:37.600 --> 44:40.600
 of quantum mechanics and relativity, which is physics.

44:40.600 --> 44:42.600
 And by that time, I was at Brown University.

44:42.600 --> 44:46.600
 And I was, you know, thinking, oh, maybe I'll be condensed matter physicist or experimentalist.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.600
 I never thought I'd be a theorist.

44:47.600 --> 44:49.600
 And I'm not a theorist.

44:49.600 --> 44:51.600
 So it was pretty prescient.

44:51.600 --> 44:55.600
 But it always appealed to me, like, why not do what made me happy as a 12 year old?

44:55.600 --> 45:00.600
 Like, we often forget about, like, those, you know, primitive things about us are probably

45:00.600 --> 45:03.600
 the most sustainable, durable, and resilient attributes of our character.

45:03.600 --> 45:06.600
 So with my own kids, like, what are they interested in now when they're young?

45:06.600 --> 45:08.600
 And it doesn't mean that's what they're going to do.

45:08.600 --> 45:11.600
 I mean, some of them want to play Fortnite, you know, like professional Fortnite play,

45:11.600 --> 45:12.600
 which there are.

45:12.600 --> 45:15.600
 But, you know, the odds of that is less than the odds of being a professor.

45:15.600 --> 45:18.600
 Can I ask you, is your father still with us?

45:18.600 --> 45:19.600
 No.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.600
 Just in a small tangent.

45:23.600 --> 45:24.600
 Yeah.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.600
 Do you miss him?

45:25.600 --> 45:26.600
 Do you think about him?

45:26.600 --> 45:31.600
 Does his mathematical journey reverberate through who you are?

45:31.600 --> 45:32.600
 Oh, yeah, absolutely.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.600
 I mean, it did in very many ways.

45:35.600 --> 45:37.600
 And he's been gone for a long time now.

45:37.600 --> 45:43.600
 Thinking back to that time with him, he must have instilled some capacity for me to only

45:43.600 --> 45:46.600
 want to spend my time, which is a limited quantity.

45:46.600 --> 45:48.600
 I don't think it's the most limited quantity.

45:48.600 --> 45:49.600
 Maybe we'll talk about that later.

45:49.600 --> 45:55.600
 But to go into only the most challenging, interesting things with the limited time that

45:55.600 --> 45:56.600
 we have while we're alive.

45:56.600 --> 45:59.600
 And for him, it was the foundations of quantum mechanics.

45:59.600 --> 46:02.600
 For me, it was the foundations of the universe.

46:02.600 --> 46:03.600
 And how did it come to be?

46:03.600 --> 46:06.600
 And I felt like, well, people have been trying since Einstein to outdo Einstein.

46:06.600 --> 46:10.600
 It really haven't made great progress in the foundations of quantum mechanics.

46:10.600 --> 46:15.600
 But this is an exciting time, the Kobe satellite had just released its data that the universe

46:15.600 --> 46:17.600
 had this anisotropy pattern.

46:17.600 --> 46:21.600
 Stephen Hawking called it like looking at the face of God and so forth.

46:21.600 --> 46:25.600
 And so it seemed like this is a good golden age for what I'm going to do and what I'm

46:25.600 --> 46:26.600
 most interested in.

46:26.600 --> 46:30.600
 But always throughout that, I wanted to understand, I didn't want to be a wrench monkey.

46:30.600 --> 46:32.600
 No offense to people that just do experiment.

46:32.600 --> 46:33.600
 And no offense to monkeys.

46:33.600 --> 46:34.600
 No offense to monkeys.

46:34.600 --> 46:35.600
 That's right.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.600
 This little guy.

46:36.600 --> 46:37.600
 Sorry, man.

46:37.600 --> 46:43.600
 But thinking back to what animates me, it's not doing the engineering as much as it is

46:43.600 --> 46:44.600
 getting the data.

46:44.600 --> 46:45.600
 But there's a lot of steps.

46:45.600 --> 46:52.100
 I want to be the guy understanding what made the universe produce the signal that we saw.

46:52.100 --> 46:56.600
 So I always joke with my theorist friends, call me a closeted theorist.

46:56.600 --> 47:01.520
 I want to be, they call a guy who hangs out with musicians, a drummer.

47:01.520 --> 47:04.160
 So I want to be like that for physics, right?

47:04.160 --> 47:05.160
 For theoretical physics.

47:05.160 --> 47:08.840
 I want to be like the guy doesn't do new theory, but understands the theory that the new theorists

47:08.840 --> 47:09.840
 are doing.

47:09.840 --> 47:17.960
 I love that formulation of a theorist is understanding the source of the signal you're getting.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.080
 Signal is primary.

47:20.080 --> 47:29.100
 The thing you measure is primary and theory is just the search of explaining how that

47:29.100 --> 47:30.600
 signal originated.

47:30.600 --> 47:31.800
 But it's all about the signal.

47:31.800 --> 47:38.080
 I see the same search for the human mind and neuroscience in that same kind of way.

47:38.080 --> 47:43.480
 It's ultimately about the signal, but you kind of hope to understand how that signal

47:43.480 --> 47:44.480
 originated.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.480
 That's fascinating.

47:45.480 --> 47:54.360
 That's such a beautiful way to explain experimental physics, because it ultimately at the end

47:54.360 --> 47:58.000
 of the day is all about the signal.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.000
 Yeah.

47:59.000 --> 48:03.760
 So maybe those two things, the neuroscience and the cosmos, not getting too romantic,

48:03.760 --> 48:07.480
 but yeah, maybe they're linked in some fundamental way.

48:07.480 --> 48:09.920
 Some fundamental consciousness, cosmic consciousness.

48:09.920 --> 48:11.520
 We're going to get to that.

48:11.520 --> 48:12.520
 Yeah.

48:12.520 --> 48:13.520
 Yeah.

48:13.520 --> 48:14.520
 No, we definitely have to get to that.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.840
 But getting back to that, so my origins, so I always say like, and I want to try this

48:17.840 --> 48:18.840
 on you.

48:18.840 --> 48:21.400
 You said you wouldn't answer any of my questions, but I'm going to ask you some questions.

48:21.400 --> 48:23.160
 What's the most important day on the calendar?

48:23.160 --> 48:26.220
 Don't tell me the date, but to you, what is your most, what's the most important day to

48:26.220 --> 48:27.720
 you every year?

48:27.720 --> 48:29.760
 Do I have to answer or do I have to think about that?

48:29.760 --> 48:30.760
 No, no.

48:30.760 --> 48:32.240
 The answer, like you don't have to tell me the exact date of the calendar.

48:32.240 --> 48:35.160
 It could be like your mistress's birthday or whatever.

48:35.160 --> 48:38.320
 I have so many I lose track.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.320
 Even though I'm single.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.320
 How does that even make sense?

48:40.320 --> 48:41.320
 I know.

48:41.320 --> 48:42.320
 Okay.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.320
 I'm sorry.

48:43.320 --> 48:49.240
 So a day, like a month in a day, yeah, I mean, for me it would be December 31st.

48:49.240 --> 48:50.240
 Yeah.

48:50.240 --> 48:52.600
 So I was going to say New Year's Eve, New Year's Day.

48:52.600 --> 48:55.000
 Some people say birthday, anniversary, kid's birth.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.680
 They're usually signifying beginnings and ends, right?

48:58.680 --> 49:02.840
 January means the portal between the God was the portal between the beginning and the end.

49:02.840 --> 49:06.520
 So you're looking back maybe because you're Russian, you know, like the death side, the

49:06.520 --> 49:10.360
 light side looking forward to January, the beginning, right?

49:10.360 --> 49:17.360
 So everybody's most important day is usually some beginning or something significant.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.080
 For me, it was studying the most significant thing of all is like, when did the universe

49:20.080 --> 49:21.080
 get born?

49:21.080 --> 49:26.240
 Like I said before, and I didn't think there, again, I didn't, I just, there was some mental

49:26.240 --> 49:31.800
 obstruction that I didn't realize that I could get passed because I didn't think like anybody

49:31.800 --> 49:32.800
 does it.

49:32.800 --> 49:36.720
 Like I knew astronomers knew these answers, like the universe at that time between 10

49:36.720 --> 49:38.240
 and 20 billion years old.

49:38.240 --> 49:41.840
 Now we know it's 13.872 billion years old.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.640
 It's incredible, the five digit, you know, first significant 505.

49:44.640 --> 49:45.640
 What is it again?

49:45.640 --> 49:46.640
 13.8?

49:46.640 --> 49:51.000
 13.872 billion years, 872 million.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.920
 So is there a lot of plus or minus on that?

49:52.920 --> 49:54.160
 Is it, what are the air bars on that?

49:54.160 --> 49:55.380
 So for me, I'm 50.

49:55.380 --> 49:59.000
 So it would be the equivalent of you looking at me and telling me within 12 hours how old

49:59.000 --> 50:00.000
 I am.

50:00.000 --> 50:01.000
 Yeah.

50:01.000 --> 50:02.640
 So half a percent, percent level accuracy.

50:02.640 --> 50:03.880
 There's a confidence behind that.

50:03.880 --> 50:04.880
 Oh yeah.

50:04.880 --> 50:05.880
 I mean, there's a significance.

50:05.880 --> 50:06.880
 Yeah.

50:06.880 --> 50:07.880
 No, it's extremely well measured.

50:07.880 --> 50:11.600
 I mean, it's one of the most precise things that we have in contrast to, again, 25 years

50:11.600 --> 50:16.240
 ago, we didn't know if the universe was 10 billion or 20 billion years old, but there

50:16.240 --> 50:20.960
 were stars in our galaxy that were believed to be as they are about 12 billion years old.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.760
 Or in the universe that were 12 billion.

50:22.760 --> 50:26.760
 So that would be like you being older than your father.

50:26.760 --> 50:27.760
 It was embarrassing.

50:27.760 --> 50:31.920
 Can we actually take a tangent on a tangent, on a tangent, on a tangent?

50:31.920 --> 50:33.480
 How old is the universe?

50:33.480 --> 50:36.080
 Can you dig in onto this number?

50:36.080 --> 50:42.840
 How do we know currently with those, I guess you said four or five significant digits?

50:42.840 --> 50:45.320
 So we can come about it from two different ways.

50:45.320 --> 50:48.960
 One, basically they rely on the most important number in cosmology, which is called the

50:48.960 --> 50:49.960
 Hubble constant.

50:49.960 --> 50:54.000
 The Hubble constant is this weird number that has the following units.

50:54.000 --> 50:58.400
 It has the units of kilometers per second per megaparsec.

50:58.400 --> 51:02.240
 So it's a speed per distance, which means you multiply it by distance and you get a

51:02.240 --> 51:03.240
 speed.

51:03.240 --> 51:04.240
 And what is the speed you're measuring?

51:04.240 --> 51:07.960
 Well, you're measuring the speed of a distant galaxy at many megaparsecs away.

51:07.960 --> 51:09.600
 So a galaxy at one megaparsec away.

51:09.600 --> 51:13.160
 This isn't actually strictly true because of local gravitational effects.

51:13.160 --> 51:17.640
 But if you go out, say, one megaparsec away, I would say that that galaxy is moving 72

51:17.640 --> 51:19.480
 kilometers per second away from you.

51:19.480 --> 51:23.880
 And every galaxy, except for the local, very most local group surrounding us, maybe a half

51:23.880 --> 51:32.800
 a dozen galaxies, out of 500 billion galaxies to perhaps a trillion galaxies.

51:32.800 --> 51:37.700
 So 12 out of that number are moving towards us, the rest are moving away from us.

51:37.700 --> 51:43.160
 So that number, if you invert it, if you say, well, when did those things last touch each

51:43.160 --> 51:44.360
 other, all those galaxies?

51:44.360 --> 51:45.920
 Now they're really far apart.

51:45.920 --> 51:46.920
 We know how fast they're moving away.

51:46.920 --> 51:50.440
 It's a very simple algebra problem to solve, when were they touching?

51:50.440 --> 51:52.080
 That's where you get that number from.

51:52.080 --> 51:54.280
 So there's the local 12 and then the rest.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.280
 Ignore the 12?

51:55.280 --> 51:56.280
 Yeah.

51:56.280 --> 52:01.120
 And then you ignore the 12 and then look at the others and solve the algebra problem.

52:01.120 --> 52:06.120
 How does the stuff in the beginning, the mystery of that beginning epoch change this

52:06.120 --> 52:07.720
 calculation of?

52:07.720 --> 52:12.360
 Very little because actually we understand how there's some other ingredients that go

52:12.360 --> 52:15.760
 into it, namely how much dark energy there is in the universe, how much dark matter there

52:15.760 --> 52:20.440
 is in the universe, how much radiation, light, neutrinos, et cetera, there are, and how much

52:20.440 --> 52:24.200
 ordinary matter like we're made up of, neutrons, protons, croutons.

52:24.200 --> 52:25.200
 Okay.

52:25.200 --> 52:31.400
 So the morons.

52:31.400 --> 52:37.560
 It appears that the universe is bigger than it is older.

52:37.560 --> 52:38.560
 How does that make sense?

52:38.560 --> 52:39.560
 Oh, yeah.

52:39.560 --> 52:43.840
 So you're talking about the fact that we can actually see stuff in our observable universe

52:43.840 --> 52:49.080
 that's located at a distance that is farther than the speed of light times the age of the

52:49.080 --> 52:50.080
 universe.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.080
 Yeah.

52:51.080 --> 52:52.080
 Naively, you would say that.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.080
 So you're right.

52:53.080 --> 52:56.760
 If the universe were static, if the universe came into existence, and you can conceive

52:56.760 --> 53:00.480
 of this, the universe came into a big bang in a fixed universe.

53:00.480 --> 53:05.600
 So the universe just started off and those galaxies were, they could be moving towards

53:05.600 --> 53:10.840
 us away from us, who knows, that you could say I can see a galaxy that's at a distance

53:10.840 --> 53:16.000
 of only 13.8 billion years times the speed of light, that would be true.

53:16.000 --> 53:20.520
 But the fact that the light is expanding along with the expansion of the universe.

53:20.520 --> 53:25.120
 So imagine there was some very distant past, we were near a galaxy, it's going to produce

53:25.120 --> 53:28.720
 some light, and that galaxy is going to be moving away from us, the light's going to

53:28.720 --> 53:32.200
 be getting more and more red shifted as it's called, that's going to be moving farther

53:32.200 --> 53:36.360
 and farther away from us as time goes on, there'll be some acceleration as we get into

53:36.360 --> 53:38.840
 the era of dark energy.

53:38.840 --> 53:44.160
 The light signals, there'll be some cone of acceptance, if you will, from which represents

53:44.160 --> 53:47.760
 all the events that we could have received information from.

53:47.760 --> 53:51.560
 We can't currently communicate with that galaxy.

53:51.560 --> 53:54.520
 It sent us some light, and now it's moving away, and it's sent us some light.

53:54.520 --> 53:58.280
 And because the space is also dragging the photons with it, if you like, the photons

53:58.280 --> 54:02.680
 are being participating in the expansion of the universe, that's why they're red shifting,

54:02.680 --> 54:07.920
 that we can see things out to where the universe first began expanding, not just when it began

54:07.920 --> 54:09.320
 existing.

54:09.320 --> 54:13.120
 And because the universe has been expanding for 13.8 billion years, with no sign of slowing

54:13.120 --> 54:19.600
 down yet, which is a huge surprise, but it's just a surprise, that we can see things approximately

54:19.600 --> 54:22.160
 three times the age of the universe away from us.

54:22.160 --> 54:26.280
 So we can see this called the age of the universe 15 billion years, just to make the math simple.

54:26.280 --> 54:32.120
 We see things at 45 billion light years distance in that direction, and we see things at 45

54:32.120 --> 54:36.880
 billion light years in that direction, just turning our telescopes 180 degrees away.

54:36.880 --> 54:42.160
 So that means we see things that themselves are 90 billion light years away from each

54:42.160 --> 54:43.160
 other.

54:43.160 --> 54:45.400
 That's sort of the diameter of the observable universe.

54:45.400 --> 54:47.160
 Is there another universe beyond that?

54:47.160 --> 54:48.160
 We don't know.

54:48.160 --> 54:51.360
 So I'm conjecture, there's not only one, there's an infinite number of them.

54:51.360 --> 54:56.040
 How are you emotionally okay with the fact that our universe is expanding?

54:56.040 --> 54:57.040
 So like...

54:57.040 --> 54:59.400
 It's gonna be like Annie Hall, like with Alvie Singer?

54:59.400 --> 55:02.640
 I'll grow up in the Soviet Union.

55:02.640 --> 55:03.640
 We watched propaganda.

55:03.640 --> 55:05.520
 I realized that you did, yes.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.080
 So there's a fake of Annie Hall.

55:07.080 --> 55:09.240
 Is that some kind of, what is this?

55:09.240 --> 55:15.040
 It's a comedy or propaganda movie with Woody Allen, certainly canceled, but nevertheless,

55:15.040 --> 55:20.360
 back when he was not canceled yet, he made a movie called Annie Hall, in which as a self

55:20.360 --> 55:24.720
 depiction, he's like a Larry David before Larry David was Larry David, neurotic, typical

55:24.720 --> 55:26.240
 neurotic young Jew.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.960
 He's in Brooklyn, and he all of a sudden tells his mother he's not doing his homework anymore.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.240
 He refuses to do his homework.

55:31.240 --> 55:36.440
 The mother says, why? because the universe is expanding, and it keeps on expanding.

55:36.440 --> 55:39.560
 Everything will rip apart, and no, we'll never have anything in contact, and everything

55:39.560 --> 55:40.560
 is meaningless.

55:40.560 --> 55:45.000
 I assume these are some of the topics we're gonna get to, and she goes, what are you talking

55:45.000 --> 55:46.000
 about?

55:46.000 --> 55:47.000
 We're in Brooklyn.

55:47.000 --> 55:49.200
 Brooklyn is not expanding.

55:49.200 --> 55:50.200
 And that's true.

55:50.200 --> 55:51.200
 Brooklyn is not expanding.

55:51.200 --> 55:52.200
 The solar system is not expanding.

55:52.200 --> 55:55.640
 Oftentimes, they get asked, what is the universe expanding into?

55:55.640 --> 55:57.480
 That's one of my favorite questions.

55:57.480 --> 55:59.160
 What is it expanding into?

55:59.160 --> 56:02.440
 And I say, it's actually an easy question if you think about it.

56:02.440 --> 56:06.120
 You've seen your friend, Elon, he goes out into space, he's got a rocket, right?

56:06.120 --> 56:07.840
 What's outside of the rocket?

56:07.840 --> 56:12.560
 If you take this bottle, empty out this bottle, take the cap off it, go outside the rocket,

56:12.560 --> 56:18.320
 you know, sip in some tang, screw on the cover of it, what's in there?

56:18.320 --> 56:19.320
 Is it empty?

56:19.320 --> 56:23.080
 That's just semantics, I guess.

56:23.080 --> 56:24.080
 Yeah.

56:24.080 --> 56:26.120
 No, it's definitely not empty.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.760
 So you step outside the rocket?

56:27.760 --> 56:30.640
 Yeah, you're in the vacuum of space, the quote, unquote, vacuum of space.

56:30.640 --> 56:31.880
 And there's no more liquid in it?

56:31.880 --> 56:32.880
 There's no more liquid in it.

56:32.880 --> 56:36.000
 No, it's just a container, one cubic centimeter, let's just make it simple.

56:36.000 --> 56:42.920
 One cubic centimeter of box, and you take it out into space outside of the Falcon, whatever.

56:42.920 --> 56:44.080
 What's inside that box?

56:44.080 --> 56:45.200
 It's not empty.

56:45.200 --> 56:48.560
 There's actually, I'm going to say, this is going to set your friends up.

56:48.560 --> 56:54.240
 There's 420 photons from the fusion of the light elements that we call the cosmic microwave

56:54.240 --> 56:56.720
 background inside that box at any second.

56:56.720 --> 57:02.960
 Okay, all right, hold on a second, what, 420, that's, I've heard of that number before.

57:02.960 --> 57:03.960
 All right, let's...

57:03.960 --> 57:06.240
 It used to be 69, but then they changed.

57:06.240 --> 57:08.880
 Wow, physics works in mysterious ways.

57:08.880 --> 57:11.640
 In the millimeter box, it's 69.

57:11.640 --> 57:12.960
 What are we talking about here?

57:12.960 --> 57:15.400
 What's in the box?

57:15.400 --> 57:18.160
 I'm going to get it, that's right.

57:18.160 --> 57:19.160
 Let's think outside the box.

57:19.160 --> 57:20.360
 No, we're thinking inside the box.

57:20.360 --> 57:25.280
 So if you have, every cubic centimeter of our observable universe is suffused with heat

57:25.280 --> 57:28.640
 left over from the big bang, dark matter particles.

57:28.640 --> 57:33.760
 There's a little ordinary matter in the universe, and every cubic centimeter, there's some probability

57:33.760 --> 57:37.760
 to find a proton, a cosmic ray, an electron, et cetera.

57:37.760 --> 57:41.720
 There's actually an awful lot of neutrinos inside of that cubic centimeter.

57:41.720 --> 57:43.800
 Just imagine how many cubic centimeters there are in the universe.

57:43.800 --> 57:44.800
 It's enormous.

57:44.800 --> 57:47.280
 That's why there's enormous numbers of particles in our universe.

57:47.280 --> 57:49.120
 It's a very rich universe.

57:49.120 --> 57:51.240
 But now let's zoom in on that box.

57:51.240 --> 57:56.320
 So now inside that box, there might be one, let's say there might be one ordinary matter,

57:56.320 --> 58:00.080
 like a proton or an electron, a baryon, a lepton.

58:00.080 --> 58:04.720
 There might be a couple hundred neutrinos, and there'll be a couple hundred photons,

58:04.720 --> 58:07.200
 as I said, 420.

58:07.200 --> 58:09.920
 What's between those guys?

58:09.920 --> 58:14.400
 What's between the protons and the neutrinos and the photons?

58:14.400 --> 58:17.320
 Just zoom into the cubic micron now.

58:17.320 --> 58:19.480
 Imagine 420 things inside a box this big.

58:19.480 --> 58:20.480
 It's actually pretty empty.

58:20.480 --> 58:22.520
 There's just zipping around in there, right?

58:22.520 --> 58:24.240
 So between them, there's a lot of empty space.

58:24.240 --> 58:30.360
 And this is outside the physics based models of fields and all those kinds of things, just

58:30.360 --> 58:33.560
 actually asking the question, what is this emptiness?

58:33.560 --> 58:38.920
 What's the particle content in the universe, in every cubic centimeter of the universe?

58:38.920 --> 58:39.920
 Outside of the 420.

58:39.920 --> 58:40.920
 So you have the 420.

58:40.920 --> 58:41.920
 420.

58:41.920 --> 58:42.920
 They have some mass.

58:42.920 --> 58:43.920
 Oh, they have energy.

58:43.920 --> 58:44.920
 They don't have mass.

58:44.920 --> 58:45.920
 Photons don't have mass.

58:45.920 --> 58:46.920
 Energy.

58:46.920 --> 58:48.920
 That's why they don't bring suitcases.

58:48.920 --> 58:50.440
 That's true, right?

58:50.440 --> 58:54.320
 Photons never bring suitcases with you, with them because they're traveling light.

58:54.320 --> 58:57.640
 I don't even get a laugh at you.

58:57.640 --> 58:58.640
 20 dad jokes.

58:58.640 --> 58:59.640
 Okay.

58:59.640 --> 59:00.640
 You'll appreciate something.

59:00.640 --> 59:01.640
 No, this is pretty good.

59:01.640 --> 59:03.160
 It's just, I'm laughing on the inside.

59:03.160 --> 59:04.160
 What's in the box?

59:04.160 --> 59:05.160
 What's the 420?

59:05.160 --> 59:07.600
 What's between the photons?

59:07.600 --> 59:08.600
 That's what space is.

59:08.600 --> 59:10.240
 That's what the universe is expanding into.

59:10.240 --> 59:11.240
 Okay.

59:11.240 --> 59:16.360
 That's the notebook on which the photons are written.

59:16.360 --> 59:17.360
 That's beautiful.

59:17.360 --> 59:26.480
 Still, thank you, still, I understand this, but it's still uncomfortable that if the universe

59:26.480 --> 59:30.240
 is expanding, that this thing is expanding.

59:30.240 --> 59:31.520
 The canvas is expanding.

59:31.520 --> 59:36.480
 It's very strange because if we're just sitting there still, I guess if we're in Brooklyn,

59:36.480 --> 59:37.840
 nothing's expanding.

59:37.840 --> 59:44.880
 So our cognition, our intuition about the world is based on this local fact that we

59:44.880 --> 59:49.080
 don't get to experience this kind of expansion.

59:49.080 --> 59:50.080
 Yeah.

59:50.080 --> 59:52.480
 And that intuition leads us astray.

59:52.480 --> 59:57.400
 But you know that gravity is the weakest of the so called four fundamental forces.

59:57.400 --> 1:00:00.360
 And yet it has the longest range pervasiveness.

1:00:00.360 --> 1:00:04.600
 Gravity is, we're being pulled towards the Andromeda galaxy at some enormous rate of

1:00:04.600 --> 1:00:09.720
 speed because of its massive counter gravitational force to the force we exert on it.

1:00:09.720 --> 1:00:14.040
 So gravity is enormously long range, but incredibly weak.

1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:21.120
 And because of that, we can think about these effects of expansion as the relationship between

1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:25.920
 the, as you said, the grid lines on the notebook, right?

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:32.080
 Gravity is a manifestation of the interrelationship between those points, how far they are from

1:00:32.080 --> 1:00:34.120
 each other, and those can change.

1:00:34.120 --> 1:00:39.200
 Those point distances can change over time because of the force of gravity.

1:00:39.200 --> 1:00:46.600
 So it's weak and what we experience is gravity is the changing of those trajectories from

1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:49.000
 being rectilinear to curvilinear.

1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.240
 That's what we experience is gravity.

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:55.880
 You had this analogy when you talked to Barry Barish about bowling ball and a trampoline.

1:00:55.880 --> 1:01:00.200
 That's almost right because it's actually, you have to visualize that now in four dimensions,

1:01:00.200 --> 1:01:04.480
 like wrapping a trampoline at every point around the object, including on the sides.

1:01:04.480 --> 1:01:06.280
 And it becomes very hard to visualize.

1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:08.160
 So a lot of people use that.

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:12.240
 It's also a fraught analogy because you're using gravity, like the notion of gravity

1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:15.200
 pulling something down to explain the notion of gravity.

1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:18.440
 So it's a little overburdening the analogy.

1:01:18.440 --> 1:01:19.440
 But okay.

1:01:19.440 --> 1:01:22.680
 So you mentioned Barry Barish wrote the forward to your book.

1:01:22.680 --> 1:01:25.040
 How do gravitational waves fit into all of this?

1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:29.480
 How do they, on the emotional level, how do they make you feel that they're just moving

1:01:29.480 --> 1:01:30.480
 space time?

1:01:30.480 --> 1:01:31.480
 Yeah.

1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:35.920
 So gravitational waves were the Nobel Prize for gravitational waves discovery the first

1:01:35.920 --> 1:01:36.920
 time.

1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:44.000
 It was discovered twice indirectly by two men named Halson Taylor.

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:46.000
 And that was given my first year of graduate school.

1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:49.800
 The day I entered graduate school almost, they announced these two guys won it.

1:01:49.800 --> 1:01:52.960
 And the guy who won it did the work that would later win him the Nobel Prize when he was

1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:53.960
 my age.

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:55.160
 Is this in the 40s?

1:01:55.160 --> 1:01:56.160
 This was, no.

1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:57.160
 That was a joke.

1:01:57.160 --> 1:01:58.160
 Yeah.

1:01:58.160 --> 1:01:59.160
 That was good.

1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:00.160
 Thank you.

1:02:00.160 --> 1:02:01.160
 I got it.

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:02.160
 I got it.

1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:03.160
 You know, to a cosmologist age, it means nothing.

1:02:03.160 --> 1:02:04.160
 And to a tennis player.

1:02:04.160 --> 1:02:05.160
 Not on Tinder.

1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:06.160
 That's right.

1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:07.160
 Right.

1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:08.160
 Sorry.

1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:13.720
 Gravitational waves do fit in because what we're trying to do now is use the properties

1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:18.760
 of gravitational waves, the analogous properties that they have to photons, that they travel

1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:22.760
 at the speed of light, that they go through everything, they can go through everything,

1:02:22.760 --> 1:02:30.160
 and that they're directly detectable, we're using them to try to confirm if or if not

1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:32.080
 inflation occurred.

1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:36.640
 So did inflation, the spark that ignited the fusion of the elements in the early part of

1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:40.720
 the universe and the expansion, the initial expansion of the universe, did that take place?

1:02:40.720 --> 1:02:45.980
 There's only one way that cosmologists believe we could ever see that through the imprint

1:02:45.980 --> 1:02:51.440
 of these primordial gravitational waves, not these old newcomers that Barry studies,

1:02:51.440 --> 1:02:56.880
 the ones that occurred a billion light years away from us a billion years ago, but we're

1:02:56.880 --> 1:03:02.240
 seeing things that happened 13.82 billion years ago during the inflationary epoch.

1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:08.000
 However, those we cannot build a LIGO and put it at the Big Bang.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.760
 So if you want to measure, let's say you have the old time firecracker, let's say there's

1:03:12.760 --> 1:03:16.920
 a firecracker, and you want to see if it went off in the building next door to you.

1:03:16.920 --> 1:03:21.360
 You can't see it, so you can't see the imprint of it, but you can hear it.

1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:25.960
 And what we're trying to do is hear the effect of gravitational waves from the Big Bang,

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:32.160
 not by using a camera or even an interferometer like Barry used and his colleagues, but instead

1:03:32.160 --> 1:03:38.520
 using the CMB, the light, the primordial ancient fossils of the universe, the oldest light

1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:39.680
 in the universe.

1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:46.160
 We're going to use that as a film, quote unquote, onto which gravitational waves get exposed.

1:03:46.160 --> 1:03:51.960
 And hope you can know, so what are the challenges there to get enough accuracy for the exposure?

1:03:51.960 --> 1:03:57.040
 So the signal, as I said, so there's 420 of these photons per cubic centimeter, and there's

1:03:57.040 --> 1:03:59.400
 a lot of cubic centimeters in the universe.

1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:04.920
 However, what we're looking for is not the brightness of the photon, how intense it is.

1:04:04.920 --> 1:04:07.560
 We're not looking for its color, what wavelength it is.

1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:09.680
 We're looking for what its polarization is.

1:04:09.680 --> 1:04:10.680
 And we'll go there.

1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:15.680
 Let me just ask, are you serious about the per cubic millimeter or 420 is the number?

1:04:15.680 --> 1:04:16.680
 Centimeter.

1:04:16.680 --> 1:04:20.200
 But a cubic centimeter, 420 is the number.

1:04:20.200 --> 1:04:21.200
 That's the number.

1:04:21.200 --> 1:04:22.200
 That's Moses.

1:04:22.200 --> 1:04:24.200
 And if he doesn't, he will truly enjoy this.

1:04:24.200 --> 1:04:25.200
 Okay.

1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:27.200
 Yeah, that's true.

1:04:27.200 --> 1:04:28.200
 Oh, okay.

1:04:28.200 --> 1:04:29.200
 Funding security.

1:04:29.200 --> 1:04:30.200
 Excellent.

1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:37.120
 So, I mean, this takes us to this story of heartbreak, of triumph, of that you described

1:04:37.120 --> 1:04:38.440
 and losing the Nobel Prize.

1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:42.000
 So describe what polarization is that you mentioned.

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000
 Yeah.

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:49.480
 Can you describe what Bicep 1 and Bicep 2 are, Bicep 3, perhaps the instruments that

1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:54.520
 can detect this kind of polarization, what are the challenges, the origin story, the

1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:55.520
 whole thing.

1:04:55.520 --> 1:04:56.520
 Yeah.

1:04:56.520 --> 1:04:59.440
 So, well, the origin story goes back again to like a father son rivalry.

1:04:59.440 --> 1:05:00.440
 It really does.

1:05:00.440 --> 1:05:04.320
 My father won all these prizes, awards, et cetera, but he never won a Nobel Prize.

1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:08.400
 And you know, some parents in America, they compete with their kids, you know, oh, I was

1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:11.800
 a football player in high school, I'll show you and whatever, wrestling, whatever.

1:05:11.800 --> 1:05:14.120
 And some of us could be healthy too.

1:05:14.120 --> 1:05:20.160
 But with me and my dad, it wasn't super healthy, like we would compete and, you know, he was

1:05:20.160 --> 1:05:23.120
 much more of a pure mathematician and I was an experimental physicist.

1:05:23.120 --> 1:05:27.960
 So we had both different ideas in what was worth prioritizing our time.

1:05:27.960 --> 1:05:30.300
 But I knew for sure he didn't win the Nobel Prize.

1:05:30.300 --> 1:05:32.320
 And I knew I could kind of outdo him.

1:05:32.320 --> 1:05:37.360
 So I feel pretty venal and kind of, you know, a minuscule kind of character why I say that.

1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:41.840
 The only reason you could outdo him is because the field's muddle is given every four years.

1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:43.840
 And only if you're under 40, which he was.

1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:47.760
 So he's working under much more limited conditions.

1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:48.760
 That's right.

1:05:48.760 --> 1:05:52.120
 So even if I had, which, you know, spoiler alert, the book's called Losing the Nobel Prize,

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:53.620
 so I didn't do it.

1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:58.840
 But I wanted to do something big and I wanted to do something that would really just unequivocally

1:05:58.840 --> 1:06:01.800
 be realized as a discovery for the ages.

1:06:01.800 --> 1:06:05.560
 As in fact, it was when we made the premature announcement that we had been successful.

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:09.880
 So you were from the beginning reaching for the big questions.

1:06:09.880 --> 1:06:10.920
 That's all I can say.

1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:14.480
 So as an experimenter, you were swinging for the fences.

1:06:14.480 --> 1:06:15.600
 That's all I wanted to do.

1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:21.640
 I felt like if it's not, you know, if it's worth spending, you know, perhaps the rest

1:06:21.640 --> 1:06:26.640
 of my life on as a scientist, it better be damn well, better be interesting to me to

1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:30.800
 carry me through to give me the, you know, the, you know, I always say, passion is great

1:06:30.800 --> 1:06:33.960
 when people say, oh, follow your passion, but it's not enough.

1:06:33.960 --> 1:06:37.040
 Passion's like the spark that ignites the rocket, but that's not enough to get the

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:38.520
 rocket into space.

1:06:38.520 --> 1:06:41.880
 So then you swung for the fences with bicep one.

1:06:41.880 --> 1:06:42.880
 What is this?

1:06:42.880 --> 1:06:46.480
 So bicep one was born out of a kind of interesting circumstances.

1:06:46.480 --> 1:06:49.880
 So I had gone to a Stanford university for postdocs.

1:06:49.880 --> 1:06:56.760
 So in academic hunger games, Stanford University, yeah, it's a small little school.

1:06:56.760 --> 1:07:00.760
 It's not like that technical college in Massachusetts that you're affiliated with.

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:05.800
 But as I went there, I was working for a new assistant professor.

1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:10.280
 She had gotten there only a year before I got there, and she had her own priorities

1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:12.120
 that things that she wanted to do.

1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:16.080
 But I kept thinking in my spare time that I wanted to do something completely different.

1:07:16.080 --> 1:07:19.680
 She was studying galaxies at high redshift, and I wanted to study the origin of the universe

1:07:19.680 --> 1:07:22.480
 using this type of technology.

1:07:22.480 --> 1:07:27.120
 And I realized the courtesy of a good friend of mine who's now at Johns Hopkins, Mark

1:07:27.120 --> 1:07:30.540
 Hemminkowski, that we didn't need this enormous Hubble telescope.

1:07:30.540 --> 1:07:32.960
 We didn't need a 30 meter diameter telescope.

1:07:32.960 --> 1:07:35.280
 We needed a tiny refracting telescope.

1:07:35.280 --> 1:07:38.560
 You know, bigger than my head, you know, less than a foot across.

1:07:38.560 --> 1:07:42.280
 And that telescope would have the same power as a Hubble telescope, you know, size telescope

1:07:42.280 --> 1:07:46.160
 could have, because the signals that we're looking for are enormous in wavelength on

1:07:46.160 --> 1:07:47.160
 the sky.

1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:50.600
 They're enormously long, large area signals on the sky.

1:07:50.600 --> 1:07:54.920
 And if we could measure that, it would be proof effectively as close as you get to proof

1:07:54.920 --> 1:07:59.320
 there could be things that mimic it, but that we discovered the inflationary epoch.

1:07:59.320 --> 1:08:04.160
 Inflation being the signal originally conceived by Alan Goothe to explain why the universe

1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:09.120
 had the large scale features that it does, namely that it has so called flat geometry.

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:14.600
 So there's no, there's no way to make a triangle in space in our universe that has three interior

1:08:14.600 --> 1:08:18.280
 angles that do not sum to 180 degrees.

1:08:18.280 --> 1:08:21.440
 You can do that with spacecraft, you can do that with stars, you can do that with laser

1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:23.720
 beams, you can do that with three different galaxies.

1:08:23.720 --> 1:08:27.960
 All those galaxies, no matter how far you go, have this geometry, it's remarkable.

1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:33.040
 But it's also unstable, it's very unlikely, it's very seemingly finely tuned.

1:08:33.040 --> 1:08:37.760
 And that was one of the motivations that Goothe had to kind of conceive of this new idea called

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:42.680
 inflation in 1979 when he was a postdoc also at Stanford, Slack.

1:08:42.680 --> 1:08:46.840
 And he was trying to get a permanent job, I was trying to like make my name for myself.

1:08:46.840 --> 1:08:51.240
 And so I realized I could do this, but I was also being paid by this, this professor at

1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:53.320
 Stanford to do a job for her.

1:08:53.320 --> 1:08:56.960
 And I was kind of a crappy employee, to be honest with you.

1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:00.080
 And then one day she couldn't take it anymore because I was like sketching notebooks and

1:09:00.080 --> 1:09:04.160
 planning his experiments and I just, I wasn't, no, I actually had big ideas in your mind.

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:06.200
 You're planning big experiments.

1:09:06.200 --> 1:09:12.320
 And that was difficult to work with on a small scale for like a postdoc type of situation.

1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:18.000
 We have to publish basic papers, deliver on some basic deadlines for a project, all those

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:19.000
 kinds of things.

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.320
 And support your advisor is paying, she's paying me.

1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:27.560
 And so one day I came in and actually involved another friend of mine, an astronomer named

1:09:27.560 --> 1:09:33.560
 Jill Tarder, one of the pioneers in the SETI science business of detecting extraterrestrials,

1:09:33.560 --> 1:09:38.040
 which I assume you'd never like to talk about aliens, so I'm sure we won't get into aliens.

1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:41.240
 But Jill was visiting Stanford and I was like, I really want to meet her, can you introduce

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:42.240
 me?

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:45.320
 And she said, no, in fact, you're fired, my boss.

1:09:45.320 --> 1:09:50.000
 So I was like, this is possibly the best thing that could ever happen to me.

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:54.080
 I didn't know where it would lead or what happened to it, but getting fired from this

1:09:54.080 --> 1:09:58.760
 ultra prestigious university turned out to be the path, I mean, literally that brings

1:09:58.760 --> 1:10:05.840
 me here today, in that because of that, I ended up working for another person in Caltech,

1:10:05.840 --> 1:10:08.880
 which is in Pasadena.

1:10:08.880 --> 1:10:12.800
 And she, my original boss at our church, she got me the job with her former advisor,

1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:15.080
 a man by the name of Andrew Lang.

1:10:15.080 --> 1:10:22.080
 And Andrew was like, he was like this, I don't know, like, he's like Steve Jobs or Elon,

1:10:22.080 --> 1:10:27.240
 you know, charismatic, handsome, persuasive, ideal man.

1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:32.960
 Not the guy always in the lab doing everything, but understood where things are going decades

1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:33.960
 from now.

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:38.000
 And he had been involved in an experiment that actually measured the universe was flat,

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:42.360
 very close to flat, along with a preceding experiment done at Princeton by Lyman Page

1:10:42.360 --> 1:10:43.360
 and other collaborators.

1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:45.280
 So the shape of the universe is flat.

1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:47.880
 The geometry of the universe is flat.

1:10:47.880 --> 1:10:49.440
 How did he do that experiment?

1:10:49.440 --> 1:10:52.080
 So he used the cosmic microwave background.

1:10:52.080 --> 1:10:55.920
 And so what I said is you have to look for triangles in the universe, so you can measure

1:10:55.920 --> 1:11:00.000
 triangles on Earth, you can actually, it's hard to show that the Earth is curved, but

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.600
 you can show the Earth is curved using triangles, mountaintops, et cetera, if you have an accurate

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:04.600
 enough protractor.

1:11:04.600 --> 1:11:05.600
 Allegedly.

1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:06.600
 Yeah.

1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:07.600
 Yeah.

1:11:07.600 --> 1:11:09.800
 God, you're like auto canceling.

1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:10.800
 This is great.

1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:11.800
 I asked hard questions.

1:11:11.800 --> 1:11:12.800
 My ratings are going to go up, man.

1:11:12.800 --> 1:11:13.800
 This is going to be great.

1:11:13.800 --> 1:11:14.800
 Take out the figures.

1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:16.800
 If you want actual science, go listen to Brian.

1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:22.400
 If you want all of these conspiracy theories, or a.k.a. the truth about flat Earth, listen

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:23.880
 to him.

1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:27.520
 So what he used was the following triangle.

1:11:27.520 --> 1:11:32.360
 There are proto galaxy sized objects in the CMB.

1:11:32.360 --> 1:11:34.840
 The cosmic microwave background has these patches.

1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:41.120
 And so you can make a triangle out of the diameter of one of these blobs of primordial

1:11:41.120 --> 1:11:44.680
 plasma, the soup that constitutes the early universe, which is hydrogen.

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:45.880
 It's very simple material.

1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:48.480
 I understand hydrogen, electrons and radiation.

1:11:48.480 --> 1:11:49.480
 Very simple.

1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:51.800
 Plasma physicist's son, understand it.

1:11:51.800 --> 1:11:54.800
 The diameter is one base of the triangle.

1:11:54.800 --> 1:11:57.440
 And then the distance to the Earth is the other two legs.

1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:01.680
 So he measured along with his colleagues at Caltech and then University of Rome and that's

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:08.800
 other group at Princeton, measured the angle, interior angle effectively, very, very accurately,

1:12:08.800 --> 1:12:11.440
 and showed that it added up to 180 degrees.

1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:15.280
 Can you localize accurately the patches in the CMB?

1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:19.080
 Can you know where they could trace them back location wise?

1:12:19.080 --> 1:12:22.640
 You can know where they are, but more than that, there's so many of these patches.

1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:25.720
 They're about one square degree on the sky.

1:12:25.720 --> 1:12:30.640
 The sky, you may know, a sphere has about 44,000 square degrees in a sphere.

1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:35.600
 So there's literally 44,000 of these sized patches over which he could do these kind

1:12:35.600 --> 1:12:37.840
 of measurements to build up very good statistics.

1:12:37.840 --> 1:12:41.640
 That's not exactly how they do it or how they did it in this experiment called boomerang,

1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:46.920
 but they did measure very accurately what was called the first Doppler peak or acoustic

1:12:46.920 --> 1:12:49.800
 peak in the plasma, the primordial plasma.

1:12:49.800 --> 1:12:58.040
 So the sphere has 44, approximately 44,000 square degrees to cover a sphere.

1:12:58.040 --> 1:13:01.920
 That's a very kind of important data collection thing when you're sitting on a sphere and

1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:04.840
 you're looking out into the observable universe.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:08.640
 So there's a lot of patches to work with.

1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:13.760
 And in fact, a lot of the fast kind of algorithmic decomposition of spheres and machine learning

1:13:13.760 --> 1:13:18.680
 in the early 2000s still used today was created out of this field by data analysts using this

1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:24.720
 thing called hierarchical, equal area triangles called heel picks is what it's called.

1:13:24.720 --> 1:13:29.720
 And just stitch all this stuff together and stitch it together very accurately.

1:13:29.720 --> 1:13:30.720
 Yeah.

1:13:30.720 --> 1:13:35.120
 Get high statistical significance in order to reduce the statistical errors.

1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:39.400
 Very clean signal and measurement device to reduce the systematic errors.

1:13:39.400 --> 1:13:42.960
 Those are the two predominant sources of error in any measurement.

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:45.440
 Those that can be improved by more and more measurement, you know, you take more and more

1:13:45.440 --> 1:13:49.200
 measurements of this table, you'll get slightly better each time, but you only win as the

1:13:49.200 --> 1:13:53.400
 number of, the one over the square root of the number of measurements.

1:13:53.400 --> 1:13:55.660
 But the square root of 44,000 is pretty big.

1:13:55.660 --> 1:13:57.520
 So they were able to get a very accurate measurement.

1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.000
 Again, it's not exactly how they did it.

1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:03.400
 They also have to do a Fourier analysis, decompose that to a power spectrum, filtration,

1:14:03.400 --> 1:14:04.400
 windows.

1:14:04.400 --> 1:14:07.080
 There's a lot of work that goes into it, image analysis.

1:14:07.080 --> 1:14:11.640
 And then comparing that with cosmological parameters, very simple model, just six different

1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:14.360
 numbers that go into a model that made a prediction.

1:14:14.360 --> 1:14:16.920
 And one of those is the geometry of the universe pops out.

1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:21.080
 And that is the universe has zero spatial curvature and that was called boomerang.

1:14:21.080 --> 1:14:22.640
 So he had just come off of this.

1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:26.320
 Now let me remind you, who is the first person, you know, to measure the curvature of the

1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:27.320
 earth?

1:14:27.320 --> 1:14:32.120
 It's a guy named Aristophanes in that, you know, whatever lived around Aristotle's time.

1:14:32.120 --> 1:14:33.120
 His name is in the history books.

1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:37.960
 So this guy, Andrew Lang, I was like, he's like the next Aristotle, Aristophanes, like

1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:41.560
 I just wanted to work for this guy, you know, he was clearly had this brand.

1:14:41.560 --> 1:14:45.720
 He was about 40 at the time, California scientist of the year.

1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:48.080
 I was sure he was going to win an Nobel Prize for that.

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:53.440
 And I knew that he, you know, so I went down to Caltech to give my job talk.

1:14:53.440 --> 1:14:56.280
 And he said, you know, I love it, you got a job.

1:14:56.280 --> 1:14:59.040
 And before I could even, you know, before he finished the sentence, I said, I'll take

1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:02.000
 it, you know, like it was too good to be true.

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:06.080
 And I started working there at Caltech and slowly but surely, because Caltech's a rich

1:15:06.080 --> 1:15:11.520
 private university, at that time run by a Nobel Prize winner by the name of David Baltimore.

1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:15.600
 He just wrote us a check, Baltimore wrote us a check and said, get started on this idea.

1:15:15.600 --> 1:15:19.720
 And so we started coming with the idea for what I later named bicep by the background

1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:24.520
 imaging cosmic extragalactic polarization, which is kind of ironic because we ended up

1:15:24.520 --> 1:15:28.000
 measuring galactic polarization, we'll get to that in a minute.

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.760
 But along the way, the idea was very simple, we're going to make the simplest telescope

1:15:31.760 --> 1:15:35.200
 you can possibly make, which is a refracting telescope.

1:15:35.200 --> 1:15:38.680
 Your eyes, you have two refracting telescopes in your head.

1:15:38.680 --> 1:15:41.840
 Only way, you know, forward is making things more complex, right?

1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:45.880
 And when you make things complex in science, you introduce the possibility for systematic

1:15:45.880 --> 1:15:46.880
 errors.

1:15:46.880 --> 1:15:49.760
 And so we want to build the cleanest instrument, turns out a cleanest instrument you can build

1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:52.160
 in astronomy is a refracting telescope.

1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:58.600
 We also had to unlike that telescope or Galileo's, we had to use very sensitive detectors that

1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:04.480
 were cooled less than one twentieth of the temperature of the cosmic background itself,

1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:07.160
 which is the coolest temperature in the whole universe.

1:16:07.160 --> 1:16:12.360
 So we had to cool these down to about 0.1 or 0.2 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero.

1:16:12.360 --> 1:16:16.520
 To do that, we need to put it inside of a huge vacuum chamber and suck out all the air molecules

1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:22.600
 and water molecules and take it to a very, very special place called the South Pole Antarctica,

1:16:22.600 --> 1:16:24.880
 from which I retrieved for you a patch.

1:16:24.880 --> 1:16:26.960
 There it is over there.

1:16:26.960 --> 1:16:29.840
 So when you go there, you get these bright red jackets.

1:16:29.840 --> 1:16:30.840
 Bright.

1:16:30.840 --> 1:16:31.840
 Oh, yeah.

1:16:31.840 --> 1:16:32.840
 You fly down.

1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:36.680
 As somebody who was born in the Soviet Union, we obviously like to call it red, United States

1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:41.680
 Antarctic Program, the National Science Foundation.

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:45.560
 And the base is called the Amundsen Scott South Polar Station.

1:16:45.560 --> 1:16:50.720
 So it's a little known fact of geopolitics that whatever country occupies a region has

1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:52.000
 ownership over it.

1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:53.440
 Now there is a treaty in Antarctica.

1:16:53.440 --> 1:16:57.400
 You can't use it for military purposes, for mining, et cetera, et cetera.

1:16:57.400 --> 1:17:00.960
 But I don't know if you know, but about 12 years ago, Putin sent a submarine to the North

1:17:00.960 --> 1:17:01.960
 Pole.

1:17:01.960 --> 1:17:04.360
 There's no land at the North Pole, right?

1:17:04.360 --> 1:17:05.360
 So what did he do?

1:17:05.360 --> 1:17:07.960
 He stuck it on the ocean underneath.

1:17:07.960 --> 1:17:11.920
 But the South Pole is on a continent called Antarctica, which was first reached about

1:17:11.920 --> 1:17:15.520
 110 years ago, first time in human history.

1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:18.240
 Antarctica means the opposite of the bear.

1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:21.960
 That means like no bears there, basically opposite of where polar bears are.

1:17:21.960 --> 1:17:24.680
 Like it means polar bear, that's where, in Greek.

1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:25.680
 Oh, did not know that.

1:17:25.680 --> 1:17:26.680
 Fascinating.

1:17:26.680 --> 1:17:27.800
 So Antarctic means the opposite place of that.

1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:31.200
 So humans never even saw it, let alone went to the South Pole, which is kind of in the

1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:33.640
 middle of that continent.

1:17:33.640 --> 1:17:37.360
 We went to take this telescope somewhere extremely dry.

1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:43.040
 It turns out the Sahara Desert, San Diego, Texan, there's no place like the South Pole

1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:44.040
 or Chile.

1:17:44.040 --> 1:17:46.040
 Those are the two premier places on Earth.

1:17:46.040 --> 1:17:47.760
 Of course, you'd like to go into space.

1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:48.760
 There's no water in space.

1:17:48.760 --> 1:17:52.360
 It's not about cold, it's about dry.

1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:53.360
 Exactly.

1:17:53.360 --> 1:17:58.960
 So that's why, for example, you can take this awadka and you could put it in this cup,

1:17:58.960 --> 1:17:59.960
 right?

1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:03.240
 And we could take it over to a microwave somewhere and heat it up.

1:18:03.240 --> 1:18:05.960
 After two minutes, the water's, three minutes, the water's boiling.

1:18:05.960 --> 1:18:06.960
 You can't touch it.

1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:08.080
 Take it for me, don't touch it.

1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:10.360
 But you can touch the mug and take it out if you want to, right?

1:18:10.360 --> 1:18:11.360
 Why?

1:18:11.360 --> 1:18:13.120
 Because the mug is totally bone dry.

1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:16.800
 But the microwaves get absorbed by the water molecules because water molecules resonate

1:18:16.800 --> 1:18:19.080
 exactly at these microwave frequencies.

1:18:19.080 --> 1:18:24.720
 So we don't want these precious photons, 420 of them, traveling per cubic centimeter,

1:18:24.720 --> 1:18:29.080
 from the Big Bang itself to get absorbed in some water molecule in the Earth's atmosphere.

1:18:29.080 --> 1:18:32.920
 So you take it to a place with the fewest number of water molecules per square centimeter

1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:34.520
 of surface area.

1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:38.680
 And that happens to be either Chile or my other project, the Simons Observatory is located,

1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:40.720
 or you take it to the South Pole.

1:18:40.720 --> 1:18:46.280
 We took it to the South Pole and spent a couple of months of my life down there.

1:18:46.280 --> 1:18:52.760
 And it's like being on Hoth, you know, it's like, it's a completely otherworldly environment,

1:18:52.760 --> 1:18:59.400
 ice, planar, flat as a pancake, you like, and the buildings are built up on stilts.

1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:03.440
 They're built up on, because the snow will otherwise cover them over.

1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:06.880
 The nearest medical facilities are 4,000 miles away.

1:19:06.880 --> 1:19:11.440
 If you have any issues with your wisdom teeth, they yank them before you go down there.

1:19:11.440 --> 1:19:14.440
 If you have any issues with your appendix, they'll cut it out of you before you go down

1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:15.440
 there.

1:19:15.440 --> 1:19:18.960
 The Vostok base, not too far away, about 600 miles away.

1:19:18.960 --> 1:19:23.200
 The doctors there, there's a famous picture of one of them operating on himself, taking

1:19:23.200 --> 1:19:26.280
 out his own appendix in the middle of winter by himself.

1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:29.920
 It's a harsh condition, science in the harshest of conditions.

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:31.440
 On Earth at least.

1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:35.240
 And we go to those great lengths because it's a pristine environment to observe these precious

1:19:35.240 --> 1:19:36.840
 photons.

1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:40.880
 And we built this telescope and it weighs, you know, tens of thousands of pounds.

1:19:40.880 --> 1:19:44.600
 And it had to scan the sky almost like it's a robot.

1:19:44.600 --> 1:19:47.200
 I mean, it's scanning the sky almost unattended.

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:51.520
 It needed, we have a guy who spends a year of his life down there, a girl who spends

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:53.080
 a year of their life down there.

1:19:53.080 --> 1:19:54.400
 They're called winter overs.

1:19:54.400 --> 1:19:59.440
 They arrive in sometimes as early as November and they don't leave until the following December.

1:19:59.440 --> 1:20:02.760
 And we always joke, we'll pay you $75,000.

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:04.840
 You just have to work for one night of your life.

1:20:04.840 --> 1:20:05.840
 That's all.

1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:08.040
 But it's a long night.

1:20:08.040 --> 1:20:12.960
 And what bicep is, and I couldn't bring my polarized sunglasses here, so I brought these

1:20:12.960 --> 1:20:14.600
 actual polarizers here.

1:20:14.600 --> 1:20:19.920
 So if you take this and put it in front of your telescope there, you have now made a

1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:21.280
 polarimeter.

1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:24.200
 You have made a polarization sensitive telescope.

1:20:24.200 --> 1:20:28.440
 Now you may not be able to immediately know how you would use such a thing, but one way

1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:33.960
 to think about it, now take this guy and look at a light, look at a light source, put one

1:20:33.960 --> 1:20:40.000
 up to your eye and now put the other one in front of it anywhere and now rotate them.

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.560
 What happens to the light source?

1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:45.480
 It becomes brighter and dimmer and brighter and dimmer.

1:20:45.480 --> 1:20:46.480
 Yeah.

1:20:46.480 --> 1:20:48.280
 So it's called a quadripolar pattern, right?

1:20:48.280 --> 1:20:49.280
 So it's repeating.

1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:51.880
 It goes bright, dim, bright, dim.

1:20:51.880 --> 1:20:57.240
 It rotates twice in intensity for every single physical rotation.

1:20:57.240 --> 1:20:58.720
 And that's because of the property of the photon.

1:20:58.720 --> 1:21:05.680
 The photon is a spin one field, but the polarization of light is the axis at which its electric

1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:07.400
 field is oscillating.

1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:10.200
 Its electric field is marching straight up and straight down.

1:21:10.200 --> 1:21:15.080
 And so therefore vertical polarization is the same as negative vertical polarization.

1:21:15.080 --> 1:21:18.960
 And so you get the same pattern as you rotate two times for every one physical rotation.

1:21:18.960 --> 1:21:22.880
 It's just like a spin, a spin two object.

1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:27.600
 So now if you put that in front of the telescope, you can do one of two things.

1:21:27.600 --> 1:21:31.600
 Now you're polarizing all the light that's going in because you have one of the polarizers

1:21:31.600 --> 1:21:34.120
 and then you can analyze it as you rotate the other one.

1:21:34.120 --> 1:21:37.160
 You can analyze it and change the amount of polarization.

1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:40.120
 Or you can put this kind of very special crystal in here.

1:21:40.120 --> 1:21:41.120
 There's a crystal.

1:21:41.120 --> 1:21:42.280
 It's called calcite.

1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:45.040
 This is from Lex Luthor, not Lex Friedman.

1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:49.160
 This crystal, put it on top of your printed notes there and tell me what does it look

1:21:49.160 --> 1:21:50.160
 like?

1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:56.440
 There's, like I could see everything twice.

1:21:56.440 --> 1:21:58.560
 It's a double image.

1:21:58.560 --> 1:22:02.720
 That is a special crystal that has two different indices of refraction.

1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:08.120
 So light emerging, which is unpolarized from the black ink, comes out and it splits into

1:22:08.120 --> 1:22:12.480
 two different directions and it could split even more if I made the crystal, give you

1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:14.480
 my more expensive crystal, but that's all I have.

1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:16.240
 What is the crystal with this kind of property called?

1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:17.480
 It's called calcite.

1:22:17.480 --> 1:22:18.480
 This is crystal.

1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:20.120
 It's called birefringent crystal.

1:22:20.120 --> 1:22:23.520
 By means to, refrigerant means refracting.

1:22:23.520 --> 1:22:28.560
 So this is a special type of material that separates light based on its polarization.

1:22:28.560 --> 1:22:32.200
 Pretty clean by signal.

1:22:32.200 --> 1:22:36.800
 It's cleanly too, I'm seeing too very cleanly.

1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:37.800
 It's very crisp.

1:22:37.800 --> 1:22:40.080
 That's yours to keep with every time you host me.

1:22:40.080 --> 1:22:47.040
 Now take the polarizer underneath your left hand, put it on top of the crystal and kind

1:22:47.040 --> 1:22:48.120
 of move it back and forth.

1:22:48.120 --> 1:22:49.120
 Wow.

1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:50.800
 This is incredible.

1:22:50.800 --> 1:22:55.840
 You can switch as you rotate, you switch from one signal to the other.

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:58.360
 So it's one of the refractions to the other.

1:22:58.360 --> 1:22:59.360
 Whoa.

1:22:59.360 --> 1:23:03.040
 So that is now you are analyzing the polarization.

1:23:03.040 --> 1:23:07.440
 You're confirming the light comes out of the crystal, two different types of polarization.

1:23:07.440 --> 1:23:12.880
 And effectively what we do is we have those two things, if you like, but working in the

1:23:12.880 --> 1:23:17.240
 microwave, so our detector, that's where the cosmic photons are brightest in the microwave

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:20.080
 regime in the electromagnetic spectrum.

1:23:20.080 --> 1:23:23.440
 And we're coupling that to refracting telescope, but your eyes are refracting telescopes.

1:23:23.440 --> 1:23:25.560
 So you are a polarimeter right now.

1:23:25.560 --> 1:23:30.600
 The human eye can actually slightly detect polarization, but otherwise it mainly detects

1:23:30.600 --> 1:23:32.560
 its intensity of light and the color.

1:23:32.560 --> 1:23:35.040
 That's what we call color and intensity, brightness.

1:23:35.040 --> 1:23:39.480
 So you're devising an instrument that's very precise in measuring that polarization.

1:23:39.480 --> 1:23:40.480
 Exactly.

1:23:40.480 --> 1:23:45.120
 And doing so in the microwave region with detectors not made of biological human eyes,

1:23:45.120 --> 1:23:50.280
 retina cells, but of superconductors and things called bulometers.

1:23:50.280 --> 1:23:54.040
 And this has to be done at temperatures close to absolute zero.

1:23:54.040 --> 1:23:58.700
 Under vacuum conditions, one billionth of the pressure we feel here at sea level.

1:23:58.700 --> 1:24:03.240
 So why is it that this kind of device could win a Nobel Prize?

1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:07.400
 So when the CMB was discovered, it was discovered serendipitously.

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:13.040
 There were two radio astronomers working at the time at Bell Laboratories.

1:24:13.040 --> 1:24:16.160
 Now why would Bell Laboratories be employing radio astronomers?

1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:21.520
 Bell Laboratories was kind of like Apple or, you know, it was like a think tank or, you

1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:22.520
 know, it was Google.

1:24:22.520 --> 1:24:23.520
 Let's say it was like Google.

1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:26.880
 Google has like Google X, it has this thing and that thing, right?

1:24:26.880 --> 1:24:31.400
 So they were working there, but imagine if Google was employing radio astronomers.

1:24:31.400 --> 1:24:33.000
 Like they were actively recruiting.

1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:34.000
 Why would they do that?

1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:39.120
 Well, it turns out that was the beginning in the 1960s, was the first commercial satellite

1:24:39.120 --> 1:24:41.120
 launch for communication.

1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:45.440
 And so Bell Labs, which would later become the telephone, you know, part of AT&T in

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:50.840
 the early telephone company, later invent the first cell phone the year I was born.

1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:56.360
 And they would take that 1946 and they would take that telescope technology that radio

1:24:56.360 --> 1:25:01.640
 astronomers had developed and they would use that to see if they could improve the signal

1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:03.360
 to noise of the satellites that they were seeing.

1:25:03.360 --> 1:25:05.080
 And they found they couldn't.

1:25:05.080 --> 1:25:09.520
 They found that they could not improve the signal to noise ratio of the first telecommunication

1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:10.520
 satellite.

1:25:10.520 --> 1:25:13.800
 It was like the equivalent to one kilobit per second, Malcolm, and they were bouncing

1:25:13.800 --> 1:25:18.600
 signals from, you know, from the West Coast up to the satellite, bouncing it down, landing

1:25:18.600 --> 1:25:25.760
 it in New Jersey of all places in Northern New Jersey, Holmville, New Jersey.

1:25:25.760 --> 1:25:27.400
 And these radio astronomers couldn't get rid of the signal.

1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:30.240
 So they said, well, New Jersey is not far from New York.

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:31.760
 Let's see if the signal is coming from New York.

1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:33.120
 No, not coming from New York.

1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:34.400
 Let's see if it changes with the year.

1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:38.760
 Maybe it's coming from the galaxy, which was also discovered there by Jansky in 1930 something.

1:25:38.760 --> 1:25:43.520
 So in the not being able to reduce the signal or increase the signal to noise ratio, the

1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:44.520
 noise was...

1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:45.520
 It was noise.

1:25:45.520 --> 1:25:46.760
 They knew the signal was right.

1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:48.160
 They couldn't get rid of the noise.

1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:52.320
 And there was excess noise over the model that had not only been predicted by them, but had

1:25:52.320 --> 1:25:55.880
 been measured by a previous guy, a guy by the name of Edward Ohm.

1:25:55.880 --> 1:26:00.400
 He measured the same signal, found that there was this hiss of static, of radio static that

1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:03.600
 he could not get rid of that had a value of about three Kelvin.

1:26:03.600 --> 1:26:04.600
 So you can translate.

1:26:04.600 --> 1:26:10.600
 Remember, I said, if you take a radio telescope and you have pointed at an object that's hot,

1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:14.200
 the radio telescope's detector will get to the same temperature as the object.

1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:16.520
 It's a principle of radiothermodynamics.

1:26:16.520 --> 1:26:17.720
 So it's a really interesting thing.

1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:20.120
 So thermometer, you can stick it into Jupiter from here on Earth.

1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:21.620
 It's amazing.

1:26:21.620 --> 1:26:26.320
 And so we in a radio astronomy characterize our signal not by its intensity, but by its

1:26:26.320 --> 1:26:27.760
 temperature.

1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:31.640
 So he found this guy, Edward Ohm, oh, there's this three Kelvin signal, I can't get rid

1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:32.640
 of it.

1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:35.320
 It must be I did my error analysis wrong.

1:26:35.320 --> 1:26:38.960
 And I would give him an F if he was one of my first year students.

1:26:38.960 --> 1:26:41.680
 But he's just attributed to lack of understanding.

1:26:41.680 --> 1:26:46.480
 These other guys, Penzius and Wilson, who are also radio astronomers, they said, no, let's

1:26:46.480 --> 1:26:52.880
 build another experiment, put that inside of our telescope and do what's called calibration,

1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:55.760
 put inject a known source of signal.

1:26:55.760 --> 1:26:59.600
 Every second that has a temperature of about four Kelvin, because the signal that they

1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:02.840
 were trying to get rid of is about three Kelvin, and you want to have it as close as possible

1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:04.880
 to the pernicious signal as possible.

1:27:04.880 --> 1:27:08.360
 They did that once a second, so they got billions of measurements, millions of measurements

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:12.960
 over the course of several months, years, and even by the end, maybe millions of measurements

1:27:12.960 --> 1:27:14.600
 for sure.

1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.000
 And they found they couldn't get rid of it either, but they measured it.

1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:20.440
 It was exactly 2.7265 degrees Kelvin.

1:27:20.440 --> 1:27:26.560
 So how does having a four Kelvin source, how does the calibration work, just that accuracy?

1:27:26.560 --> 1:27:27.560
 It could be larger.

1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:29.280
 I imagine you're trying to calibrate the microphone.

1:27:29.280 --> 1:27:33.600
 You could do it with a really loud sound, but the gain would start to compress.

1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:37.680
 So there are amplifiers downstream from the detector in every experiment that I've ever

1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:41.640
 worked on, and they only have a linear region over a very small region, and you want to

1:27:41.640 --> 1:27:43.420
 keep it as linear as possible.

1:27:43.420 --> 1:27:46.960
 That means you want, if you're trying to get rid of, you're trying to compare like a voice

1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:51.360
 and you're trying to compare that to a jet engine, it's not going to be as easy on the

1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:56.040
 amplifiers as getting a slightly, a gong or something.

1:27:56.040 --> 1:27:59.200
 So the idea of the noise is present in both?

1:27:59.200 --> 1:28:03.560
 There's noise present in both, and you measure, what they did is they made a separate measurement

1:28:03.560 --> 1:28:07.240
 just of the calibration system, which they measured exactly very well.

1:28:07.240 --> 1:28:09.440
 Four Kelvin is the temperature of a liquid helium.

1:28:09.440 --> 1:28:12.240
 That's a temperature that's not going to change, and it's certainly not going to change

1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:14.160
 of a time scale of one second.

1:28:14.160 --> 1:28:17.760
 And so they could compare unknown signal, known signal, unknown signal, known signal,

1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:18.880
 like a scale, like a balance.

1:28:18.880 --> 1:28:20.400
 So another way to think about it is like this.

1:28:20.400 --> 1:28:24.400
 You've seen these Libra kind of balances, where you put two weights in a pan, right?

1:28:24.400 --> 1:28:28.200
 What happens if you put like a one ounce weight on one side and a 20 kilogram weight in the

1:28:28.200 --> 1:28:29.200
 other?

1:28:29.200 --> 1:28:30.200
 You don't get any measurement, right?

1:28:30.200 --> 1:28:32.400
 You do get kind of a measurement if they're close in weight.

1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:33.920
 That's why they use four Kelvin.

1:28:33.920 --> 1:28:34.920
 Got it.

1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:39.760
 But just to linger on the fact that there's a romantic element to the fact that you're

1:28:39.760 --> 1:28:41.280
 arriving at the same temperature.

1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:42.280
 That's kind of fascinating.

1:28:42.280 --> 1:28:45.760
 And you're measuring stuff in terms of, you're measuring signal in terms of temperature at

1:28:45.760 --> 1:28:46.760
 the source.

1:28:46.760 --> 1:28:47.760
 Yeah.

1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:51.200
 So you get a, I mean, there's something about temperature that's intimate.

1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:52.200
 Yeah.

1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:53.200
 It's cool.

1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:54.200
 Yeah.

1:28:54.200 --> 1:28:57.880
 Especially since, you know, all life is basically, you know, conversion of energy and trying

1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:02.720
 to control entropy, which is then related to thermodynamics, exactly in that way.

1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:07.840
 And this was very crucial kind of thing to do in science because they weren't looking

1:29:07.840 --> 1:29:08.840
 for the signal.

1:29:08.840 --> 1:29:13.040
 They found it accidentally, these two scientists, Penzias and Wilson.

1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:16.680
 And I like to think that those kind of discoveries are the purest in science.

1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:20.880
 Like when you see something, Isaac Asimov once said, like the most important reaction

1:29:20.880 --> 1:29:26.360
 as a scientist is not Eureka, which means in Greek, as you know, I have found it.

1:29:26.360 --> 1:29:29.200
 No, he said, no, he said, like, that's weird.

1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:32.000
 Like that's a much better reaction or that's freaking cool.

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:33.600
 Like that's a scientist.

1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:35.360
 Not like, oh, I found one because.

1:29:35.360 --> 1:29:36.360
 Surprise.

1:29:36.360 --> 1:29:37.360
 Yeah.

1:29:37.360 --> 1:29:43.080
 If you find what you're going to find, that's what leads us susceptible to confirmation bias,

1:29:43.080 --> 1:29:44.080
 which is deadly.

1:29:44.080 --> 1:29:46.360
 And so, you know, as close to deadly as possible.

1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:51.240
 So how does that take us to something that's potentially worthy of a Nobel Prize?

1:29:51.240 --> 1:29:54.280
 So Penzias and Wilson weren't looking for a signal.

1:29:54.280 --> 1:30:01.960
 They ended up discovering the heat left over from the fusion of helium from hydrogen, etc.

1:30:01.960 --> 1:30:03.080
 And that was a serendipitous discovery.

1:30:03.080 --> 1:30:04.560
 They won the Nobel Prize in 1978.

1:30:04.560 --> 1:30:07.720
 It was the first one ever awarded in cosmology.

1:30:07.720 --> 1:30:11.920
 My reasoning is what if you could explain not only how the elements got formed, but how

1:30:11.920 --> 1:30:16.800
 the whole universe got formed and kill off every other model of science.

1:30:16.800 --> 1:30:21.880
 So if that weren't enough, every scientist, you know, worth his or her salt had told me

1:30:21.880 --> 1:30:27.040
 and Andrew Lang and our colleagues, this is a slam dunked Nobel Prize if you could do

1:30:27.040 --> 1:30:28.040
 it.

1:30:28.040 --> 1:30:31.880
 Because it was really explaining, again, the stakes of this science is different than like

1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:33.920
 superfluidity, plasma physics.

1:30:33.920 --> 1:30:37.840
 When you talk about the origin of the universe, it ties into everything.

1:30:37.840 --> 1:30:41.880
 It ties into philosophy, theology.

1:30:41.880 --> 1:30:47.000
 You realize if Paul Steinhardt is correct, that the Bible can't be correct.

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:51.560
 In other words, the Bible is correct now, isn't falsified if you like, if you believe

1:30:51.560 --> 1:30:52.560
 it.

1:30:52.560 --> 1:30:54.960
 I'm not, I never use the Bible as a science book, obviously.

1:30:54.960 --> 1:30:57.880
 But the Bible speaks of a singular beginning.

1:30:57.880 --> 1:31:02.320
 What if you knew for sure the universe was not singular, it would be more like the cosmology

1:31:02.320 --> 1:31:08.720
 of Akhenaten and Egyptians than the biblical Torah, Old Testament, if you will, narrative.

1:31:08.720 --> 1:31:11.480
 So in my mind, the stakes could not be higher.

1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:14.520
 And again, it's not an offense because we need plasma physics, we need, we need every

1:31:14.520 --> 1:31:19.520
 type of physics except maybe biophysics, like we literally use every branch of physics

1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:24.160
 and thermodynamic superconductivity, quantum attack, all that goes into our understanding

1:31:24.160 --> 1:31:25.160
 of the instrument.

1:31:25.160 --> 1:31:28.880
 And even further, if you want to understand the theory that predicts the signal that we

1:31:28.880 --> 1:31:29.880
 purport to measure.

1:31:29.880 --> 1:31:36.600
 So I rationalize that if Pensius and Wilson won the Nobel Prize for this, if Holson Taylor

1:31:36.600 --> 1:31:40.720
 won the Nobel Prize for indirectly detecting gravitational waves, this is decades before

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:48.120
 LIGO, by me detecting gravitational waves indirectly, detecting how the universe began,

1:31:48.120 --> 1:31:52.800
 detecting the origin of the initial conditions for the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, which won

1:31:52.800 --> 1:31:57.920
 the Nobel Prize in 1983, these are like five Nobel Prizes, potentially.

1:31:57.920 --> 1:32:02.480
 And for that reason, it seemed as close as you could possibly get to being a slam dunk,

1:32:02.480 --> 1:32:06.240
 to outdo what my father did, to do really this impossible.

1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:13.520
 And at that time, Lex, again, it sounds weird because people are like, oh, you wouldn't,

1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:17.120
 you don't really, you still want the Nobel Prize, you're still like greedy, and look,

1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:20.640
 you wrote another book about, and I always joke, I'm like, well, if you want to see if

1:32:20.640 --> 1:32:24.000
 I'm a hypocrite, just get them to give me the Nobel Prize in literature.

1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:25.920
 And if I accept it, then I'm a hypocrite.

1:32:25.920 --> 1:32:30.840
 But wait, well, we'll get to your current feelings on the Nobel Prize in terms of hypocrites

1:32:30.840 --> 1:32:32.160
 and so on.

1:32:32.160 --> 1:32:39.760
 But so there's this ambition, let's say this device, this kind of signal could unlock many

1:32:39.760 --> 1:32:41.840
 of the mysteries about the early universe.

1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:44.360
 And so there was excitement there.

1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:47.000
 So let's take it then further.

1:32:47.000 --> 1:32:52.880
 I mean, there's a human story here of a bit of heartbreak, not only was this possibly

1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:59.000
 worth the Nobel Prize, if the Nobel Prize was given, you were excluded from the list

1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:01.640
 of three that would get the Nobel Prize.

1:33:01.640 --> 1:33:04.720
 So why were you excluded?

1:33:04.720 --> 1:33:07.400
 Maybe that's a place to tell the story of Bicep 2.

1:33:07.400 --> 1:33:08.400
 Yeah.

1:33:08.400 --> 1:33:13.840
 So Bicep 2, like iPhones, or I know you're an Android fanboy, but every year, they get

1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:14.840
 a little bit better.

1:33:14.840 --> 1:33:18.720
 They get more megapixels, they get more optics, triple X zoom, whatever.

1:33:18.720 --> 1:33:19.720
 Okay, right?

1:33:19.720 --> 1:33:21.520
 We upgraded our detectors as well.

1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:25.280
 The initial detectors were based on what are called semiconductors.

1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:29.400
 They have certain properties that make them very difficult to replicate at scale.

1:33:29.400 --> 1:33:34.680
 And we wanted to make them into superconductors, which had a virtue that you could then mass

1:33:34.680 --> 1:33:35.680
 produce them.

1:33:35.680 --> 1:33:36.680
 Why superconductors?

1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.280
 Well, again, we're measuring heat.

1:33:38.280 --> 1:33:43.280
 So one thing about a superconductor is that it transitions from some finite resistance

1:33:43.280 --> 1:33:48.480
 to zero resistance over a very short span of temperature range.

1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:53.000
 That means you can use that very short span dependency as an accurate and sensitive and

1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:54.960
 precise thermometer.

1:33:54.960 --> 1:33:58.480
 And so my brilliant colleagues around the world, in this case, Jamie Bach and nowadays

1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:05.000
 Suzanne Staggs at Princeton, they are just exquisitely making these sensors tens of thousands

1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:06.000
 of them.

1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:12.520
 The initial Bicep 1 instrument, of course, we just call it Bicep, that only had 98 detectors.

1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:17.800
 Simon's Observatory is going to have 100 times more, just in one of our four telescopes.

1:34:17.800 --> 1:34:24.480
 We're going to have 60,000 detectors operating full time at 0.1 degree above absolute zero

1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:25.640
 in the Atacama Desert.

1:34:25.640 --> 1:34:26.640
 We'll get there.

1:34:26.640 --> 1:34:32.760
 But in the case of getting back to what Bicep did, we upgraded it made Bicep 2.

1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:42.360
 In January 2010, we had just installed in the exact same location at the South Pole in

1:34:42.360 --> 1:34:47.960
 the same building, which is ominously called the Dark Sector Laboratory, DSL, still operating

1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:49.920
 through this very day.

1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:56.960
 We installed a new receiver on the same platform as before, very similar identical optics, cryogenics,

1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:02.040
 vacuum, everything, except it went from 98 detectors to 512 detectors.

1:35:02.040 --> 1:35:05.640
 So almost an order of magnitude, very substantial upgrade.

1:35:05.640 --> 1:35:09.840
 And it had certain other features that made it even more powerful than just a naive factor

1:35:09.840 --> 1:35:11.340
 of five.

1:35:11.340 --> 1:35:14.480
 And then we started observing with that, and we knew we'd have years to go, and maybe we'd

1:35:14.480 --> 1:35:15.480
 never see anything.

1:35:15.480 --> 1:35:18.760
 Again, we're looking for these tiny little reverberations in the fabric of space time

1:35:18.760 --> 1:35:23.080
 produced close to the origin of the universes we could ever get to.

1:35:23.080 --> 1:35:24.400
 So I was playing a role in that.

1:35:24.400 --> 1:35:30.560
 Obviously, it had upgraded my version of the original idea that I had had for Bicep, along

1:35:30.560 --> 1:35:32.720
 with Andrew Lang.

1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:38.360
 And in January of 2010, I was at a meeting at UC Berkeley, and I got a call from Andrew

1:35:38.360 --> 1:35:44.320
 Lang, or I was in a meeting with Andrew Lang's thesis advisor, Paul Richards, at UC Berkeley.

1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:49.080
 And he said Andrew is dead, he had taken his life by suicide.

1:35:49.080 --> 1:35:53.880
 And this is a man, and I had already lost my father at this point in 2010, but he was

1:35:53.880 --> 1:35:55.840
 like a father figure to me, Andrew.

1:35:55.840 --> 1:36:02.280
 He would give me advice on marriage, on how I should be with my kids, and what was the

1:36:02.280 --> 1:36:04.600
 most important way to move through the academic ladder.

1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:09.360
 Again, he was preternaturally suited to win the Nobel Prize, everyone always thought he

1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:10.360
 would win it.

1:36:10.360 --> 1:36:12.360
 If he were alive, he still could win it.

1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:18.000
 In fact, his wife, or his ex wife, won it, Francis Arnold in 2018.

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:26.440
 And it was just a power couple, and it destroyed me for a long time because he was just this

1:36:26.440 --> 1:36:27.440
 magical person.

1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:34.000
 I mean, I couldn't conceive of my career, my life, even like these aspects of raising

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:37.160
 kids and being married without him.

1:36:37.160 --> 1:36:43.480
 And to do it in that way, it felt like, again, he's got kids, and I feel terrible for them,

1:36:43.480 --> 1:36:44.480
 obviously.

1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:45.480
 But it did feel like a betrayal.

1:36:45.480 --> 1:36:46.640
 I mean, I'm just being honest with you.

1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:50.160
 It felt like, why didn't the F did you not reach out?

1:36:50.160 --> 1:36:52.640
 I thought we were close, and I couldn't.

1:36:52.640 --> 1:36:56.480
 I told him everything, and I felt like he had told me everything.

1:36:56.480 --> 1:36:59.880
 And now he was gone, and then inevitably we had to keep running the instrument.

1:36:59.880 --> 1:37:04.560
 I mean, there's millions of dollars invested, careers at stake, young people working tremendously

1:37:04.560 --> 1:37:08.360
 hard, and then here we were, and who's going to take over the lead?

1:37:08.360 --> 1:37:11.040
 He was the lead of the project at Caltech.

1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:15.720
 And then it turned out that the other collaborators with whom I had been working for years and

1:37:15.720 --> 1:37:21.040
 shared a lot of ups and downs with as well, they had decided to form a collaboration in

1:37:21.040 --> 1:37:23.400
 which I was no longer the principal investigator.

1:37:23.400 --> 1:37:26.920
 I was no longer one of the co principal investigators as I was on Bicep One.

1:37:26.920 --> 1:37:31.360
 So I continue on Bicep One as the co leader of it, but not on Bicep Two.

1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:34.680
 And obviously that was pretty painful.

1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:40.440
 This is all happening at the same time as you lose this father figure.

1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:47.840
 Now there's this one betrayal in a way, and there's another or something that feels like

1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:49.340
 a betrayal.

1:37:49.340 --> 1:37:54.720
 And he had kind of been the only one looking out for my interest in the new experiment.

1:37:54.720 --> 1:37:59.280
 I had moved from Caltech to UC San Diego, and there were other postdocs in the mix,

1:37:59.280 --> 1:38:03.000
 all of whom would come there to work with him to get the, you know, the approbation

1:38:03.000 --> 1:38:07.080
 that would then lead to their careers taking off as it did for mine.

1:38:07.080 --> 1:38:08.840
 And you know, so there was a competition.

1:38:08.840 --> 1:38:15.840
 I mean, science is not free from egos and competition and desires rightfully or wrongfully

1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:17.560
 for credit and attribution.

1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:21.920
 Was he the source of strength and confidence for you as a scientist, as a man?

1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:28.960
 I mean, we're kind of alone in this world as when you take on difficult things, we often

1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:34.200
 kind of grasp, but a few folks that give us strength.

1:38:34.200 --> 1:38:39.200
 Was he your basically your only source of strength in this whole journey, like primarily

1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:41.920
 in terms of like this close knit?

1:38:41.920 --> 1:38:43.760
 As a scientist, there were really two.

1:38:43.760 --> 1:38:48.880
 There was one, this Russian cosmologist, Alexander Polnarev, who thankfully is very much alive.

1:38:48.880 --> 1:38:52.600
 It was a Queen Mary university, now he's retired.

1:38:52.600 --> 1:38:56.120
 He was kind of a theoretical, you know, cosmological father to me.

1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:01.560
 And then Andrew was this counterpoint that was teaching me, you need to have a brand

1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:02.760
 as a scientist.

1:39:02.760 --> 1:39:05.720
 Every scientist has a brand and some of them don't protect it.

1:39:05.720 --> 1:39:08.080
 Some of them don't burnish it.

1:39:08.080 --> 1:39:12.480
 But some of the skills about being a scientist, we don't teach our students involve, how do

1:39:12.480 --> 1:39:16.880
 you cultivate a scientific persona?

1:39:16.880 --> 1:39:18.840
 And he was the exemplar for that.

1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:24.800
 In addition to being the avuncular, you know, father figure type character that really,

1:39:24.800 --> 1:39:26.480
 you know, was the person I would talk to.

1:39:26.480 --> 1:39:30.520
 I had issues with when I had issues with my own students and he would tell me how those

1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:31.520
 were.

1:39:31.520 --> 1:39:35.680
 And he would tell me, you know, his misgivings about people that he worked with or things

1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:36.680
 in his personal life.

1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:39.280
 And it was, it was, it was devastating.

1:39:39.280 --> 1:39:40.760
 But again, like, who the hell am I?

1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:41.760
 I'm not his kid.

1:39:41.760 --> 1:39:46.120
 You know, he, his kids lost father, you know, it's, so I feel guilty talking about it in

1:39:46.120 --> 1:39:48.360
 that sense, but it's just a reality, you know.

1:39:48.360 --> 1:39:53.280
 Well, there is something that's not often talked about is people who collaborate on

1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:54.280
 scientific efforts.

1:39:54.280 --> 1:40:01.040
 I mean, that's, I don't, again, don't want to compare, but you know, it's, it's sometimes

1:40:01.040 --> 1:40:09.120
 when the collaboration is a truly great, it sounds similar as when veterans talk about

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:12.960
 their time serving together, there's, there's a bond that's formed.

1:40:12.960 --> 1:40:20.560
 So like comparing family and this kind of thing is, you know, it is not productive, but

1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:28.320
 the depth of the bond is nevertheless real because you're taking on something, you're

1:40:28.320 --> 1:40:31.140
 taking on the impossible.

1:40:31.140 --> 1:40:35.280
 You're trying to achieve something sort of like there's this darkness, this fog of mystery

1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:40.520
 that we're all surrounded by, which is what the human condition is.

1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:45.320
 And you are like grasping at hope through the tools of science and you're doing that

1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:51.160
 together with like a confidence you probably should not have, but you're boldly pushing

1:40:51.160 --> 1:40:52.160
 through.

1:40:52.160 --> 1:41:01.080
 And then for him to, to take his own life, it can, can I ask you about this kind of moment

1:41:01.080 --> 1:41:06.960
 that combined, I don't want to say betrayal, but perhaps the feeling of betrayal that bicep

1:41:06.960 --> 1:41:12.280
 to kind of goes on without you, even though you're part of it, you're not part of the

1:41:12.280 --> 1:41:13.800
 leadership group.

1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:18.760
 Can you describe those low points?

1:41:18.760 --> 1:41:20.000
 Was there a depression?

1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.680
 What was there a crumbling of confidence?

1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:23.680
 Yeah.

1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:30.120
 I mean, it was, it was so wrapped up with my identity as a person, you know, like there's

1:41:30.120 --> 1:41:34.960
 only a few different ways to have identity and, you know, unless you're unhealthy psychologically,

1:41:34.960 --> 1:41:38.520
 one of them for scientists is often that they're a scientist and that sometimes is their primary

1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:39.520
 identity.

1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:43.440
 Now I've got other, you know, husband and father, but, but, you know, at that time that

1:41:43.440 --> 1:41:45.000
 was my identity.

1:41:45.000 --> 1:41:51.120
 So to have that kind of taken away, it, you know what, it reminded me of being, you know,

1:41:51.120 --> 1:41:56.960
 kind of adopted in a sense like my, like the one who created me or that I had played, you

1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:01.520
 know, played a role in Mila, that he abandoned me in the sense, it felt like these people

1:42:01.520 --> 1:42:02.520
 are abandoning me.

1:42:02.520 --> 1:42:07.200
 And the only thing I'd correct about the analogy that you use is like in Mila in the war, they're

1:42:07.200 --> 1:42:08.720
 all working, you know, for common good.

1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:13.480
 It's not like, I want to be, get the most kills or, I compare it more to like a band,

1:42:13.480 --> 1:42:16.520
 like think about the Beatles, you know, and what they did.

1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:21.240
 And then they like, you know, they ripped apart because of Ego's credit, they had solo careers,

1:42:21.240 --> 1:42:25.600
 they had, you know, relations with their intimates and so forth.

1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:30.280
 And there it's not only for the common good, there is more of a zero sum aspect.

1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:34.000
 Like I would say science is not, science is an infinite game.

1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:35.840
 You can't win science.

1:42:35.840 --> 1:42:38.920
 You never get to the, oh, we won science and even the Nobel Prize, they don't feel like,

1:42:38.920 --> 1:42:39.920
 oh, we're done.

1:42:39.920 --> 1:42:42.920
 They feel like a lot of times they're imposters even to that day.

1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:48.480
 However, science is made up of a lot of, lot of, lot of finite games where there is only

1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:50.080
 one winner for tenure.

1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:54.080
 There is only three winner, are only three winners for the Nobel Prize.

1:42:54.080 --> 1:42:58.040
 And because of that, I think it's heterodox and it's very confusing, especially there's

1:42:58.040 --> 1:42:59.040
 no guide.

1:42:59.040 --> 1:43:02.640
 I never got a guide how to be a professor, how to teach, how to lead a research group,

1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:06.840
 how to deal with the death of an advisor, how to deal with an unruly graduate student

1:43:06.840 --> 1:43:07.840
 or two.

1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:11.880
 You know, so we're all like reinventing it, which is kind of ironic and insane if you

1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:12.880
 think about it.

1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:16.080
 Because the academic system that I am a part of and you are a part of is a thousand years

1:43:16.080 --> 1:43:24.600
 old, dates back to Bologna, Northern Italy, 1088 or so, first universities were established.

1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:29.400
 And you know, very little has changed, some guy or gal scratching a rock on another piece

1:43:29.400 --> 1:43:33.720
 of rock and, you know, lecturing in front of, there's only one better aspect nowadays

1:43:33.720 --> 1:43:38.360
 is that back then, the students could go on strike if they didn't like the professor,

1:43:38.360 --> 1:43:42.480
 and then he or she wouldn't get paid, probably mostly it was he's back then.

1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:47.240
 Nowadays that barbaric process has been replaced by tenure, so okay.

1:43:47.240 --> 1:43:51.920
 But no, it was a definite kind of feeling of the rug getting pulled out from underneath

1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:52.920
 me.

1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:58.240
 You know, he was like my consigliore, he was a guy I, you know, sought counsel and counseled

1:43:58.240 --> 1:44:04.280
 me and he's dead and I felt like there is no one who's going to honor the agreements

1:44:04.280 --> 1:44:05.640
 that we had.

1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:07.240
 And he was a very soulful person.

1:44:07.240 --> 1:44:11.760
 He was so much better at being a scientist than I could ever be.

1:44:11.760 --> 1:44:15.160
 And just a loss for the cosmos, it just really hurt.

1:44:15.160 --> 1:44:18.280
 And you know, I thought, oh, like, you know, it's so sad because he could have won the

1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:19.280
 Nobel Prize.

1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:21.600
 I don't think like that anymore.

1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:25.960
 Just I think about his kids felt at first, now there goes my chance at winning a Nobel

1:44:25.960 --> 1:44:31.160
 Prize and hence the title of the book was like, I knew I would not win the Nobel Prize.

1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:34.240
 It also means that there's parts of the Nobel Prize that have to be done away with.

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:38.200
 It's a double entendre, like we need to lose aspects of the Nobel Prize to help science

1:44:38.200 --> 1:44:39.200
 out.

1:44:39.200 --> 1:44:43.200
 We can talk about that at a different time, but in the context of like now thinking back

1:44:43.200 --> 1:44:49.120
 on it, that was such a minuscule part of it because let's say he did win the Nobel Prize

1:44:49.120 --> 1:44:53.360
 or I did win the Nobel, you know, any of us did, would that have changed anything?

1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:55.240
 Would that have brought anything back?

1:44:55.240 --> 1:44:59.760
 It's so, you know, we say it's like vanity, it's futility.

1:44:59.760 --> 1:45:04.840
 And I just, you know, for me, the Nobel Prize is like, it's, I don't want to say it's like

1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:08.760
 insignificant because obviously it has a lot of power and it has influence.

1:45:08.760 --> 1:45:13.280
 And you know, I went back, I had Neil deGrasse Tyson on my show, I'm going to name drum, okay?

1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:14.920
 And he prepares.

1:45:14.920 --> 1:45:20.480
 He prepares like a surgeon before doing surgery when he goes on a talk show.

1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:24.400
 So you see him going on Colbert Report, you think, oh, they just have a banter.

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:25.400
 He's just naturally gifted.

1:45:25.400 --> 1:45:27.160
 No, he said, no, no, no.

1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:29.840
 You say that you're undermining what he does.

1:45:29.840 --> 1:45:34.000
 What he does, he goes back, he watches the last month of Colbert Reports or whatever

1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:38.640
 it's called, late show, and he says, how long does Stephen pause between questions?

1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:41.360
 How long in the news cycle does he go back?

1:45:41.360 --> 1:45:44.280
 What topics has he talked about with people similar to me?

1:45:44.280 --> 1:45:46.640
 So I took Neil and I did that for you.

1:45:46.640 --> 1:45:50.120
 And I look back, how many times has Lex mentioned the words Nobel and prize?

1:45:50.120 --> 1:45:56.440
 And I put it into Google Engram and out came exactly the same number of times as show notes,

1:45:56.440 --> 1:45:58.840
 show episodes as of this moment.

1:45:58.840 --> 1:46:01.480
 So you've said the words Nobel Prize over 240 times.

1:46:01.480 --> 1:46:02.480
 Yeah.

1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:08.600
 I mean, it is so strange as a symbol that kind of unites this whole scientific journey,

1:46:08.600 --> 1:46:09.600
 right?

1:46:09.600 --> 1:46:20.000
 And it's both sad and beautiful that a little prize, like a little award, a medal, a little

1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:24.960
 plaque, they'll be most likely forgotten by history completely.

1:46:24.960 --> 1:46:26.680
 Some silly list.

1:46:26.680 --> 1:46:32.280
 It's somehow a catalyst for greatness.

1:46:32.280 --> 1:46:37.280
 It resulted in you doing your life's work, the dream of it.

1:46:37.280 --> 1:46:39.040
 Would I have done it without the Nobel Prize?

1:46:39.040 --> 1:46:40.040
 I don't.

1:46:40.040 --> 1:46:43.600
 I can't necessarily counterfactually state that that would have happened.

1:46:43.600 --> 1:46:47.560
 So no, it definitely has a place.

1:46:47.560 --> 1:46:50.560
 And for me, it is valuable to think about it.

1:46:50.560 --> 1:46:57.960
 But the level of obsession that academics have about it is really, I think it is almost

1:46:57.960 --> 1:47:00.280
 unbalanced becoming unhealthy.

1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:04.960
 And again, I have no, I make no truck with the winners of the Nobel Prize.

1:47:04.960 --> 1:47:10.640
 Obviously, now I've had 11 on the show, and to think about the one rule.

1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:15.600
 So by the way, right after the day new month of the story, which I'll get to in a bit,

1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:20.960
 how our dreams went down to dust and ashes, I was asked by the Royal Swedish Academy of

1:47:20.960 --> 1:47:25.520
 Sciences to nominate the winners of the 2015 Nobel Prize in physics.

1:47:25.520 --> 1:47:31.560
 So the one that I theoretically could have been eligible to win in 2016, actually, they

1:47:31.560 --> 1:47:32.560
 asked me to nominate.

1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:33.560
 Now, imagine if I ask you.

1:47:33.560 --> 1:47:38.240
 You say, Brian, you know, instead of me inviting myself on the show, if you say, Brian, would

1:47:38.240 --> 1:47:40.000
 you like to come on the Lex Friedman podcast?

1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:44.280
 I say, you know what, Lex, you know, that kind of Rogan, I think you might, can you

1:47:44.280 --> 1:47:46.120
 introduce him to me?

1:47:46.120 --> 1:47:47.800
 Like, do you imagine how that would feel?

1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:52.640
 Like you'd be like, you know, so I was asked to nominate the winners and the one rule that

1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:57.040
 they say of all the rules that Alfred Nobel stipulated, there's only one rule that they

1:47:57.040 --> 1:47:58.040
 maintained.

1:47:58.040 --> 1:48:01.720
 In other words, he said one person can win it for something they discovered in the preceding

1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:08.000
 year that had the greatest benefit to mankind, made the world better, right?

1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:09.360
 None of that was mentioned in the letter.

1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:12.120
 I said, many people can win it for what worked on long ago.

1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:15.960
 They didn't mention anything in the letter to me signed by the secretary general, nothing

1:48:15.960 --> 1:48:16.960
 about benefiting mankind.

1:48:16.960 --> 1:48:20.320
 They said, just one thing, can't nominate yourself.

1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:22.120
 So none of these guys nominated themselves.

1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:28.200
 Actually, little known fact, they sent that exact letter just to you.

1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:30.120
 That rule was created just for you.

1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:33.200
 It's called the Keating Coralit, yes, exactly.

1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:34.200
 Just to like...

1:48:34.200 --> 1:48:35.200
 Good for them.

1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:36.200
 Rub it in.

1:48:36.200 --> 1:48:41.560
 I mean, it's, in this particular case, of course, there's like some weird technicality

1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:42.560
 or whatever.

1:48:42.560 --> 1:48:49.600
 But in this particular case, it's kind of a powerful reminder that the Nobel Prize leaves

1:48:49.600 --> 1:48:54.200
 a lot of people behind in that there's stories behind all of that.

1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:55.200
 Yeah.

1:48:55.200 --> 1:48:56.200
 I mean, here's a good example.

1:48:56.200 --> 1:48:57.200
 Again, this is my friend, Barry Barr.

1:48:57.200 --> 1:49:00.280
 He's become like a mentor and a friend.

1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:04.400
 He wrote the forward to this, my book, Into the Impossible.

1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:07.200
 He won the Nobel Prize because a different guy died.

1:49:07.200 --> 1:49:08.200
 And he admits it.

1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:09.200
 And he said it.

1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:13.400
 And actually, it's funny with him because I've heard you talk, you know, very rhapsodically

1:49:13.400 --> 1:49:17.880
 and loving and romantically about, with Harry Cliff and wonderful podcasts with him, by

1:49:17.880 --> 1:49:23.200
 the way, about the LHC and how wonderful it is and how in that, you know, we were about

1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:28.360
 to build the superconducting supercollider right here in Texas and it didn't get built

1:49:28.360 --> 1:49:30.400
 and got canceled by Congress and so on.

1:49:30.400 --> 1:49:32.880
 And I'd say to Barry, that was the best thing that ever happened to you.

1:49:32.880 --> 1:49:34.200
 And he's like, what the hell are you talking about?

1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:39.720
 I'm like, if that didn't get canceled, first of all, even though it did get canceled, the

1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:44.480
 Europeans went on to build it themselves, save the American taxpayers billions of dollars.

1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:48.680
 And we wouldn't have learned anything really substantially new as proven by the fact that

1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:53.280
 as you and Harry talked about, nothing besides the Higgs particle of great note has come out

1:49:53.280 --> 1:49:57.520
 and actually he's had a recent paper, but it's been an upper limit along with his collaborators

1:49:57.520 --> 1:50:00.920
 and LHCP experiment that I'm going to be talking with him about.

1:50:00.920 --> 1:50:03.160
 But the bottom line is it was really built to detect the Higgs.

1:50:03.160 --> 1:50:08.000
 So the SSE for twice as much money would have sucked up Barry's career and he would have

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.920
 been working on that, maybe not.

1:50:09.920 --> 1:50:12.080
 And then he would never have worked on LIGO.

1:50:12.080 --> 1:50:14.040
 And then he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize, right?

1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:15.640
 So you look at counterfactual history.

1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:17.040
 That's not actually a big stretch, right?

1:50:17.040 --> 1:50:20.040
 If the SSE had still gone on, he would have worked on it because he was one of the primary

1:50:20.040 --> 1:50:22.200
 leaders of that experiment.

1:50:22.200 --> 1:50:26.360
 Second thing, imagine the following thing had happened.

1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:32.400
 They won the Nobel Prize because in September 2015, they detected unequivocal evidence for

1:50:32.400 --> 1:50:37.360
 the in spiral collision of two massive black holes, each about 30 times the mass of the

1:50:37.360 --> 1:50:43.200
 sun, leaving behind an object that had just less than 60 solar masses behind.

1:50:43.200 --> 1:50:49.840
 So one solar mass worth of matter got converted to pure gravitational energy, no light was

1:50:49.840 --> 1:50:51.360
 seen by them.

1:50:51.360 --> 1:50:59.480
 This particular date, September 14, 2015, that explosion because of the miracle of time

1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:06.440
 travel that telescopes afford us, that actually took place 1.2 billion years ago in a galaxy

1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:07.440
 far, far away.

1:51:07.440 --> 1:51:11.800
 They actually don't know which galaxy it took place in still and they never will.

1:51:11.800 --> 1:51:15.200
 If that collision between these two things, which have probably been orbiting each other

1:51:15.200 --> 1:51:20.640
 for maybe a million years or more, if that had occurred 15 days earlier, Barry wouldn't

1:51:20.640 --> 1:51:23.000
 have won the Nobel Prize because...

1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:29.200
 It's hilarious to think that there's one human that won the Nobel Prize because two giant

1:51:29.200 --> 1:51:34.280
 things collided a billion, 200 million years ago.

1:51:34.280 --> 1:51:40.000
 And if it had happened 18 days, 20, 30, because that was the deadline for the Nobel Prize

1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:44.200
 to be announced, they announced the findings in February, but you have to nominate the

1:51:44.200 --> 1:51:45.200
 winners in January.

1:51:45.200 --> 1:51:49.880
 So I could have nominated them up until January 30th, but they didn't announce anything and

1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:53.200
 they were just rumors.

1:51:53.200 --> 1:51:55.760
 But the reason that he wouldn't have won it, because there was another guy who was still

1:51:55.760 --> 1:52:00.600
 alive, considered to be the founder and father of three of the three fathers, Ray Weiss who

1:52:00.600 --> 1:52:05.200
 did win it, Kip Dorn who did win it, and the third gentleman at Caltech named Ron Driever,

1:52:05.200 --> 1:52:07.120
 who passed away again.

1:52:07.120 --> 1:52:12.040
 He was alive in 2016, he died in the middle of 2017, and then he was awarded the Nobel

1:52:12.040 --> 1:52:13.040
 Prize.

1:52:13.040 --> 1:52:20.400
 And here we are, several billion of hairless apes that strangely were clothing, celebrated

1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:30.720
 three other clothed, hairless apes with a metal, with one particular element.

1:52:30.720 --> 1:52:35.360
 And then they made speeches in a particular language that evolved in a...

1:52:35.360 --> 1:52:41.040
 Yeah, to get those metals in front of another guy who wears even fancier clothes, who is

1:52:41.040 --> 1:52:42.920
 the king of Sweden.

1:52:42.920 --> 1:52:44.920
 And then they got some free food afterwards.

1:52:44.920 --> 1:52:47.360
 Get some reindeer meat, that's right.

1:52:47.360 --> 1:52:50.040
 Okay, excellent.

1:52:50.040 --> 1:52:54.960
 Since you mentioned Joe Rogan in that little example, what happened to you in terms of

1:52:54.960 --> 1:52:57.160
 bicep too?

1:52:57.160 --> 1:53:02.600
 I want to kind of speak at a high level about a particular thing I observed.

1:53:02.600 --> 1:53:06.120
 So I was a fan of Joe Rogan since he started the podcast.

1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:09.880
 Just listening to the podcast, I'm a huge fan of podcasts in general.

1:53:09.880 --> 1:53:17.680
 And it also coincided with my entry into grad school and this whole journey of academia.

1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:23.240
 So grad school, getting my PhD, going to MIT, and then Google, and then just looking at

1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:26.720
 this whole world of research.

1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:36.360
 What I really loved about how Joe Rogan approaches the world is that he celebrates others.

1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:37.440
 Like he promotes them.

1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:43.920
 He gets like genuinely, and I now know this from just being a friend privately, he genuinely

1:53:43.920 --> 1:53:48.000
 gets excited by the success of others.

1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:55.720
 And the contrast of that to how folks in academia often behave was always really disappointing

1:53:55.720 --> 1:54:03.480
 to me because the natural, just on a basic human level, there is an excitement.

1:54:03.480 --> 1:54:09.240
 But the nature of that excitement is more like, I'm happy for my friend, but I'm really

1:54:09.240 --> 1:54:11.320
 jealous and I want to even, I'll do them.

1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:14.000
 I want to celebrate them, but I want to do even better.

1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.080
 So even that's even for friends.

1:54:16.080 --> 1:54:21.240
 So there's not a genuine, pure excitement for others.

1:54:21.240 --> 1:54:28.280
 And then a couple of that with just you now as a host of a popular podcast know this feeling,

1:54:28.280 --> 1:54:35.520
 which is like, there's not even a willingness to celebrate publicly the awesomeness of others.

1:54:35.520 --> 1:54:42.960
 People in academia are often best equipped technically in terms of language to celebrate

1:54:42.960 --> 1:54:43.960
 others.

1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:50.560
 They understand the beauty, like the full richness of why the cool idea is as cool as

1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:51.560
 it is.

1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:53.440
 And they're in the best position to celebrate it.

1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:58.440
 And yet there's a feeling that if I celebrate others, they might end up on the cover of

1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:01.760
 nature or whatever and not me.

1:55:01.760 --> 1:55:03.960
 They turn into zero sum game.

1:55:03.960 --> 1:55:10.640
 The reason why I think Rogan has been an inspiration to me and many others is that it doesn't have

1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:12.480
 to be that way.

1:55:12.480 --> 1:55:18.360
 And forget money and all those kinds of things that I think there's a narrative told that

1:55:18.360 --> 1:55:23.840
 uh, academics are this way because there's a limited amount of money and so they're fighting

1:55:23.840 --> 1:55:24.840
 for this.

1:55:24.840 --> 1:55:28.440
 I don't think that's the reason it's happening this way.

1:55:28.440 --> 1:55:32.960
 I think, uh, I think you, you can have a limited amount of money.

1:55:32.960 --> 1:55:37.000
 The battle for money happens in the space of proposal.

1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:38.000
 There's networking.

1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:43.080
 There's private stuff, public celebration of others and all and just actually just how

1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:48.600
 you feel in the privacy of your own heart is not have to do anything with money.

1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:54.520
 It has to do with you having a big ego and not humbling yourself to the beauty of the

1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:56.600
 journey that we're all on.

1:55:56.600 --> 1:56:02.440
 And there's folks like Joe Rogan who in the comedian circles is also rare, but he inspired

1:56:02.440 --> 1:56:07.160
 all these other comedians to realize, you know what, it's great to celebrate each other.

1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:11.280
 We're promoting each other and therefore the pie grows because, because everybody else

1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:14.800
 gets excited about this whole thing and the pie grows right now.

1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:20.280
 The scientists by fighting, like by not celebrating each other are not growing the pie.

1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:24.160
 And now because of that sort of science becomes less and less popular.

1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:26.880
 The flying wheel and exactly, no, and I want to point out two things.

1:56:26.880 --> 1:56:32.880
 One is that I remember you went on Joe's show maybe a couple of years ago and, um, and then

1:56:32.880 --> 1:56:36.320
 he gave you a watch and gave you like a Rolex, right?

1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:38.960
 And I tweeted to you and I think it's Omega Omega, sorry.

1:56:38.960 --> 1:56:39.960
 Okay, fine.

1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:44.160
 Uh, the watch that went to the, to the moon, which we will get to in a bit.

1:56:44.160 --> 1:56:46.840
 Um, I don't think he could give you what I gave you though, by the way.

1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:50.680
 Um, and we'll get to what that final gift package is for you.

1:56:50.680 --> 1:56:55.200
 And by the way, I also wanted to mention because when you said Joe Rogan, I would not be upset

1:56:55.200 --> 1:56:57.200
 and you should definitely go on Joe Rogan.

1:56:57.200 --> 1:57:03.920
 And we had this conversation with him because I was like when I was, uh, uh, so moving to

1:57:03.920 --> 1:57:08.280
 Austin and had a conversation like, don't you think it's weird like if we have the

1:57:08.280 --> 1:57:12.560
 same guests at the same time or whatever, he's like, fuck that.

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:14.640
 I want you to be more successful than me.

1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:20.280
 I want, he, he truly wants everybody, like especially people close to him to be more

1:57:20.280 --> 1:57:21.280
 successful.

1:57:21.280 --> 1:57:24.280
 Like there's not even a thought like, but you know why he does.

1:57:24.280 --> 1:57:27.320
 And this is what I tweeted to you in one of the few things I think you have retweeted

1:57:27.320 --> 1:57:28.320
 that I sent you.

1:57:28.320 --> 1:57:32.120
 I said, someday you're going to give that to somebody and today I wanted that to be

1:57:32.120 --> 1:57:33.120
 me.

1:57:33.120 --> 1:57:41.040
 Uh, Joe's Omega, no, but, but the point is he sees in you that same, um, you know, grandiosity,

1:57:41.040 --> 1:57:43.040
 that same genuine spirit, graciousness.

1:57:43.040 --> 1:57:44.040
 And I think that's true.

1:57:44.040 --> 1:57:45.400
 I mean, you do do something very rare.

1:57:45.400 --> 1:57:48.600
 I don't want to turn this into too much of a love fest, but I do want to say even back

1:57:48.600 --> 1:57:53.160
 to Andrew, you know, who I've almost been, hey, he geographic about, you know, just treating

1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:54.280
 him like a saint.

1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:59.040
 He said to me the same thing and a moment of peak said like, God damn it, like I have

1:57:59.040 --> 1:58:04.480
 to train these guys and women that work for me so that they can be better than me so that

1:58:04.480 --> 1:58:08.560
 they can go out and compete with me for the same limited amount of funding from the FANG

1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:09.560
 NSF.

1:58:09.560 --> 1:58:12.040
 You know, that wasn't his, that wasn't who he was.

1:58:12.040 --> 1:58:16.560
 Um, that was just an expression like I'm doing something which is fundamentally, but

1:58:16.560 --> 1:58:17.560
 you know what?

1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:21.360
 Um, when you have kids, hopefully, you know, please God, you will someday because I think

1:58:21.360 --> 1:58:27.360
 and I hope we can get to talk about that later, but part of investment and part of doing something

1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:28.360
 with it.

1:58:28.360 --> 1:58:33.800
 Like you can get married, you can marry someone cause she's rich or he's rich or you can marry

1:58:33.800 --> 1:58:36.360
 someone cause they're good looking or he's good looking.

1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:40.040
 You can marry for all these different reasons that are ultimately selfish.

1:58:40.040 --> 1:58:42.000
 There's no way you can have a kid and be selfish.

1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:43.080
 Nobody says like, oh, you know what?

1:58:43.080 --> 1:58:46.160
 I really want this thing that's three feet tall that doesn't speak English that craps

1:58:46.160 --> 1:58:49.840
 on my floor that wakes me up all hours of the night that interferes my love life.

1:58:49.840 --> 1:58:53.040
 You know, nobody says that cause it doesn't benefit you for months and months.

1:58:53.040 --> 1:58:57.320
 A friend of mine who actually does the videos for me and does a lot of my solo videos, he's

1:58:57.320 --> 1:58:58.320
 having his first kid.

1:58:58.320 --> 1:58:59.320
 He's like, what do I do?

1:58:59.320 --> 1:59:01.760
 Cause it always gets stupid if I will catch up on sleep now.

1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:04.400
 Like yeah, I'm going to store sleep in my sleep bank.

1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:06.720
 Like I don't think Huberman and you talked about that, right?

1:59:06.720 --> 1:59:07.720
 You can't do that.

1:59:07.720 --> 1:59:08.720
 That's stupid.

1:59:08.720 --> 1:59:11.920
 What you can do, give the kid a bath, feed the baby, let the mother relax.

1:59:11.920 --> 1:59:16.040
 Like in other words, do the things and, and this really relates back to what Aristotle

1:59:16.040 --> 1:59:17.040
 once said.

1:59:17.040 --> 1:59:20.880
 Aristotle once said, why do parents love kids more than kids love parents?

1:59:20.880 --> 1:59:25.720
 As much as you love your dad and your mom, they still love you more and because you love

1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:27.320
 that, what you sacrifice for.

1:59:27.320 --> 1:59:28.320
 Here's a proof.

1:59:28.320 --> 1:59:31.160
 Um, I know a lot of families that have kids with special needs.

1:59:31.160 --> 1:59:35.760
 Some, some with severe, uh, my, one of my uncles, uh, my, the Keating side had, uh, severe

1:59:35.760 --> 1:59:40.400
 what they called mental retardation now, it's probably has a different name.

1:59:40.400 --> 1:59:45.240
 That out of the nine other brothers and sisters, he was their favorite cause they had to sacrifice

1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:47.080
 so much for him.

1:59:47.080 --> 1:59:50.920
 And I think of that, you know, in the small case, like Joe is kind of mentoring you or

1:59:50.920 --> 1:59:51.920
 whatever.

1:59:51.920 --> 1:59:52.920
 You're going to mentor someone.

1:59:52.920 --> 1:59:54.920
 You love that, what you sacrifice for.

1:59:54.920 --> 1:59:56.600
 What you sacrifice is reduction of entropy.

1:59:56.600 --> 2:00:01.560
 It's storing and investing and you want to protect that and you know, that, that to me

2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:02.560
 really speaks to this.

2:00:02.560 --> 2:00:04.400
 So I, you know, I don't hold it against, but it is true.

2:00:04.400 --> 2:00:08.560
 Like scientists are, you know, when they're described again, they're often said to be like

2:00:08.560 --> 2:00:09.560
 children, right?

2:00:09.560 --> 2:00:10.560
 You've heard this description.

2:00:10.560 --> 2:00:11.560
 They're inquisitive.

2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:12.560
 They're curious.

2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:13.560
 They're passionate.

2:00:13.560 --> 2:00:14.560
 They love that.

2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:15.560
 And I'm like, yeah, and they don't play well with others.

2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:16.560
 They're jealous.

2:00:16.560 --> 2:00:17.560
 They're petty.

2:00:17.560 --> 2:00:18.560
 They're selfish.

2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:19.560
 They won't share their ball in the go home.

2:00:19.560 --> 2:00:20.560
 We, you can't, there's no such thing as a single edge sword.

2:00:20.560 --> 2:00:23.560
 I wish there were, you know, because you, we, we need some more of that cause you gotta

2:00:23.560 --> 2:00:24.820
 stall it up.

2:00:24.820 --> 2:00:31.520
 But in this case, he, you know, I think when, when you have this kind of investment in,

2:00:31.520 --> 2:00:33.760
 in science, it's going to be natural.

2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:37.760
 But that doesn't mean we have to like, you know, feed the flames of competition.

2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:42.160
 You know, I'm like really, if you go to the homepage of the NSF or the department of energy

2:00:42.160 --> 2:00:47.840
 or the recently released national academy of sciences, future of science for the astronomical

2:00:47.840 --> 2:00:52.760
 sciences for the next 25 years or more, they talk about how many Nobel prizes these different

2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:54.320
 science things could win.

2:00:54.320 --> 2:00:59.080
 Exoplanets, life, the discovery of the CMB, B mode polarization, the nice thing.

2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:01.760
 You know, that's figure two in this thing.

2:01:01.760 --> 2:01:05.520
 And I'm like, what message is that sent to kids like to young people?

2:01:05.520 --> 2:01:08.160
 Like that's what you should be doing so that you win this small, as you said, this prize

2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:11.760
 given out by one hairless ape to another wearing a fancier costume using reindeer.

2:01:11.760 --> 2:01:15.360
 Especially in the case of Nobel prize, it's only currently given to three people.

2:01:15.360 --> 2:01:16.360
 At most.

2:01:16.360 --> 2:01:17.360
 Which was never one of his stipulate.

2:01:17.360 --> 2:01:18.360
 He actually said one.

2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:19.880
 You can only give it to one person.

2:01:19.880 --> 2:01:20.880
 So they change it.

2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:21.880
 Why did they change it?

2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:22.880
 Why did they change it?

2:01:22.880 --> 2:01:23.880
 I speculate.

2:01:23.880 --> 2:01:26.120
 And by the way, the book's only three chapters out of 11 about the Nobel prize.

2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:27.560
 And it's, it's a fact.

2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:31.660
 But you know, one of the things that's been so interesting, like I'm speaking, actually

2:01:31.660 --> 2:01:36.320
 this coming up in December is that the Nobel prize is given out on the day of Alfred Nobel's

2:01:36.320 --> 2:01:37.320
 death.

2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:42.640
 There's a lot of and, and they bring in flowers, not from his birthplace, but from his mausoleum,

2:01:42.640 --> 2:01:47.320
 which is in San Romano, Romano in Italy.

2:01:47.320 --> 2:01:51.360
 It's a lot of like death fascination, you know, denial of death features heavily in the Nobel

2:01:51.360 --> 2:01:56.160
 prize because it's like what outlives a person? Well, science can outlive a person. My father has

2:01:56.160 --> 2:02:01.040
 a theorem named after him. It's still, you know, engraved in many places around the world.

2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:04.240
 You or I, we can go to different places around the world. People know who we are based on our

2:02:04.240 --> 2:02:08.880
 publications. We engrave things. We want to store things. We want to compress things. And I think

2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:12.640
 that's, there's something beautiful about that, but there is a notion of denial of death. Like,

2:02:12.640 --> 2:02:17.840
 there is a notion of what will outlast me, especially if you're among the many 90 something

2:02:17.840 --> 2:02:23.760
 percent of members of the National Academy. Don't believe in an active faith and a creator

2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:31.440
 and a God. And science can substitute for that, but it's not ultimately as fulfilling. I just,

2:02:31.440 --> 2:02:37.280
 I don't believe it can fulfill a person the way even practicing but not believing in a religion

2:02:37.280 --> 2:02:42.640
 can fulfill a person. So, which is interesting because you do bring up Ernest Becker and the

2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:50.320
 denial of death in losing the Nobel Prize book. And there is a sense in which that's probably in

2:02:50.320 --> 2:02:57.040
 part at the core of this, especially later dream of the Nobel Prize or a prize or recognition.

2:02:57.040 --> 2:03:03.680
 I've interacted with a few, you know, or a large number of scientists that are getting up in age.

2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:12.400
 And there is the feeling of a real pride of happiness in them from winning awards and getting

2:03:12.400 --> 2:03:18.000
 certain recognitions. And I probably at the core of that is a kind of a mortality or

2:03:20.400 --> 2:03:27.920
 a kind of desire for mortality. And that was always off putting to me as opposed to,

2:03:27.920 --> 2:03:36.880
 I mean, I know it sounds weird to say it's off putting, but it just, rather than celebrating

2:03:36.880 --> 2:03:46.880
 the pure joy of now solving the puzzles of the mysteries all around us, just the actual

2:03:49.760 --> 2:03:55.120
 exploration of the mysterious. For its own sake. For its own sake.

2:03:55.120 --> 2:03:59.280
 Yeah. Well, that's why I said, you know, it's like a scientist should, okay, you have to be

2:03:59.280 --> 2:04:04.560
 careful and not have any, you know, physical, it has to be platonic. But you can think of

2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:08.960
 scientists and mentor. I have a chart in the book and in my plaque made by one of my graduate

2:04:08.960 --> 2:04:13.760
 students, former graduate students, she's now a professor in New Mexico, Darcy Barron. And

2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:19.280
 she made this plaque and it has 17 generations. So, here I am, 17, you know, levels down. There's a

2:04:19.280 --> 2:04:24.800
 guy, Leibniz, not the famous Leibniz, different Leibniz, 1596 he was born. And I'm in this

2:04:24.800 --> 2:04:29.520
 chain. And I don't know if you know this, but in the Russian language, the word scientist

2:04:29.520 --> 2:04:33.760
 means someone who was taught. I'll say it very slowly. One who was taught, right?

2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:37.360
 Hachoni. Hachoni. So, it probably means the guy who was taught, right?

2:04:38.000 --> 2:04:42.480
 No. No, no, no, it's, it's, it's literally someone who was taught.

2:04:42.480 --> 2:04:43.760
 Someone who was taught, right? Yeah.

2:04:43.760 --> 2:04:47.760
 So, what does that mean? To me, it has a dual kind of meaning, at least dual meaning. One is

2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:51.840
 that you have to be a good student to be a scientist because you have to learn from somebody

2:04:51.840 --> 2:04:56.880
 else. Two, you have to be a teacher. You have to pay it forward. If you don't, I claim you're really

2:04:56.880 --> 2:05:02.160
 not a scientist in the truest sense. And I feel like with the work that I do and outreach and

2:05:02.160 --> 2:05:06.560
 stuff like that, I'm doing it at scale. I'm influencing more than the, you know, 24 kids

2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:10.240
 I might have in my graduate class or undergraduate class. And they're, you know, potentially could

2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:15.840
 reach thousands of people around the world and make them into scientists themselves.

2:05:15.840 --> 2:05:20.880
 Because that's the flywheel that is only beneficial. There is no competition. There's no zero

2:05:20.880 --> 2:05:27.680
 some fixed, fixed mindset versus growth mindset. Because it is an infinite game. Imagine a culture

2:05:27.680 --> 2:05:32.080
 that had none of the trappings of the negativity of the Soviet Union or pre World War One,

2:05:33.280 --> 2:05:39.360
 Germany or Imperial Japan, you know, science celebrated. And we're just making like a nation

2:05:39.360 --> 2:05:43.840
 of scientists and like, we're not doing it to become multi billionaires or necessarily, you know,

2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:49.120
 for any military purpose whatsoever. But if we had that, you know, sometimes I'm flying, you know,

2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:53.760
 home at night, like when you fly into LA, you literally, it's very rare. You can see like the

2:05:53.760 --> 2:05:58.080
 number 10 million, like it's very hard to like visualize things. You see a brick wall you ask,

2:05:58.080 --> 2:06:01.600
 how many bricks are there? It might be a thousand, two thousand, 10 million lights,

2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:05.920
 there's 10 million souls. And you can see in their discreet, they're not like the Milky Way

2:06:05.920 --> 2:06:12.560
 all blending together. Each loss in their own busy lives, excited, fall in love, afraid of losing

2:06:12.560 --> 2:06:17.600
 their job, all that. By the way, people should know that you're a pilot. So you literally mean fly.

2:06:17.600 --> 2:06:24.640
 Yeah, sometimes I get to do it. You get to look at the eye of God perspective on these 10 million,

2:06:24.640 --> 2:06:29.040
 on these millions of... And I don't think they're like constellations, but upside down,

2:06:29.040 --> 2:06:32.400
 like the city is like a constant. Hopefully, I'll stay to keep the plane the right way up.

2:06:32.400 --> 2:06:37.120
 But when you think about like, imagine they're all working together. And imagine like, you always

2:06:37.120 --> 2:06:41.920
 talk about love. But like, you don't know, you don't know that they're not where they have love.

2:06:41.920 --> 2:06:45.200
 Like, so you're looking down on them. And it's just amazing. Because you think like,

2:06:45.200 --> 2:06:51.920
 what amazing creation is man and humans? And what can we do? It's phenomenal. It's so exciting.

2:06:51.920 --> 2:06:55.920
 And then I get to do it. It's a job, I say, don't tell Gavin Newsom, but I do it for free.

2:06:56.560 --> 2:07:04.160
 I love what I do. But to think about like, oh, if my student succeeds, no, it's unfortunate

2:07:04.160 --> 2:07:08.240
 that you have experience that I've certainly experienced it. And I think there are ways

2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:14.880
 around it. I think it is a vexing problem because people want to... It's very tempting to keep your

2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:20.480
 own kind of garden fertilized. One thing that's interesting is like, people are like, why are

2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:24.400
 you doing this thing? And podcasts and you're supposed to be as serious scientists leading

2:07:24.400 --> 2:07:30.160
 this huge project and collaborators. And I'm like, well, most of what I do, as I said before,

2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:36.320
 it's for you, it's Velcro. For me, it's like, what is the deal with the safety standards on the

2:07:36.320 --> 2:07:39.840
 truck that we're driving up to deliver the diesel fuel that will power the generator that will allow

2:07:39.840 --> 2:07:44.160
 the concrete truck to... It has nothing to do with the Big Bang inflation, the multiverse.

2:07:44.160 --> 2:07:47.760
 God's existence has nothing to do with that. So those are people I say I have to talk to,

2:07:48.400 --> 2:07:52.240
 the people that come on the show, those are people I want to talk to. And that's super fun.

2:07:52.240 --> 2:07:57.440
 I mean, it's a real honor that I get to do it. I'm using... I have some unfair advantages, right?

2:07:57.440 --> 2:08:00.960
 I'm at a top university. We have people that's affiliated with the Arthur C. Clark Foundation,

2:08:02.080 --> 2:08:08.480
 brilliant scientists coming through. But I felt like it would be kind of a shame if I didn't allow

2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:15.040
 them to teach at scale because they're better teachers than I am. Let me ask you an interesting,

2:08:15.040 --> 2:08:22.320
 maybe difficult question. Have you ever considered talking on your podcast with the people who would

2:08:22.320 --> 2:08:28.480
 get the Nobel Prize for Bicep 2 if it turned out to be detecting what it is? Yeah. I mean,

2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:33.120
 I'm still friends with them and they have still gone on too. So we should say like,

2:08:33.120 --> 2:08:38.960
 why we didn't win the Nobel Prize and then what happened with the group that is now leading it

2:08:38.960 --> 2:08:45.760
 completely, that I'm completely divorced from in a secular sense. We're friends. We see each other.

2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:51.440
 We send each other emails and stuff like that. I would love to get their sense of what the natural

2:08:51.440 --> 2:08:56.400
 heartbreak built into the whole process of the Nobel Prize, what their sense is. I would love

2:08:56.400 --> 2:09:01.840
 to hear an honest, real conversation. I understand you're friends. There's some hard truth that

2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:05.200
 even friends will talk about it too. They weren't happy I wrote the book. I mean, I remember one of

2:09:05.200 --> 2:09:09.440
 them was like, well, what's this I hear about a book? I mean, a lot of people told me not to

2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:13.440
 write the book. They said it's going to give too much attention to the Nobel Prize. It's going to

2:09:13.440 --> 2:09:18.480
 look like sour grapes. Again, I say you can prove I have sour grapes or not. Just give me the next

2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:23.440
 prize. So you would, if you get a Nobel Prize for Literature, you would turn it down? I don't know.

2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:30.080
 It's funny because Sabina Hasenfelder, who is a fellow kind of YouTube sensation and

2:09:30.080 --> 2:09:33.120
 an issue in for the Nobel Peace Prize.

2:09:33.120 --> 2:09:39.440
 You're right. She's so gracious and so good. She has that German, just gentleness.

2:09:40.160 --> 2:09:42.960
 She's a little too nice for my taste, I would say.

2:09:42.960 --> 2:09:47.280
 I wish she could really say what she thinks and be snarky on occasion. So she wrote a review of

2:09:47.280 --> 2:09:53.440
 my book when it came out three or four years ago and she said, well, Brian Keating, she said,

2:09:53.440 --> 2:09:59.280
 well, it's good. It's interesting. He talks about cosmology, but they can do whatever the hell

2:09:59.280 --> 2:10:04.080
 they want and he presumably has these problems with it, but it's none of his business, basically.

2:10:05.680 --> 2:10:10.160
 And at the end, she said, but if you want one good thing, he's a really good writer and who

2:10:10.160 --> 2:10:13.680
 knows? He could win the Nobel Prize in Literature someday. I said, and then she allowed me to

2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:18.160
 publish a rebuttal on her blog, which was kind of funny. But anyway, no. So getting back to the

2:10:18.160 --> 2:10:25.360
 guys that we were kind of collaboratemies or frenemies and, look, we don't wish each other

2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:30.320
 active ill. I've visited them. They're welcome to visit me. They have visited me. The thing I have

2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:37.680
 to say is that I just wonder about introspection. Like for me, literally, I don't care about the

2:10:37.680 --> 2:10:43.680
 Nobel Prize other than what it can do to benefit science. But I no longer, I did, but by the way,

2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:48.000
 I did seriously care about how I benefit Brian Keating early on in my career. I'm just totally

2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:52.960
 honest. I'm not proud of it. It's kind of embarrassing. But now I would hope that people

2:10:52.960 --> 2:10:58.400
 would say like, okay, the guy is like, he's obsessed with it. My next book is not about this.

2:10:58.400 --> 2:11:05.120
 It's about something completely different. And I do feel like people lack introspection

2:11:05.120 --> 2:11:08.560
 a lot of times in science. We don't think about why we're doing what we're doing.

2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:15.280
 And I think it comes down to curiosity. One thing about Joe, and again, I've only listened to like,

2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:18.800
 I have to confess, you're like my father. Now I'm confessing my sins to you,

2:11:18.800 --> 2:11:25.040
 Father Lex, Father Friedman. I haven't listened to like that many of your episodes start to finish,

2:11:25.040 --> 2:11:28.640
 okay? I'm with our friend, a mutual friend, Eric, I've listened to a bunch of recent ones.

2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:34.400
 Einstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, Weinstein, that's what it is.

2:11:35.440 --> 2:11:39.120
 I get confused with the brother. The brother's car amounts up,

2:11:39.120 --> 2:11:43.840
 the brother's wines, and a few others. I haven't ever listened to a full Joe Rogan episode.

2:11:43.840 --> 2:11:49.120
 But from what I've seen with him, he has a preternatural curiosity. He doesn't have passion.

2:11:49.120 --> 2:11:53.360
 There are a lot of podcasts about passion, like I've been on their show. He has curiosity, like

2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:57.120
 he's not going to stop talking about something until he hops it, until he understands it,

2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:02.240
 until he gets it viscerally. And I respect that because as I say in this more recent book,

2:12:02.800 --> 2:12:07.120
 passions like kind of like the dopamine hit that gets you started, like, oh, I'm going to be great.

2:12:07.120 --> 2:12:11.440
 I'm going to maybe I could win a Nobel Prize. Like that's not going to sustain you. The sustenance

2:12:11.440 --> 2:12:17.520
 comes from the passion converting to curiosity. And what I want to do is convert as many things

2:12:17.520 --> 2:12:23.120
 as possible to things that I can then, because actually I've had on people that discuss addiction.

2:12:23.840 --> 2:12:28.800
 And there is an addictive quality to doing podcasts or whatever, but there's an addictive

2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:33.920
 quality being a scientist. And you get to do things that are very specialized and specialized

2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:39.360
 locations with special people paid for by other people have no frickin idea what you do. I mean,

2:12:39.360 --> 2:12:44.400
 imagine you worked in some like some job and you know, Feynman said he said all these contradictory

2:12:44.400 --> 2:12:49.280
 things like when he was he was once said like, he said, if you can't explain it to your grandmother,

2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:52.640
 you don't understand it yourself. Then the day you won the Nobel Prize, a reporter asked him,

2:12:52.640 --> 2:12:55.840
 what did you win it for? He said, if I could explain it to you, bud, it wouldn't be worth a

2:12:55.840 --> 2:13:00.640
 Nobel Prize. So let's let's leave aside his inherent contradictions. But but in reality,

2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:06.000
 there is a kind of like dopamine rush that you get from it. But but you know, what is ultimately

2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:12.080
 going to be the sustenance of it? So yeah, I do feel like we have to find a way to to nucleate

2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:16.320
 that. I don't know. Actually, I don't know if it's if it's like, can you can you turn someone

2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:21.520
 into a I used to ask this question all the time? Like, can you make someone creative? Like, can

2:13:21.520 --> 2:13:26.800
 you teach someone to be creative? I don't know. Can you teach someone to be curious? I don't know.

2:13:26.800 --> 2:13:31.280
 I do know that kids are naturally curious. As they get older, they get less curious,

2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:37.840
 just like I heard from the other forward authors, James Altucher, he said once he did a study,

2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:44.080
 kids smile 300 times a day or smile or laugh adults five or six, five or six. No, I'm trying to get

2:13:44.080 --> 2:13:49.360
 you to laugh, but anyway, no, it's true. So somewhere he lose 30, you know, to 50%. I'm not

2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:54.240
 entertained. But that's because I'm an adult. No. And then I do remember there's some some

2:13:54.240 --> 2:13:58.720
 distribution on those studies with a happier adult smile a little more, but still the kids

2:13:58.720 --> 2:14:02.400
 blow them out of the water. Just crushing. So can you is it or should in other words,

2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:08.800
 should we invest our energy in getting the half life decay constant stretched out more for curiosity

2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:13.840
 for kids? Or should we try to reset the dopamine hit? And then, you know, I don't know. It's an

2:14:13.840 --> 2:14:19.120
 open course. Well, I think it goes to David Foster Wallace, the key to life is to be unboreable.

2:14:19.120 --> 2:14:25.600
 I think I think you could train this kind of thing, which is in every single situation. So like,

2:14:25.600 --> 2:14:32.160
 which I think is at the core, at least this correlated with curiosity is in every situation,

2:14:33.680 --> 2:14:40.000
 try to find the exciting, the fascinating, like in every situation, you sitting at the,

2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:45.600
 I don't know, waiting for something at a DMV or something like that, find something that excites

2:14:45.600 --> 2:14:53.440
 you like a thought, like watch people or start to think about, well, I wonder how many people

2:14:53.440 --> 2:14:58.960
 have to go to the DMV every day. And they try to go into the the pothead mode of thinking like,

2:14:59.600 --> 2:15:05.360
 wow, isn't this weird that there's a bunch of people that are having to get a stamp of approval

2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:09.440
 from the government to drive their cars. And then there's millions of cars driving every day.

2:15:09.440 --> 2:15:13.760
 How can I do this better? Maybe some blockchain and they could like VIN transfer. Yeah, exactly.

2:15:13.760 --> 2:15:19.200
 Yeah. No, that is a good. And then every situation, I think if you rigorously like,

2:15:19.200 --> 2:15:24.880
 just practice that at a young age, I think you can learn to do that because like sometimes people

2:15:24.880 --> 2:15:31.280
 like ask me for advice and like to do this thing or that thing is, I think you at the core really

2:15:31.280 --> 2:15:38.000
 have to have this muscle of finding the awesomeness in everything because if you're able to find the

2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:42.320
 awesomeness in everything, like whatever journey you take, whatever, whatever weird

2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:50.480
 man that you take through life is going to be productive is going to end up in a great place.

2:15:50.480 --> 2:15:56.720
 So like that muscle is at the core of it. And I guess curiosity is central to that.

2:15:58.240 --> 2:16:06.000
 But you didn't win the Nobel Prize. The team of bicep that led the bicep to didn't win the

2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:15.200
 Nobel Prize because of some space dust. That's right. Kick schmutz. Which one is the moon?

2:16:15.200 --> 2:16:18.640
 Which one is? That one's the dust. Space dust, yeah.

2:16:20.480 --> 2:16:25.760
 What are we looking at? So why is space dust the villain of this whole story?

2:16:25.760 --> 2:16:29.200
 Well, it's funny, you know, I wrote these books and I don't know about you, but when you get all

2:16:29.200 --> 2:16:32.320
 these books, I'm sure you get books and people send you books. They always come in these dust

2:16:32.320 --> 2:16:37.040
 jackets, right? I was like, what the hell is a dust jacket? Like how much dust is raining down at

2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:42.720
 any moment? I mean, this is immaculate. This room is Russian tidiness, but in a normal household,

2:16:42.720 --> 2:16:48.560
 how much dust is raining down? It's not really until I wrote a book. And I realized, you know,

2:16:48.560 --> 2:16:53.040
 I'm writing a story about the origin of the universe, then the prologue, you know, to the

2:16:53.040 --> 2:16:59.520
 cosmos, and dust is going to cover this story. It's actually more a story about

2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:04.880
 astrophysics and cosmology than dust. And this is the link between the cosmological and the

2:17:04.880 --> 2:17:09.920
 astrophysical. So what does that mean? So astrophysics is broadly speaking, the study of physical

2:17:09.920 --> 2:17:15.760
 phenomena manifest in the heavens, astronomical phenomena. Cosmology is concerned with the origin,

2:17:15.760 --> 2:17:19.680
 evolution, composition of the universe as a whole, but it's not really concerned with stars,

2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:24.560
 galaxies, and planets per se, other than how they might help us measure the Hubble constant,

2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:30.880
 the density of the universe, the neutrino content, etc. So we tend to have a tendency to kind of

2:17:30.880 --> 2:17:35.280
 look a little bit, you know, they're like, not all astronomers and astrophysicists are equal,

2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:38.400
 they're all equal, but some are more equal than others. So we have kind of a prejudice,

2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:42.240
 a little swagger, right? And cosmologists are studying, you know, we're using Einstein,

2:17:42.240 --> 2:17:46.080
 we're not using like, you know, Boltzmann, we're thinking of the biggest possible pictures.

2:17:46.720 --> 2:17:53.520
 In so doing, you can actually become blinded to otherwise obvious effects that people,

2:17:53.520 --> 2:17:58.480
 you know, would have not overlooked. In our case, when we sought out the signal,

2:17:58.480 --> 2:18:03.600
 we were using the photons that make up this primordial heat bath that surrounds the universe,

2:18:03.600 --> 2:18:08.640
 luckily only at three degrees Kelvin approximately, we're using those as a type of film onto which

2:18:08.640 --> 2:18:14.000
 gravitational waves will reverberate it, make them oscillate preferentially in a polarized way,

2:18:14.000 --> 2:18:19.520
 and then we can use our polarized sunglasses, but in a microwave format to detect the characteristic

2:18:19.520 --> 2:18:24.000
 twofold symmetry pattern of under rotation. That's the technical way that we undergo,

2:18:24.000 --> 2:18:29.040
 I mean, there's a lot more to it. But there are more than one thing that can mimic exactly that

2:18:29.040 --> 2:18:34.080
 signal. First of all, when you look at the signal, the signal, if inflation took place, big if,

2:18:34.080 --> 2:18:41.680
 but if it took place, the signal would be about one or two parts per billion of the CMB temperature

2:18:41.680 --> 2:18:49.040
 itself. So a few nano Kelvin, the CMB is a few Kelvin, the signal from these B modes would be a

2:18:49.040 --> 2:18:55.280
 few nano Kelvin. It's astonishing to think, Penzies and Wilson in 1965 measured something

2:18:55.280 --> 2:19:00.800
 that's a billion times brighter. And that was what 60 years ago, let's call it 60 years ago,

2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:05.200
 since they discovered it. Moore's Law, you're more expert on this, call it every two years.

2:19:05.760 --> 2:19:10.560
 So you're talking about like two to the 30th power, doubling or something like that at that.

2:19:10.560 --> 2:19:15.920
 Let's call it two to the 20th, something like that. So that's like only two to the 10th as a

2:19:15.920 --> 2:19:21.920
 thousand, correct my math, I'm wrong. Two to the 20th is a million, two to the 30th is a billion.

2:19:21.920 --> 2:19:28.080
 So we're outpacing Moore's Law in terms of the sensitivity of our instruments to detect these

2:19:28.080 --> 2:19:33.840
 feeble signals from the cosmos. And they don't have to deal with, on the semiconductor factory

2:19:33.840 --> 2:19:38.640
 in Santa Clara, California, they don't have to deal with meteorites and things like coming into

2:19:38.640 --> 2:19:42.960
 the laboratory. It's a clean room, it's pristine, they can control everything about it. We can't

2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:48.400
 control the cosmos. And the cosmos is literally littered with particles of schmutz, of failed

2:19:48.400 --> 2:19:55.440
 planets, asteroids, meteoroids, things that didn't coalesce to make either the Earth, the moon,

2:19:55.440 --> 2:20:00.880
 the planet Jupiter or its moons or get sucked into them and make craters on them, etc., etc.

2:20:00.880 --> 2:20:05.440
 The rest of it is falling and it comes in a power spectrum. There's very few, thank God,

2:20:05.440 --> 2:20:10.880
 chicks of love size, impact or progenitors that will take out all life on Earth.

2:20:10.880 --> 2:20:16.800
 But there's extremely large number of tiny dust particles and microscopic grains and then there's

2:20:16.800 --> 2:20:23.840
 a fair number of intermediate sized particles. It turns out this little guy here is the end

2:20:23.840 --> 2:20:29.440
 product of a collapsing star that explodes in what's called the supernova, type 2 supernova.

2:20:30.000 --> 2:20:37.440
 So stars spend most of their life using helium nuclei protons and neutrons into helium

2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:43.120
 nuclei. And then from there it can make other things like beryllium and briefly make beryllium

2:20:43.120 --> 2:20:47.840
 and carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, all the way up until it tries to make iron and nickel.

2:20:48.560 --> 2:20:53.520
 Iron and nickel are endothermic. It takes more energy than gets liberated to make

2:20:53.520 --> 2:20:59.920
 an atom of iron. When that happens, there's no longer enough heat supplying pressure to resist

2:20:59.920 --> 2:21:03.520
 the gravitational collapse of the material that was produced earlier. So the star form

2:21:03.520 --> 2:21:08.400
 is going to go inside out. That's how scientists discovered helium was discovered on the sun.

2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:12.160
 I don't know, did you know? That's why it's called helium. Yeah, they went there at night and

2:21:13.120 --> 2:21:13.920
 Oh, well done.

2:21:13.920 --> 2:21:17.600
 They went there at night. No, helium means heliosis, the god of the sun. It was discovered in its

2:21:17.600 --> 2:21:22.400
 spectrum from observations of the telescope like 150 years ago. It wasn't discovered like when

2:21:22.400 --> 2:21:28.320
 oxygen and iron was discovered. So it's only a relatively recent comer to the pure activity.

2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:30.960
 The helium came after oxygen.

2:21:30.960 --> 2:21:34.800
 Oh, no, first hydrogen forms into helium. So that's the first thing that formed.

2:21:34.800 --> 2:21:36.160
 No, in terms of discoveries.

2:21:36.160 --> 2:21:42.720
 Oh, yeah, after oxygen. Yeah, I think priestly and others, the Dalton discovered it in the 1700s.

2:21:42.720 --> 2:21:46.080
 No, helium was really only discovered from the spectrum of looking at the sun and seeing

2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:50.480
 the weird atomic absorption and Fraunhofer lines in the solar spectrum.

2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:55.760
 When it tries to make iron, there's no longer any leftover heat. In other words,

2:21:55.760 --> 2:22:01.760
 there's heat left over from fusing, as you know, the sun of a plasma physicist. He fused to hydrogen

2:22:01.760 --> 2:22:06.320
 nuclei, you get excess energy plus you get helium. So that's why fusion energy could be the energy

2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:11.200
 source of the future and always will be. Hopefully, it'll come much sooner than that.

2:22:11.200 --> 2:22:14.960
 And so doing trying to make iron, it takes more energy, doesn't give off enough energy,

2:22:14.960 --> 2:22:20.080
 star collapses, explodes. And what does it spray out into the cosmic interstellar medium?

2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:24.400
 It sprays out the last thing it made, which is that stuff. Luckily for us, because some of that

2:22:24.400 --> 2:22:29.680
 coalesced and made the core of the earth onto which the lighter like silica and carbon and the

2:22:29.680 --> 2:22:33.440
 dirt and the crust of the earth were formed. And some of that made its way to the crust,

2:22:33.440 --> 2:22:38.640
 the iron, made its way to the crust. Some of that, your mother ate and synthesized hemoglobin

2:22:38.640 --> 2:22:43.600
 molecules. And hemoglobin has iron particles in it. It's a quite amazing substance. Without it,

2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:46.560
 we wouldn't have our red blood. We wouldn't exist as we are.

2:22:47.200 --> 2:22:49.520
 Is this a very long complicated mom joke?

2:22:49.520 --> 2:22:55.120
 I've done enough dad jokes. My quote is up. So I'm taking this object,

2:22:56.160 --> 2:23:00.880
 seriously, not all of it gets bound up in a planet. In fact, forming planets is very inefficient.

2:23:01.680 --> 2:23:04.800
 And so there's a lot of schmutz left over, some of which gets in the way

2:23:05.440 --> 2:23:10.240
 of our telescopes looking back to the beginning of time. And some of those molecules like iron

2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:16.160
 is used in compass needles. They're magnetized. And magnetic fields in our galaxy can align them

2:23:16.160 --> 2:23:21.120
 and make the exact polarization pattern that we're looking for. As if the compass needles get all

2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:26.080
 aligned, that's like the polarization of the dust grain. It's like that polarizing filter.

2:23:26.080 --> 2:23:29.920
 That means light polarized like this will get absorbed. And light polarized like this will

2:23:29.920 --> 2:23:34.720
 go through. So it's absorbing, it's making 100% polarized light out of an initially unpolarized

2:23:34.720 --> 2:23:41.440
 light source. And that's what happened. And what we ended up claiming on March 17th,

2:23:41.440 --> 2:23:46.640
 and I'm sure if you were there, you might remember this, at the Harvard Center for Astrophysics,

2:23:46.640 --> 2:23:50.160
 there was an announcement. There were like three or four Nobel Prize winners in the audience.

2:23:50.160 --> 2:23:54.960
 And the bicep two team, which I was no longer leading, I was still a member of it. In fact,

2:23:54.960 --> 2:23:59.360
 in the announcement, the first person they mentioned, besides, you know, thank you all for

2:23:59.360 --> 2:24:03.600
 being here as me and my team at UC San Diego, although I wasn't invited to go to the press

2:24:03.600 --> 2:24:10.240
 conference because that Harvard complicated. Yes, exactly. It's a little school up there in

2:24:10.240 --> 2:24:16.240
 the Cambridge area. And so they ended up making this announcement that we had discovered the

2:24:16.240 --> 2:24:21.840
 aftershocks of inflation. We detected the gravitational waves, shaking up the CMB. And on

2:24:21.840 --> 2:24:26.320
 that day, past Lex Friedman podcast, back when it was called artificial intelligence,

2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:32.560
 Max Tagmark said, Goodbye, Universe, Hello, Multiverse, and Hello, Nobel Prize. See, he saw

2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:37.360
 that as confirmatory evidence, not only of inflation, not only of gravitational waves,

2:24:37.360 --> 2:24:44.240
 but of the multiverse, Goodbye, Universe, Hello, Multiverse. Multiverse is a natural consequence

2:24:44.240 --> 2:24:48.560
 consequence of inflation. Yes, according to its prominent, you know, supporters. Yeah.

2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:56.480
 Yeah. And of course, leave the poetry to Max, which he does masterfully. Okay. So that the

2:24:56.480 --> 2:25:03.280
 excitement was there. I mean, maybe the initial heartbreak for you is there too. That's that's

2:25:03.280 --> 2:25:08.000
 some of the darker moments you're going through. But broadly for the space of science, there's

2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:13.200
 excitement there. Huge excitement. And I often note that this is a problem in what I call, you

2:25:13.200 --> 2:25:18.320
 know, the science media complex, because oftentimes you'll see things like past guest air seeker,

2:25:19.520 --> 2:25:23.680
 Venus life, you know, exists. And that will be really, I mean, it's fascinating, right? And

2:25:23.680 --> 2:25:28.080
 with the work that she's doing, or her colleagues are doing, Clara, who's on your show as well.

2:25:28.080 --> 2:25:34.240
 And that will be on front page, New York Times, Boston Globe, San Diego Union Tribune, and it'll

2:25:34.240 --> 2:25:39.120
 be above the fold, make headlines around the world. And then six months, 12 months later, as

2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:45.120
 is the case for us, retraction, page C17 of the Saturday edition that nobody reads, you know,

2:25:45.120 --> 2:25:51.200
 and underneath the personal. So we have a problem in science that the, you know, if it if it if it

2:25:51.200 --> 2:25:56.720
 explodes, it leads, you know, and we get this huge fanfare. And this is not unique to my experiment.

2:25:56.720 --> 2:26:02.800
 This happened with the earlier discovery of so called Martian life of discovered in Antarctica,

2:26:03.840 --> 2:26:07.840
 which was announced after peer review. We weren't peer reviewed at the point when we made

2:26:07.840 --> 2:26:11.680
 the announcement, we had a press conference and there are other reasons that the team leaders

2:26:11.680 --> 2:26:15.760
 felt it was important to do that so that we don't get scooped by a referee who's unethical.

2:26:15.760 --> 2:26:18.160
 We thought we had done everything right, but that's confirmation by

2:26:18.160 --> 2:26:23.280
 There's like levels to this. And there were people, you know, me,

2:26:23.280 --> 2:26:27.600
 warning about how it would be interpreted and wanting to also make sure that we put all the

2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:31.840
 data out, including the maps, which we still haven't released. And so there were a lot of

2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:37.280
 reasons to be skeptical, but the audience, the, the public never knows this. I think it's,

2:26:37.280 --> 2:26:41.920
 so I've made a rule that if I am ever in charge of, you know, doling out large amounts of science

2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:46.560
 funding, that when you should keep kind of an option, in other words, you should have money

2:26:46.560 --> 2:26:52.640
 for publicity, fine, have money for your press conference, but hold in reserve in a bond to

2:26:52.640 --> 2:26:58.800
 be used, hopefully never. But if it's to be used, an equal fund for the retraction, if it should

2:26:58.800 --> 2:27:04.240
 occur. So you would like to see, because that's a big part of transparency is the, is the,

2:27:06.000 --> 2:27:11.280
 to me, in the space of science, at least, that's as beautiful because it reveals

2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:18.240
 the, it's like, it's, uh, it does a great story. There's a, there's an excitement. There's, um,

2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:23.280
 humanity. There, so there's a climax to the triumph, but there's also a climax to the,

2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:29.440
 like the disappointment at the end, because that also eventually leads to triumph again.

2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:33.280
 That sets up, that's the drama that sets up the triumph. Like with Andrew Wiles,

2:27:33.280 --> 2:27:39.120
 for me, Fermat's last, uh, Fermat's theorem, I guess it's not last name, whatever, the,

2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.560
 is like the ups and downs of that, the roller coaster, the whole thing should be documented.

2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:48.960
 That is science. That is science. And when we don't do that, then we cultivate this aura

2:27:48.960 --> 2:27:54.320
 that excludes other scientists, often from minorities or women, that you have to be Einstein,

2:27:54.320 --> 2:27:58.480
 like Einstein came out of the womb and he was just like this guy with like curly, no, he wasn't.

2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:02.720
 He was, he wasn't bad at math. That was all, that's all nonsense. But he said that he,

2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:06.800
 you know what he said? He attributed his success to Alex. He said, I never asked my dad

2:28:07.520 --> 2:28:13.280
 what happened when I ran alongside a light beam as a kid. And thank God I didn't, because had I,

2:28:13.280 --> 2:28:18.240
 he would have told me the best answer of the day, which by the way, you know, he would create 20

2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:24.880
 years later as a 26 year old in the patent office, obviously in Switzerland. And in so doing, by delaying

2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:30.160
 when he asked these questions, he said, I approached it with the intellect of a mature scientist,

2:28:30.160 --> 2:28:35.680
 not a little kid. And I wouldn't have accepted the same explanation. So sometimes assuming that

2:28:35.680 --> 2:28:41.040
 scientists are infallible, inevitable, omniscient, you know, being, I think that really does a

2:28:41.040 --> 2:28:44.320
 disturbance. And Jim Gates said, you know, he's like, Einstein wasn't always Einstein.

2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:49.200
 And we cultivate this mystery and allure at our peril because we're humans,

2:28:49.200 --> 2:28:53.360
 until we have artificial Einstein, which I don't think will ever exist.

2:28:54.080 --> 2:29:00.560
 You've launched the assayer project where you hope to assess theories of everything with

2:29:00.560 --> 2:29:05.120
 experiments. You have a YouTube video where you're announcing that. That's, it looks super cool.

2:29:06.160 --> 2:29:10.400
 Can you describe this project? And you also mentioned kind of, you give a shout out to

2:29:10.400 --> 2:29:16.400
 little known fellow by the name of Galileo Galilei as an inspiration to this project.

2:29:17.040 --> 2:29:23.600
 Yeah. So Galileo is kind of my avatar, my hero, kind of all around scientists that I would love to

2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:30.400
 approach the, you know, logarithm of Galileo. He was not only a phenomenal scientist,

2:29:30.960 --> 2:29:37.600
 he was an incredible artist, a writer, a poet, a philosopher. And back then they didn't have

2:29:37.600 --> 2:29:41.120
 distinctions between, you know, scientists and, you know, it was like a physician, was like a

2:29:41.120 --> 2:29:47.600
 physicist. And he would indulge, you know, kind of these really intellectual flights of fancy,

2:29:48.160 --> 2:29:54.400
 thinking about phenomena, such as the Earth's tides or the, you know, the composition of the

2:29:54.400 --> 2:30:00.400
 Milky Way. And what's interesting about Galileo is that he was almost as wrong often as he was

2:30:00.400 --> 2:30:06.640
 right. And Galileo was not alone like this. I always say like Einstein had at least seven

2:30:06.640 --> 2:30:11.440
 Nobel Prizes that he could have won for discoveries that later became true. But he also had seven,

2:30:12.000 --> 2:30:15.840
 you know, huge, you know, impossible to believe blunders in some sense.

2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:20.880
 It's too bad because he could have had a good career, as I would say. And Galileo was like that

2:30:20.880 --> 2:30:27.120
 too. In other words, he would fall victim to, I think, this confirmation bias that all scientists

2:30:27.120 --> 2:30:31.920
 have to guard their lives against, their careers, their brands, their reputations against,

2:30:31.920 --> 2:30:36.480
 which is the exclusion of evidence that doesn't conform to what you're trying to prove

2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:42.080
 for one reason or another, or the radical acceptance of things that do comport with it

2:30:42.080 --> 2:30:46.160
 in order to bolster your confidence. And both are equally intoxicating. It's, you know,

2:30:46.880 --> 2:30:52.960
 confirmation bias is a hell of a drug because it really reinforces this notion,

2:30:52.960 --> 2:30:57.360
 which is partially sunk cost. You've put so much time, effort, money, reputation into it.

2:30:57.360 --> 2:31:04.240
 You don't want to be wrong and go back on it. And with Galileo, he would be incredibly perceptive

2:31:04.240 --> 2:31:10.960
 about things such as, you know, the Earth being not located at the center of the solar system,

2:31:10.960 --> 2:31:17.520
 and the Sun being the center, so called Copernican hypothesis. And he would use as evidence very,

2:31:17.520 --> 2:31:22.240
 very interesting ideas that all of which were wrong, basically. And in fact, we weren't able

2:31:22.240 --> 2:31:27.600
 to prove that the Earth orbited around the Sun. And I ask you, like, can you prove the Earth is

2:31:27.600 --> 2:31:31.840
 not flat? No, well, you're a flat Earth or anyway. But, but, but it's, I asked my...

2:31:31.840 --> 2:31:38.800
 Proud, flat Earth society member, t shirts coming out soon, lexstreaming.com, merch,

2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:42.880
 last merch. But it's actually not trivial to do that. But most of my students,

2:31:42.880 --> 2:31:46.000
 graduate students can prove that the Earth is rounder. Explain how the Earth...

2:31:46.000 --> 2:31:48.960
 It is actually not trivial to do, though. It's not. Yeah.

2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:52.640
 And much harder is to prove that the Earth goes around the Sun. In fact, that's extremely hard

2:31:52.640 --> 2:31:57.120
 to prove. And almost none of my students, even after they get their PhD and the final exam,

2:31:57.120 --> 2:31:59.920
 I kind of like to just, you know, give them a little bit of humility. Because I think they'd

2:31:59.920 --> 2:32:03.920
 be a good scientist. You need to be humble. You need to have a little humility. And you need to

2:32:03.920 --> 2:32:08.080
 have swagger. You need to feel like a little cocky. Like, I can do this. I can do this thing

2:32:08.080 --> 2:32:12.320
 that Einstein, by definition, couldn't do. I'm going to attempt it. I'm going to attempt to do

2:32:12.320 --> 2:32:18.320
 what was impossible just a generation ago. How do you prove that the Earth goes around the Sun?

2:32:19.920 --> 2:32:23.520
 Is it by the motion of other planets? So there are many ways to do it. I mean,

2:32:23.520 --> 2:32:28.400
 obviously, you could take a spaceship, park it at the North celestial pole of our solar system and

2:32:28.400 --> 2:32:32.720
 just watch what happens. But obviously, that wasn't how it was discovered in the late 1700s.

2:32:32.720 --> 2:32:38.880
 So it's called aberration. So if you look at stars as the Earth orbits around the Sun,

2:32:39.440 --> 2:32:43.520
 the position of the stars will shift slightly because of the tilt of the Earth and because

2:32:43.520 --> 2:32:48.320
 the Earth is in motion around the Earth and around the Sun. And because the Earth has a non

2:32:48.320 --> 2:32:52.960
 trivial amount of velocity compared to the speed of light in its orbit around the Sun,

2:32:53.520 --> 2:32:57.440
 the stars will trace out little tiny ellipses and those will correspond to the fact that

2:32:57.440 --> 2:33:01.760
 we're moving around. If they're at infinite distance, which we assume that they are, they're not

2:33:01.760 --> 2:33:05.120
 really. But for all intents and purposes and the scale of the solar system, they're infinitely

2:33:05.120 --> 2:33:10.400
 far away. So that's called stellar aberration. And that was the first way it was discovered.

2:33:10.400 --> 2:33:14.000
 And actually, we still use that. We have to correct for that effect when we measure

2:33:14.000 --> 2:33:18.560
 the cosmic microwave background. Because imagine you're inside of an oven. It has some

2:33:18.560 --> 2:33:22.720
 temperature three Kelvin and a thousand Kelvin whenever. If you're moving towards you, the

2:33:22.720 --> 2:33:26.720
 photons that are coming to me in that direction will be blue shifted hotter. And the ones behind

2:33:26.720 --> 2:33:31.440
 me will be redshifted. I'll artificially impute a greater or lesser amount of matter

2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:35.520
 or energy where you are and then extension of the Doppler effect. So we actually

2:33:35.520 --> 2:33:38.800
 make use of that and construct what's called like a local standard of rest.

2:33:39.440 --> 2:33:44.320
 Anyway, so you can do it. But Galileo said, no, no, no, I'm not going to wait for that. I have other

2:33:44.320 --> 2:33:50.000
 proofs for it. One of which is that the Earth has tides and the tides come in and out twice a day,

2:33:50.000 --> 2:33:55.600
 high tide and low tide. And it's he made the analogy of because the Earth is moving around

2:33:55.600 --> 2:34:00.000
 the sun, say this is the sun here, and it's moving around the sun, but it's also rotating on its

2:34:00.000 --> 2:34:05.360
 axis. See how the water is sloshing up and down inside the vodka bottle. As that happens, he

2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:09.360
 said that's what the tides are caused by. Totally wrong. Most people listen to this podcast. Just

2:34:10.640 --> 2:34:14.720
 so you know, if you're listening to this, he actually has a bottle of vodka in his hand.

2:34:14.720 --> 2:34:22.000
 Half drunk. And we're both drunk and whatever else is possible. So as it sloshed around,

2:34:22.000 --> 2:34:27.520
 he claimed that was what now has nothing to do with that. The moon over there, the moon pulls

2:34:27.520 --> 2:34:32.960
 differentially on the Earth and the Earth's ocean. That causes the oceans to bulge slightly

2:34:32.960 --> 2:34:37.280
 towards and away from where the moon is. And the moon is actually the source of the Earth's tides.

2:34:37.280 --> 2:34:42.320
 It has nothing to do with Copernicus, the orbit of the center. So he was totally wrong about that.

2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:47.120
 He also thought that the Milky Way was comprised only of stars when we know it's made of gas,

2:34:47.120 --> 2:34:52.720
 dust, nebulae, and things like that. So he had a fair share of blunders. Now, one thing I always

2:34:52.720 --> 2:34:58.720
 kind of make note of, and I'm actually producing along with Jim Gates, Fabiola Gianatti, Frank

2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:06.080
 Wilczek, and Carlo Revelli and my friend, Lucio Picharillo, the first ever audiobook of one of

2:35:06.080 --> 2:35:10.560
 Galileo's Dialogue, the one where he claimed to find evidence for the orbit of the Earth around

2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:16.320
 the Sun. But it was an error. So you're reading parts of this text. Yeah. It's a brilliant book.

2:35:16.320 --> 2:35:21.440
 So this book was written in 1632. It was written and it was the one that caused him to go into

2:35:21.440 --> 2:35:28.000
 house arrest and almost threatened to be tortured. And that book laid out his arguments for what was

2:35:28.000 --> 2:35:36.000
 called the Copernican or the nonparapetetic Aristotelian, et cetera, notion of the planetary

2:35:36.000 --> 2:35:42.320
 dynamic. And eventually he was forced to recant that he believed in it and allegedly he said he

2:35:42.320 --> 2:35:46.560
 still believes the Earth moves. Anyway, so it's written in the form of a trilog. It's actually

2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:52.560
 called the Dialogue with three people. There's one named Salviati, who is espousing Galileo's

2:35:52.560 --> 2:35:58.080
 notions about how the heavens were orchestrated. And Salviati means like the salvation, the savior.

2:35:58.080 --> 2:36:02.800
 Then there's a middleman, Segredo. So Carlo Revelli is playing Salviati, a brilliant one.

2:36:04.000 --> 2:36:09.280
 I am playing Segredo, who's like an intelligent interlocutor. I'm kind of just,

2:36:09.280 --> 2:36:14.080
 I can appreciate Aristotle. I can appreciate Copernicus. Then there's this guy, Simpliccio,

2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:19.440
 the simpleton. And he espouses the words of the pope. So you can imagine like, you know,

2:36:19.440 --> 2:36:25.040
 you're working in the Putin's government or you're working in whatever. And all of a sudden,

2:36:25.040 --> 2:36:30.240
 you're kind of putting the words of like the fool, literally calling the fool, but you're using the

2:36:30.240 --> 2:36:34.560
 words of the all supreme powerful being on Earth at that time as the Vatican Church,

2:36:34.560 --> 2:36:39.840
 especially for an Italian like Galileo. So he wasn't as brilliant, you know, politically

2:36:40.880 --> 2:36:43.840
 as he was astrophysically and otherwise.

2:36:43.840 --> 2:36:46.320
 Who's doing Simpliccio?

2:36:46.320 --> 2:36:51.600
 Simpliccio is a friend of mine in University of Manchester named Lucio Picciarillo. He's

2:36:51.600 --> 2:36:57.600
 an Irish guy, but he has a full blooded Italian. They all speak English and Italian. I only speak

2:36:58.400 --> 2:37:02.640
 and the forwards are written by, so one forward and this place has three forwards,

2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:09.920
 which is like a 12 word. Okay, the four words are written for me. Yeah, that was a good one.

2:37:09.920 --> 2:37:16.400
 The forward three forward. One of them is written by Albert Einstein, in which he says Galileo

2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:20.800
 was not only one of the greatest scientists in history. This is Einstein telling Galileo,

2:37:21.520 --> 2:37:27.600
 but he was one of the greatest writers and minds of all of human history. That forward is read

2:37:27.600 --> 2:37:32.880
 by Frank Wilczak, who you've had. Jim Gates, who you've also had. He reads the translation,

2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:40.800
 the translator, Stelman Drake is a renowned scientific translator. And then Fabiola Gianotti,

2:37:40.800 --> 2:37:48.160
 she reads the introduction and dedication from Galileo to the Duke of Tuscany and some of the

2:37:48.160 --> 2:37:52.880
 different introductions that Galileo himself had. It's such a thrill to be able to do it.

2:37:52.880 --> 2:37:58.240
 I only randomly found out because I wanted to study it and it's like 500 pages long. And I was

2:37:58.240 --> 2:38:02.480
 like, let me get the audio book because I'm an audio medium kind of guy. Didn't exist. So I said,

2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:06.720
 let's do it ourselves. And so we did it. And hopefully it'll be out on Galileo's birthday,

2:38:06.720 --> 2:38:13.360
 which is February 15th, 2022. There'll be a ripe 457, but that's not the only one of his books.

2:38:13.360 --> 2:38:18.480
 Galileo wrote many books, one of which is called the Military Compass. And this is an

2:38:18.480 --> 2:38:23.920
 interesting book for my blockchain and your blockchain aficionados. In this book, he talks

2:38:23.920 --> 2:38:28.640
 about a compass, which is not a magnetic compass, but an actual slide roll. It's basically a slide

2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:34.240
 roll. And it's a manual. It's like, imagine if your phone came with a manual nowadays,

2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:39.040
 they don't, right? But this was a manual for how to use this slide roll, which is enormously

2:38:39.040 --> 2:38:43.680
 important. And he gives a whole bunch of worked examples. It's a brilliant book. One of the examples

2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:48.880
 is how do you convert money? So he does a money conversion, currency conversion between Ducati

2:38:48.880 --> 2:38:54.720
 and Florentine Ducati and Scootie and whatever, you know, Lyra, whatever, he does all these currency

2:38:54.720 --> 2:39:01.360
 conversions. One copy of this book, or maybe maybe two exist, first printings from 1600 still exist.

2:39:02.080 --> 2:39:09.280
 If Galileo had just kept those in his family, they're worth $100 million. Nowadays, you can't

2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:13.840
 get a Scootie. A Scootie's worth nothing. Like a Ducati's worth not, I mean, maybe some collector

2:39:13.840 --> 2:39:18.640
 wants a piece of paper, right? So it's a lesson. Like there are value in physical, you know,

2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:23.520
 non fungible tokens, this original non fungible token. So, but then a third book is called The

2:39:23.520 --> 2:39:28.880
 Assayer. So what is an assayer? So assayers were kind of like these alchemists, you know,

2:39:28.880 --> 2:39:33.920
 physicists, chemists that would, would, would be around a court. And every so often for the

2:39:33.920 --> 2:39:38.880
 treasurer, they would want to accept pieces of gold from the citizens and convert that to script

2:39:38.880 --> 2:39:44.560
 or, you know, paper money. And to do that, they needed someone to verify with a standard of gold

2:39:44.560 --> 2:39:50.800
 that they knew to be gold and do some kind of semi non destructive evaluation of the purported

2:39:50.800 --> 2:39:54.720
 object, the metal that was supposed to be gold. So they would take these pieces of gold,

2:39:55.360 --> 2:39:59.520
 theoretically gold, and they would rub it on something called a touchstone. Touchstone was

2:39:59.520 --> 2:40:04.960
 a special piece of rock, granite, whatever. It has no intrinsic value. It's just a piece of rock.

2:40:04.960 --> 2:40:11.040
 But with that rock, you could assay and determine the content of this thing that could be worth,

2:40:11.040 --> 2:40:14.480
 you know, millions of lira or whatever, right? So it was an incredibly important job.

2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:20.560
 And so this person would take this piece of inanimate rock and use it to do something valuable.

2:40:20.560 --> 2:40:26.800
 What I want to do in the assayer project is take this plethora of physical theories of everything.

2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:30.800
 I said recently, you know, we should give a nub all prize to someone who doesn't come up with

2:40:30.800 --> 2:40:37.200
 a theory of everything because there's just, there's just like, it's just rotten with them.

2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:42.800
 And I think it's great. You know, I often say that theory is kind of like software,

2:40:42.800 --> 2:40:46.400
 and I'm not denigrating software at all. But like, you can create a lot of software,

2:40:46.400 --> 2:40:51.040
 you can make a quine, and it'll make its own quine. And like, you can make infinite amounts of

2:40:51.040 --> 2:40:54.800
 software. Look it up, kids. That's one of my favorite videos. And you could see, you can

2:40:54.800 --> 2:40:57.920
 replicate, you can't replicate, you can't make a telescope that makes a telescope that makes it

2:40:57.920 --> 2:41:01.920
 so. In other words, hardware is kind of like the non fungible token, that's ultimate minted,

2:41:01.920 --> 2:41:07.840
 you know, limited edition, the book, the compass book. And so it's very expensive. That means

2:41:07.840 --> 2:41:14.000
 you have to be very careful before you invest decades, billions, and humans into pursuing

2:41:14.000 --> 2:41:18.480
 one of these theories of everything. You have to have good intuition for it. And lately, what

2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:25.200
 I've seen is not predictions, but retradictions. So you see that the Large Hadron Collider will

2:41:25.200 --> 2:41:30.800
 come out with a measurement. And then so and so, we'll say, oh, this is, you know, this is compatible

2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:36.240
 with string theory, or g minus two of the muon. It has these bizarre properties. Fifth force,

2:41:36.240 --> 2:41:43.440
 string theory predicts this. String theory solves this. Neutrinos, sterile neutrinos,

2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:49.040
 Large Hadron Collider Bottom or B experiment, blah, blah, blah. They'll say that it's compatible

2:41:49.040 --> 2:41:53.040
 after the fact. And it's not so bad, right? Because look, what did Einstein do with GR,

2:41:53.040 --> 2:41:59.360
 general relativity? The first thing he did was not predict something new. He looked at the anomalous

2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:04.480
 behavior of the planet Mercury. And he saw it was behaving strangely. And people had said, oh,

2:42:04.480 --> 2:42:08.960
 that's because there's another planet hiding behind the sun that we can't see that perturbs the orbit

2:42:08.960 --> 2:42:13.680
 of the planet Mercury. It's always called Vulcan. That was one approach. That's kind of like the

2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:18.160
 dark matter approach where it's like, there's a clump of matter that we can't see that's influencing

2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:23.280
 the planet that we can't see. And we use that to divine and intuit the existence of the other

2:42:23.280 --> 2:42:27.120
 planet. That's actually how Neptune was discovered. Neptune was discovered because of the anomalous

2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:32.160
 behavior of the planet Uranus. So Neptune was dark. We couldn't see it. It was tugging on Uranus in a

2:42:32.160 --> 2:42:37.120
 certain way. And that led to Laverier discovering the planet, predicting where this planet should

2:42:37.120 --> 2:42:42.000
 be found. So it had a good heritage and physics, right, to predict this planet that you couldn't

2:42:42.000 --> 2:42:47.520
 see that work. But Einstein said, no, it's caused by the warping and bending of spacetime

2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:51.440
 due to the presence of matter will later become known as the Einstein equations.

2:42:51.440 --> 2:42:55.760
 So he explained why Mercury did that. And it was known since the time of Newton

2:42:55.760 --> 2:43:00.480
 that Mercury was behaving in this really freaky way. So he didn't predict it. He retrojected it.

2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:05.040
 That's fine. But at some point, you should come up with something new that's uniquely

2:43:05.040 --> 2:43:09.840
 predictive of your theory, as I just said. The theory of dark matter in the context of Neptune

2:43:09.840 --> 2:43:14.800
 is actually a valid theory. It just happens not to make sense in the context of Vulcan. And so

2:43:14.800 --> 2:43:20.480
 if he had kept doing that, maybe perhaps he wouldn't have come up with these other predictions

2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:24.880
 that he would later reject. Like, he rejected the existence of gravitational waves. You and Barry

2:43:24.880 --> 2:43:28.800
 talked about that. He didn't actually believe it. It was the one peer reviewed paper that he had.

2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:33.440
 He used to send back in those days, he sent a letter to Nature, physical review, publish this,

2:43:33.440 --> 2:43:37.600
 you know, let me know how much it cost. And they got it rejected because he said,

2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:42.000
 you can't detect gravitational waves. And actually, or they're not real. And the guy showed that

2:43:42.000 --> 2:43:47.760
 they're real because he corrected a math error in Einstein and Rosen's paper. So it's fascinating.

2:43:47.760 --> 2:43:53.280
 What should the assayer do? He or she should look at these theories, look what things they explain

2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:59.600
 that already exist, and look at what new predictions they can claim to explain if we can build

2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:04.320
 experiments to test them. You have to kind of challenge yourself to think about what kind of

2:44:04.320 --> 2:44:10.800
 predictions can they make such that we can construct experiments. So that's like ultimately

2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:19.040
 back going to the signal to the experimenter theorist, essentially. That's right.

2:44:19.040 --> 2:44:25.760
 So like very experiment centric exploration of the fundamental theory of everything.

2:44:25.760 --> 2:44:31.120
 That's right. And the best scientists, the best physicists were both experimentalists and theorists.

2:44:31.920 --> 2:44:36.080
 Or at least that they, if they were experimentalists, they understood the theory well enough

2:44:36.080 --> 2:44:40.560
 to make predictions or to explore the predictions and the consequences of those predictions.

2:44:40.560 --> 2:44:45.280
 Or if they were theorists, they were like Galileo, like Einstein has patents for things that he

2:44:45.280 --> 2:44:51.120
 invented. And then, you know, some of his work led to the laser and the maser. So he had practically,

2:44:51.120 --> 2:44:55.040
 it wasn't just pure airy fairy, you know, quantum reality and expanding universe.

2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:00.000
 So in this case, what I want to do is look at, you know, there's 10 different theories of everything

2:45:00.000 --> 2:45:04.560
 or cosmological models, they make predictions, they have advantages and disadvantages. And I'm

2:45:04.560 --> 2:45:08.880
 just asking the question, why aren't we applying Bayesian reasoning with confidence intervals?

2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:12.560
 Why don't we have updates every time an experiment comes out? We can update our

2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:17.040
 credulity in that experiment or that theory, rather, based on the results of the experiment.

2:45:17.040 --> 2:45:21.200
 And we shouldn't do it after the fact. Or as, you know, Michio Kaku has said, well,

2:45:21.200 --> 2:45:25.200
 you have to tell me what the initial conditions are. And that's not my job. You're supposed to

2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:30.320
 tell me if string theory is correct. What should it predict if it's true? There's one big problem,

2:45:30.320 --> 2:45:39.280
 which I should say, that to be a good ass air, I think you have to be worldly in the sense of

2:45:40.240 --> 2:45:46.560
 worldly and curious, like we were talking about before with you and Joe. And you can't only talk

2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:54.000
 your own book. You can't only understand your own pet theory of everything. You can't only say, well,

2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:59.120
 I only understand string theory, and I don't have time for these other theories, or as if it's

2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:06.880
 beneath me to even go into Garrett Leasy, or Eric Weinstein, or Stephen Wolfram, or aspects of M

2:46:06.880 --> 2:46:12.000
 theory, et cetera, et cetera. And there are some that say, you know, like, why do we give string

2:46:12.000 --> 2:46:18.480
 theory so much of an advanced past when we... There are actually predictions it's made that are

2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:24.000
 completely anathema to what we observe in physics. Like, the dark energy should be negative, and we

2:46:24.000 --> 2:46:28.160
 see it as positive. Like, that's a huge strife. You know, if you told somebody, here's my tenure

2:46:28.160 --> 2:46:31.440
 application, and what they'll be like, oh, I've made this pretty... If it wasn't done by, you know,

2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:36.800
 Maldesena and, you know, Witten and folks like that, I don't know if it would have had the traction,

2:46:36.800 --> 2:46:42.080
 the endurance, the resiliency that's had. And that worries me, because all these men and some

2:46:42.080 --> 2:46:46.960
 women are making these fantastic, brilliant, beautiful ideas, and they're not even looking

2:46:46.960 --> 2:46:52.960
 at what their neighbor's doing. There's a thing that I really enjoyed seeing, and I don't see often

2:46:52.960 --> 2:47:00.560
 enough of these theories, which is others who are also experts kind of studying them sufficiently

2:47:00.560 --> 2:47:07.600
 well to steel man the theory, to show the beautiful aspects of the theory. You know,

2:47:07.600 --> 2:47:15.280
 I see that with Stephen Wolfram. He has a very different sort of formulation of physics with

2:47:15.280 --> 2:47:24.080
 his physics project. Now, physics is a foreign land to me, but his formulation, especially

2:47:24.080 --> 2:47:29.680
 in the context of cellular talent or hypergraphs, just as objects, as mathematical objects themselves

2:47:29.680 --> 2:47:36.720
 are familiar. And so I'm able to see the real beauty there, and it saddens me that others

2:47:37.760 --> 2:47:43.360
 in the physics community can't also see the beauty. Like, give it a chance. Give it a chance

2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:49.680
 to see the beauty. Give it your respect. So there is one person who does take time and is

2:47:49.680 --> 2:47:54.640
 what I consider to be a great scientist in terms of what he thinks. He obviously has invested

2:47:54.640 --> 2:48:00.960
 interest in his own theory, and it's Eric. Eric's got a truly encyclopedic knowledge of the history

2:48:00.960 --> 2:48:08.240
 of physics, and he has a great warmth and graciousness when it comes to giving others. And I've

2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:12.400
 witnessed this, and I've had, look, first of all, I think debate is pointless. Like, I don't know

2:48:12.400 --> 2:48:17.040
 about you, but if you've ever voted, like, oh, I saw this debate, and, you know, because Trump did

2:48:17.040 --> 2:48:21.280
 so badly, now I'm going to vote for Biden. No, never have. You almost never change anybody's mind

2:48:21.280 --> 2:48:26.640
 unless you debate with love, unless you have almost like, we're going to win together,

2:48:26.640 --> 2:48:31.840
 like the red team approach in the military, they're trying to win a war. So they may disagree on

2:48:31.840 --> 2:48:36.720
 the tactics day to day, but the strategy, we have to win this war. I love you, and I want to protect

2:48:36.720 --> 2:48:41.520
 you. I don't see that in very many of these physicists from Kaku. I almost see it. It's

2:48:41.520 --> 2:48:46.480
 embarrassing in some ways, because they'll almost mock with the exception of Eric. You know, Garrett's

2:48:46.480 --> 2:48:50.880
 interesting, you know, his theory is, you know, people have a lot of issues, very technical,

2:48:51.440 --> 2:48:56.080
 but Eric has taken the time to try to understand it. Eric has taken the time to understand

2:48:56.080 --> 2:49:01.360
 Peter White's theory, and I don't see the same graciousness extended from them, I'm sorry.

2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:06.960
 Yes, you're right. I mean, with Eric, he hasn't, he wants to, but he hasn't extended the same

2:49:06.960 --> 2:49:12.160
 for Stephen Wolfram, because I think... No, he did. No, actually, no, he did. I had a debate with

2:49:12.160 --> 2:49:16.640
 them live on my show. No, I did. I listened to it, but like, I just think it's outside of the two

2:49:16.640 --> 2:49:22.720
 kit that Eric is comfortable with. So it's not, it's not that he's not, but you're, the main thing

2:49:22.720 --> 2:49:30.080
 that's often absent and Eric does have is like the willingness and like not just like dismissing

2:49:30.080 --> 2:49:34.880
 or mocking though that he's, he's reaching out, but okay. I mean, what if it's not, you know,

2:49:34.880 --> 2:49:38.160
 I made a joke when they were on, I was like, how many theories of everything can there be,

2:49:38.160 --> 2:49:42.080
 you know, Highlander, you know, there can be only one, you know, I don't know, maybe.

2:49:42.080 --> 2:49:51.600
 But he of course also like the other folks who propose a theory has an ego. He rides a dragon

2:49:52.560 --> 2:49:58.880
 with the dragon representing the ego. Well, let me ask you about your friend, Eric Weinstein.

2:49:58.880 --> 2:50:05.040
 So he proposed initial sketches of geometric community, which is his theory of everything.

2:50:05.040 --> 2:50:09.120
 Maybe you can elucidate some aspect of it that you find interesting, but

2:50:11.920 --> 2:50:16.720
 what do you think about the response he got from the scientific community?

2:50:17.600 --> 2:50:23.520
 Well, you know, some of the response came from people, academicians, professors. Some came from

2:50:23.520 --> 2:50:28.400
 a lay audience and some came from trained scientists or no longer, you know, maybe practicing

2:50:28.400 --> 2:50:35.200
 in universities. I thought it was, there was a lot of vitriol, which surprised me because

2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:41.840
 I look at what he's trying to do. And it was always, the vitriol would always come with some

2:50:41.840 --> 2:50:48.080
 element of ad hominem. And maybe that's his personality, maybe that engenders this or whatever.

2:50:48.080 --> 2:50:51.920
 Maybe there is kind of just a natural tendency. You know, I always get these emails,

2:50:51.920 --> 2:50:56.960
 Professor Keating, I have a new theory, Weinstein was wrong. I'm going to prove it. I'm not going

2:50:56.960 --> 2:51:02.320
 to math, but if you help me, I will share my Nobel Prize with you. Oh, thanks. Have you read

2:51:02.320 --> 2:51:08.320
 my books? In other words, it's always taking down the dragon. It's always taking down the

2:51:08.320 --> 2:51:12.320
 kung fu master, right? That you get the hit points from D&D. You get their hit points,

2:51:12.320 --> 2:51:16.320
 you take their cards, you get their wrist tokens from Kamchatka. And thinking about

2:51:16.880 --> 2:51:22.800
 with Eric, it's like, because what he's doing is so aspirational, it is grandiose in a good sense.

2:51:22.800 --> 2:51:28.560
 What he's trying to do is construct a geometric theory of everything that has aspects of supersymmetry

2:51:28.560 --> 2:51:34.640
 and stuff embedded in it. He's trying to meld that. It has very unusual features and that it

2:51:34.640 --> 2:51:40.000
 features not only multiple spatial dimensions, multiple time dimensions. It uses new mathematical

2:51:40.000 --> 2:51:47.040
 objects that he's invented. And look, I had had him on my show. I've talked with him. We've had

2:51:47.040 --> 2:51:51.360
 consultations with other physicists, you know, where he'll come down and I have a visitor's

2:51:51.360 --> 2:51:55.840
 office and he comes down to San Diego sometimes and spends time there. And we talk with eminent

2:51:55.840 --> 2:52:01.920
 mathematicians and physicists. Eric's been out of the academic world for a long time.

2:52:02.480 --> 2:52:06.720
 And there is, as I said before, an aspect of persuasion that must take place

2:52:07.280 --> 2:52:12.960
 in order to get anything through. And I think there was a slight amount of good nature, not

2:52:12.960 --> 2:52:18.160
 ignorance, naivete, but just the sense that if this is right, everyone will recognize it.

2:52:18.160 --> 2:52:22.560
 If you build a better mousetrap, the world will beat a path to your door as the expression goes.

2:52:22.560 --> 2:52:25.760
 That's completely untrue. That doesn't even happen with mousetraps. I mean,

2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:29.440
 you know how many freaking mousetrap types there are? It's like, no, they don't beat a

2:52:29.440 --> 2:52:33.520
 path to your door. You have to sell that freaking thing. You have to sell it like Steve Jobs or

2:52:33.520 --> 2:52:39.280
 Elon. I have never, I've had one paper, I have 200 papers I've published in peer reviewed journals.

2:52:39.280 --> 2:52:44.320
 I've only had one, half a percent published with no referees comments. In other words,

2:52:44.320 --> 2:52:47.840
 published like Dream, submitted it, and happened to be in a prestigious journal. I thought I was

2:52:47.840 --> 2:52:52.400
 pretty psyched about that. But you almost have to crave the response, getting it back from a journal.

2:52:52.400 --> 2:52:56.240
 And I think he doesn't see, first of all, he doesn't subscribe to the peer review process.

2:52:56.240 --> 2:53:02.240
 He thinks that is anathema to way sciences, invest interest in public journals, etc., etc.

2:53:03.200 --> 2:53:09.280
 I think you can have elements of peer review that are substantive and valuable. I think you have to

2:53:09.280 --> 2:53:13.600
 learn from your critics. One of my conversations with John Mather, he talks about loving your

2:53:13.600 --> 2:53:19.120
 critics in this book, but not being so open to their criticism, that their criticism goes to your

2:53:19.120 --> 2:53:24.960
 heart, and not being so open to their compliments, that their compliments go to your head. It's a

2:53:24.960 --> 2:53:30.640
 very tough sila and carib this to walk. Well, there's something, I mean, I want to be careful here

2:53:30.640 --> 2:53:39.120
 because I'd like to talk to Eric about this directly, but I'll just, from a perspective of a friend,

2:53:39.120 --> 2:53:50.000
 I want to ask about the drug of fame. So there's also the public

2:53:53.440 --> 2:53:58.400
 perception of the battles of physics. And so there's a very narrow community,

2:53:59.680 --> 2:54:06.160
 but then there's the way that's perceived, the exploration of ideas is perceived by the public.

2:54:06.160 --> 2:54:11.920
 And so there is a certain drug to the excitement that the public can show

2:54:13.040 --> 2:54:21.680
 when they sense that you have something big. And that in itself might become the thing that gives

2:54:21.680 --> 2:54:29.600
 you pleasure. And I think that with theories of everything or with any kind of super, super

2:54:29.600 --> 2:54:35.760
 ambitious projects, and this is taking us back to when you were ambitious about trying to understand

2:54:35.760 --> 2:54:41.760
 the origins of the universe, if you convince yourself that you have an intuition about the

2:54:41.760 --> 2:54:49.920
 origins of the universe, and you have a platform like you do now, where you start to communicate

2:54:49.920 --> 2:54:55.920
 your intuition, it's hazy like all the science, you're still unsure, but you have a sense. I mean,

2:54:55.920 --> 2:55:00.000
 perhaps you don't have that as much as an experimentalist because you always kind of start

2:55:00.000 --> 2:55:06.960
 going, okay, how can I build a device to see through the fog? But if you're more like a

2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:15.760
 theoretician who kind of works in the realm of ideas, in the realm of intuitions, it is also

2:55:15.760 --> 2:55:21.600
 a source of pleasure. You mentioned dopamine, a source of dopamine, that you can communicate to

2:55:21.600 --> 2:55:28.400
 others that you're really excited by the possibility of solving the deepest mysteries of the universe.

2:55:28.400 --> 2:55:36.240
 Yeah. So there's some aspect to which you want to be a Gregori Grisha Perlman and go into the

2:55:36.240 --> 2:55:42.160
 hole and get the work done and shut the hell up about the, I'm speaking about myself about

2:55:43.920 --> 2:55:49.680
 talking about the dream and planning and exploring how great it will be if my intuition

2:55:49.680 --> 2:55:56.800
 turns out to be correct. If the sketches I have turn out to actually build the bridge that takes

2:55:56.800 --> 2:56:08.080
 us to a whole new place as a friend of Eric's or a friend of my friend, what kind of advice do you

2:56:08.080 --> 2:56:15.440
 give? What is your role? Is it to be a supporter given that he has many critics or is it to be in

2:56:15.440 --> 2:56:22.720
 private a critic? Like a lot of my friends will say, hey, shut the hell up. Just get it done.

2:56:22.720 --> 2:56:27.920
 Well, first of all, I want to ask you a question I've asked him and then it comes from Animal Farm.

2:56:29.280 --> 2:56:32.880
 My favorite book. Yeah. So you remember Benjamin the donkey?

2:56:32.880 --> 2:56:37.200
 Yes. And he's talking to the pig. I forget the pig's name. You probably know. Anyway,

2:56:37.200 --> 2:56:42.880
 the pig says to him, you got this long, lustrous, beautiful tail. You're so lucky. I got this short,

2:56:42.880 --> 2:56:49.040
 curly, little squiggly thing. Does Jack squat? Tell me, how does it feel to have such a lustrous

2:56:49.040 --> 2:56:56.320
 tail? And Benjamin says, well, the good Lord, he gave me a tail to swat away the flies. But you

2:56:56.320 --> 2:57:03.520
 know what? I'd rather not have the tail if I didn't have the flies. So I ask you, as I've asked Eric,

2:57:04.240 --> 2:57:10.960
 is it worth it? You've got these beautiful tail, but there are flies. I'm not saying in a negative

2:57:10.960 --> 2:57:17.680
 way. I'm just saying you get unwanted distractions, dopamine, kind of the highlight, the spotlight

2:57:17.680 --> 2:57:22.800
 effect. It's obviously allowing you to do things that you could never do alone. And I think,

2:57:23.760 --> 2:57:27.840
 you know, first of all, I'd love to know how you answer that because that's something I don't feel

2:57:27.840 --> 2:57:32.240
 I can relate to myself. Well, this has to do with more like

2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:43.440
 platform, platform stuff. Yeah, scale. Oh, I, that has no very little effect on me. I enjoy it.

2:57:43.440 --> 2:57:48.320
 I enjoy meeting new people, but that has nothing to do with platform. Yeah, no, that has no effect

2:57:48.320 --> 2:57:57.840
 on me. Do I want somebody that enjoys the act itself. So this conversation, the reason I'm

2:57:57.840 --> 2:58:03.360
 doing this podcast with you today is because that allows me to trick you into talking to me for a

2:58:03.360 --> 2:58:07.520
 prolonged period of time. I don't care about platform. I assume nobody listens. It really

2:58:07.520 --> 2:58:13.760
 doesn't matter. Yeah, I forgot it right. My whole test of it was a good podcast. Because how do you

2:58:13.760 --> 2:58:17.680
 know? Like podcasts have been around, what, 12 years? How do we know as podcasters we're doing a

2:58:17.680 --> 2:58:20.560
 good job? Like sometimes you get someone say, that was the best interview I ever had, but that

2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:26.560
 doesn't happen that often, at least for me. But if you realize that you forgot to put the SD card

2:58:26.560 --> 2:58:31.840
 in that little guy and the zoom didn't work, would you do it again? And I think if you say yes to

2:58:31.840 --> 2:58:38.000
 that, that was a good podcast. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly it. So in that space, yeah,

2:58:39.520 --> 2:58:48.080
 all of it is worth it. But the dream, I'm more referring to the psychological effects. Forget

2:58:48.080 --> 2:58:52.880
 the platform, forget all of that. Maybe you shouldn't even brought up the platform because it

2:58:52.880 --> 2:58:57.200
 really has to do even in your own private mind, which is what I'm struggling with.

2:58:57.200 --> 2:59:05.040
 Because I enjoy the planning, the dreaming, the early stages,

2:59:07.200 --> 2:59:13.920
 so much that I often don't take projects to completion. This is a psychological effect

2:59:13.920 --> 2:59:18.240
 that I'm sure basically everybody, every engineer, everybody that does anything,

2:59:18.240 --> 2:59:24.000
 goes through. I just, in this case particular, I think it also applies. And I wonder as a friend,

2:59:24.000 --> 2:59:28.880
 what is the role? So yeah, I mean, that effect has been documented, everything from planning

2:59:28.880 --> 2:59:35.040
 telescopes to dieting. So there's a tiny bit of dopamine that you get visualizing how you're

2:59:35.040 --> 2:59:39.200
 going to feel, you don't need to know this, but you don't deal, but losing five pounds.

2:59:39.200 --> 2:59:43.200
 I say, oh, I'm going to lose five pounds. And I'm going to be able to run a minute faster.

2:59:43.200 --> 2:59:47.600
 So there's a part of me when I'm planning the diet and the meals and the exercise that I get a

2:59:47.600 --> 2:59:51.360
 little bit of that thrill. And that actually saps a little bit of my willpower to actually

2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:55.120
 complete the task that will take me to that goal. So that's a documented effect. And that happens

2:59:55.120 --> 3:00:00.640
 in project planning and project management. It's a very, very important thing to guard against as

3:00:00.640 --> 3:00:06.080
 a manager of a big project. With Eric, it's interesting because with him, first of all,

3:00:06.080 --> 3:00:12.880
 we relate extremely well on a friendship level and very close. He does remind me a lot of my

3:00:12.880 --> 3:00:20.240
 father. And I've told him that just as a mathematician, as a big thinker, as in his case,

3:00:20.240 --> 3:00:26.160
 as a father, you know, the father kind of figure that I didn't have a sense. But that he is a

3:00:26.160 --> 3:00:30.480
 true lover of life. He knows he's got a huge platform. He knows he gets a lot of attention

3:00:30.480 --> 3:00:35.520
 for what he does. And, you know, I jokingly say, well, it's one thing, like, how do you know,

3:00:35.520 --> 3:00:40.800
 Lex, that someone's an expert? So experts say there's a good rule Ray Dalio writes about in

3:00:40.800 --> 3:00:45.120
 principles. He says an expert is someone who's done something three times successfully. Like,

3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:49.280
 you can do something correctly once you could do something correctly. It's very hard to pull off

3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:56.160
 like three projects, three telescopes, three, whatever, right? So look for that. It's arbitrary.

3:00:56.160 --> 3:01:00.240
 It could be four, it could be two, right? But the point is, look at Eric. So how many things

3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:06.080
 has he contributed to and made, you know, pretty substantive kind of paradigm shifts for different

3:01:06.080 --> 3:01:11.280
 people? I would say he's been right many times. Does that mean he's infallible, that he's ineffable?

3:01:11.280 --> 3:01:17.360
 No, of course not. For me, so what I'm saying is I get a little bit of the joy of kind of learning

3:01:17.360 --> 3:01:22.880
 something purely as a scientist, something completely outside of what I do, mathematics,

3:01:23.520 --> 3:01:31.040
 gauge theory, the kind of very advanced geometry, topology that he's interested in.

3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:36.400
 But every now and then, I will sneak in that I want, you know, I've told him, I'm going to turn

3:01:36.400 --> 3:01:40.160
 your son into an experimentalist despite you. You know, like, he is not going to be a theorist.

3:01:40.160 --> 3:01:43.680
 Zev is not going to be a theorist. He is working with me. He is learning from me. We're trying to

3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:48.640
 get him into, he wants to bypass all of the, you know, kind of nonsense of undergraduate and go

3:01:48.640 --> 3:01:52.720
 straight to graduate school. And I've tried to encourage him that maybe he could do it, maybe

3:01:52.720 --> 3:01:57.520
 he can't, but there's no other way than to try. And so we, I prepared a whole curriculum for Zev

3:01:57.520 --> 3:02:02.000
 to basically bypass all of undergraduate and to his credit, he's done, earns all the credit.

3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:04.960
 He's learned it to a level that matches many of my graduates.

3:02:04.960 --> 3:02:09.840
 Okay, hold on a second. I have to push back and this is me saying it. And I'll, I'm sure I'll

3:02:09.840 --> 3:02:18.320
 talk to Eric about this, but to say you said, Eric's done, was right on multiple things.

3:02:19.120 --> 3:02:28.400
 I think Eric has a great deep insight about human nature and how societies work. And he says a lot

3:02:28.400 --> 3:02:35.760
 of wise words on that world. But I think if we're talking about experts, you kind of have to prove

3:02:35.760 --> 3:02:40.160
 you, you know, it's like Michael Jordan playing baseball, like he's proved it many times that

3:02:40.160 --> 3:02:45.600
 he can play basketball, but he's also got to prove that he can play baseball. And I would say the

3:02:45.600 --> 3:02:54.000
 whole point of, I mean, of radical ideas is you're not, I mean, it's very hard to be sitting on a

3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:59.040
 track record of, I mean, you're, when you're swinging for the fence as always, you're, there's

3:02:59.040 --> 3:03:06.560
 not a track record to sit on. And like Max Tagmark is an example of somebody who has a huge track

3:03:06.560 --> 3:03:12.800
 record of more like acceptable stuff, but he also keeps swinging for the fences in every other world.

3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:17.680
 So he has that track record with Eric, if you look at just the number of publications, all

3:03:17.680 --> 3:03:22.560
 this stuff, he did really, he chose not to travel the academic class. So there's no

3:03:22.560 --> 3:03:30.960
 proof of expertise, except sort of an obvious linguistic demonstration of brilliance. But

3:03:30.960 --> 3:03:35.760
 that's not how physics works. So there's a polite way to damn somebody as a scientist and say,

3:03:35.760 --> 3:03:40.960
 he or she, she, they really know the history of physics, right? Like physicists always love

3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:44.240
 it. Like Sean Carroll always jokes about like, you know, like physicists should never talk about

3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:51.360
 history of physics. But it's more than that. So Eric has certainly contributed in finance

3:03:51.360 --> 3:03:58.080
 and finance specifically and gauge theory and economics and inflation dynamics and the non

3:03:58.080 --> 3:04:02.960
 cosmological. Hold on a second. That's yet to be proven. He has a lot of powerful interest.

3:04:02.960 --> 3:04:07.680
 Well, gauge theory is calculated. It's calculus proven. I mean, he has a gauge model for currency

3:04:10.320 --> 3:04:16.720
 exchanges between different nations that is explanatory. It's not, you know, is it something,

3:04:16.720 --> 3:04:20.640
 in other words, it's a model and it's used for pedagogical purposes. And it might be,

3:04:20.640 --> 3:04:26.480
 okay. It's unique to him. I mean, him and Pia. Yes. It might be a powerful model.

3:04:27.280 --> 3:04:32.400
 It might be one that's actually deserves a huge amount of applause and celebration, but

3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:36.560
 does not yet receive that. And that's one of the things that Eric talks about is not received the

3:04:36.560 --> 3:04:41.920
 attention it deserves. But it has not yet received the attention it deserves. And so like the

3:04:41.920 --> 3:04:47.440
 proven expertise thing, I mean, there's a lot of people that go to their grave without the

3:04:47.440 --> 3:04:54.400
 recognition they deserve. And it's a tragedy. But the fact is, like, you have to fight for

3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:59.920
 that recognition. The tragedy happens for a reason. You can't just say this person is obviously

3:04:59.920 --> 3:05:07.520
 brilliant and therefore they deserve the credit in every single domain. It doesn't, it doesn't

3:05:07.520 --> 3:05:12.560
 like transfer immediately. There's nobody that's, well, at least I wouldn't argue Eric is one of

3:05:12.560 --> 3:05:19.120
 the special minds in our generation. But you still have to fight the fight of physics and prove

3:05:19.120 --> 3:05:24.480
 it within the community. And I think the same applies in economics. You can't, I mean, as somebody

3:05:25.600 --> 3:05:33.280
 that, you know, I've gone through the academic journey, just like you said, the peer review,

3:05:33.280 --> 3:05:38.720
 all those things, flawed as they are, that's the part of the process. You have to convince your

3:05:38.720 --> 3:05:45.360
 peers, the people that are as obsessed for whatever the hell reason about that particular thing that

3:05:45.360 --> 3:05:51.360
 you're working on. Yes, there's egos. Yes, there's politics. It's a giant mess. But I think it's a

3:05:51.360 --> 3:06:00.560
 beautiful mess through which you have to go through in order to reveal the power of your idea to

3:06:00.560 --> 3:06:05.920
 yourself and to the world. Well, let me use an example. So you know of James Clerk Maxwell,

3:06:05.920 --> 3:06:10.240
 and he invented the laws of electromagnetism, which is the first example of a unification

3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:16.720
 principle ever displayed by the human mind in history. Purely mathematics, unifying completely

3:06:16.720 --> 3:06:21.920
 disparate phenomena. In one case, electricity, charges, static electricity, lightning, and the

3:06:21.920 --> 3:06:27.920
 other magnets, bar magnets, currents, etc. Unified them. You know what he did? I like to do a thought

3:06:27.920 --> 3:06:33.520
 experiment. Imagine Twitter exists 1864. Maxwell's working away. And he goes, I have this wonderful

3:06:33.520 --> 3:06:38.640
 idea with fluctuations and inductive virtue and blah, blah, blah. And it revolves around this

3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:43.440
 thing called an ether. And by the way, there are these little vortices and gears. And the gears

3:06:43.440 --> 3:06:46.800
 have these planetary things, and they suck up vortices. And the vortices determine the density

3:06:46.800 --> 3:06:52.400
 of the electromagnetic potential. You feel like this guy's a fricking moron. And what would you do?

3:06:52.400 --> 3:06:56.160
 Come on. Honestly, you would say everything this guy does is wrong. I mean, he's got this

3:06:56.160 --> 3:07:02.560
 idiotic idea. And it would be falsified a couple of decades later by Mark Wilson and Morley. And

3:07:02.560 --> 3:07:08.000
 in so doing, you would have thrown out a very beautiful baby with bathwater or as in Twitter,

3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:14.320
 imagine the twitstorm, you know, clerk Maxwell at clerk Maxwell, one would get it would be brutal,

3:07:14.320 --> 3:07:18.800
 right? And to the detriment, and that might even set back history. Imagine Yang Mills doing the

3:07:18.800 --> 3:07:23.760
 same thing churned Simon's. A lot of these things are very fantastic. But but why Lex? Why does Ed

3:07:23.760 --> 3:07:29.200
 Witton? Why does one know the same? Let me give a good good example. One guest, brilliant guy,

3:07:29.200 --> 3:07:34.400
 I love him. He is the reason that Stephen Hawking conceded his black hole information

3:07:34.400 --> 3:07:40.160
 paradox loss issue. What did he conceive it conceded based upon mild the same as calculation

3:07:40.160 --> 3:07:46.480
 in ADS CFT and five dimensional wormholes? But is any of that? First of all, we don't live in

3:07:46.480 --> 3:07:50.800
 ADS universe. Second of all, we don't know if wormholes are traversable if they exist even.

3:07:51.440 --> 3:07:55.840
 You know, these are devices that are kept thorn is popularized for movies is like to say that

3:07:55.840 --> 3:08:00.720
 this is something on which I will concede a bet. Now, obviously Hawking was doing that for publicity.

3:08:00.720 --> 3:08:06.480
 Why does Mal Desena? Why does and he's got a pretty high H index, pretty well respected guy at IAS.

3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:12.560
 Love talking to him, brilliant guy. By the way, also had made use of Eric and Pia's work on gauge

3:08:12.560 --> 3:08:17.360
 theory and economics. Originally, and one, I believe the breakthrough, I can't remember exactly

3:08:17.360 --> 3:08:22.240
 what but partially, you know, credit some of the work that he did, which appears there's a footnote

3:08:22.240 --> 3:08:27.760
 to Pia Milani's thesis and some conversations, Eric, I think in it. Anyway, getting back to that,

3:08:27.760 --> 3:08:33.040
 why is there not the same skepticism? Is it because Mal Desena, who's an eminent physicist,

3:08:33.040 --> 3:08:37.840
 obviously, has published, you know, realistic work and done and done? What about Whitton?

3:08:38.480 --> 3:08:40.800
 You know, Whitton gets a pass. I mean, if you...

3:08:40.800 --> 3:08:43.600
 Well, Whitton gets a pass on which aspect? The string theory?

3:08:43.600 --> 3:08:46.960
 Well, yeah, that M theory is correct. I mean, here's, let me just say Hawking. Hawking gets

3:08:46.960 --> 3:08:52.240
 the ultimate pass. Hawking would say things like M theory, there's zero evidence for it. I mean,

3:08:52.240 --> 3:08:55.840
 there's the famous meme that went around this weekend, like, what does string theory predict

3:08:55.840 --> 3:08:58.880
 it and it's nothing? And by the way, that's actually wrong. I talked to Cumberland. I know

3:08:58.880 --> 3:09:02.080
 you talked to Cumberland. Cumberland says that string theory does make predictions.

3:09:02.080 --> 3:09:06.480
 It predicts the mass of the electron, lies between 10 to the minus one plank mass and 10 to the minus

3:09:06.480 --> 3:09:10.080
 30 plank. Whatever, our electron. It's a big range.

3:09:10.080 --> 3:09:16.160
 It's a huge range. Imagine Cumberland comes up and again, he's just some nobody, but he actually,

3:09:16.160 --> 3:09:20.560
 you know, he doesn't have a profile. He's not a Harvard, has zero H and X or whatever Eric's is.

3:09:21.120 --> 3:09:25.680
 Why do we not like, in other words, why are we more harsh on people that are trying?

3:09:25.680 --> 3:09:32.000
 You know the answer to that. So I get a million emails, just like you said, yourself, where they

3:09:32.640 --> 3:09:36.880
 provenize in my world is artificial intelligence, the equivalence of that.

3:09:37.680 --> 3:09:42.800
 I figured out how to build consciousness, how to engineer intelligence, how to...

3:09:42.800 --> 3:09:46.480
 You should send your emails to me and I'll send my emails.

3:09:46.480 --> 3:09:51.200
 And we'll reply to you. I mean, and I don't want to sort of mock this because I think

3:09:51.200 --> 3:09:57.040
 it's very possible that there is either kernels of interesting ideas or in the whole like,

3:09:57.040 --> 3:10:01.680
 there is geniuses out there that are unheard, but because of the so much noise,

3:10:02.960 --> 3:10:06.320
 you do have to weigh, like,

3:10:06.320 --> 3:10:14.320
 hire the Ed Wittons of the world when they make statements. And that's why you build up a track

3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:23.040
 record. As you said with Ray Dalio, you have to show that you can, like, if you're a Pollock and

3:10:23.040 --> 3:10:28.320
 you show us a painting of a bunch of chaos, you have to, and this is a bad example, probably,

3:10:28.320 --> 3:10:30.320
 because he probably never showed this proof. I think he could do it.

3:10:30.320 --> 3:10:37.680
 Yeah. It's much more comforting to see that they can paint a good,

3:10:38.640 --> 3:10:44.080
 accurate picture of still life of an apple on the table. So there's...

3:10:44.080 --> 3:10:45.120
 Meteorite at a time.

3:10:45.120 --> 3:10:51.440
 Because then, I mean, because then there's something about the scientific community that

3:10:51.440 --> 3:10:57.040
 they have perhaps an oversensitive bullshit sensor to where they're not going to give the full effort

3:10:57.040 --> 3:11:02.000
 of their attention if you don't have the track record. Now, you could say that's a kind of

3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:06.880
 club that only you have to, like, you have to have 10, you have to have this, yes, that exists,

3:11:06.880 --> 3:11:13.040
 but there's some aspect in which you have to play the game a little bit to get the machine of signs

3:11:13.040 --> 3:11:20.000
 going. Otherwise, if you're always saying, well, I have my ball and I don't want to play your game,

3:11:20.000 --> 3:11:22.800
 your game sucks, then nobody's going to want to play with you.

3:11:22.800 --> 3:11:28.320
 That's true in there. Look, inherent in all of this is an underlying grandiosity. Look,

3:11:28.320 --> 3:11:34.080
 how could you talk about doing what Kaku said on here and elsewhere? We're looking for the

3:11:34.080 --> 3:11:38.080
 umbilical cord that connects our universe to another universe that will then reveal in a one

3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:41.280
 inch equation that will surely win a Nobel Prize, the mind of God, the...

3:11:41.280 --> 3:11:44.080
 That's like a prerequisite, I guess, to tackle these questions.

3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:49.760
 I think it's detrimental. I think doing that, first of all, I think there's an element of

3:11:49.760 --> 3:11:52.720
 almost snarkiness because none of these scientists are believing, you know,

3:11:53.360 --> 3:11:57.440
 nostics. They're not theists, right? So they're using it as kind of a stand in,

3:11:57.440 --> 3:12:01.200
 and they always talk about Einstein didn't mean it was like a Spinoza, and he wasn't, you know,

3:12:01.200 --> 3:12:03.360
 a The... God doesn't play dice. God doesn't play dice.

3:12:03.360 --> 3:12:07.280
 Yeah, Einstein mentions of God, yeah. Yeah, and then Stephen Hawking says,

3:12:07.280 --> 3:12:10.640
 if when we come, we get an M theory understood, we'll know the mind of God.

3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:17.040
 That's the title of Kaku's book, the God Particle, the God Equation, you know,

3:12:17.040 --> 3:12:21.040
 do any of them really believe in God? No, is that a prerequisite? No, I'm not saying that.

3:12:22.080 --> 3:12:25.040
 But the point being, you're talking about something that has to do with God, right?

3:12:25.040 --> 3:12:29.360
 I mean, where else do you go from there? I mean, I think God, for now, enjoys a little bit more,

3:12:29.360 --> 3:12:34.720
 you know, kind of PR than Elon or Joe or whatever, right? So, like, it's, you know,

3:12:34.720 --> 3:12:37.200
 God's got a pretty good, you know, H index himself.

3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:40.240
 He has a, by the way, a Twitter account, just so you know, it's pretty good.

3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:43.120
 The tweets of God, yeah. The tweets of God.

3:12:43.120 --> 3:12:47.600
 So, if you look at that, you have to go in there. Again, you have to go in with some swagger.

3:12:47.600 --> 3:12:52.240
 You have to have a little bit of arrogance, but you should, I agree, mix with a little bit of

3:12:52.240 --> 3:12:57.120
 humility. So, he's doing something. He comes from outside of academia. Now, if he rails against,

3:12:57.120 --> 3:13:00.320
 I'm talking about Eric now, if he's just railing, oh, the system, and I'm not going to publish,

3:13:00.320 --> 3:13:04.400
 because F that, and that's only created by greedy journals, I don't think he's doing

3:13:04.400 --> 3:13:09.200
 himself any favors. On the other hand, if he's shopping it, if he's talking it, if he's willing

3:13:09.200 --> 3:13:17.280
 to expose it to criticism, and to even embrace people who may not have the purest intentions,

3:13:17.280 --> 3:13:23.040
 perhaps, but in the sense of, like, they're not arguing solely to get to the truth with a capital

3:13:23.040 --> 3:13:27.520
 T, what they're trying to do is take down, hopefully those people aren't out there,

3:13:27.520 --> 3:13:33.840
 but on the other hand, looking at what Eric does for other people, looking at the fact that he has

3:13:33.840 --> 3:13:37.840
 courtesy, he will look at Wolfram, he will look at Lisey, who's one of his closest friends.

3:13:37.840 --> 3:13:40.640
 I mean, he calls him as Ant, not as Ant. Nemesis.

3:13:40.640 --> 3:13:44.080
 Nemesis, right, right. I think that's interesting that they're loving friends.

3:13:44.080 --> 3:13:49.120
 I really enjoyed that portal conversation, which, and Gary Lisey, Eric, Eric has torn about that

3:13:49.120 --> 3:13:55.440
 conversation because, I guess, because of the nemesis of the beautiful dance of minds playing

3:13:55.440 --> 3:13:58.960
 these ideas with the years of everything. Some of these things, you know, look, so fundamentally,

3:13:58.960 --> 3:14:03.280
 now, I may disagree with him, Eric, on a different aspect, which is the only one I'm capable of,

3:14:03.280 --> 3:14:08.240
 but let me say one thing, which is experimental, but let me say one thing. I understand probably

3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:13.760
 a third of what Eric's talking about with GU. I understand, you know, GR, I understand mathematics,

3:14:13.760 --> 3:14:17.840
 I understand some group theory, fiber bone, I can get a little of it, the age theory,

3:14:19.040 --> 3:14:23.360
 but I also understand what I don't understand, and I understand that there are people like

3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:29.760
 Witt and Maldesena, Nima, other people that can understand it, and they're not trying to understand.

3:14:29.760 --> 3:14:33.280
 Sabina, she can understand it. She makes all these, you know, oh, I don't understand it,

3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:37.360
 I don't want to understand it. I don't have time, and then she makes a video, a music video,

3:14:37.360 --> 3:14:41.360
 you know, kind of mocking Eric and Steven and Garrett. I'm like, oh, you have a time to do,

3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:46.400
 and I love Sabina, and I've actually promoted my show on her, and I love her, and she's doing

3:14:46.400 --> 3:14:50.880
 a wonderful job, but you have a video that you said yourself takes eight weeks to produce from

3:14:50.880 --> 3:14:55.440
 Start to Fit, and you couldn't have spent, you know, 30 minutes, two hours. I, Brian Keating,

3:14:55.440 --> 3:15:00.080
 have done it as an experimental cosmologist, and I have enough to say, like, this is interesting,

3:15:00.080 --> 3:15:03.840
 it's part of the assayer project, and it actually, I shouldn't say that there are no people,

3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:09.120
 they're very serious. Louis Alvarez Gommet at SUNY, Stony Brook, Simon Center for Geometrical

3:15:09.120 --> 3:15:13.760
 Physics, so he and I are running this seminar, hopefully this summer, we're going to reenact

3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:19.280
 the famous Shelter Island conferences in 1900s, where, you know, Feynman got together and they

3:15:19.280 --> 3:15:25.520
 calculated the lamb shift and all, but what did that feature? The harmony, the resonant minds

3:15:25.520 --> 3:15:30.400
 behind the best experimentalists in cosmology, particle physics, condensed matter physics

3:15:30.400 --> 3:15:34.560
 is now teaching us tremendous things about, you know, lower dimensional systems that can be applied.

3:15:35.680 --> 3:15:40.480
 Theorists and experimentalists, observers, cosmologists, we all were get together,

3:15:40.480 --> 3:15:45.120
 and we're just going to do it out of a spirit of love, but if it's just like, oh, this guy's like

3:15:45.120 --> 3:15:49.200
 a loud man, I don't have time for that. I really don't. I don't think it's an interesting way to

3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:56.400
 spend my time. There's an aspect that I hope to see, and it goes back to our sort of discussion

3:15:56.400 --> 3:16:01.840
 about Joe Rogan. I do hope to see sort of love and humility in the presentation, like, let go of

3:16:01.840 --> 3:16:09.440
 this kind of fear of your ideas being stolen and the ego that's inherent to the scientific pursuit,

3:16:09.440 --> 3:16:17.680
 and not that everybody is established and known entities. Let go of that a little bit so we can

3:16:18.240 --> 3:16:22.480
 explore and celebrate ideas. I would love to see more of that, just because you're saying,

3:16:22.480 --> 3:16:25.440
 especially with these big ideas of theories of everything.

3:16:25.440 --> 3:16:28.960
 And I've talked, I mean, this isn't talking in tales out of school, but I mean,

3:16:28.960 --> 3:16:32.560
 he has made claims that I fundamentally disagree with, you know, in terms of like,

3:16:33.120 --> 3:16:37.280
 you know, he's had this Twitter baiting, you know, loving trolling of Elon, you know,

3:16:37.280 --> 3:16:40.000
 why are you spending all this money to get to Mars? You know, we should be spending money on

3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:44.400
 interdimensional travel and we can unlock it. And I said to him, like, and he makes the point,

3:16:44.400 --> 3:16:50.880
 you know, that, oh, the atomic theory, you know, that unleashed the nuclear age and that, you know,

3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:56.160
 could lead to planetary destruction. But I make the point pushing back with love on him. And I

3:16:56.160 --> 3:17:00.560
 say, look, nobody looked into the equations, you know, like Fermi didn't like look into all these

3:17:00.560 --> 3:17:05.200
 equations of the unification, which still doesn't exist. By the way, we spent all this time, Lex,

3:17:05.200 --> 3:17:09.520
 and I don't know why it is, it's a phenomenon purely in theoretical physics. People are looking for

3:17:09.520 --> 3:17:14.000
 the toe, and they're overlooking the gut. In other words, they're spending all this time in

3:17:14.000 --> 3:17:18.160
 the theory of everything, the God equate, and there's this gut that unifies the three stronger

3:17:18.160 --> 3:17:22.640
 forces. We don't have a single theory for that. And people like lash out, they've tried and failed

3:17:22.640 --> 3:17:27.360
 at it. For people don't know, there's four forces, gut grant unification theories that

3:17:27.360 --> 3:17:31.840
 unifies the three forces stuff and don't try to get a shortcut to the theory of everything,

3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:37.040
 which unifies the four. And then there's this whole thing that may be quantum gravity is not

3:17:37.040 --> 3:17:47.440
 even a thing. So we're trying to solve, we're trying to solve the puzzle of everything at the

3:17:47.440 --> 3:17:54.000
 physics level. And then already before solving it, already saying once we solve it, here's going to

3:17:54.000 --> 3:18:05.680
 be all the beautiful time. Yeah, I suppose you need that kind of ego, that confidence,

3:18:06.800 --> 3:18:11.280
 that ambition in order to even have a chance at some of these. The only two people in this

3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:16.720
 book of Nine Noble Laureates who told me they don't have the imposter syndrome or two theorists,

3:18:16.720 --> 3:18:21.760
 Frank Wilczuk and Sheldon Glashow. And Frank, is it pretty interesting? And I know eventually

3:18:21.760 --> 3:18:26.240
 we're going to talk about the meaning of life, but you talk about Frank. Frank invented this

3:18:26.240 --> 3:18:33.520
 theory along with his advisor and another third person in the early 1970s, which from 1974,

3:18:33.520 --> 3:18:37.200
 three, when he was a Princeton, all the way up until 2004, when he won the Nobel Prize, every

3:18:37.200 --> 3:18:41.760
 day of his life. Imagine this, Lex, you're going to have this startup, someone tells you're going

3:18:41.760 --> 3:18:46.960
 to win a lottery. You're going to win a lottery in 40 years. What becomes your singular focus

3:18:46.960 --> 3:18:55.600
 in your life from now until the next 40 years? Well, I'm not sure. I mean, would it be winning

3:18:55.600 --> 3:18:59.760
 a lottery or if I'm so confident? I'm saying you're guaranteed to win a lottery. Here's this

3:18:59.760 --> 3:19:02.880
 wallet, Bitcoin wallet. It's going to guarantee you don't have this much money. It's stablecoin,

3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:07.920
 whatever. You're going to win it 40, but you have to wait 40 years. To me, it would be surviving

3:19:07.920 --> 3:19:12.320
 for the next 40 years. You wouldn't leave your house. You would go out in a bubble wrap hat.

3:19:12.320 --> 3:19:17.120
 You wouldn't go out with that 20 masks on, right? Your whole life would be consumed with... Now,

3:19:17.120 --> 3:19:20.080
 imagine everyone's telling you you're going to win the Nobel Prize, which is bigger than the

3:19:20.080 --> 3:19:24.960
 lottery. I mean, many P prizes are worth more than the Nobel Prize, and every person who wins a prize

3:19:24.960 --> 3:19:29.600
 that's worth three times the money, like Maldesena, he would trade the breakthrough prize for a Nobel

3:19:29.600 --> 3:19:35.360
 Prize and a heartbeat. So these guys had to wait 40 years. Imagine the excruciating pain.

3:19:35.360 --> 3:19:39.600
 What got him through it? He didn't feel like he didn't deserve it. He felt like, hell, yeah,

3:19:39.600 --> 3:19:45.280
 I earned it. He has that swagger. And what I'm looking for in this asset is to try to find

3:19:45.920 --> 3:19:49.360
 ways that we can test stuff now, because I don't know if I'm going to be here in 40 years. I hope

3:19:49.360 --> 3:19:54.000
 I am. But can we bypass? Can we get shortcuts? What's called the low energy regime? And to me,

3:19:54.000 --> 3:19:59.200
 that's what's interesting. What can we do now? I don't care. Isaac Newton came up with color

3:19:59.200 --> 3:20:02.000
 theory, and he did something really interesting. Next time I come, I'll bring you some prisms.

3:20:02.000 --> 3:20:06.320
 So what did he do? He took a white light. He took a prism from the sun, actually. He put it through

3:20:06.320 --> 3:20:10.880
 a slit, put it through a prism, and it made a beautiful rainbow, like you've seen. And then he

3:20:10.880 --> 3:20:15.440
 took another prism, and he put it upside down, like, you know, dark side of the moon, whatever.

3:20:15.440 --> 3:20:18.880
 And the light went through the first prism, turned into a rainbow, and then the rainbow

3:20:18.880 --> 3:20:24.160
 went into a prism and came out a white light. That's pretty cool. Then he took a popsicle stick

3:20:24.160 --> 3:20:29.520
 or whatever, a pipe tobacco, and he put it in the beam, like, blocked out the orange,

3:20:29.520 --> 3:20:33.920
 and it didn't make white light come out. So he showed, like, colors of synthesis.

3:20:33.920 --> 3:20:38.720
 It's a common... He didn't use, like, the Large Hadron Collider to do that. You know, he used a

3:20:38.720 --> 3:20:43.280
 very low energy experiment to prove a unification in this color physics and different kind of color

3:20:43.280 --> 3:20:47.680
 physics than in quantum chromodynamics. But nevertheless, can we find things like that?

3:20:47.680 --> 3:20:52.000
 Are we spending way too much time and energy thinking about the future circular collider,

3:20:52.000 --> 3:20:56.000
 which, even if it gets built, will cost $30 billion just to build? By the way, any time,

3:20:56.000 --> 3:20:59.920
 from now on, if I leave you with anything, any time an experimental physicist tells you a number,

3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:04.640
 always double it, maybe triple it. How much is it going to cost? To operate it. So, like, do we

3:21:04.640 --> 3:21:09.680
 build an aircraft carrier to build an aircraft carrier? Do we build a nuclear reactor, a semiconductor

3:21:09.680 --> 3:21:13.440
 facility? And the rule of thumb that works pretty well in project management is it costs about 10

3:21:13.440 --> 3:21:19.120
 percent per year to operate a given object of sufficient complexity. And in this case, so in

3:21:19.120 --> 3:21:23.280
 10 years, it'll cost double the cost. So never believe a number, whether it's from our mutual

3:21:23.280 --> 3:21:28.000
 friend Harry or whoever, don't believe the number. Double it and then say, is it worth it? And so

3:21:28.000 --> 3:21:32.960
 building a solar system size accelerator, even if it were possible, do we have to do that? Or can

3:21:32.960 --> 3:21:39.600
 we use these two 30 solar mass objects colliding together to test the number of large extra spatial

3:21:39.600 --> 3:21:44.800
 dimensions? Can we do that? People are working on it. I think it's fascinating. So focus on building

3:21:44.800 --> 3:21:55.840
 detectors. Experiments. That, like, where the cosmos is part of the experiment, I suppose,

3:21:55.840 --> 3:22:01.280
 that's doing the hard work. Because when you're saying low energy regime, because for some of these,

3:22:01.280 --> 3:22:06.400
 especially big questions like theories of everything, you need some high energy events.

3:22:07.200 --> 3:22:12.320
 And so somehow figure out how the high energy events that are already happening out there,

3:22:12.320 --> 3:22:18.160
 how to leverage them to understand here on Earth. So one of the alternative theories of

3:22:18.160 --> 3:22:22.720
 cosmology that is not singular quantum gravitational requiring as the Big Bang and

3:22:22.720 --> 3:22:29.200
 inflation are, are these balancing models. Some of them feature a similar kind of entity called

3:22:29.200 --> 3:22:34.560
 the quantum field. And that quantum field in the initial stages of the universe of our current,

3:22:34.560 --> 3:22:39.200
 after the bounce, which is not a singularity, it compresses to a classical kind of rebound,

3:22:39.200 --> 3:22:44.880
 and the universe starts expanding. During that process, the expansion is governed by what's

3:22:44.880 --> 3:22:49.440
 called a scalar field, of which we only know one that exists. That's called the Higgs boson. Higgs

3:22:49.440 --> 3:22:56.240
 is a scalar fundamental particle, fundamental field. That field then later does double duty,

3:22:56.240 --> 3:23:01.760
 and it becomes dark energy. So it solves two problems. And I'm not saying it's correct,

3:23:01.760 --> 3:23:06.240
 we don't know yet. But are there observations of, and so dark energy is manifest today,

3:23:06.240 --> 3:23:12.080
 it's manifest in properties we see in supernova explosions, etc., etc. We see the effects of

3:23:12.080 --> 3:23:17.600
 accelerating universe caused by presumably dark energy. Is dark energy a constant, or does it vary?

3:23:17.600 --> 3:23:22.400
 That has to vary in order for this theory to be true, because that eventually has to decay so

3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:27.120
 that the universe can not support itself and collapse again, again, classically. So we could

3:23:27.120 --> 3:23:31.280
 use low energy phenomena. It's hard to think of supernova as being a low energy phenomenon,

3:23:31.280 --> 3:23:35.680
 but we use that as a tracer of the cosmic expansion field and see, does it change or

3:23:35.680 --> 3:23:40.080
 is it a constant? That's an example of a low energy limit to prove a high energy phenomenon

3:23:40.080 --> 3:23:45.600
 like this collapsing universe in the cyclic model. Speaking of things that cost a lot, but are super

3:23:45.600 --> 3:23:57.280
 exciting. Page two? No, we'll wrap it up. There's more than page two. What do you think this is?

3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:04.480
 Louis de Broglie's thesis was three pages long. Anyone want to know about prize for the wave

3:24:04.480 --> 3:24:12.480
 particle duality? So size matters in different dimensions in life. I think the lessons I've

3:24:12.480 --> 3:24:19.520
 learned about life is the short of the paper or the short of the thesis. Some of the greatest

3:24:19.520 --> 3:24:25.920
 papers I've ever written are short. I feel like some of the best ideas in this world,

3:24:25.920 --> 3:24:30.240
 not to sound like a contradiction of Feynman, a contradiction on top of a contradiction,

3:24:30.240 --> 3:24:36.720
 but it could be written on a napkin, honestly, which just kind of tells you something about ideas.

3:24:36.720 --> 3:24:49.840
 What are your thoughts about the James Webb Space Telescope? Is this somebody who likes telescopes

3:24:49.840 --> 3:24:58.240
 and this is one of the, I think it says, took 20 years to build, $9.7 billion. Is that way too

3:24:58.240 --> 3:25:03.680
 much too little? Are you excited about this thing? It's sufficiently different from what I do in my

3:25:03.680 --> 3:25:10.240
 field that it's incredibly interesting to me because I have no horse in that race and so I'm

3:25:10.240 --> 3:25:15.040
 not competing with them for time or money or resources or people or whatever. So I can purely

3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:21.680
 be an advocate and an aficionado of science. It is in some sense the successor to Hubble.

3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:28.240
 It will do things that Hubble can't do. It will also may or may not have the impact on a visceral

3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:33.520
 kind of artistic level that Hubble had. What are some of the most iconic things that Hubble did?

3:25:34.080 --> 3:25:40.560
 The Hubble Ultra Deep Field, the pillars of creation, storms and imaging of these twisted

3:25:40.560 --> 3:25:46.320
 deep sky galaxies, those resonated with the public. Just visually, they're beautiful.

3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:51.280
 Yeah, when you look at these images, the Hubble Ultra Deep Field, you'll maybe put that in,

3:25:51.280 --> 3:25:57.200
 you'll show every speck of light except for one, 4,000 blobs of light. There's one star in our

3:25:57.200 --> 3:26:02.400
 galaxy, the rest are galaxies. Now, that image is less than one tenth of your fingernail held

3:26:02.400 --> 3:26:08.400
 out at arm's length. It contains 4,000 galaxies. So now you can figure out how many galaxies there are

3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:12.640
 in the whole sky just by seeing how long does it take you to move your fingernail over the whole

3:26:12.640 --> 3:26:17.680
 sky. So we have another couple of hours. No, so it comes out to be that's how we get 500 billion

3:26:17.680 --> 3:26:22.720
 or more galaxies. Now, it's not exact to the galaxy, but it's a good order of magnitude estimate,

3:26:22.720 --> 3:26:27.520
 maybe even better. Hubble produced that and it was basically serendipitous. They pointed to some

3:26:27.520 --> 3:26:31.680
 dark blank piece of sky what they thought was blank and they saw it. Same thing that happened

3:26:31.680 --> 3:26:35.360
 with the CMB. They were looking for something they didn't find. Same thing they found when they

3:26:35.360 --> 3:26:41.920
 were looking for the deceleration of the universe and found it was accelerating. So what I sometimes

3:26:41.920 --> 3:26:46.000
 hear is that we don't know what we're going to discover. I never think that's a good idea to

3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:50.160
 spend billions of dollars on something. You should have some guaranteed low hanging fruit

3:26:50.160 --> 3:26:55.520
 and then there should be swinging for the fences. And I think in this case, it was really everything

3:26:55.520 --> 3:26:58.640
 is swinging for the fences because it's either it's kind of a single point failure. If that

3:26:58.640 --> 3:27:05.280
 telescope, which is this origami construction of 22 hexagonal panels that have to unfold properly

3:27:05.280 --> 3:27:10.160
 and then orient themselves a million miles from Earth beyond the Earth Moon distance by a factor of

3:27:10.160 --> 3:27:16.880
 four and still transmit telecommunication back to the Earth, get solar energy, keep it away from

3:27:16.880 --> 3:27:20.960
 the sun. You don't want to look through the telescope of the sun with your remaining good eye

3:27:20.960 --> 3:27:27.040
 and you do that and you cover. It's going to be phenomenal for science, for sure, if it works.

3:27:27.760 --> 3:27:33.440
 There are a lot of people think it's so risky. NASA sunk so much of their budget, it ate up

3:27:33.440 --> 3:27:37.760
 and what if it does fail? I mean, there's no guarantee. Yes, it's insured, but so what? You're

3:27:37.760 --> 3:27:41.440
 not going to get back those 20 years of people. Well, let's start building it again. They didn't

3:27:41.440 --> 3:27:50.640
 build two copies of it. And then if it fails, it kind of has a dampening effect on the prospects

3:27:50.640 --> 3:27:54.400
 and the inspiration of the public for what science can do, what science engineer can do

3:27:54.400 --> 3:27:58.800
 is all in space. It will make a huge impact scientific. Let's hope for the best. Let's assume

3:27:58.800 --> 3:28:04.720
 it does succeed. It's launched in a couple of weeks and when it does, it will transform our

3:28:04.720 --> 3:28:11.040
 understanding of we just discovered not only like extra solar planets that have moons on them

3:28:11.040 --> 3:28:15.520
 and asteroid belt, we discovered an extra solar planet in another galaxy. This will be able to

3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:22.880
 see crazy stuff like that, spectroscopy, imaging. But it will be able to go back farther in time

3:28:22.880 --> 3:28:27.280
 such that we will be doing cosmology. Hubble did some cosmology and measured the Hubble constant.

3:28:27.280 --> 3:28:33.360
 That was its key project when it was designed and launched. But because it is optical telescope,

3:28:33.360 --> 3:28:38.320
 it's sensitive to more close in redshift, so shorter distances. Now, James Webb is much,

3:28:38.320 --> 3:28:41.520
 much higher redshift. It can probe the darker, deeper distant universe.

3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:46.480
 Okay. Let's talk about not the distant universe, but our neighboring planets.

3:28:47.120 --> 3:28:55.040
 First, I got to ask you about the moon. So there's a piece of the moon on this table

3:28:55.040 --> 3:28:59.520
 that you've given me that we didn't have to pick up that arrived here.

3:29:00.080 --> 3:29:03.360
 That's right. So how did a piece of the moon arrive here on Earth?

3:29:03.360 --> 3:29:10.160
 So this chunk of the moon, if it were delivered by the Apollo and NASA missions,

3:29:10.160 --> 3:29:14.480
 you and I would be guilty of a felony right now because they legal to own pieces of the moon

3:29:14.480 --> 3:29:18.800
 collected by the Apollo astronauts. So don't even joke about that when you go over to Houston.

3:29:19.520 --> 3:29:23.680
 This piece of moon, rock, was delivered via the old fashioned way by gravity. So

3:29:24.400 --> 3:29:30.560
 this was a chunk of the moon, which is blasted off because the moon gets bombarded by asteroids

3:29:30.560 --> 3:29:35.360
 and meteoroids. Some of them eject material from the surface of the moon into space.

3:29:36.080 --> 3:29:42.960
 And it will then orbit the common moon Earth system. And it will then eventually enter our

3:29:42.960 --> 3:29:47.680
 atmosphere. And if the piece is large enough and the trajectory is proper, it can land intact.

3:29:47.680 --> 3:29:53.040
 And this one landed with a few hundred grams worth and they sliced it up. And then it was

3:29:53.040 --> 3:29:58.080
 delivered via US Postal Service to my house. So you can buy these pieces and actually you can buy

3:29:58.080 --> 3:30:03.280
 a piece of Mars. You can buy a piece of Mars delivered by the same route. Now, what's so

3:30:03.280 --> 3:30:07.680
 interesting about that? Well, if a piece of Mars can get here, a piece of Earth can get there,

3:30:08.560 --> 3:30:13.840
 some piece of Earth has some life forms on it, it could get there. And if that can happen in our

3:30:13.840 --> 3:30:18.320
 solar system, it could happen throughout the galaxy. So I'm actually not of the opinion

3:30:18.320 --> 3:30:23.440
 that there is life elsewhere in the universe, at least technological life that we can see.

3:30:23.440 --> 3:30:30.000
 I see this look of horror on your face. I view it, I am personally extremely pessimistic,

3:30:30.000 --> 3:30:33.760
 would be extremely surprised. I'm just, I'm curious by the transition,

3:30:34.400 --> 3:30:40.560
 because you just said that life could have arrived from Mars or like from planet to planet

3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:45.600
 by because of the meteorite striking it and so on. Yeah. And then you went to, you don't think

3:30:45.600 --> 3:30:50.640
 there might be life out there in the universe. Technological life. Technological life,

3:30:50.640 --> 3:30:56.400
 yeah, advanced intelligence civilizations. Okay. Okay, so go on.

3:30:56.400 --> 3:31:00.960
 Yeah. So that's the generalization of what the famous astronomer Fred Hoyle called,

3:31:00.960 --> 3:31:05.360
 I know this is a PG 13 power, it's called panspermia. Panspermia.

3:31:06.320 --> 3:31:09.680
 Beep that out, please. Yeah, please. And that's the exchange of

3:31:10.800 --> 3:31:16.640
 genetic life form material from other reaches on Earth, which explains the origin of life on Earth,

3:31:16.640 --> 3:31:21.120
 but not the origin of life itself, which I think is a much grander mystery and much more interesting.

3:31:22.000 --> 3:31:25.120
 How did life get here? And you've talked with many eminent people about that.

3:31:25.840 --> 3:31:30.240
 I'm not going to add that much, but just thinking about the reverse process. Let's say

3:31:30.240 --> 3:31:35.280
 life started on the Earth somehow and then made its way out into the universe. Is there enough

3:31:35.280 --> 3:31:41.600
 time for the whatever material went from Earth via panspermic direction, spraying the love gun

3:31:41.600 --> 3:31:46.320
 out into the universe, did that then have enough time to incubate and go onto a planet that could

3:31:46.320 --> 3:31:51.440
 support it? Certainly not within our solar system, which traveling at the meteorite speeds would

3:31:51.440 --> 3:31:57.040
 require hundreds of millions of years, then looking at the evolutionary history from bacteria to Bach,

3:31:57.680 --> 3:32:01.680
 from rocks to Rachmaninoff. I don't know, I can do this all day.

3:32:01.680 --> 3:32:02.800
 Oh, wow, that's pretty good.

3:32:02.800 --> 3:32:07.200
 How do you get from those very simple inanimate objects to life? I just simply think there's

3:32:07.200 --> 3:32:10.640
 not enough time for Earth to seed life, technological life throughout the galaxy. I

3:32:10.640 --> 3:32:12.480
 don't think there's any evidence for that.

3:32:12.480 --> 3:32:19.840
 But so you really think that the origin of life on Earth is a really special event.

3:32:19.840 --> 3:32:25.600
 Yeah, if it did originate on Earth, my question for those that search for life outside the Earth

3:32:26.160 --> 3:32:32.160
 is what if you had a letter from God and the letter said life didn't originate on Earth?

3:32:32.160 --> 3:32:36.880
 Like, would you choose a different profession? It would seem hopeless. In other words,

3:32:36.880 --> 3:32:40.160
 we only have a sample of one. In fact, we only know of one conscious life form,

3:32:40.160 --> 3:32:44.960
 let alone one planet that has life on it. What if you knew for sure it didn't start here?

3:32:44.960 --> 3:32:50.720
 That means that there's almost nothing about Earth that is originated. It didn't

3:32:50.720 --> 3:32:54.480
 originate the life process. So to study purely the origin of life, not life itself,

3:32:54.480 --> 3:32:59.360
 I think that's still fascinating. But how could we learn about the origin of, remember,

3:32:59.360 --> 3:33:04.080
 you have to go from inanimate object to a living object, whatever that definition of life is.

3:33:04.080 --> 3:33:09.360
 And I'm not an expert in many definitions, Max, Sarah, many different definitions.

3:33:09.360 --> 3:33:14.640
 But how do you actually go from inanimate to animate? It's a huge question.

3:33:14.640 --> 3:33:20.160
 Yeah, but then you don't have to be the place where life originated to replicate the origin.

3:33:21.600 --> 3:33:27.440
 Yeah, that's one way to understand something is to build it. But another way is to just observe

3:33:27.440 --> 3:33:37.040
 it. You don't have to truly reengineer for scratch. But then, yes, if it didn't originate on Earth,

3:33:37.040 --> 3:33:43.440
 then your intuitions about the basic prerequisites of life are off.

3:33:43.440 --> 3:33:49.520
 What's the governing principle? And then you can have just an almost an arbitrary number

3:33:50.240 --> 3:33:58.480
 of possible, like, if life didn't start on Earth. So to me, that's exciting because

3:33:58.480 --> 3:34:04.320
 it's like, we know even less than we thought. The thing is, it can prosper on Earth though.

3:34:04.320 --> 3:34:11.120
 Yeah. So maybe the origin of life is fundamentally different from the maintenance of life.

3:34:11.120 --> 3:34:17.200
 Right. And maybe the existence of the Earth life symbiosis is critical. I think Sarah,

3:34:17.200 --> 3:34:22.880
 you talked about Sarah Walker, that it's a planetary phenomenon, etc. So doesn't that

3:34:22.880 --> 3:34:28.000
 make it less like, in other words, not only do you need special life conditions to create life,

3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:34.560
 but then sustenance of life, as you say, that also has to be maintained under very specific

3:34:34.560 --> 3:34:39.440
 circumstances by very specific planets and with very specific tectonic activity and moon.

3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:44.000
 And by the way, you need a Jupiter nearby. You need an Earth and a moon system so that you

3:34:44.000 --> 3:34:48.560
 don't get bombarded too early. And I always think like this, like, technological life.

3:34:48.560 --> 3:34:52.080
 I haven't said this before, really, so I'm just speaking. I usually like to write down before I

3:34:52.080 --> 3:34:55.120
 say this differently. But one of the things I thought about this... Somebody hosts a podcast.

3:34:55.120 --> 3:35:00.080
 You should probably accept the fact that you're going to say stupid things every once in a while.

3:35:00.080 --> 3:35:06.320
 Not every once in a while. Every while. I claim that, you know, to get to sending, you know,

3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:12.000
 people to the moon, you know, our planet needed whales and dinosaurs, right? Like,

3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:16.960
 you don't make a solar panel from another solar panel. Like, you made a solar panel from a factory

3:35:16.960 --> 3:35:21.520
 that melted down glass, silica, you know, aluminum extruded that using fossil fuels.

3:35:21.520 --> 3:35:26.000
 Where do those fossil fuels come from? Like, so any civilization that's going to be a Dyson,

3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:31.120
 you know, Kardashev's, do they have dinosaurs? Like, do they have, like, prebiotic life?

3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:36.000
 Did they have a great oxygenation event? Did they have a dimorphism between prokaryotic,

3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:40.080
 eukaryotic? All those hurdles... Let's say you give each one... Let's say there's eight hurdles.

3:35:40.720 --> 3:35:44.560
 And each one of those has a probability of one in the thousand to go from, you know,

3:35:44.560 --> 3:35:48.720
 eukaryotic, prokaryotic, whatever. Let's say that's a one in a thousand chance. I think it's like one

3:35:48.720 --> 3:35:53.040
 in 10 to the 40th or whatever if you really do it. But let's say it's first generous nature,

3:35:53.040 --> 3:35:57.680
 one in 10 to the 3. Let's say there's eight of those hurdles. That means you have, you know,

3:35:57.680 --> 3:36:05.360
 10 to the 24th power, different possibility. And that's just with eight. Like, the moon has to be

3:36:05.360 --> 3:36:08.720
 there, Jupiter has to be there, dinosaurs had to be there, all the different things that we have

3:36:08.720 --> 3:36:15.120
 to get to technological life. There's only 10 to the... Only. There's 10 to the 22nd, we think,

3:36:15.120 --> 3:36:21.680
 earth, not earth, planets in the observable universe, not the galaxy. So that's 100 times

3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:27.600
 fewer than the probability to get, you know, 100% clearing these eight very low hurdles of one in

3:36:27.600 --> 3:36:31.920
 a thousand. That's fascinating. Because now I really need to listen to your conversation with

3:36:31.920 --> 3:36:38.320
 Lee Cronin, who I believe you had, because he believes the opposite. Yes, I'm gonna have a debate

3:36:38.320 --> 3:36:47.040
 with him. He believes that the way biology evolved on earth could have evolved almost an

3:36:47.040 --> 3:36:51.680
 infinite number of other ways. So like, if you ran earth over and over and over, you would keep

3:36:51.680 --> 3:36:59.200
 getting life and it'll be very different. So the fact that our particular life seems unique

3:36:59.920 --> 3:37:04.960
 is just like, well, because every freaking life is going to seem unique, but it'll be very different.

3:37:04.960 --> 3:37:10.560
 It's not like we shouldn't be asking the question of what's the likelihood of getting a human like

3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:22.000
 thing. Because that seems to be super special. It's more like, how easy is it to make anything

3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:27.840
 that has the skills of a human. And I don't mean like something with thumbs, but achieving basically

3:37:27.840 --> 3:37:34.000
 a technological civilization. And according to Lee, at least, it's like, it's trivial. I know,

3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:37.520
 we fought a little bit. I'd love to debate him. I think it'd be a lot of fun because we debate

3:37:37.520 --> 3:37:41.440
 with love when I talk with Lee, I love him and he loves me, I think. I hope. But let me ask you

3:37:41.440 --> 3:37:46.720
 a question. I asked this of him and Sarah on our clubhouse ones. So what do you think would happen

3:37:46.720 --> 3:37:54.800
 the next day? Let's say we discovered life. It's Proxima Centauri B. It looks just like slime mold,

3:37:54.800 --> 3:38:00.240
 like you get on your breed cheese or whatever. We discover it. What would happen the next day?

3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:05.040
 And they were like, oh, this would be transformative. And I'm not trying to be

3:38:05.040 --> 3:38:08.640
 like, you know, total Cassandra about this. But I said, I don't think anything would happen.

3:38:09.760 --> 3:38:13.680
 What are you talking about? This would be transformational. I'm like, I stipulate that life

3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:17.760
 exists. Go down to like the river, you know, I'm in San Diego, go down to the Pacific Ocean,

3:38:17.760 --> 3:38:23.760
 scoop up a glass, you know, you're gonna find life in there. And what are we doing? What are we

3:38:23.760 --> 3:38:29.280
 doing to our earth? We're destroying it callously. We're like pumping crap into there. Like we have

3:38:29.280 --> 3:38:33.920
 this toxic waste bill a couple of months ago in San Diego, I couldn't go to the beach. Let me take

3:38:33.920 --> 3:38:39.040
 it a step further. You know how many people, I'm sorry that you do know, but how many people died

3:38:39.040 --> 3:38:45.120
 in the 20th century killed? These are advanced civil. This isn't slime mold. We kill, we mean,

3:38:45.120 --> 3:38:50.880
 we harm, we hurt, we hate. I don't think anything would happen the next day. We go back to what

3:38:50.880 --> 3:38:54.880
 we had and I said, if that weren't proof enough, life has been discovered at least two or three

3:38:54.880 --> 3:39:01.280
 times just in my professional career. Once in 1996, these Alan Landhills meteorites in Antarctica,

3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:06.560
 so like microbial respiration processes, still we don't know. It was a press conference held by

3:39:06.560 --> 3:39:11.760
 Bill Clinton on the White House lawn that's featured in the movie Contact. We purpose for that movie.

3:39:12.800 --> 3:39:20.320
 And then there's this phosphorus life, this toxic life in the pools of Mono Lake,

3:39:20.320 --> 3:39:26.480
 many, you know, extremophile, we don't give a crap. We continue to treat. So why are we thinking

3:39:26.480 --> 3:39:31.360
 that like our salvation, from whence will our salvation come as the Bible says? Like, it's not

3:39:31.360 --> 3:39:36.640
 going to change how we are. It's not going to magnify how I treat you or you treat me. And we're

3:39:36.640 --> 3:39:40.640
 pretty knowledgeable people you and I compared to, you know, laypeople. Okay, that's interesting.

3:39:40.640 --> 3:39:48.800
 That's a really interesting argument. I wonder if you're right, but my intuition is I can maybe

3:39:48.800 --> 3:39:53.520
 present a different argument that you can think about in the realm of things you care about,

3:39:53.520 --> 3:39:58.640
 even deeper, which is like, what happens once we figure out the origins of the universe?

3:39:58.640 --> 3:40:03.280
 Like how would that change your life? I would say there are certain discoveries

3:40:03.280 --> 3:40:08.480
 that even in their very ideal will change the fabric of society. I tend to see if there's

3:40:08.480 --> 3:40:15.680
 definitive proof that there's life in the more complex, the more powerful that idea is elsewhere

3:40:15.680 --> 3:40:23.600
 that I'm not exactly sure how it will change society because it's such a slap in the face.

3:40:24.480 --> 3:40:29.680
 It's like such a humbling force, or maybe not, or maybe it's a motivator to say,

3:40:31.040 --> 3:40:34.960
 yeah, I don't know which force would take over. Maybe it'll be governments with military

3:40:36.080 --> 3:40:41.360
 start to think like, well, how do we kill it? If there's a lot of life out there,

3:40:41.360 --> 3:40:47.120
 how do we create the defenses? How do we extract it? Or mine it for benefits?

3:40:47.840 --> 3:40:51.840
 I mean, I just see like there's 100 million literal counter examples of that. I mean,

3:40:52.480 --> 3:40:59.200
 right now there's like 700 million kids in poverty. How do we go about our life and just

3:40:59.200 --> 3:41:04.720
 not deal with that? I mean, look, I put it aside. I eat hamburgers, and 100 years I'll be canceled

3:41:04.720 --> 3:41:10.240
 for being a carnivore or whatever. So obviously to get through life, you have to make certain

3:41:10.240 --> 3:41:14.560
 compromise. You're not going to think about certain things. But I just think there is a

3:41:14.560 --> 3:41:18.560
 sort of wish fulfillment. Like every time there's, why are we going to Mars and digging and flying

3:41:18.560 --> 3:41:23.040
 this cool ass helicopter? We're looking for water. Like stipulate that water was there.

3:41:23.600 --> 3:41:27.520
 Like I believe there was water. I think we should investigate and see what the geology was like.

3:41:27.520 --> 3:41:29.600
 But don't you think, so you're saying?

3:41:29.600 --> 3:41:32.880
 I don't think you're going to get meaning from it. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying it's

3:41:32.880 --> 3:41:37.920
 not worth doing. I'm just saying there's a wish fulfillment aspect that people will find meaning

3:41:37.920 --> 3:41:45.200
 for life from science. Okay. But there's a complicated line here. What if it's this

3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:53.600
 intelligence civilization living, obviously, probably not on Mars, but somewhere like in a

3:41:53.600 --> 3:42:01.280
 neighboring galaxy that we, sorry, in a neighboring star system that we discover.

3:42:02.160 --> 3:42:05.200
 Don't you think that profound change in meaning?

3:42:05.200 --> 3:42:09.760
 I mean, I guess, again, I assume that because of this pansemaramic process or whatever,

3:42:09.760 --> 3:42:15.760
 that the probability is much, much greater than zero. I mean, it's not one 100%, but it's much

3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:20.800
 likelier than that, that at least some living material from Earth has ejaculated itself into

3:42:20.800 --> 3:42:23.280
 the solar system, into the universe, right, into our galaxy.

3:42:23.280 --> 3:42:26.080
 Beats that, please. As well.

3:42:26.080 --> 3:42:31.600
 That's right. So the fact that that could happen and that you're holding a piece from a planetary

3:42:31.600 --> 3:42:37.600
 body, one that couldn't support life as far as we know. But next time, if you play nice and you

3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:42.000
 come on my podcast someday, I will give you a tiny chunk of Mars. So Mars theoretically could

3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:43.440
 support stuff, right? Moving on up.

3:42:43.440 --> 3:42:47.440
 So yeah. So I believe that there could be remnants of Earth in this. So that means

3:42:47.440 --> 3:42:50.640
 there could be evolution. I don't think there's any chance that there's like,

3:42:51.280 --> 3:42:53.680
 people using iPhones and having podcasts and stuff.

3:42:53.680 --> 3:42:56.960
 No, there's so much, some chance, though, right?

3:42:56.960 --> 3:43:02.720
 Again, yeah. I think the, well, the simple statement to say,

3:43:02.720 --> 3:43:07.200
 it's much, much, much higher probability that life exists than technological life exists,

3:43:07.200 --> 3:43:10.480
 right? I don't think we can argue that. It doesn't mean it's forbidden. Again,

3:43:10.480 --> 3:43:13.440
 I'm not saying any of this is forbidden, not worth studying, not interesting.

3:43:13.440 --> 3:43:14.480
 It's a likelihood thing.

3:43:14.480 --> 3:43:18.000
 Yeah. And to answer your, I think you're wise to push back and like,

3:43:18.000 --> 3:43:21.760
 what does it matter what I'm doing? And I like to think about that, you know,

3:43:21.760 --> 3:43:25.280
 because it's like, what is the value of what you're doing? Like, you have to answer that

3:43:25.280 --> 3:43:28.480
 question or else at the end of your life, you'll have these existential, you know,

3:43:28.480 --> 3:43:33.360
 kind of crises, right? So when I think about like who I am, part of my identity is

3:43:33.360 --> 3:43:37.520
 answering and asking scientific questions. For me, though, there is a religious kind of

3:43:37.520 --> 3:43:42.800
 undercurrent that does undergird in some sense, this quest. Again, I'm not like a practicing,

3:43:42.800 --> 3:43:48.640
 I'm not like wearing, you know, like I'm not like full on into my birth religion, Judaism.

3:43:49.520 --> 3:43:53.680
 But at the same token, I think as, you know, one of the things Einstein did say is that,

3:43:53.680 --> 3:44:00.960
 you know, religion without science is blind or is lame, and science without religion is lame,

3:44:00.960 --> 3:44:04.640
 is blind and lame. Anyway, the point is that like, you can't get meaning,

3:44:05.840 --> 3:44:10.000
 you know, from just knowing facts. Like Wikipedia knows more than all of us will ever know,

3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:14.720
 right? It has no wisdom. You know, wisdom, it means, you know, sapien, the word wisdom in

3:44:14.720 --> 3:44:19.520
 Latin is sapien. We are wise. And by the way, do you know what we're, what our real name is

3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:24.640
 homo sapien sapien. So it's man who knows that he knows. Do you know what he knows? Do you know

3:44:24.640 --> 3:44:29.040
 what the knowing is? It's that he's going to die. We're the only creatures that know that we are

3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:32.880
 going to die. We don't know when we're going to die. But like, you know, I have a cat,

3:44:33.760 --> 3:44:38.000
 a fierce attack cat. It's beautiful. She doesn't know when she's going to die.

3:44:38.000 --> 3:44:40.640
 It doesn't mean I'm more valuable than I think I am.

3:44:40.640 --> 3:44:46.640
 The survival instinct is fundamentally different from like the knowledge of death. And that's

3:44:46.640 --> 3:44:51.200
 where the earner specter comes in with the terror of death. And that that's a creative force

3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:57.680
 that seems to be more feature than bug about the human condition is that

3:45:00.240 --> 3:45:08.320
 I mean, it's a gift of knowing our own mortality. Yeah, to me, I mean, that's, that's why,

3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:15.520
 you know, I agree with you in some sense in terms of the aliens not being a thing that solves all

3:45:15.520 --> 3:45:21.040
 mysteries. That's why, you know, my love has always been the human mind. So understanding

3:45:22.800 --> 3:45:29.920
 who we are, what the hell are we? And I think your love has been an echo of that, which is,

3:45:29.920 --> 3:45:35.200
 where do we come from? Yeah. Or basically, as cheesy as the sounds, you know,

3:45:36.560 --> 3:45:42.800
 Michio Kaku is away with words. If you if you can just like enjoy the, you know,

3:45:42.800 --> 3:45:47.360
 he speaks in complete, he's like Sam Harris of cosmology. I mean, he speaks in complete paragraphs.

3:45:47.360 --> 3:45:53.600
 But like also unapologetically, he says, you know, we will know God, or we will know the

3:45:53.600 --> 3:46:01.520
 mind of God, or whatever the quotes, those kinds of things. That's exciting, that physics might

3:46:01.520 --> 3:46:08.880
 be able to find equations that unlock our origins at the very core. And like the fabric of it all

3:46:08.880 --> 3:46:14.080
 too. And that's just our origins. You know, what's, you know, what's at the beginning.

3:46:15.360 --> 3:46:19.120
 Something tells me we're too dumb to truly understand what's at the beginning. But

3:46:19.120 --> 3:46:22.880
 I think we should be humble in that way. I mean, again, another thing is, you know,

3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:30.480
 you ever hear the saying like we shared 99% of our DNA with chimps or bonobos or whatever.

3:46:31.120 --> 3:46:34.560
 I share like pie more than that. You know, sometimes I wish we shared like 100%.

3:46:34.560 --> 3:46:40.400
 Like, that'd be so much more interesting. Like, oh, there's 50% of a fruit fly or banana, like

3:46:41.040 --> 3:46:45.360
 no, no, no, there's something, but that should make us feel more precious. And I almost feel

3:46:45.360 --> 3:46:52.080
 like discovering life on another planet, whatever solar system, would cause a diminution of humanity.

3:46:52.080 --> 3:46:55.760
 Like the one thing I do hold fast to from a religion, I don't know where I am with God,

3:46:55.760 --> 3:47:01.760
 like, do I believe in God? I think that's an unanswerable question. But I have some thoughts

3:47:01.760 --> 3:47:07.360
 about it. But by the same token, I think the one thing I do get from religion is that every human

3:47:07.360 --> 3:47:12.720
 has infinite worth, because we are in a religious capacity considered to be equal to God. In other

3:47:12.720 --> 3:47:17.680
 words, we are gods, not to be like, you know, but we can contemplate what God did. We have aspects

3:47:17.680 --> 3:47:22.880
 of God. We have free will. God had free will. If he exists, again, I can't prove that God exists.

3:47:22.880 --> 3:47:25.200
 Otherwise, you wouldn't have any credit for believing in God.

3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:30.960
 This is interesting. I mean, it's like I'm talking to Einstein here, but let me ask anyway.

3:47:30.960 --> 3:47:32.720
 Can you clip that for my clip shot?

3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:40.000
 For somebody who's looking at the young universe, at the early universe,

3:47:42.320 --> 3:47:49.120
 and are talking about God and are agnostic, who do you think is God?

3:47:50.800 --> 3:47:56.720
 So I thought you had just like one of the best podcasts with Sam Harris this past summer.

3:47:56.720 --> 3:48:02.480
 And one of the things I liked about that conversation is he talked a lot about happiness

3:48:03.040 --> 3:48:07.120
 and meditation. And he said something that's really resonated with me, and I've been working

3:48:07.120 --> 3:48:12.480
 on it around and trying to work on it my own way. But he said like, you can never be happy.

3:48:13.840 --> 3:48:18.640
 You can only become happy. And I try to take a little bit further than that, because I think

3:48:18.640 --> 3:48:22.880
 it's interesting. Like meditation is like, you're not like, oh, I'm happy and now like,

3:48:22.880 --> 3:48:27.360
 oh, my kid came in and now I'm not happy. No, like you can be satisfied. Kurt Vonnegut said,

3:48:27.360 --> 3:48:30.240
 like, you ever catch this? Sometimes you're like walking around and you're like,

3:48:30.240 --> 3:48:35.360
 life is freaking amazing. Like I'm happy. And Kurt Vonnegut said, you should say to yourself

3:48:35.360 --> 3:48:40.160
 every time that happens, like a little mantra, like, if this isn't goodness, if this isn't happiness,

3:48:40.160 --> 3:48:45.040
 nothing is. Just remind yourself how awesome it is every breath, everything that you do,

3:48:45.040 --> 3:48:49.360
 when you make an impact, even some of the bad stuff that happens. Good, it's good.

3:48:49.360 --> 3:48:55.840
 So Sam said that. And it made me think, because I was like, well, what does it really mean to be

3:48:55.840 --> 3:49:02.480
 happy? Because like, I can think of, I can think of about, you know, two or three ways that right

3:49:02.480 --> 3:49:07.200
 now I could double my happiness. No, like win the lottery or whatever, like I could double my

3:49:07.200 --> 3:49:12.640
 happiness. There's only a few ways though, right? Like, you know, I had this kind of thought like,

3:49:12.640 --> 3:49:17.280
 how many boats can you waterski behind? Like you had twice as many followers, now you got

3:49:17.280 --> 3:49:21.440
 two million followers, five million, whatever. It doesn't do anything. It's called the hedonic

3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:26.240
 treadmill. Like once you get to a certain level, it takes a lot more, you know, change and followers,

3:49:26.240 --> 3:49:32.080
 money, impact, women, whatever you want to make you have one more quanta of happiness, right?

3:49:32.080 --> 3:49:38.640
 On the other hand, this is a concept from entropy. I could make your life miserable in an infinite

3:49:38.640 --> 3:49:43.680
 number of ways. In other words, there's more space space to make your life unhappy than happy.

3:49:43.680 --> 3:49:49.440
 And so I thought about that in the context of what Sam said about happiness. So it's sort of like,

3:49:49.440 --> 3:49:56.240
 yeah, it's an expression of entropy. And that what you should be doing in life is doing that which

3:49:56.960 --> 3:50:02.800
 will cause you devastation if it goes away. Because those are the things that like are where

3:50:02.800 --> 3:50:09.680
 you're reducing entropy, like a kid, like anyone who's a parent knows instantly what I'm talking

3:50:09.680 --> 3:50:14.800
 about. Like how to make your life a billion times worse. But there's no way to make your life a

3:50:14.800 --> 3:50:20.160
 billion times better. And so thinking about that, now turning into the question of God's existence,

3:50:20.960 --> 3:50:26.800
 I feel like there's no way that you can believe in God to quote, misquote Sam, but there's ways

3:50:26.800 --> 3:50:32.480
 that you can become a believer in God. In other words, you could increase the Bayesian confidence

3:50:32.480 --> 3:50:37.040
 level that there is some, and let's not call it God because that's a freighted term. Let's just call

3:50:37.040 --> 3:50:42.960
 it some infinite source of goodness or our beautiful power in the universe, right? Simple

3:50:42.960 --> 3:50:48.880
 things can do that. You can increase your credulity in the goodness of life. And we have this bias as

3:50:48.880 --> 3:50:55.280
 humans towards negativity. Negativity bias, well known fact. So what I want to do is let's call

3:50:55.280 --> 3:51:00.960
 God good, right? That's where it comes from. God, good, same words in German. And when we think

3:51:00.960 --> 3:51:08.080
 about what is good, let's do those things that would devastate us. And a lot of that could be

3:51:08.080 --> 3:51:16.560
 relationships. And there's a powerful concept from network theory, which is that the number of

3:51:16.560 --> 3:51:20.560
 connections in a network, you know, I'm just saying it for you, it grows as the square of the

3:51:20.560 --> 3:51:25.120
 elements in the matrix, in the number, right? So you think of a matrix with n people, you know,

3:51:25.120 --> 3:51:29.360
 person one, two, three, four, and then there's four other people, there's 16 different pairs,

3:51:29.360 --> 3:51:34.560
 but half of them overlap. The diagonal is where you know each other, you know yourself. So there's,

3:51:34.560 --> 3:51:41.840
 but that still grows as n squared. So those connections increase and decrease, right? You

3:51:41.840 --> 3:51:45.360
 ever have two friends that are fighting and like you're kind of upset, even though you're not

3:51:45.360 --> 3:51:49.040
 fighting with either one of them. So like a network grows like that. So you want to increase

3:51:49.040 --> 3:51:54.560
 your network as much as possible, but only the kind of high quality interstices between them.

3:51:54.560 --> 3:52:00.800
 And I think in doing so, you make yourself fragile, not antifragile. And I think that is

3:52:00.800 --> 3:52:04.880
 where purpose and maybe approaching some notion of God can come from.

3:52:05.440 --> 3:52:12.960
 So that is a source of meaning, maximizing the goodness in life and the way you know it's good

3:52:12.960 --> 3:52:20.000
 as if it's taken away, it would devastate you. That's one way. Think about it, your brand,

3:52:20.000 --> 3:52:25.760
 your business, your spouse, your kids. I mean, parents can't count though. I've known parents

3:52:25.760 --> 3:52:30.480
 that have. Jim Simons, here's a perfect example. He's one of my oldest friends and mentors.

3:52:31.840 --> 3:52:37.760
 He is one of the richest people on earth, Gulfstream, Megayan. This is all documented,

3:52:37.760 --> 3:52:45.440
 books about him. He lost two sons as adults. And I hear people say, I'm so jealous of Jim Simons.

3:52:45.440 --> 3:52:51.520
 Would you take everything? I don't know where he has that strength in his wife,

3:52:51.520 --> 3:52:57.920
 Marilyn, and his first wife, Barbara. I'm not, I'm not like that. Some people are,

3:52:57.920 --> 3:53:04.000
 there are angels that walk among us. And, you know, there's this famous prayer. It's like,

3:53:05.200 --> 3:53:09.600
 God, you know, there's an old saying like one of the hardest tests there are in life is to be

3:53:09.600 --> 3:53:13.440
 given a lot of money. And you see it like happens with like lawyer, like people who win the lottery

3:53:13.440 --> 3:53:18.560
 or whatever, or NFL football players after their careers over, they get, they're broke, right?

3:53:18.560 --> 3:53:22.800
 And I was like, God, please test me with money. You know, that'd be great. But, but in reality,

3:53:22.800 --> 3:53:27.360
 you should never say I'm gonna, I want what X person has, unless you're willing to take

3:53:27.360 --> 3:53:29.920
 everything. And you'll find you won't want to take everything.

3:53:32.720 --> 3:53:40.320
 Yeah, I think a lot about the altering effects of fame, of money, of power on people. I,

3:53:40.320 --> 3:53:53.600
 I, it, it blinds people. And I wonder about that for myself, because it seems like in themselves,

3:53:53.600 --> 3:54:00.800
 these are definitely not the goals I'm pretty much afraid. I'm not desirous. And I'm definitely

3:54:00.800 --> 3:54:10.000
 afraid of each of those things, money, fame, and power. But it seems the dreams I have as

3:54:10.000 --> 3:54:16.480
 consequences can often have these things. And I'm really afraid of becoming something

3:54:17.520 --> 3:54:24.240
 that would disappoint me when I was younger, that would, that wouldn't recognize, you know,

3:54:24.240 --> 3:54:30.720
 because change happens gradually. But are you using yourself as the, as the touchstone to use

3:54:30.720 --> 3:54:36.880
 the answer? Like, what is your rubric to, to a prize if you have lived up to that 12 year old,

3:54:36.880 --> 3:54:42.880
 whatever year old lacks? Like, how will you know or not know if you've let yourself down? Or like,

3:54:42.880 --> 3:54:48.160
 I always think live to impress yourself. Like, I don't care if I have followers. Like, it's nice

3:54:48.160 --> 3:54:52.720
 or whatever. But it's hedonic. And it's just never ending. Because you'll always see the next

3:54:52.720 --> 3:54:56.560
 level. But I think it's pretty damn cool that like, I've gotten to go to these places, the

3:54:56.560 --> 3:55:02.320
 South Pole, and I've done these things, and I've made a family, and I'm able to teleport my values

3:55:02.320 --> 3:55:09.440
 into the future through my children. And I've had ideological children that I, so by what metric,

3:55:09.440 --> 3:55:13.200
 you know, have you not already A, impressed yourself? And B, could you let yourself down?

3:55:13.200 --> 3:55:17.600
 I don't want to say the therapist. I just think some of it is psychology. For me, I'm very much

3:55:17.600 --> 3:55:24.160
 just never, I'm highly self critical, is that I'm never happy, never happy with what I've done.

3:55:24.160 --> 3:55:29.680
 But I'm always happy in the way that you described, which is that the Vonnegut thing,

3:55:29.680 --> 3:55:35.360
 where you just often during the day, I will feel, I don't know, I just remember

3:55:36.160 --> 3:55:44.080
 just eating beef jerky and being truly happy. That was just last night. And I have that all the

3:55:44.080 --> 3:55:52.240
 time. And that to me is why I mean, that feels to me like a healthy way to live life. And at least

3:55:52.240 --> 3:55:57.440
 for me, it's the one I really enjoy. A lot of people tell me that maybe being so self critical,

3:55:57.440 --> 3:56:02.000
 so hard on yourself is not a good way to go. But more and more as I get older,

3:56:02.000 --> 3:56:08.960
 I realized it's just who I am. You have to a certain point accept this is how I'm always

3:56:08.960 --> 3:56:13.040
 going to be the self critical. It's like they were a cold Delphi, right? You know that yourself.

3:56:13.600 --> 3:56:16.560
 But I want to leave you with one last thing. It was just to say, just on this topic,

3:56:17.440 --> 3:56:22.960
 you know, it could be different, right? We could go down to the ocean and get some krill instead

3:56:22.960 --> 3:56:29.200
 of the 711. You know, it could be that we have no other taste buds. And, you know,

3:56:29.200 --> 3:56:33.360
 Eric's talked about the four dimensions of the, you know, the vibration of your tongue, right?

3:56:33.360 --> 3:56:39.760
 It could be like there's one and it's just like not, you know, Memphis barbecue or whatever you

3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:46.080
 like in your slim gym. It could be something, it could be very boring. Similarly, what if like

3:56:46.080 --> 3:56:50.960
 that's a clue? Like what if that's giving us evidence? Here's another clue. There are many

3:56:50.960 --> 3:56:56.880
 animals, most animals have single monocolor vision. They only see in black and white intensity. They

3:56:56.880 --> 3:57:04.960
 only have rods and no cones. We could be like that, but we're not. Why is that not a clue? Like

3:57:06.720 --> 3:57:10.560
 God's not going to like hit you over the head and say like, here I am because then everybody

3:57:10.560 --> 3:57:14.080
 would believe in him. And there's very simplistic. I've had debates even with like famous atheists

3:57:14.080 --> 3:57:19.840
 like Lawrence Krauss, who's like self declared militant atheists. And I was like, well, I don't

3:57:19.840 --> 3:57:24.160
 believe in the same God you don't believe in, like some guy in a white beard and a chair. Like

3:57:24.160 --> 3:57:29.840
 that's infantile. Like I gave that away a long time ago. But what if there are clues? What if

3:57:29.840 --> 3:57:35.360
 Yang Mills theory, you know, Maxwell's equation, like what, those are beautiful. If you've ever

3:57:35.360 --> 3:57:41.360
 seen like, you know, expressed in tensor notation, Einstein's equations or, or Maxwell's equations

3:57:41.360 --> 3:57:46.720
 or, and then Maxwell's equations riding on Einstein's, it's unbelievably beautiful.

3:57:46.720 --> 3:57:52.960
 It doesn't have to be that way. That we can comprehend it. That's a crack. Maybe that's where

3:57:52.960 --> 3:57:58.960
 the light gets in. And the light is what reveals what's beautiful. So I don't believe in God.

3:57:58.960 --> 3:58:03.600
 I think that's a stupid notion. Like, do I believe in God? Like sometimes I joke. I wonder if God

3:58:03.600 --> 3:58:07.840
 believes in me, you know, like more than if I believe in like, he needs Brian Keating. Like,

3:58:07.840 --> 3:58:11.360
 you know, what, you know, it's like one of my friends is a rabbi. He's like,

3:58:12.400 --> 3:58:16.240
 what would I be doing if I were God? Exactly what God's doing right now. Like,

3:58:16.240 --> 3:58:18.080
 you think I know more than God? Give me your proof.

3:58:18.080 --> 3:58:23.200
 Leaving clues of beauty for, for these hairless apes.

3:58:23.200 --> 3:58:23.440
 Yeah.

3:58:24.080 --> 3:58:27.440
 And to see what they do with this. And then Marvel at,

3:58:29.200 --> 3:58:35.440
 at both the tragedy of what the, what those apes do to each other and the,

3:58:36.320 --> 3:58:42.000
 the rare moments of when they have, when they understand, understand deeply about how the

3:58:42.000 --> 3:58:47.440
 world works. Brian, you're an incredible human being. I'm a big fan and I'm really honored that

3:58:47.440 --> 3:58:54.400
 he was, first of all, shower me with rocks from the moon. From space. From space. Space dust.

3:58:54.400 --> 3:59:01.680
 Space dust and crystals, magical crystals, healing crystals that you can, you can use for good.

3:59:01.680 --> 3:59:06.560
 And tell me your story and spend your really valuable time with me today. This was amazing.

3:59:06.560 --> 3:59:08.480
 That was a great pleasure for me, Lex. Thank you so much.

3:59:08.480 --> 3:59:14.080
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Brian Keating. To support this podcast,

3:59:14.080 --> 3:59:19.440
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

3:59:19.440 --> 3:59:26.480
 Galileo Galilei. In questions of science, the authority of a thousand is not worth the humble

3:59:26.480 --> 3:59:39.520
 reasoning of a single individual. Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
