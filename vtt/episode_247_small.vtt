00:00.000 --> 00:02.440
 The following is a conversation with Jamie Metzel,

00:02.440 --> 00:05.920
 author specializing in topics of genetic engineering,

00:05.920 --> 00:09.200
 biotechnology, and geopolitics.

00:09.200 --> 00:12.160
 In the past two years, he has been outspoken

00:12.160 --> 00:15.240
 about the need to investigate and keep an open mind

00:15.240 --> 00:18.200
 about the origins of COVID 19.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.960
 In particular, he has been keeping an extensive

00:20.960 --> 00:23.520
 up to date collection of circumstantial evidence

00:23.520 --> 00:25.760
 in support of what is colloquially known

00:25.760 --> 00:27.880
 as lab leak hypothesis,

00:27.880 --> 00:30.600
 that COVID 19 leaked in 2019

00:30.600 --> 00:33.600
 from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.560
 In part, I wanted to explore the idea

00:35.560 --> 00:37.920
 in response to the thoughtful criticism

00:37.920 --> 00:40.760
 to parts of the Francis Collins episode.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.760
 I will have more and more difficult conversations like this

00:43.760 --> 00:45.840
 with people from all walks of life

00:45.840 --> 00:47.800
 and with all kinds of ideas.

00:47.800 --> 00:50.200
 I promise to do my best to keep an open mind

00:50.200 --> 00:52.320
 and yet to ask hard questions,

00:52.320 --> 00:54.240
 while together searching for the beautiful

00:54.240 --> 00:57.600
 and the inspiring in the mind of the other person.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.920
 It's a hard line to walk gracefully,

00:59.920 --> 01:01.600
 especially for someone like me,

01:01.600 --> 01:03.520
 who's a bit of an awkward introvert

01:03.520 --> 01:06.480
 with barely the grasp of the English language

01:06.480 --> 01:10.200
 or any language, except maybe Python and C++.

01:10.200 --> 01:13.920
 But I hope you stick around, be patient and empathetic,

01:13.920 --> 01:17.320
 and maybe learn something new together with me.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.480
 This is the Lux Friedman podcast.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.640
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:21.640 --> 01:22.840
 in the description.

01:22.840 --> 01:27.600
 And now here's my conversation with Jamie Metzel.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.560
 What is the probability in your mind

01:29.560 --> 01:32.080
 that COVID 19 leaked from a lab?

01:32.080 --> 01:35.960
 In your write up, I believe you said 85%.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.720
 I know it's just a percentage,

01:37.720 --> 01:39.840
 we can't really be exact with these kinds of things,

01:39.840 --> 01:41.520
 but it gives us a sense

01:41.520 --> 01:43.320
 where your mind is, where your intuition is.

01:43.320 --> 01:44.880
 So as it stands today,

01:44.880 --> 01:46.960
 what would you say is that probability?

01:46.960 --> 01:48.960
 I would stand by what I've been saying

01:48.960 --> 01:51.960
 since really the middle of last year.

01:51.960 --> 01:55.640
 It's more likely and not, in my opinion,

01:55.640 --> 01:56.920
 that the pandemic stems

01:56.920 --> 01:59.440
 from an accidental lab incident in Wuhan.

01:59.440 --> 02:04.240
 Is it 90%, is it 65%, I mean, that's kind of arbitrary.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.160
 But when I stack up all of the available evidence

02:08.160 --> 02:11.040
 and all of it on both sides is circumstantial,

02:11.040 --> 02:12.880
 it weighs very significantly

02:12.880 --> 02:14.440
 toward a lab incident origin.

02:14.440 --> 02:17.960
 So before we dive into the specifics at a high level,

02:17.960 --> 02:20.440
 what types of evidence,

02:20.440 --> 02:22.840
 what intuition, what ideas are leading you

02:22.840 --> 02:25.840
 to have that kind of estimate?

02:25.840 --> 02:28.040
 Is it possible to kind of condense,

02:28.040 --> 02:32.200
 when you look at the wall of evidence before you,

02:32.200 --> 02:33.960
 where's your source,

02:33.960 --> 02:36.640
 the strongest source of your intuition?

02:36.640 --> 02:37.760
 And I would have to say,

02:37.760 --> 02:40.640
 it's just logic and deductive reasoning.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.480
 So before I make the case for why I think

02:42.480 --> 02:45.000
 it's most likely a lab incident origin,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.720
 let's just say why it could be

02:46.720 --> 02:49.440
 and still it could be natural origin.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.880
 All this is natural origin in the sense

02:51.880 --> 02:54.440
 that it's a bat virus backbone,

02:54.440 --> 02:57.000
 horseshoe bat virus backbone.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.040
 Okay, I'm gonna keep pausing you,

02:59.040 --> 03:00.360
 define stuff.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.400
 So maybe it's useful to say,

03:02.400 --> 03:04.160
 what do we mean by lab leak?

03:04.160 --> 03:05.960
 What do we mean by natural origin?

03:05.960 --> 03:07.840
 What do we mean by virus backbone?

03:07.840 --> 03:09.800
 Okay, great questions.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.440
 So viruses come from somewhere.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.920
 Viruses have been around for 3.5 billion years.

03:14.920 --> 03:17.840
 And they've been around for such a long time

03:17.840 --> 03:20.720
 because they are adaptive and they're growing

03:20.720 --> 03:23.640
 and they're always changing and they're morphing.

03:23.640 --> 03:26.320
 And that's why viruses are,

03:26.320 --> 03:28.040
 I mean, they've been very successful

03:28.040 --> 03:29.480
 and we are victims.

03:29.480 --> 03:30.680
 Sometimes we're beneficiaries.

03:30.680 --> 03:34.760
 We have viral DNA has morphed into our genomes,

03:34.760 --> 03:37.720
 but now it's certainly in the case of COVID 19,

03:37.720 --> 03:42.720
 we are victims of the success of viruses.

03:42.720 --> 03:44.800
 And so when we talk about a backbone,

03:44.800 --> 03:49.800
 so the SARS CoV2 virus has a history

03:50.080 --> 03:52.680
 and these viruses don't come out of whole cloth.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.680
 There are viruses that morph.

03:54.680 --> 03:59.120
 And so we know that at some period,

03:59.120 --> 04:02.040
 maybe 20 years ago or whatever,

04:02.040 --> 04:07.040
 the virus that is SARS CoV2 existed in horseshoe bats.

04:08.640 --> 04:13.160
 It was a horseshoe bat virus and it evolved somewhere.

04:13.160 --> 04:15.640
 And there are some people who say

04:15.640 --> 04:16.920
 there's no evidence of this,

04:16.920 --> 04:18.760
 but it's a plausible theory

04:18.760 --> 04:21.040
 based on how things have happened in the past.

04:21.040 --> 04:25.080
 Maybe that virus jumped from the horseshoe bat

04:25.080 --> 04:27.120
 through some intermediate species.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.040
 So it's like, let's say there's a bat

04:29.040 --> 04:31.800
 and that it infects some other animal.

04:31.800 --> 04:36.200
 Let's say it's a pig or a raccoon dog or a civet cat.

04:36.200 --> 04:37.120
 They're all pangolin.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.280
 They're all sorts of animals that have been considered.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.880
 And then that virus adapts into that new host

04:43.880 --> 04:45.960
 and it changes and grows.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.120
 And then according to the quote unquote

04:48.120 --> 04:49.520
 natural origins hypothesis,

04:49.520 --> 04:53.160
 it jumps from that animal into humans.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.120
 And so what you could imagine,

04:55.120 --> 04:57.000
 and some of the people who are making the case,

04:57.000 --> 04:58.800
 all of the people actually who are making the case

04:58.800 --> 05:00.960
 for a natural origin of the virus,

05:00.960 --> 05:03.440
 what they're saying is it went from bat

05:03.440 --> 05:05.760
 to some intermediate species.

05:05.760 --> 05:08.440
 And then from that intermediate species, most likely,

05:08.440 --> 05:10.960
 there's some people who say it went directly bat to human,

05:10.960 --> 05:13.040
 but through some intermediate species.

05:13.040 --> 05:16.640
 And then humans interacted with that species.

05:16.640 --> 05:20.040
 And then it jumped from that whatever it is to humans.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.760
 And that's a very plausible theory.

05:21.760 --> 05:23.360
 It's just that there's no evidence for it.

05:23.360 --> 05:25.760
 And the nature of the interaction is,

05:25.760 --> 05:29.720
 do most people kind of suggest this at the wet markets?

05:29.720 --> 05:32.600
 So the interaction of the humans with the animal

05:32.600 --> 05:35.320
 is in the form of it's either a live animal

05:35.320 --> 05:39.680
 as being sold to be eaten or a recently live animal,

05:39.680 --> 05:41.960
 but newly dead animal being sold to.

05:41.960 --> 05:46.120
 That's certainly one very possible possibility,

05:46.120 --> 05:48.920
 a possible possibility, I don't know if that's a word.

05:48.920 --> 05:52.040
 But the people who believe in the wet market origin,

05:52.040 --> 05:53.000
 that's what they're saying.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.440
 So they had one of these animals,

05:55.440 --> 05:57.920
 they were cutting it up, let's say, in a market.

05:57.920 --> 06:01.040
 And maybe some of the blood got into somebody,

06:01.040 --> 06:02.600
 maybe had a cut on their hand,

06:02.600 --> 06:04.160
 or maybe it was aerosolized.

06:04.160 --> 06:05.800
 And so somebody breathed it.

06:05.800 --> 06:09.080
 And then that virus found this new host,

06:09.080 --> 06:11.600
 and that was the human host.

06:11.600 --> 06:14.920
 But you could also have that happen in, let's say, a farm.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.880
 So it's happened in the past that let's say

06:17.880 --> 06:21.360
 that there are farms, and because of human encroachment

06:21.360 --> 06:24.920
 into wild spaces, we're pushing our farms

06:24.920 --> 06:27.400
 and our animal farms further and further

06:27.400 --> 06:31.000
 into what used to be just natural habitats.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
 And so it's happened in the past, for example,

06:33.000 --> 06:35.880
 that there were bats roosting over pig pens

06:35.880 --> 06:38.880
 and the bat droppings went into the pig pens.

06:38.880 --> 06:43.320
 The viruses in those droppings infected the pigs

06:43.320 --> 06:45.960
 and then the pigs infected the humans.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.520
 And that's why it's a plausible theory.

06:48.520 --> 06:52.000
 It's just that there's basically no evidence for it.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.640
 If it was the case that SARS CoV2 comes

06:55.640 --> 06:57.960
 from this type of interaction,

06:57.960 --> 07:01.840
 as in most of the at least recent past outbreaks,

07:01.840 --> 07:03.200
 we'd see evidence of that.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.240
 Viruses are messy.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.000
 They're constantly undergoing Darwinian evolution

07:08.000 --> 07:09.000
 and they're changing.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.800
 And it's not that they're just ready for prime time,

07:11.800 --> 07:13.840
 ready to infect humans on day one.

07:13.840 --> 07:17.720
 Normally you can trace the viral evolution

07:17.720 --> 07:20.680
 prior to the time when it infects humans.

07:20.680 --> 07:24.760
 But for SARS CoV2, it just showed up on the scene

07:24.760 --> 07:26.760
 ready to infect humans.

07:26.760 --> 07:30.600
 And there's no history that anybody has found so far

07:30.600 --> 07:33.040
 of that kind of viral evolution.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.600
 With the first SARS, you could track it

07:35.600 --> 07:39.920
 by the genome sequencing that it was experimenting.

07:39.920 --> 07:44.160
 And SARS CoV2 was very, very stable,

07:44.160 --> 07:47.560
 meaning it had already adapted to humans

07:47.560 --> 07:49.800
 by the time it interacted with us.

07:49.800 --> 07:50.760
 Fully adapted.

07:50.760 --> 07:55.160
 So with SARS, there's a rapid evolution

07:55.160 --> 07:58.520
 when it first hooks onto a human.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.640
 Yeah, because it's trying.

07:59.640 --> 08:02.400
 Like a virus, its goal is to survive and replicate.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.240
 Yeah, no, it's true.

08:03.240 --> 08:04.480
 It's like, oh, we're going to try this.

08:04.480 --> 08:05.200
 Oh, that didn't work.

08:05.200 --> 08:08.200
 We'll try it exactly like a startup.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.400
 And so we don't see that.

08:10.400 --> 08:13.840
 And so there are some people who say, well, one hypothesis

08:13.840 --> 08:17.280
 is you have a totally isolated group of humans,

08:17.280 --> 08:21.400
 maybe in southern China, which is more than 1,000 miles away

08:21.400 --> 08:22.840
 from Wuhan.

08:22.840 --> 08:26.840
 And maybe they're doing their animal farming

08:26.840 --> 08:29.960
 right next to these areas where there

08:29.960 --> 08:31.960
 are these horseshoe bats.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.600
 And maybe in this totally isolated place

08:34.600 --> 08:36.640
 that no one's ever heard of, they're not connected

08:36.640 --> 08:40.760
 to any other place, one person gets infected.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.400
 And it doesn't spread to anybody else

08:42.400 --> 08:44.080
 because they're so isolated.

08:44.080 --> 08:45.720
 They're like, I don't know, I mean,

08:45.720 --> 08:48.120
 I can't even imagine that this is the case.

08:48.120 --> 08:52.560
 And then somebody gets in a car and drives all night

08:52.560 --> 08:56.200
 more than 1,000 miles through crappy roads to get to Wuhan.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.600
 It doesn't stop for anything.

08:57.600 --> 08:59.120
 It doesn't infect anybody on the way.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.840
 No one else in that person's village infects anyone.

09:01.840 --> 09:05.400
 And then that person goes straight to the Huanan seafood

09:05.400 --> 09:08.360
 market, according to this, in my mind, not very credible

09:08.360 --> 09:11.360
 theory, and then unloads his stuff

09:11.360 --> 09:12.680
 and everybody gets infected.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.240
 And they're only delivering those animals

09:15.240 --> 09:17.720
 to the Wuhan market, which doesn't even

09:17.720 --> 09:20.400
 sell very many of these kinds of animals that

09:20.400 --> 09:23.160
 are likely intermediate species and not to anywhere else.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.920
 So that means a little bit of a straw man.

09:26.920 --> 09:31.400
 But on top of that, the Chinese have sequenced more than 80,000

09:31.400 --> 09:32.480
 animal samples.

09:32.480 --> 09:36.280
 And there's no evidence of this type of viral evolution

09:36.280 --> 09:37.600
 that we would otherwise expect.

09:37.600 --> 09:41.880
 Let's try to, at this moment, steal

09:41.880 --> 09:46.440
 man the argument for the natural origin of the virus.

09:46.440 --> 09:50.280
 So just to clarify, so Wuhan is actually,

09:50.280 --> 09:52.240
 despite what it might sound like to people,

09:52.240 --> 09:53.640
 is a pretty big city.

09:53.640 --> 09:55.160
 There's a lot of people that live in it.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.000
 11 million.

09:56.000 --> 09:59.680
 So not only is there the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

09:59.680 --> 10:03.960
 there's other centers that do work on viruses.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.600
 But there's also a giant number of markets.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.000
 And everything we're talking about here

10:08.000 --> 10:09.560
 is pretty close together.

10:09.560 --> 10:13.680
 So when I look at the geography of this,

10:13.680 --> 10:15.960
 I think when you zoom out, it's all Wuhan.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.840
 But when you zoom in, there's just

10:17.840 --> 10:20.120
 a lot of interesting dynamics that could be happening

10:20.120 --> 10:21.600
 and where the cases are popping up

10:21.600 --> 10:24.080
 and what's being reported, all that kind of stuff.

10:24.080 --> 10:29.560
 So I think the people that argue for the natural origin,

10:29.560 --> 10:33.920
 and there's a few recent papers that come out arguing this,

10:33.920 --> 10:35.680
 it's kind of fascinating to watch this whole thing.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.120
 But I think what they're arguing is

10:37.120 --> 10:39.320
 that there's this Hunan market, that's

10:39.320 --> 10:45.480
 one of the major markets, the wet markets in Wuhan,

10:45.480 --> 10:52.600
 that there's a bunch of cases that were reported from there.

10:52.600 --> 10:57.120
 So if I look at, for example, the Michael Warraby

10:57.120 --> 10:59.000
 perspective that he wrote in Science,

10:59.000 --> 11:01.960
 he argues, he wrote this a few days ago,

11:01.960 --> 11:05.800
 the predominance of early COVID cases linked to Hunan

11:05.800 --> 11:09.120
 market, and this can't be dismissed as ascertainment

11:09.120 --> 11:10.760
 bias, which I think is what people

11:10.760 --> 11:13.320
 argue that you're just kind of focusing on this region,

11:13.320 --> 11:14.520
 because a lot of cases came.

11:14.520 --> 11:18.320
 There could be a huge number of other cases.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.000
 So people who argue against this say

11:20.000 --> 11:22.440
 that this is a later stage already.

11:24.920 --> 11:26.360
 So he says no.

11:26.360 --> 11:31.240
 He says this is the epicenter, and this

11:31.240 --> 11:36.480
 is a clear circumstantial evidence,

11:36.480 --> 11:39.440
 but evidence, nevertheless, that this

11:39.440 --> 11:43.760
 is where the jump happened to humans, the big explosion.

11:43.760 --> 11:45.920
 Maybe not K0, I don't know if he argues that,

11:45.920 --> 11:47.400
 but with the early cases.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.200
 So what do you make of this whole idea?

11:49.200 --> 11:52.320
 Can you steel man it before you talk about the other?

11:52.320 --> 11:56.160
 And my goal here isn't to attack people on the other side,

11:56.160 --> 12:00.800
 and my feeling is if there is evidence that's presented

12:00.800 --> 12:03.600
 that should change my view, I hope

12:03.600 --> 12:06.560
 that I'll be open minded enough to change my view.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.400
 And certainly Michael Warraby is a thoughtful person,

12:09.400 --> 12:12.200
 a respected scientist, and I think this work

12:12.200 --> 12:14.520
 is contributive work, but I just

12:14.520 --> 12:20.480
 don't think that it's as significant as has

12:20.480 --> 12:22.640
 been reported in the press.

12:22.640 --> 12:25.360
 And so what his argument is is that there

12:25.360 --> 12:30.440
 is an early cluster in December of 2019

12:30.440 --> 12:33.360
 around the Huanan seafood market.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.400
 And even though he himself argues

12:36.400 --> 12:40.560
 that the original breakthrough case, the original case,

12:40.560 --> 12:45.040
 the index case where the first person infected

12:45.040 --> 12:48.280
 happened earlier, happened in October or November.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.800
 So not in December.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.880
 His argument is, well, what are the odds

12:52.880 --> 12:56.480
 that you would have this number, this cluster of cases

12:56.480 --> 12:58.080
 in the Huanan seafood market?

12:58.080 --> 13:00.920
 And if the origin happened someplace else,

13:00.920 --> 13:03.280
 wouldn't you expect other clusters?

13:03.280 --> 13:06.120
 And it's not an entirely implausible argument.

13:06.120 --> 13:09.200
 But there are reasons why I think

13:09.200 --> 13:12.800
 this is not nearly as determinative as has been reported.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.840
 And I certainly had a lot of, I and others,

13:14.840 --> 13:17.640
 had tweeted a lot about this.

13:17.640 --> 13:20.600
 And that is first, the people who

13:20.600 --> 13:24.120
 were infected in this cluster, it's not

13:24.120 --> 13:27.560
 the earliest known virus of the SARS CoV2.

13:27.560 --> 13:28.600
 It began mutating.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.840
 So it's not the original SARS CoV2 there.

13:31.840 --> 13:35.520
 So it had to have happened someplace else, too.

13:35.520 --> 13:38.560
 The people who were infected in the market

13:38.560 --> 13:41.520
 weren't infected in the part of the market

13:41.520 --> 13:43.680
 where they had these kinds of animals

13:43.680 --> 13:46.240
 that are considered to be candidates

13:46.240 --> 13:49.440
 as an intermediary species.

13:49.440 --> 13:53.120
 And third, there was a bias, actually, I'll have four things.

13:53.120 --> 13:58.200
 Third, there was a bias in the early assessment in China

13:58.200 --> 13:59.720
 of what they were looking for.

13:59.720 --> 14:02.280
 But they were asked, did you have exposure to the market?

14:02.280 --> 14:04.560
 Because I think in the early days when people were figuring

14:04.560 --> 14:08.680
 things out, that was one of the questions that was asked.

14:08.680 --> 14:11.400
 And fourth, and probably most significantly,

14:11.400 --> 14:16.880
 we have so little information about those early cases in China.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.480
 And that's really unfortunate.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.400
 And we'll talk about this later because the Chinese government

14:21.400 --> 14:25.480
 is preventing access to all of that information, which they

14:25.480 --> 14:29.200
 have, which could easily help us get to the bottom, at least

14:29.200 --> 14:31.800
 know a ton more about how this pandemic started.

14:31.800 --> 14:38.400
 And so it's like grasping at straws in the dark with gloves on.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.600
 That's right.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.040
 But to steal man the argument, we have this evidence

14:43.040 --> 14:45.000
 from this market.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.400
 And yes, the Chinese government has turned off the lights,

14:48.400 --> 14:48.920
 essentially.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.240
 So we have very little data to work with.

14:51.240 --> 14:53.400
 But this is the data we have.

14:53.400 --> 14:57.720
 So who's to say that this data doesn't represent a much bigger

14:57.720 --> 15:01.520
 data set that a lot of people got infected at this market

15:01.520 --> 15:04.960
 with it, even at the parts, or especially at the parts

15:04.960 --> 15:09.160
 with the meat, the infected meat was being sold?

15:09.160 --> 15:11.400
 So that could be true.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.680
 And it probably is true.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.880
 The question is, is this the source?

15:16.880 --> 15:18.760
 Is this the place where this began?

15:18.760 --> 15:22.000
 Or was this just a place where it was amplified?

15:22.000 --> 15:26.640
 And I certainly think that it's extremely likely

15:26.640 --> 15:29.080
 that the Huanan seafood market was

15:29.080 --> 15:31.280
 an at point of amplification.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.040
 And it's just answering a different question.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.680
 Basically, what you're saying is it's

15:34.680 --> 15:38.440
 very difficult to use the market as evidence for anything

15:38.440 --> 15:42.760
 because it's probably not even the starting point.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.840
 So it's just a good place for it to continue spreading.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.600
 That's certainly my view.

15:47.600 --> 15:52.000
 What Michael Warraby's argument is that, well,

15:52.000 --> 15:53.160
 what are the odds of that?

15:53.160 --> 15:57.000
 That we're seeing this amplification in the market.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.280
 And let me put it this way.

16:00.280 --> 16:04.240
 If we had all of the information, if the Chinese government

16:04.240 --> 16:06.880
 hadn't blocked access to all of this,

16:06.880 --> 16:08.520
 because there's blood bank information,

16:08.520 --> 16:12.280
 there's all sorts of information, and based

16:12.280 --> 16:14.960
 on a full and complete understanding,

16:14.960 --> 16:18.360
 we came to believe that all of the early cases

16:18.360 --> 16:19.520
 were at this market.

16:19.520 --> 16:23.200
 I think that would be a stronger argument than what

16:23.200 --> 16:24.000
 this is so far.

16:24.000 --> 16:26.720
 But everything leads to the fact that, why is it

16:26.720 --> 16:30.040
 that the Chinese government, which was, frankly,

16:30.040 --> 16:32.560
 after a slow start, the gold standard

16:32.560 --> 16:36.880
 of doing viral tracking for SARS 1,

16:36.880 --> 16:41.160
 why have they apparently done so little and shared so little?

16:41.160 --> 16:45.120
 I think it begs a lot of questions.

16:45.120 --> 16:50.240
 OK, so let's then talk about the Chinese government.

16:50.240 --> 16:51.960
 There's several governments, right?

16:51.960 --> 16:55.200
 So one is the local government of Wuhan.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.760
 And not just the Chinese government.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.080
 Let's talk about government.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.160
 No, let's talk about human nature.

17:02.160 --> 17:03.360
 Let's just keep zooming out.

17:03.360 --> 17:04.880
 Let's talk about planet Earth.

17:04.880 --> 17:06.120
 No.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.440
 So there's the Wuhan local government.

17:08.440 --> 17:13.840
 There's the Chinese government led by Xi Jinping.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.520
 And there's governments in general.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.080
 I'm trying to empathize.

17:18.080 --> 17:21.440
 So my father was involved with Chernobyl.

17:21.440 --> 17:25.680
 I'm trying to put myself into the mind of local officials,

17:25.680 --> 17:29.880
 of people who are like, oh, shit, there's

17:29.880 --> 17:33.560
 a potential catastrophic event happening here.

17:33.560 --> 17:39.880
 And it's my ass because there's incompetence all over the place.

17:39.880 --> 17:42.560
 Human nature is such that there's incompetence all over the place.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.560
 And you're always trying to cover it up.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.720
 And so given that context, I want

17:48.720 --> 17:52.720
 to lay out all the possible incompetence,

17:52.720 --> 17:57.480
 all the possible malevolence, all the possible geopolitical

17:57.480 --> 17:58.400
 tensions here.

18:01.320 --> 18:02.040
 All right.

18:02.040 --> 18:06.440
 Where in your sense did the cover up start?

18:06.440 --> 18:13.320
 So there's this suspicious fact.

18:13.320 --> 18:16.760
 It seems like that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

18:16.760 --> 18:19.200
 had a public database of thousands

18:19.200 --> 18:22.680
 of sampled bad coronavirus sequences.

18:22.680 --> 18:26.320
 And that went offline in September of 2019.

18:26.320 --> 18:28.240
 What's that about?

18:28.240 --> 18:30.560
 So let me talk about that specific.

18:30.560 --> 18:33.560
 And then I'll also follow your path of zooming out.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.480
 And it's a really important.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.320
 Is that a good starting point?

18:35.320 --> 18:36.240
 It's a great starting point.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.040
 Yeah, yeah.

18:37.040 --> 18:40.440
 So but there's a bigger story.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.520
 But let me talk about that.

18:42.520 --> 18:46.480
 So the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.640
 And we can go into the whole history of the Wuhan

18:48.640 --> 18:50.280
 Institute of Virology, either now or later,

18:50.280 --> 18:52.200
 because I think it's very relevant to the story.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.520
 But let's focus for now on this database.

18:55.520 --> 19:01.040
 They had a database of 22,000 viral samples and sequence

19:01.040 --> 19:05.080
 information about viruses that they had collected,

19:05.080 --> 19:07.640
 some of which, the collection of some of which

19:07.640 --> 19:10.400
 was supported through funding from the NIH.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.960
 Not a huge NIH through the EcoHealth Alliance.

19:12.960 --> 19:18.080
 It's a relatively small amount, $600,000, but not nothing.

19:18.080 --> 19:23.240
 The goal of this database was so that we could understand

19:23.240 --> 19:27.320
 viral evolution so that, exactly for this kind of moment

19:27.320 --> 19:29.800
 where we had an unknown virus, we

19:29.800 --> 19:31.920
 could say, well, is this like anything

19:31.920 --> 19:33.400
 that we've seen before?

19:33.400 --> 19:35.840
 And that would help us both understand what we're facing

19:35.840 --> 19:39.400
 and be better able to respond.

19:39.400 --> 19:45.040
 So this was a password protected public access database.

19:45.040 --> 19:51.880
 In 2019, in September 2019, it became inaccessible.

19:51.880 --> 19:53.520
 And then the whole, a few months later,

19:53.520 --> 19:55.960
 the entire database disappeared.

19:55.960 --> 20:00.080
 What the Chinese have said is that because there were

20:00.080 --> 20:03.120
 all kinds of computer attacks on this database,

20:03.120 --> 20:07.040
 but why would that happen in September 2019

20:07.040 --> 20:11.920
 before the pandemic, at least as far as we know?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.600
 So just to clarify.

20:13.600 --> 20:14.480
 Yes.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.720
 It went down to September 2019, just

20:17.720 --> 20:19.720
 so we get the year straight.

20:19.720 --> 20:22.520
 January 2020 is when the virus really

20:22.520 --> 20:26.000
 started getting the press.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.080
 So we're talking about December 2019.

20:29.080 --> 20:30.960
 A lot of early infections happened.

20:30.960 --> 20:34.920
 September 2019 is when this database goes down.

20:34.920 --> 20:37.280
 Just to clarify, because you said it quickly,

20:37.280 --> 20:42.520
 the Chinese government said that their database

20:42.520 --> 20:48.640
 was getting hacked, therefore the director of this part

20:48.640 --> 20:50.800
 of the Wuhan Institute of Virology said that.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.200
 Oh, she was the one that said it.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.000
 She was the one who said it.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.960
 Oh, boy.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.440
 I did not even know that part.

20:56.440 --> 20:57.160
 Yeah.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.560
 Well, she's an interesting character.

20:58.560 --> 20:59.320
 We'll talk about her.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.320
 Yeah.

21:01.320 --> 21:07.640
 So the excuse is that it's getting cyberattacked a lot.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.800
 So we're going to take it down without any further explanation,

21:10.800 --> 21:12.080
 which seems very suspicious.

21:12.080 --> 21:16.880
 And then this virus starts to emerge in October, November,

21:16.880 --> 21:17.440
 December.

21:17.440 --> 21:19.480
 There's a lot of argument about that, but after.

21:19.480 --> 21:20.800
 Sorry to interrupt, but some people

21:20.800 --> 21:22.800
 are saying that the first outbreak could have

21:22.800 --> 21:25.400
 happened as early as September.

21:25.400 --> 21:27.600
 I think it's more likely it's October, November.

21:27.600 --> 21:31.320
 But for the people who are saying that the first outbreak,

21:31.320 --> 21:35.840
 the first incident of a known outbreak, at least to somebody,

21:35.840 --> 21:38.560
 happened in September, they make the argument, well,

21:38.560 --> 21:42.440
 what if that also happened in mid September of 2019?

21:42.440 --> 21:44.520
 I'm not prepared to go there, but there are some people

21:44.520 --> 21:45.520
 who make that argument.

21:45.520 --> 21:47.920
 But I think, again, if I were to put myself

21:47.920 --> 21:52.560
 in the mind of officials, whether it's officials within the Wuhan

21:52.560 --> 21:57.960
 Institute of Virology or Wuhan local officials,

21:57.960 --> 22:01.960
 I think if I notice some major problem,

22:01.960 --> 22:09.160
 like somebody got sick, some sign of, oh, shit, we screwed up.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.880
 That's when you kind of do the slow,

22:11.880 --> 22:13.680
 there's like a Homer Simpson meme,

22:13.680 --> 22:15.560
 where you slowly start backing out.

22:15.560 --> 22:20.680
 And I would probably start hiding stuff.

22:20.680 --> 22:21.800
 CYA, yeah.

22:21.800 --> 22:25.960
 Yeah, and then coming up with really shady excuses.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.880
 It's like you're in a relationship

22:27.880 --> 22:29.960
 and your girlfriend wants to see your phone.

22:29.960 --> 22:32.000
 And you're like, I'm sorry, I'm just getting

22:32.000 --> 22:33.480
 attacked by the Russians now.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.680
 The cybersecurity issue.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.280
 I can't.

22:35.280 --> 22:36.760
 Yeah, I wish I could.

22:36.760 --> 22:37.520
 I wish I could.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.400
 It's just unsafe right now.

22:39.400 --> 22:42.760
 So would it be OK if I give you my kind of macro view

22:42.760 --> 22:46.200
 of the whole information space and why I believe

22:46.200 --> 22:49.080
 this has been so contentious?

22:49.080 --> 22:52.400
 So here's if I had to give my best guess,

22:52.400 --> 22:55.960
 and I underline the word guess of what happened.

22:55.960 --> 22:59.480
 And your background, your family background with Chernobyl,

22:59.480 --> 23:02.040
 I think is highly relevant here.

23:02.040 --> 23:06.280
 So after the first SARS, there was a recognition

23:06.280 --> 23:09.800
 that we needed to distribute knowledge about virology

23:09.800 --> 23:11.600
 and epidemiology around the world.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.880
 The people in China and Africa and Southeast Asia,

23:14.880 --> 23:16.680
 they were the frontline workers.

23:16.680 --> 23:20.600
 And they needed to be doing a lot of the viral monitoring

23:20.600 --> 23:25.600
 and assessment so that we could have an early alarm system.

23:25.600 --> 23:28.200
 And that was why there was a lot of investment

23:28.200 --> 23:31.480
 in all of those places in building capacity and training

23:31.480 --> 23:34.680
 people and helping to build institutional capacity.

23:34.680 --> 23:37.640
 And the Chinese government, they recognized

23:37.640 --> 23:40.760
 that they needed to ramp things up.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.240
 And then the World Health Organization

23:43.240 --> 23:44.840
 and the World Health Assembly, they

23:44.840 --> 23:47.560
 had their international health regulations

23:47.560 --> 23:50.080
 that were designed to create a stronger infrastructure.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.480
 So that was the goal.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.240
 There were a lot of investments.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.360
 And I know we'll talk later about the Wuhan Institute

23:56.360 --> 23:56.880
 of Virology.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.360
 I won't go into that right now.

23:59.360 --> 24:02.600
 So there was all of this distributed capacity.

24:02.600 --> 24:07.280
 And so in the early days, there's a breakout in Wuhan.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.720
 We don't know is it September, October, November.

24:10.720 --> 24:14.600
 Maybe December is when the local authorities

24:14.600 --> 24:16.680
 start to recognize that something's happening.

24:16.680 --> 24:21.680
 But at some point in late 2019, local officials in Wuhan

24:21.680 --> 24:23.600
 understand that something is up.

24:23.600 --> 24:26.720
 And exactly like in Chernobyl, these guys

24:26.720 --> 24:29.240
 exist within a hierarchical system.

24:29.240 --> 24:32.360
 And they are going to be rewarded if good things happen.

24:32.360 --> 24:35.000
 And they're going to be in big trouble if bad things happen

24:35.000 --> 24:36.280
 under their watch.

24:36.280 --> 24:41.080
 So their initial instinct is to squash it.

24:41.080 --> 24:44.320
 My guess is they think, well, if we squash this information,

24:44.320 --> 24:47.120
 we can most likely beat back this outbreak,

24:47.120 --> 24:49.360
 because lots of outbreaks happen all the time,

24:49.360 --> 24:54.000
 including of SARS 1, where there was multiple lab incidents

24:54.000 --> 24:56.840
 out of a lab in Beijing.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.800
 And so they start their cover up on day one.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.600
 They start screening social media.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.520
 They send nasty letters to different doctors and others

25:06.520 --> 25:08.600
 who are starting to speak up.

25:08.600 --> 25:12.080
 But then it becomes clear that there's a bigger issue.

25:12.080 --> 25:14.760
 And then the national government of China.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.440
 Again, this is just a hypothesis.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.640
 The national government gets involved.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.880
 They say, all right, this is getting much bigger.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.280
 They go in and they realize that we

25:24.280 --> 25:26.160
 have a big problem on our hands.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.640
 They relatively quickly know that it's

25:28.640 --> 25:30.640
 spreading human to human.

25:30.640 --> 25:32.880
 And so the right thing for them to do then

25:32.880 --> 25:35.360
 is what the South African government is doing now

25:35.360 --> 25:37.800
 is to say, we have this outbreak.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.760
 We don't know everything, but we know it's serious.

25:40.760 --> 25:41.640
 We need help.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.720
 But that's not the instinct of people in most governments,

25:44.720 --> 25:47.040
 and certainly not in authoritarian governments

25:47.040 --> 25:48.280
 like China.

25:48.280 --> 25:52.760
 And so the national government, they have a choice at that point.

25:52.760 --> 25:56.200
 They can do option one, which is what we would hear

25:56.200 --> 25:59.520
 called the right thing, which is total transparency.

25:59.520 --> 26:01.480
 They criticize the local officials

26:01.480 --> 26:03.520
 for having this cover up.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.760
 And they say, now we're going to be totally transparent.

26:05.760 --> 26:08.800
 But what does that do in a system like the former Soviet

26:08.800 --> 26:10.640
 Union, like China now?

26:10.640 --> 26:12.360
 If local officials say, wait a second,

26:12.360 --> 26:15.880
 I thought my job was to cover everything up,

26:15.880 --> 26:19.760
 to support this alternative reality that authoritarian systems

26:19.760 --> 26:22.600
 need in order to survive, well, now

26:22.600 --> 26:25.760
 I'm going to be held accountable for if I'm not totally

26:25.760 --> 26:29.320
 transparent, like your whole system would collapse.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.520
 So the national government, they have that choice.

26:32.520 --> 26:37.200
 And their only choice, according to the logic of their system,

26:37.200 --> 26:38.960
 is to be all in on a cover up.

26:38.960 --> 26:41.560
 And that's why they block the World Health Organization

26:41.560 --> 26:45.480
 from sending its team to Wuhan for over three weeks.

26:45.480 --> 26:48.520
 They overtly lie to the World Health Organization

26:48.520 --> 26:51.200
 about human to human transmission.

26:51.200 --> 26:53.520
 And then they begin their cover up.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.840
 So they begin very, very quickly destroying samples,

26:56.840 --> 26:58.040
 hiding records.

26:58.040 --> 27:02.840
 They start imprisoning people for asking basic questions.

27:02.840 --> 27:05.720
 Soon after, they establish a gag order,

27:05.720 --> 27:08.800
 preventing Chinese scientists from writing or saying anything

27:08.800 --> 27:12.120
 about pandemic origins without prior government approval.

27:12.120 --> 27:16.080
 And what that does means that there isn't a lot of data,

27:16.080 --> 27:19.200
 there's not nearly enough data coming out of China.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.560
 And so lots of responsible scientists

27:21.560 --> 27:25.000
 outside of China who are data driven say, well,

27:25.000 --> 27:29.200
 I don't have enough information to draw conclusions.

27:29.200 --> 27:35.080
 And then into that vacuum, step a relatively small number

27:35.080 --> 27:40.000
 of largely virologists, but also others, respected

27:40.000 --> 27:43.160
 scientists, and I know we'll talk about the, I think,

27:43.160 --> 27:47.920
 infamous Peter Dezak, who say, well,

27:47.920 --> 27:52.680
 without any real foundation in the evidence,

27:52.680 --> 27:56.680
 they say, we know pretty much this comes from nature.

27:56.680 --> 28:01.160
 And anyone who's raising the possibility of a lab incident

28:01.160 --> 28:03.360
 origin is a conspiracy theorist.

28:03.360 --> 28:07.840
 So that message starts to percolate.

28:07.840 --> 28:11.560
 And then in the United States, we have Donald Trump.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.400
 And he's starting to get criticized for America's

28:14.400 --> 28:17.640
 failure to respond, prepare for, and respond adequately

28:17.640 --> 28:18.960
 to the outbreak.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.840
 And so he starts saying, well, I know, first,

28:22.840 --> 28:25.320
 after praising Xi Jinping, he starts saying, well,

28:25.320 --> 28:28.480
 I know that China did it, and the WHO did it,

28:28.480 --> 28:32.880
 and he's kind of pointing fingers at everybody but himself.

28:32.880 --> 28:35.200
 And then we have a media here that

28:35.200 --> 28:38.960
 had shifted from the traditional model of,

28:38.960 --> 28:40.720
 he said, she said, journalism.

28:40.720 --> 28:43.200
 So and so said X, and so and so said Y,

28:43.200 --> 28:45.840
 and then we'll present both of those views.

28:45.840 --> 28:49.120
 With Donald Trump, he would make outlandish,

28:49.120 --> 28:50.560
 starting positions.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.440
 So he would say, Lex is an axe murderer.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.400
 And then in the early days, they would say,

28:55.400 --> 28:57.440
 Lex is an axe murderer.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.080
 Lex's friend says he's not an axe murderer.

29:00.080 --> 29:02.600
 We'd have a four day debate, is he or isn't he?

29:02.600 --> 29:04.680
 And then at day four, someone would say,

29:04.680 --> 29:06.800
 why are we having this debate at all?

29:06.800 --> 29:11.800
 Because the original point is baseless.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.840
 And so the media just got in the habit.

29:13.840 --> 29:16.640
 Here's what Trump said, and here's why it's wrong.

29:16.640 --> 29:20.040
 It's very complicated to figure out

29:20.040 --> 29:21.640
 what is the role of a politician,

29:21.640 --> 29:25.600
 what is the role of a leader in this kind of game of politics.

29:25.600 --> 29:29.640
 But certainly when there's a tragedy,

29:29.640 --> 29:32.120
 when there's a catastrophic event,

29:32.120 --> 29:36.600
 what it takes to be a leader is to see clearly through the fog

29:36.600 --> 29:38.720
 and to make big, bold decisions

29:38.720 --> 29:41.160
 that does speak to the truth of things.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.120
 And even if it's unpopular truth,

29:44.280 --> 29:48.080
 to listen to the people, to listen to all sides,

29:48.080 --> 29:51.760
 to the opinions, to the controversial ideas,

29:51.760 --> 29:54.640
 and to see past all the bullshit,

29:54.640 --> 29:55.960
 all the political bullshit,

29:55.960 --> 29:59.200
 and just speak to the people,

29:59.200 --> 30:02.440
 speak to the world and make bold, big decisions.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.840
 That's probably what was needed in terms of leadership.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.520
 And I'm not so willing to criticize

30:07.520 --> 30:11.280
 whether it's Joe Biden or Donald Trump on this.

30:11.280 --> 30:15.800
 I think most people cannot be great leaders,

30:15.800 --> 30:18.640
 but that's why when great leaders step up,

30:18.640 --> 30:20.240
 we write books about them.

30:20.240 --> 30:21.240
 And I agree.

30:21.240 --> 30:26.240
 And even though, I think of myself as a progressive person,

30:26.240 --> 30:31.240
 I certainly was a critic of a lot of what President Trump did.

30:33.440 --> 30:36.160
 But on this particular case,

30:36.160 --> 30:39.440
 even though he may have said it in an uncouth way,

30:39.440 --> 30:43.600
 Donald Trump was actually, in my view, right.

30:43.600 --> 30:46.640
 I mean, when he said, hey, let's look at this lab,

30:46.640 --> 30:48.640
 I mean, he said, I have evidence, I can't tell you,

30:48.640 --> 30:51.280
 I don't think he even had the evidence.

30:51.280 --> 30:55.440
 But his intuition that this probably comes from a lab,

30:55.440 --> 30:58.160
 in my view, was a correct intuition.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.000
 And certainly I started speaking up

31:00.000 --> 31:04.440
 about pandemic origins early in 2019.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.040
 And my friends, my Democratic friends,

31:07.040 --> 31:09.720
 were brutal with me saying, what are you doing?

31:09.720 --> 31:11.760
 You're supporting Trump in an election year.

31:11.760 --> 31:15.480
 And I said, just because Donald Trump is saying something

31:15.480 --> 31:18.000
 doesn't mean that I need to oppose it.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.840
 If Donald Trump says something that I think is correct,

31:21.840 --> 31:22.960
 well, I wanna say it's correct

31:22.960 --> 31:25.240
 just as if he says something that I don't like,

31:25.240 --> 31:26.880
 I'm gonna speak up about that.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.520
 Good, you walked through the fire.

31:28.520 --> 31:31.920
 So that's, you laid out the story here.

31:31.920 --> 31:36.520
 And I think in many ways it's a human story.

31:36.520 --> 31:40.360
 It's a story of politics, it's a story of human nature.

31:41.440 --> 31:45.640
 But let's talk about the story of the virus.

31:45.640 --> 31:48.320
 And let's talk about the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

31:48.320 --> 31:51.920
 So maybe this is a good time to try to talk about

31:51.920 --> 31:53.560
 his history, about his origins,

31:53.560 --> 31:55.920
 about what kind of stuff it works on,

31:55.920 --> 32:00.760
 about biosafety levels, and about that woman.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.440
 Yeah, Xu Zhengli, yes.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.760
 Xu Zhengli.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.560
 So what is the Wuhan Institute of Virology

32:06.560 --> 32:07.520
 when did it start?

32:07.520 --> 32:09.040
 Yeah, so it's a great question.

32:09.040 --> 32:14.040
 So after SARS 1, which was in the early 2000, 2003, 2004,

32:15.800 --> 32:20.000
 there was this effort to enhance,

32:20.000 --> 32:22.960
 as I mentioned before, global capacity,

32:22.960 --> 32:23.800
 including in China.

32:23.800 --> 32:25.480
 So the Wuhan Institute of Virology

32:25.480 --> 32:29.200
 had been around for decades before then.

32:29.200 --> 32:32.080
 But there was an agreement between the French

32:32.080 --> 32:35.480
 and the Chinese governments to build

32:35.480 --> 32:39.920
 the largest BSL4 lab, so biosafety level four.

32:39.920 --> 32:42.320
 So in these, what are called high containment labs,

32:42.320 --> 32:44.480
 there's level four, which is the highest level.

32:44.480 --> 32:47.320
 And people have seen that on TV and elsewhere,

32:47.320 --> 32:50.760
 where you have the people in the different suits

32:50.760 --> 32:51.880
 and all of these protections.

32:51.880 --> 32:53.520
 And then there's level three,

32:53.520 --> 32:58.520
 which is still very serious but not as much as level four.

32:58.800 --> 33:03.200
 And then level two is just kind of goggles and some gloves

33:03.200 --> 33:05.680
 and maybe a face mask, much less.

33:05.680 --> 33:09.240
 So the French and the Chinese governments

33:09.240 --> 33:13.480
 agreed that France would help build the first

33:13.480 --> 33:17.520
 and still the largest BSL4,

33:17.520 --> 33:20.120
 plus some mobile BSL3 labs.

33:20.120 --> 33:22.200
 And they were going to do it in Wuhan.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.960
 And Wuhan is kind of like China's Chicago.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.720
 And I had actually been, it's a different story,

33:26.720 --> 33:30.680
 I'd been in Wuhan relatively not that long

33:30.680 --> 33:32.920
 before the pandemic broke out.

33:32.920 --> 33:34.920
 And that was why I knew that Wuhan is,

33:34.920 --> 33:36.800
 it's not some backwater where there are a bunch

33:36.800 --> 33:40.280
 of yokels eating bats for dinner every night.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.760
 This is a really sophisticated, wealthy,

33:42.760 --> 33:45.840
 highly educated and cultured city.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.400
 And so I knew that it wasn't like

33:48.400 --> 33:50.320
 that even the Huanan seafood market

33:50.320 --> 33:52.800
 wasn't like some of these seafood markets

33:52.800 --> 33:55.040
 that they have in Southern China or in Cambodia

33:55.040 --> 33:57.120
 where I lived for two years.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.280
 I mean, this, it was a totally different thing.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.320
 I'm gonna have to talk to you about some of the food,

34:01.320 --> 34:02.640
 including Wuhan market,

34:02.640 --> 34:04.640
 just some of the wild food going on here

34:04.640 --> 34:06.360
 because you've traveled that part of the world.

34:06.360 --> 34:08.880
 Well, let's not get there, let's not get distracted.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.080
 Good, as I was telling you Lex before,

34:11.080 --> 34:13.800
 and this is maybe an advertisement,

34:13.800 --> 34:18.040
 is having now listened to a number of your podcasts

34:18.040 --> 34:20.400
 and I'm doing long, ultra training runs

34:20.400 --> 34:22.280
 or driving in the mountains.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.680
 Like the really, because in the beginning,

34:23.680 --> 34:26.120
 we have to talk about whatever it is, is the topic,

34:26.120 --> 34:28.680
 but the really good stuff happens later, so.

34:28.680 --> 34:30.560
 So friends, you should listen to the end.

34:30.560 --> 34:34.920
 I have to say, as I was telling you before,

34:34.920 --> 34:37.840
 like when I heard your long podcast with Geron Lanier

34:37.840 --> 34:41.160
 and he talked about his mother at the very end,

34:41.160 --> 34:42.760
 I mean, just beautiful stuff.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.520
 So I don't know whether I can match beautiful stuff

34:45.520 --> 34:48.040
 but I'm gonna do my best.

34:48.040 --> 34:49.200
 You're gonna have to find out.

34:49.200 --> 34:50.880
 Exactly, stay tuned.

34:52.760 --> 34:54.960
 So France had this agreement

34:54.960 --> 34:57.960
 that they were going to help design and help build

34:57.960 --> 35:01.080
 this BSL4 lab in Wuhan.

35:01.080 --> 35:04.920
 And it was going to be with French standards

35:04.920 --> 35:07.560
 and there were going to be 50 French experts

35:07.560 --> 35:09.440
 who were going to work there

35:09.440 --> 35:12.720
 and supervise the work that happened

35:12.720 --> 35:16.040
 even after the Wuhan Institute of Virology

35:16.040 --> 35:21.040
 in the new location started operating.

35:22.040 --> 35:24.440
 But then when they started building it,

35:24.440 --> 35:28.520
 the French contractors, the French overseers

35:28.520 --> 35:31.520
 were increasingly appalled

35:31.520 --> 35:33.440
 that they had less and less control,

35:33.440 --> 35:36.880
 that the Chinese contractors were swapping out new things,

35:36.880 --> 35:39.640
 it wasn't built up to French standards,

35:39.640 --> 35:44.200
 so much that at the end when it was finally built,

35:44.200 --> 35:47.880
 the person who was the vice chairman of the project

35:47.880 --> 35:51.400
 and a leading French industrialist named Mario

35:51.400 --> 35:53.000
 refused to sign off.

35:53.000 --> 35:57.320
 And he said, we can't support, we have no idea

35:57.320 --> 36:00.240
 what this is, whether it's safe or not.

36:00.240 --> 36:03.000
 And when this lab opened,

36:03.000 --> 36:06.000
 remember we were supposed to have 50 French experts,

36:06.000 --> 36:07.920
 it had one French expert.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.320
 And so the French were really disgusted.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.760
 And actually when the Wuhan Institute of Virology

36:14.760 --> 36:19.480
 in its new location opened in 2018, two things happened.

36:19.480 --> 36:23.440
 One, French intelligence privately approached US intelligence

36:23.440 --> 36:25.120
 saying we have a lot of concerns

36:25.120 --> 36:27.280
 about the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

36:27.280 --> 36:29.280
 about its safety, and we don't even know

36:29.280 --> 36:31.400
 who's operating there, is it being used

36:31.400 --> 36:34.040
 as a dual use facility.

36:34.040 --> 36:38.560
 And also in 2018, the US embassy in Beijing

36:38.560 --> 36:42.240
 sent some people down to Wuhan to go and look at,

36:42.240 --> 36:44.720
 well, at this laboratory.

36:44.720 --> 36:48.520
 And they wrote a scathing cable that Josh Rogan

36:48.520 --> 36:51.280
 from the Washington Post later got his hands on

36:51.280 --> 36:54.160
 saying this is really unsafe,

36:54.160 --> 36:58.760
 they're doing work on dangerous bat coronaviruses

36:58.760 --> 37:02.760
 in conditions where a leak is possible.

37:02.760 --> 37:05.680
 And so then you mentioned Xuejing Li,

37:05.680 --> 37:08.680
 and I'll connect that to these virologists

37:08.680 --> 37:11.120
 who I was talking about.

37:11.120 --> 37:14.240
 So there's a very credible thesis

37:14.240 --> 37:17.800
 that because these pathogenic outbreaks happen

37:17.800 --> 37:19.760
 in other parts of the world,

37:19.760 --> 37:22.080
 having partnerships with experts

37:22.080 --> 37:24.680
 in those parts of the world

37:24.680 --> 37:28.040
 must be a foundation of our efforts.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.000
 We can't just bring everything home

37:30.000 --> 37:32.040
 because we know that viruses don't care

37:32.040 --> 37:33.720
 about borders and boundaries.

37:33.720 --> 37:35.000
 And so if something happens there,

37:35.000 --> 37:36.200
 it's going to come here.

37:36.200 --> 37:41.200
 So very correctly, we have all kinds of partnerships

37:41.680 --> 37:44.000
 with experts in these labs.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.280
 And Xuejing Li was one of those partners.

37:47.280 --> 37:51.440
 And her closest relationship was with Peter Dezak,

37:51.440 --> 37:54.000
 who's a British, I think now American,

37:54.000 --> 37:57.600
 but the president of a thing called EcoHealth Alliance,

37:57.600 --> 37:59.240
 which was getting money from NIH.

37:59.240 --> 38:02.680
 And basically EcoHealth Alliance was a pass through

38:02.680 --> 38:04.880
 organization and over the years,

38:04.880 --> 38:06.600
 it was only about $600,000.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.280
 So almost all of her funding came from the Chinese government,

38:09.280 --> 38:11.760
 but there's a little bit that came from the United States.

38:11.760 --> 38:15.160
 And so she became their kind of leading expert

38:15.160 --> 38:17.640
 and the point of contact

38:17.640 --> 38:20.240
 between the Wuhan Institute of Virology

38:20.240 --> 38:25.240
 and certainly Peter Dezak, but also with others.

38:25.880 --> 38:28.880
 And that was why in the earliest days of the outbreak,

38:28.880 --> 38:30.400
 I didn't mention that,

38:30.400 --> 38:32.920
 and I did mention that there were these virologists

38:32.920 --> 38:36.680
 who had this fake certainty that they knew it came from nature

38:36.680 --> 38:38.880
 and it didn't come from a lab.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.360
 And they called people like me conspiracy theorists

38:41.360 --> 38:43.920
 just for raising that possibility.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.880
 But when Peter Dezak was organizing that effort

38:46.880 --> 38:51.080
 in February of 2020, what he said is,

38:51.080 --> 38:54.120
 we need to rally behind our Chinese colleagues.

38:54.120 --> 38:58.840
 And the basic idea was these international collaborations

38:58.840 --> 38:59.720
 are under threat.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.360
 And I think it was because of that,

39:01.360 --> 39:06.360
 because Peter Dezak's basically his major contribution

39:06.400 --> 39:09.680
 as a scientist was just tacking his name on work

39:09.680 --> 39:13.000
 that Xu Zhengli had largely done.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.640
 He was defending a lot certainly for himself

39:15.640 --> 39:16.880
 and his organization.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.680
 So you think EcoHealth Alliance and Peter

39:20.680 --> 39:22.040
 is less about money.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.800
 It's more about kind of almost like legacy

39:24.800 --> 39:26.720
 because you're so attached to this work.

39:26.720 --> 39:28.040
 Is it just on a human level?

39:28.040 --> 39:29.160
 So I think so.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.720
 I mean, I've been criticized for being actually,

39:31.720 --> 39:34.880
 I'm certainly a big critic of Peter Dezak,

39:34.880 --> 39:38.560
 but I've been criticized by some for being too lenient.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.800
 I mean, it's so easy to say, oh, somebody,

39:40.800 --> 39:45.520
 they're like an evil ogre and just trying to do evil

39:45.520 --> 39:49.800
 and cackling in their closet or whatever.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.280
 But I think for most of us, even those of us

39:52.280 --> 39:55.520
 who do terrible, horrible things,

39:55.520 --> 39:57.680
 the story that we tell ourselves

39:57.680 --> 40:01.120
 and we really believe is that we're doing the thing

40:01.120 --> 40:02.600
 that we most believe in.

40:02.600 --> 40:04.560
 I mean, I did my PhD dissertation

40:04.560 --> 40:06.840
 on the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.

40:06.840 --> 40:09.960
 They genuinely saw themselves as idealists.

40:09.960 --> 40:13.920
 They thought, well, we need to make radical change

40:13.920 --> 40:15.720
 to build a better future.

40:15.720 --> 40:18.320
 And what they described is that they felt

40:18.320 --> 40:21.920
 was radical change was a monstrous atrocity by us.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.360
 So the criticism here of Peter is that

40:24.360 --> 40:29.360
 he was part of an organization that was kind of,

40:35.000 --> 40:39.000
 well, funding an effort that was an unsafe implementation

40:39.000 --> 40:42.080
 of a biosafety level for laboratory.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.320
 Well, a few things.

40:43.320 --> 40:48.000
 So what he thought he was doing was,

40:48.000 --> 40:49.560
 and then what he thought he was doing

40:49.560 --> 40:51.720
 is itself highly controversial

40:51.720 --> 40:56.360
 because there's one that in 2011,

40:56.360 --> 40:57.880
 there were, I know you've talked about this

40:57.880 --> 41:00.640
 with other guests, but in 2011,

41:00.640 --> 41:04.040
 there were the first published papers

41:04.040 --> 41:07.520
 on this now infamous gain of function research.

41:07.520 --> 41:10.560
 And basically what they did,

41:10.560 --> 41:13.240
 both in different labs,

41:13.240 --> 41:14.640
 and certainly in the United States,

41:14.640 --> 41:18.680
 in Wisconsin and in the Netherlands,

41:18.680 --> 41:23.680
 was they had a bird flu virus that was very dangerous

41:24.880 --> 41:28.560
 but not massively transmissive.

41:28.560 --> 41:31.640
 And they had a gain of function process

41:31.640 --> 41:33.640
 through what's called serial passage,

41:33.640 --> 41:35.600
 which means basically passing advice

41:35.600 --> 41:39.240
 like natural selection, but forcing natural selection

41:39.240 --> 41:42.480
 by just passing a virus through different cell cultures

41:42.480 --> 41:46.320
 and then selecting for what it is that you want.

41:46.320 --> 41:49.480
 So relatively easily, they took this deadly

41:49.480 --> 41:51.880
 but not massively transmissive virus

41:51.880 --> 41:53.920
 and turned it into in a lab,

41:53.920 --> 41:57.320
 a deadly and transmissive virus.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.560
 And that showed that this is really dangerous.

41:59.560 --> 42:01.160
 And so there were, at that point,

42:01.160 --> 42:03.040
 there was a huge controversy.

42:03.040 --> 42:07.120
 There were some people like Richard Ebright

42:07.120 --> 42:09.560
 and Mark Lipsitch at Harvard

42:09.560 --> 42:12.480
 who were saying that this is really dangerous.

42:12.480 --> 42:16.880
 We're in the idea that we need to create monsters

42:16.880 --> 42:17.920
 to study monsters.

42:17.920 --> 42:21.160
 I think maybe even you have said that in the past,

42:21.160 --> 42:22.320
 it doesn't make sense

42:22.320 --> 42:24.680
 because there's an unlimited number of monsters.

42:24.680 --> 42:25.800
 And so what are we gonna do?

42:25.800 --> 42:27.480
 Create an unlimited number of monsters.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.800
 And if we do that, eventually the monsters

42:29.800 --> 42:31.440
 are going to get out.

42:31.440 --> 42:33.680
 Then there was the Peter Desick camp

42:33.680 --> 42:35.440
 and he got a lot of funding,

42:35.440 --> 42:37.240
 particularly from the United States,

42:37.240 --> 42:40.360
 who said, well, and certainly Collins and Fauci

42:40.360 --> 42:42.040
 were supportive of this.

42:42.040 --> 42:44.640
 And they thought, well, there's a safe way

42:44.640 --> 42:46.320
 to go out into the world,

42:46.320 --> 42:49.560
 to collect the world's most dangerous viruses

42:49.560 --> 42:52.880
 and to poke and prod them to figure out

42:52.880 --> 42:54.200
 how they might mutate,

42:54.200 --> 42:56.400
 how they might become more dangerous

42:56.400 --> 43:01.400
 with the goal of predicting future pandemics.

43:01.520 --> 43:03.600
 And that certainly never happened

43:03.600 --> 43:07.920
 with the goal of creating vaccines and treatments.

43:07.920 --> 43:11.160
 And that largely never happened.

43:11.160 --> 43:14.400
 But that was, so Peter Desick kind of epitomized

43:14.400 --> 43:18.200
 that second approach.

43:18.200 --> 43:22.200
 And as you've talked about in the past, in 2014,

43:22.200 --> 43:25.200
 there was a funding moratorium in the United States.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.960
 And then in 2017, that was lifted.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.080
 It didn't affect the funding

43:29.080 --> 43:33.360
 that went to the EcoHealth Alliance.

43:33.360 --> 43:37.000
 So when this happened in the beginning,

43:37.000 --> 43:40.040
 and again, coming back to Peter's motivations,

43:40.040 --> 43:44.040
 I don't think, here's the best case scenario for Peter.

43:44.040 --> 43:47.080
 I'm gonna give you what I imagine he was thinking,

43:47.080 --> 43:49.720
 and then I'll tell you what I actually think.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.720
 So I think here's what he's thinking.

43:51.720 --> 43:55.560
 This is most likely a natural origin outbreak.

43:55.560 --> 44:00.360
 It just like SARS 1, again, in Peter's hypothetical mind,

44:00.360 --> 44:04.480
 just like SARS 1, this is most likely a natural outbreak.

44:04.480 --> 44:06.920
 We need to have an international coalition

44:06.920 --> 44:08.640
 in order to fight it.

44:08.640 --> 44:11.920
 If we allow these political attacks

44:11.920 --> 44:14.120
 to undermine our Chinese counterparts

44:14.120 --> 44:16.160
 and the trust in these relationships

44:16.160 --> 44:18.440
 that we've built over many years,

44:18.440 --> 44:20.600
 we're really screwed because they have

44:20.600 --> 44:23.760
 the most local knowledge of these outbreaks.

44:23.760 --> 44:27.680
 And even though, and this gets a lot more complicated,

44:27.680 --> 44:30.680
 even though there are basic questions

44:30.680 --> 44:32.480
 that anybody would ask,

44:32.480 --> 44:34.680
 and that Xu Zhengli herself did ask

44:34.680 --> 44:37.720
 about the origins of this pandemic,

44:37.720 --> 44:42.000
 even though Peter Dezak, and I'll describe this in a moment,

44:42.000 --> 44:45.040
 had secret information that we didn't have,

44:45.040 --> 44:48.360
 that in my mind massively increases the possibility

44:48.360 --> 44:50.000
 of a lab incident origin,

44:50.960 --> 44:53.760
 I, Peter Dezak, would like to guide

44:53.760 --> 44:57.160
 the public conversation in the direction

44:57.160 --> 44:58.880
 where I think it should go,

44:58.880 --> 45:03.600
 and in support of the kind of international collaboration

45:03.600 --> 45:04.720
 that I think is necessary.

45:04.720 --> 45:06.280
 That's a strong positive discussion

45:06.280 --> 45:11.280
 because it's true that there's a lot of political BS

45:11.920 --> 45:16.280
 and a lot of kind of just bickering

45:16.280 --> 45:18.960
 and lies as we've talked about.

45:18.960 --> 45:21.120
 And so it's very convenient to say, you know what?

45:21.120 --> 45:24.080
 Let's just ignore all of these quote unquote lies

45:24.080 --> 45:26.240
 and my favorite word, misinformation.

45:27.160 --> 45:31.800
 And then because the way out from this serious pandemic

45:31.800 --> 45:33.440
 is for us to work together.

45:33.440 --> 45:36.240
 So let's strengthen our partnerships

45:36.240 --> 45:38.440
 and everything else is just like noise.

45:38.440 --> 45:39.560
 Yeah, so let's,

45:39.560 --> 45:42.680
 and so then now I wanna do my personal indictment

45:42.680 --> 45:44.720
 of Peter Dezak because that's my view,

45:44.720 --> 45:46.840
 but I wanted to fairly,

45:46.840 --> 45:51.680
 because I think that we all tell ourselves stories

45:51.680 --> 45:56.360
 and also when you're a science communicator,

45:56.360 --> 45:59.200
 you can't in your public communications

45:59.200 --> 46:03.280
 give every doubt that you have or every nuance.

46:03.280 --> 46:05.760
 You kind of have to summarize things.

46:05.760 --> 46:07.520
 And so I think that he was, again,

46:07.520 --> 46:09.640
 in this benign interpretation,

46:09.640 --> 46:11.120
 trying to summarize in the way

46:11.120 --> 46:14.000
 that he thought the conversations should go.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.680
 Here's my indictment of Peter Dezak.

46:16.680 --> 46:20.920
 And I feel like Brutus here,

46:20.920 --> 46:25.920
 but I've not come here to praise Peter Dezak

46:26.040 --> 46:29.240
 because while Peter Dezak was doing all of this

46:29.240 --> 46:31.240
 and making all of these statements

46:31.240 --> 46:34.360
 about, well, we pretty much know it's a natural origin,

46:34.360 --> 46:38.160
 then there was this February 2020 Lancet letter

46:38.160 --> 46:40.960
 where it turns out, and we only knew this later,

46:40.960 --> 46:42.840
 that he was highly manipulative.

46:42.840 --> 46:45.260
 So he was recruiting all of these people.

46:45.260 --> 46:47.480
 He drafted the infamous letter

46:47.480 --> 46:50.640
 calling people like me conspiracy theorists.

46:50.640 --> 46:54.520
 He then wrote to people like Ralph Barrick and Linfa Wang

46:54.520 --> 46:57.160
 who are also very high profile virologists saying,

46:57.160 --> 46:59.080
 well, let's not put our names on it.

46:59.080 --> 47:01.920
 So it doesn't look like we're doing it

47:01.920 --> 47:04.520
 even though they were doing it.

47:04.520 --> 47:09.400
 He didn't disclose a lot of information that they had.

47:09.400 --> 47:10.840
 It was a strategic move.

47:10.840 --> 47:13.320
 So just in case people are not familiar,

47:13.320 --> 47:18.320
 February 2020 Lancet letter was TLDR

47:20.120 --> 47:24.880
 is a lab leak hypothesis is a conspiracy theory.

47:24.880 --> 47:26.600
 Essentially, yes.

47:26.600 --> 47:29.640
 So like with the authority of science,

47:29.640 --> 47:32.280
 not saying like it's highly likely,

47:32.280 --> 47:37.280
 saying it's obvious duh, it's natural origin,

47:37.760 --> 47:40.600
 everybody else is just,

47:40.600 --> 47:42.800
 everything else is just misinformation.

47:42.800 --> 47:44.920
 And look, there's a bunch of really smart people

47:44.920 --> 47:46.400
 that sign this, therefore it's true.

47:46.400 --> 47:49.560
 Yeah, not only that, so there were the people

47:49.560 --> 47:51.720
 who's 27 people signed that letter.

47:51.720 --> 47:54.400
 And then after President Trump cut funding

47:54.400 --> 47:59.000
 to EcoHealth Alliance, then he organized 77 Nobel laureates

47:59.000 --> 48:01.720
 to have a public letter criticizing that.

48:01.720 --> 48:06.440
 But what Peter knew then that we didn't fully know

48:06.440 --> 48:10.960
 is that in March of 2018, EcoHealth Alliance,

48:10.960 --> 48:13.680
 in partnership with the Wuhan Institute of Virology

48:13.680 --> 48:18.680
 and others had applied for a $14 million grant to DARPA,

48:19.320 --> 48:23.680
 which is kind of like the VC side of the venture capital side

48:23.680 --> 48:25.520
 of the Defense Department.

48:25.520 --> 48:29.400
 They're kind of where they do kind of big ideas.

48:29.400 --> 48:31.200
 Oh, by the way, as a tiny tangent,

48:31.200 --> 48:33.960
 I've gotten a lot of funding from DARPA.

48:33.960 --> 48:36.360
 They fund a lot of excellent robotics research.

48:36.360 --> 48:37.760
 And DARPA is incredible.

48:37.760 --> 48:41.080
 And among the things that they applied for is that we,

48:41.080 --> 48:43.720
 meaning Wuhan Institute of Virology is gonna go

48:43.720 --> 48:46.000
 and it's gonna collect the most dangerous

48:46.000 --> 48:49.440
 bat coronaviruses in Southern China.

48:49.440 --> 48:52.360
 And then we, as this group,

48:52.360 --> 48:56.640
 are going to genetically engineer these viruses

48:56.640 --> 48:59.840
 to insert a furan cleavage site.

48:59.840 --> 49:02.640
 So I think when everyone's now seen the image

49:02.640 --> 49:04.600
 of the SARS CoV2 virus,

49:04.600 --> 49:06.360
 it has these little spike proteins,

49:06.360 --> 49:08.000
 these little things that stick out,

49:08.000 --> 49:09.960
 which is why they call it a coronavirus.

49:09.960 --> 49:12.440
 Within that spike protein are these furan cleavage sites

49:12.440 --> 49:14.880
 which basically help with the virus

49:14.880 --> 49:18.120
 getting access into our cells.

49:18.120 --> 49:20.160
 And they're going to genetically engineer

49:20.160 --> 49:24.160
 these furan cleavage sites into these bat coronaviruses,

49:24.160 --> 49:26.360
 the serbicoviruses.

49:26.360 --> 49:30.680
 And then, and so then a year and a half later,

49:30.680 --> 49:31.720
 what do we see?

49:31.720 --> 49:36.720
 We see a bat coronaviruses with a furan cleavage site

49:36.720 --> 49:39.840
 unlike anything that we've ever seen before

49:39.840 --> 49:44.200
 in that category of SARS like coronaviruses.

49:44.200 --> 49:45.920
 That, well, yes.

49:45.920 --> 49:49.080
 I mean, the DARPA very correctly

49:49.080 --> 49:50.880
 didn't support that application.

49:50.880 --> 49:53.120
 Well, that's actually, that's like a pause on that.

49:53.120 --> 49:55.680
 So for a lot of people that's like the smoking gun.

49:55.680 --> 49:56.520
 Yeah.

49:56.520 --> 50:01.520
 Okay, let's talk about this 2018 proposal to DARPA.

50:02.240 --> 50:04.160
 So I guess who's drafted the proposal?

50:04.160 --> 50:05.000
 Is it?

50:05.000 --> 50:05.840
 EcoHealth.

50:05.840 --> 50:09.080
 EcoHealth, but the proposal is to do,

50:09.080 --> 50:14.080
 so EcoHealth is technically a US funded organization.

50:14.640 --> 50:15.480
 Primarily.

50:15.480 --> 50:19.520
 And then the idea was to do work at Wuhan Institute

50:19.520 --> 50:20.840
 of Virology.

50:20.840 --> 50:21.680
 With, yeah.

50:21.680 --> 50:22.520
 So it was.

50:22.520 --> 50:23.360
 With EcoHealth.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.200
 Yeah.

50:24.200 --> 50:26.480
 So EcoHealth basically that the Wuhan Institute

50:26.480 --> 50:28.280
 of Virology was gonna go and they were gonna

50:28.280 --> 50:30.600
 collect these viruses and store them

50:30.600 --> 50:31.800
 at Wuhan Institute of Virology.

50:31.800 --> 50:33.640
 But they're also gonna do the actual.

50:33.640 --> 50:35.480
 According, it's a really important point.

50:35.480 --> 50:37.360
 According to their proposal,

50:37.360 --> 50:39.640
 the actual work was going to be done

50:39.640 --> 50:41.760
 at the lab of Ralph Barrick

50:41.760 --> 50:43.400
 at the University of North Carolina

50:43.400 --> 50:46.200
 who's probably the world's leading expert

50:46.200 --> 50:49.440
 on coronaviruses.

50:49.440 --> 50:54.440
 And so we know that DARPA didn't fund that work.

50:55.520 --> 50:57.880
 We know, I think quite well,

50:57.880 --> 51:01.280
 that Ralph Barrick's lab in part,

51:01.280 --> 51:05.320
 because it was not funded by DARPA,

51:05.320 --> 51:07.520
 they didn't do that specific work.

51:07.520 --> 51:10.080
 What we don't know is, well,

51:10.080 --> 51:13.720
 what work was done at the Wuhan Institute of Virology

51:13.720 --> 51:16.960
 because WIV was part of this proposal.

51:16.960 --> 51:19.720
 They had access to all of the plans.

51:19.720 --> 51:22.440
 They had done, they had their own capacity

51:22.440 --> 51:25.000
 and they had already done a lot of work

51:25.000 --> 51:30.120
 in genetically altering this exact category of viruses

51:30.120 --> 51:35.120
 they had created, chimeric mixed viruses they had done.

51:35.480 --> 51:39.080
 They had mastered pretty much all of the steps

51:39.080 --> 51:40.640
 in order to achieve this thing

51:40.640 --> 51:44.200
 that they applied for funding with EcoHealth to do.

51:44.200 --> 51:46.280
 And so the question is,

51:46.280 --> 51:49.240
 did the Wuhan Institute of Virology

51:49.240 --> 51:51.840
 go through with that research anyway?

51:51.840 --> 51:55.320
 And in my mind, that's a very, very real possibility.

51:55.320 --> 51:58.560
 We certainly explain why they're giving no information.

51:58.560 --> 52:01.480
 And as you know, I've been a member

52:01.480 --> 52:04.120
 of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee

52:04.120 --> 52:06.040
 on Human Genome Editing,

52:06.040 --> 52:08.400
 which Dr. Tedros created in the aftermath

52:08.400 --> 52:11.680
 of the announcement of the world's first CRISPR babies.

52:11.680 --> 52:14.280
 And it was just basically the exact same story.

52:14.280 --> 52:16.680
 So Hojong Kui, Chinese scientist,

52:16.680 --> 52:18.120
 it was not a first tier scientist,

52:18.120 --> 52:21.200
 but a perfectly adequate second tier scientist

52:21.200 --> 52:22.240
 came to the United States,

52:22.240 --> 52:24.920
 learned all of these capacities, went back to China

52:24.920 --> 52:28.120
 and said, well, there's a much more permissive environment.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.520
 I'm gonna be a world leader,

52:30.520 --> 52:33.240
 I'm gonna establish both myself and China.

52:33.240 --> 52:35.320
 So in every scientific field,

52:35.320 --> 52:37.240
 we're seeing this same thing

52:37.240 --> 52:39.400
 where you kind of learn a model

52:39.400 --> 52:41.520
 and then you do it in China.

52:41.520 --> 52:45.640
 So is it possible that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

52:45.640 --> 52:49.880
 with this exact game plan was doing it anyway?

52:49.880 --> 52:51.760
 Do we possible?

52:51.760 --> 52:55.040
 We have no clue what work was being done

52:55.040 --> 52:56.840
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

52:56.840 --> 52:59.800
 It seems extremely likely

52:59.800 --> 53:02.000
 that at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

53:02.000 --> 53:04.480
 and this is certainly the US government position,

53:04.480 --> 53:08.280
 there was the work that was being done in Dr. Xu's lab,

53:08.280 --> 53:10.280
 but that wasn't the whole WIV.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.560
 We know, at least according to the United States government,

53:12.560 --> 53:14.160
 that there was the Chinese military,

53:14.160 --> 53:17.520
 that PLA was doing work there.

53:17.520 --> 53:19.760
 Were they doing this kind of work,

53:19.760 --> 53:22.080
 not to create a bio weapon,

53:22.080 --> 53:25.080
 but in order to understand these viruses,

53:25.080 --> 53:28.120
 maybe to develop vaccines and treatments,

53:28.120 --> 53:33.120
 it seems like a very, very logical possibility.

53:33.120 --> 53:36.240
 And then, so we know that the Wuhan Institute of Virology

53:36.240 --> 53:37.560
 had all of the skills,

53:37.560 --> 53:40.640
 we know that they were part of this proposal.

53:40.640 --> 53:43.760
 And then you have Peter Dezak, who knows all of this,

53:43.760 --> 53:47.320
 that at that time in February of 2020, we didn't know.

53:47.320 --> 53:49.520
 But then he comes swinging out of the gate,

53:49.520 --> 53:52.880
 saying anybody who's raising this possibility

53:52.880 --> 53:57.000
 of a lab incident origin is a conspiracy theorist.

53:57.000 --> 54:01.480
 I mean, it really makes him look, in my mind, very, very bad.

54:01.480 --> 54:04.440
 Yet not to at least be somewhat open minded on this,

54:04.440 --> 54:06.040
 because he knows all the details.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.960
 He knows that it's not 0%.

54:08.960 --> 54:12.040
 I mean, there's no way in his mind could even argue that.

54:12.040 --> 54:16.120
 So it's potential because of the bias, because of your focus.

54:16.120 --> 54:20.240
 I mean, it could be the Anthony Fauci mask thing,

54:20.240 --> 54:23.280
 whereas he knows there's some significant probability

54:23.280 --> 54:24.200
 that this is happening.

54:24.200 --> 54:28.640
 But in order to preserve good relations

54:28.640 --> 54:30.120
 with our Chinese colleagues,

54:30.120 --> 54:33.000
 we want to make sure we tell a certain kind of narrative.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.720
 So it's not really lying.

54:34.720 --> 54:39.200
 It's doing the best possible action at this time

54:39.200 --> 54:40.400
 to help the world.

54:40.400 --> 54:42.160
 Not that this already happened.

54:42.160 --> 54:43.440
 But that's how like...

54:43.440 --> 54:47.480
 Yeah, I think it's quite likely that that was the story

54:47.480 --> 54:49.440
 that he was telling himself.

54:49.440 --> 54:54.440
 But it's that lack of transparency in my mind is fraudulent,

54:54.440 --> 54:57.240
 that we were struggling to understand something

54:57.240 --> 54:59.200
 that we didn't understand.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.120
 And that I just think that people who possess

55:02.120 --> 55:06.920
 that kind of information, especially when the existence,

55:06.920 --> 55:09.200
 like the entire career of Peter Dezak,

55:09.200 --> 55:13.560
 is based on US taxpayers, there's a debt that comes with that.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.840
 And that debt is honesty and transparency.

55:15.840 --> 55:18.680
 And for all of us, and you talked about your girlfriend

55:18.680 --> 55:20.720
 checking your phone, for all of us,

55:20.720 --> 55:24.920
 being honest and transparent in the most difficult times,

55:24.920 --> 55:26.040
 it's really difficult.

55:26.040 --> 55:28.240
 If it were easy, everybody would do it.

55:28.240 --> 55:34.240
 And I just feel that Peter was the opposite of transparent

55:34.240 --> 55:36.600
 and then went on the offensive.

55:36.600 --> 55:40.880
 And then had the gall of joining,

55:40.880 --> 55:42.720
 I know we can talk about this,

55:42.720 --> 55:51.040
 this highly compromised joint study process with the international experts

55:51.040 --> 55:53.360
 and their Chinese government counterparts.

55:53.360 --> 55:59.280
 And used that as a way of furthering this, in my mind,

55:59.280 --> 56:06.080
 fraudulent narrative that it almost certainly came from natural origins

56:06.080 --> 56:09.560
 and a lab origin was extremely unlikely.

56:09.560 --> 56:12.680
 Just to stick briefly on the proposal to wrap that up,

56:12.680 --> 56:18.680
 because I do think in a kind of John Stuart way,

56:18.680 --> 56:21.320
 if you heard that a bit,

56:21.320 --> 56:27.080
 he sort of kind of like, common sense way.

56:27.080 --> 56:31.960
 The 2018 proposal to DARPA from EcoHealth Alliance

56:31.960 --> 56:34.520
 and Wuhan Institute of Virology,

56:34.520 --> 56:37.280
 just seems like a bit of a surprise to me.

56:37.280 --> 56:41.680
 It just seems like a bit of a smoking gun to me, like that.

56:41.680 --> 56:47.680
 So there's this excellent book that people should read called Viro,

56:47.680 --> 56:49.680
 The Search for the Origin of COVID 19.

56:49.680 --> 56:54.000
 Matt Ridley and Alina Chan, I think Alina is in MIT.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.640
 She's at the Broad Institute.

56:56.640 --> 57:03.480
 So I heard her in an interview, give this analogy of unicorns

57:03.480 --> 57:11.480
 and where basically somebody writes a proposal to add horns to horses.

57:11.480 --> 57:14.480
 The proposal is rejected.

57:14.480 --> 57:19.480
 And then a couple of years later, a year later, a unicorn shows up.

57:19.480 --> 57:23.480
 In the place where they're proposing to do it.

57:23.480 --> 57:26.480
 And then everyone was like, it's natural origin.

57:26.480 --> 57:29.480
 It's like, it's possible it's natural origin.

57:29.480 --> 57:31.480
 We haven't detected a unicorn yet,

57:31.480 --> 57:33.480
 it's the first time we've detected a unicorn.

57:33.480 --> 57:39.480
 Or it could be this massive organization that was planning, is fully equipped,

57:39.480 --> 57:42.480
 has like a history of being able to do this stuff,

57:42.480 --> 57:46.480
 has the world experts to do it, has the funding, has the motivation

57:46.480 --> 57:48.480
 to add horns to horses.

57:48.480 --> 57:54.480
 And now a unicorn shows up and they're saying, no, definitely natural.

57:54.480 --> 57:59.480
 That connects to your first question of how do I get to my 85%

57:59.480 --> 58:03.480
 and here's a summary of that answer.

58:03.480 --> 58:07.480
 And so it's what I said in my 60 minutes interview a long time ago

58:07.480 --> 58:09.480
 of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world,

58:09.480 --> 58:11.480
 the quote from Casablanca.

58:11.480 --> 58:16.480
 And so of all the places in the world where we have an outbreak

58:16.480 --> 58:19.480
 of a SARS like bat coronavirus,

58:19.480 --> 58:25.480
 it's not in the area of the natural habitat of the horseshoe bats.

58:25.480 --> 58:31.480
 It's the one city in China with the first and largest level four

58:31.480 --> 58:34.480
 virology lab, which actually wasn't even using it.

58:34.480 --> 58:37.480
 They were doing level three and level two for this work,

58:37.480 --> 58:41.480
 where they had the world's largest collection of bat coronaviruses,

58:41.480 --> 58:46.480
 where they were doing aggressive experiments designed to make these

58:46.480 --> 58:52.480
 scary viruses scarier, where they had been part of an application

58:52.480 --> 58:59.480
 to insert a furring cleavage site able to infect human cells.

58:59.480 --> 59:05.480
 And where when the outbreak happened, we had a virus that was ready

59:05.480 --> 59:09.480
 for action to infect humans and to this day better able to infect humans

59:09.480 --> 59:13.480
 than any other species, including bats.

59:13.480 --> 59:17.480
 And then from day one, there's this massive coverup.

59:17.480 --> 59:21.480
 And then on top of that, in spite of lots of efforts by lots of people,

59:21.480 --> 59:27.480
 there's basically no evidence for the natural origin hypothesis.

59:27.480 --> 59:29.480
 Everything that I've described just now is circumstantial,

59:29.480 --> 59:34.480
 but there's a certain point of where you add up the circumstances.

59:34.480 --> 59:37.480
 And you see, this seems pretty, pretty likely.

59:37.480 --> 59:42.480
 I mean, if we're getting to 100%, we are not at 100% by any means.

59:42.480 --> 59:45.480
 There still is a possibility of a natural origin.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.480
 And if we find that, great.

59:47.480 --> 59:50.480
 But from everything that I know, that's how I get to my 85.

59:50.480 --> 59:55.480
 And we'll talk about why this matters in the political sense

59:55.480 --> 1:00:00.480
 and the human sense in the science, in the realm of science, all of those factors.

1:00:00.480 --> 1:00:04.480
 But first, as Nietzsche said, let us look into the abyss

1:00:04.480 --> 1:00:08.480
 and the games we'll play with monsters that is colloquially called

1:00:08.480 --> 1:00:11.480
 gain of function research.

1:00:11.480 --> 1:00:14.480
 Let me ask the kind of political sounding question,

1:00:14.480 --> 1:00:16.480
 which is how people usually phrase it.

1:00:16.480 --> 1:00:23.480
 Did Anthony Fauci fund gain of function research

1:00:23.480 --> 1:00:26.480
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:27.480
 So it depends.

1:00:27.480 --> 1:00:31.480
 I mean, I've obviously been very closely monitoring this.

1:00:31.480 --> 1:00:32.480
 I've spoken a lot about it.

1:00:32.480 --> 1:00:34.480
 I've written about it.

1:00:34.480 --> 1:00:37.480
 And it depends on, I mean, not to quote Bill Clinton,

1:00:37.480 --> 1:00:41.480
 but to quote Bill Clinton, it depends on what the definition of is is.

1:00:41.480 --> 1:00:46.480
 And so if you use a common sense definition of gain of function,

1:00:46.480 --> 1:00:49.480
 and by gain of function, there are lots of things like gene therapies

1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:50.480
 that are gain of function.

1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:55.480
 But here, what we mean is gain of function for pathogens

1:00:55.480 --> 1:00:59.480
 able, potentially able to create human pandemics.

1:00:59.480 --> 1:01:03.480
 But if you use the kind of common sense language,

1:01:03.480 --> 1:01:05.480
 well, then he probably did.

1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:11.480
 If you use the technical language from a 2017 NIH document,

1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:14.480
 and you read that language very narrowly,

1:01:14.480 --> 1:01:19.480
 I think you can make a credible argument that he did not.

1:01:19.480 --> 1:01:22.480
 There's a question, though, and Francis Collins

1:01:22.480 --> 1:01:25.480
 talked about that in his interview with you.

1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:28.480
 But then there's a question that we know from now

1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:31.480
 that we have the information of the reports submitted

1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:35.480
 by EcoHealth Alliance to the NIH,

1:01:35.480 --> 1:01:38.480
 and some of which were late or not even delivered,

1:01:38.480 --> 1:01:41.480
 that some of this research was done on MERS,

1:01:41.480 --> 1:01:45.480
 Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome virus.

1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:50.480
 And if that was the case, there is, I think, a colorable argument

1:01:50.480 --> 1:01:54.480
 that that would be considered gain of function research

1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:59.480
 even by the narrow language of that 2017 document.

1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:02.480
 But I definitely think, and I've said this repeatedly,

1:02:02.480 --> 1:02:07.480
 that Rand Paul can be right, and Tony Fauci can be right.

1:02:07.480 --> 1:02:11.480
 And the question is, how are we defining gain of function?

1:02:11.480 --> 1:02:14.480
 And that's why I've always said the question in my mind

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.480
 isn't was it or wasn't it gain of function,

1:02:17.480 --> 1:02:21.480
 as if that's like a binary thing, if not great,

1:02:21.480 --> 1:02:23.480
 and if yes, guilty.

1:02:23.480 --> 1:02:26.480
 The question is just, what work was being done

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:28.480
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:33.480
 What role, if any, did U.S. government funding

1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:36.480
 play in supporting that work?

1:02:36.480 --> 1:02:41.480
 And what rights do we all have as human beings

1:02:41.480 --> 1:02:43.480
 and as American citizens and taxpayers

1:02:43.480 --> 1:02:46.480
 to get all of the relevant information about them?

1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:51.480
 So let's try to kind of dissect this.

1:02:51.480 --> 1:02:54.480
 So who frustrates you more, Rand Paul

1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:57.480
 or Anthony Fauci's discussion, or the discussion itself?

1:02:57.480 --> 1:03:01.480
 So for example, gain of function is a term

1:03:01.480 --> 1:03:08.480
 that's kind of more used just to mean

1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:11.480
 making, playing with viruses in one lab

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:15.480
 to try to develop more dangerous viruses.

1:03:15.480 --> 1:03:21.480
 Is this kind of research a good idea?

1:03:21.480 --> 1:03:25.480
 Is it also a good idea for us to talk about it

1:03:25.480 --> 1:03:29.480
 in public, in the political way that it's been talked about?

1:03:29.480 --> 1:03:35.480
 Is it okay that U.S. may have funded

1:03:35.480 --> 1:03:38.480
 gain of function research elsewhere?

1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:42.480
 I mean, it's kind of assumed, just like with Bill Clinton,

1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:46.480
 there was very little discussion of, I think,

1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:48.480
 correct me if I'm wrong, but, you know,

1:03:48.480 --> 1:03:53.480
 whether it's okay for a president, male or female,

1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:57.480
 to have extramarital sex, okay?

1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:03.480
 Or is it okay for a president to have extramarital sex

1:04:03.480 --> 1:04:08.480
 with people on his staff or her staff?

1:04:08.480 --> 1:04:11.480
 It was more the discussion of lying, I think.

1:04:11.480 --> 1:04:15.480
 It was, did you lie about having sex or not?

1:04:15.480 --> 1:04:17.480
 And in this gain of function discussion,

1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:20.480
 what frustrates me personally is there's not

1:04:20.480 --> 1:04:23.480
 a deep philosophical discussion about whether

1:04:23.480 --> 1:04:25.480
 we should be doing this kind of research

1:04:25.480 --> 1:04:30.480
 and what kinds, like, what are the ethical lines?

1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:32.480
 Research on animals at all.

1:04:32.480 --> 1:04:33.480
 Those are fascinating questions.

1:04:33.480 --> 1:04:36.480
 Instead, it's a gotcha thing.

1:04:36.480 --> 1:04:40.480
 Did you or did you not fund research on gain of function?

1:04:40.480 --> 1:04:43.480
 And did you fund, it's almost like a bio weapon.

1:04:43.480 --> 1:04:47.480
 Did you give money to China to develop this bio weapon

1:04:47.480 --> 1:04:49.480
 that now attacked the rest of the world?

1:04:49.480 --> 1:04:52.480
 So, I mean, all those things are pretty frustrating,

1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:56.480
 but is there, I think the thing you can untangle

1:04:56.480 --> 1:04:59.480
 about Anthony Fauci and gain of function research

1:04:59.480 --> 1:05:01.480
 in the United States and equal health alliance

1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:05.480
 and Wuhan Institute of virology that's kind of,

1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:08.480
 that's clarifying, what were the mistakes made?

1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:09.480
 Sure.

1:05:09.480 --> 1:05:12.480
 So, on gain of function, there actually has been a lot

1:05:12.480 --> 1:05:15.480
 of debate, and I mentioned before in 2011,

1:05:15.480 --> 1:05:19.480
 these first papers, there was a big debate.

1:05:19.480 --> 1:05:22.480
 Mark Lipsitch, who's formerly at Harvard now

1:05:22.480 --> 1:05:26.480
 with the US government working in the president's office,

1:05:26.480 --> 1:05:29.480
 he led a thing called the Cambridge Group

1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:32.480
 that was highly critical of this work,

1:05:32.480 --> 1:05:35.480
 but basically saying we're creating monsters.

1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:38.480
 They had the funding pause in 2014.

1:05:38.480 --> 1:05:42.480
 They spent three years putting together a framework,

1:05:42.480 --> 1:05:44.480
 and then they lifted it in 2017.

1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:46.480
 So, we had a thoughtful conversation.

1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:48.480
 Unfortunately, it didn't work,

1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:50.480
 and I think that's where we are now.

1:05:50.480 --> 1:05:54.480
 So, I absolutely think that there are real issues

1:05:54.480 --> 1:05:58.480
 with the relationship between the United States government

1:05:58.480 --> 1:06:01.480
 and eco health alliance, and through that,

1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:04.480
 eco health alliance with the Wuhan Institute of virology.

1:06:04.480 --> 1:06:07.480
 And one issue is just essential transparency,

1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:10.480
 because as I see it, it's most likely the case

1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:12.480
 that we transferred a lot of our knowledge

1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:16.480
 and plans and things to the Wuhan Institute of virology.

1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:22.480
 And again, I'm sure that Xu Zhengli is not herself a monster.

1:06:22.480 --> 1:06:25.480
 I'm sure of that, even though I've never met her.

1:06:25.480 --> 1:06:29.480
 But there are just a different set of pressures on people

1:06:29.480 --> 1:06:31.480
 working in an authoritarian system

1:06:31.480 --> 1:06:33.480
 than people who are working in other systems.

1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:36.480
 That doesn't mean it's entirely different.

1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:40.480
 And so, I absolutely think that we shouldn't give one dollar

1:06:40.480 --> 1:06:43.480
 to an organization and certainly a virology institute

1:06:43.480 --> 1:06:47.480
 where you don't have full access to their records,

1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:51.480
 to their databases, we don't know what work is happening there.

1:06:51.480 --> 1:06:56.480
 And I think that we need to have that kind of full examination.

1:06:56.480 --> 1:07:00.480
 And that's why, so I understand what Dr. Fauci is doing,

1:07:00.480 --> 1:07:02.480
 is saying, hey, what I hear, Dr. Fauci saying,

1:07:02.480 --> 1:07:04.480
 what I hear from you, Rand Paul,

1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:08.480
 is you're accusing me of starting this pandemic

1:07:08.480 --> 1:07:11.480
 and you're using gain of function as a proxy for that.

1:07:11.480 --> 1:07:13.480
 And we have, when there are Senate hearings,

1:07:13.480 --> 1:07:15.480
 every Senator gets five minutes.

1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:18.480
 And the name of the game is to translate your five minutes

1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:21.480
 into a clip that's going to run on the news.

1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:25.480
 And so, I get that there is that kind of, gotcha.

1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:31.480
 But I also think that Dr. Fauci and the National Institute

1:07:31.480 --> 1:07:34.480
 of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the NIH

1:07:34.480 --> 1:07:36.480
 should have been more transparent.

1:07:36.480 --> 1:07:40.480
 Because I think that in this day and age

1:07:40.480 --> 1:07:42.480
 where there are a lot of people poking around

1:07:42.480 --> 1:07:44.480
 in this whole story of COVID origins,

1:07:44.480 --> 1:07:47.480
 we would not be where we are if it wasn't

1:07:47.480 --> 1:07:50.480
 for a relatively small number of people.

1:07:50.480 --> 1:07:54.480
 And I'm part of, there are two, as I know, two groups.

1:07:54.480 --> 1:07:57.480
 One is these internet sleuths known as drastic.

1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:01.480
 And a number of them are part of a group that I'm part of called,

1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:03.480
 it's not our official name, but called the Paris Group.

1:08:03.480 --> 1:08:07.480
 It's about two dozen experts around the world,

1:08:07.480 --> 1:08:12.480
 but centered around some very high level French academics.

1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:16.480
 So we've all been digging and meeting with each other regularly

1:08:16.480 --> 1:08:18.480
 since last year.

1:08:18.480 --> 1:08:21.480
 And our governments across the board, certainly China,

1:08:21.480 --> 1:08:24.480
 but including the United States, haven't been as transparent

1:08:24.480 --> 1:08:26.480
 as they need to be.

1:08:26.480 --> 1:08:30.480
 So there's definitely mistakes were made on all sides.

1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:33.480
 And that's why, for me, from day one,

1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:36.480
 I've been calling for a comprehensive investigation

1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:40.480
 into this issue that certainly obviously looks at China.

1:08:40.480 --> 1:08:41.480
 But we have to look at ourselves.

1:08:41.480 --> 1:08:43.480
 We did not get this right.

1:08:43.480 --> 1:08:49.480
 So to you, I'm just going to put Rand Paul aside here.

1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:51.480
 He's a politician playing political games.

1:08:51.480 --> 1:08:55.480
 It's very frustrating, but it is what it is on all sides.

1:08:55.480 --> 1:08:59.480
 Anthony Fauci, you think should have been more transparent.

1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:09.480
 And maybe more eloquent in expressing the complexity

1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:12.480
 of all of this, the uncertainty in all of this.

1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:13.480
 Yeah.

1:09:13.480 --> 1:09:16.480
 And I get that it's really hard to do that,

1:09:16.480 --> 1:09:20.480
 because let's say you have one, you speak a paragraph,

1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:22.480
 and it's got four sentences.

1:09:22.480 --> 1:09:26.480
 And one of those sentences is the thing that's going to be turned

1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:27.480
 into Twitter.

1:09:27.480 --> 1:09:30.480
 Let me put it back.

1:09:30.480 --> 1:09:32.480
 I'll try not to be emotional about this,

1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:39.480
 but I've heard Anthony Fauci a couple of times now say

1:09:39.480 --> 1:09:43.480
 that he represents science.

1:09:43.480 --> 1:09:45.480
 I know what he means by that.

1:09:45.480 --> 1:09:50.480
 He means in the political bickering, all that kind of stuff,

1:09:50.480 --> 1:09:54.480
 that for a lot of people, he represents science.

1:09:54.480 --> 1:09:56.480
 But words matter.

1:09:56.480 --> 1:09:58.480
 And this isn't just clips.

1:09:58.480 --> 1:10:01.480
 I mean, maybe I'm distinctly aware of that doing this podcast.

1:10:01.480 --> 1:10:07.480
 Yeah, I talk for hundreds of hours now, maybe over 1,000 hours.

1:10:07.480 --> 1:10:11.480
 But I'm still careful with the words.

1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.480
 I'm trying not to be an asshole, and I'm aware when I'm an asshole

1:10:14.480 --> 1:10:17.480
 and I'll apologize for it.

1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:21.480
 If the words I represent science left my mouth,

1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:25.480
 which they very well could, I would sure as hell be apologizing

1:10:25.480 --> 1:10:26.480
 for it.

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:28.480
 And not enough because I got in trouble.

1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:31.480
 I would just feel bad about saying something like that.

1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.480
 And even that little phrase, I represent science.

1:10:35.480 --> 1:10:38.480
 No, Dr. Fauci, you do not represent science.

1:10:38.480 --> 1:10:39.480
 I love science.

1:10:39.480 --> 1:10:44.480
 The millions of scientists that inspired me to get into it.

1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:50.480
 To fall in love with the scientific method in the exploration

1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:53.480
 of ideas through the rigor of science.

1:10:53.480 --> 1:10:56.480
 That Anthony Fauci does not represent.

1:10:56.480 --> 1:11:00.480
 He's one, I believe, great scientist of millions.

1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:03.480
 He does not represent anybody.

1:11:03.480 --> 1:11:05.480
 He's just one scientist.

1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:09.480
 And I think the greatness of a scientist is best exemplified

1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:14.480
 in humility because the scientific method basically says,

1:11:14.480 --> 1:11:19.480
 like, you're standing before the fog, the mystery of it all,

1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:22.480
 and slowly chipping away at the mystery.

1:11:22.480 --> 1:11:25.480
 And it's embarrassing.

1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:28.480
 It's humiliating how little you know.

1:11:28.480 --> 1:11:29.480
 That's the experience.

1:11:29.480 --> 1:11:32.480
 So the great scientists have to have humility to me.

1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:34.480
 And especially in their communication,

1:11:34.480 --> 1:11:36.480
 they have to have humility.

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:37.480
 I don't know.

1:11:37.480 --> 1:11:43.480
 And some of it is also words matter because great leaders

1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:45.480
 have to have the poetry of action.

1:11:45.480 --> 1:11:50.480
 They have to be bold and inspire action across millions

1:11:50.480 --> 1:11:52.480
 of people.

1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:58.480
 But you also have to, through that poetry of words,

1:11:58.480 --> 1:12:03.480
 express the complexity of the uncertainty you're operating

1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:06.480
 under, be humble in the face of not being able to predict

1:12:06.480 --> 1:12:09.480
 the future or understand the past,

1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:11.480
 or really know what's the right thing to do,

1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:13.480
 but we have to do something.

1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:16.480
 And through that, you have to be a great leader

1:12:16.480 --> 1:12:18.480
 that inspires action.

1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:20.480
 Some of that is just words.

1:12:20.480 --> 1:12:22.480
 And he chose words poorly.

1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:25.480
 So I'm all torn about this.

1:12:25.480 --> 1:12:28.480
 And then there's politicians that are taking those words

1:12:28.480 --> 1:12:31.480
 and magnifying them and playing games with them.

1:12:31.480 --> 1:12:35.480
 And of course, that's a decent incentive for the people

1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:39.480
 who do the scientific leaders that step into the limelight

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:41.480
 to say any more words.

1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:43.480
 So they kind of become more conservative

1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:45.480
 with the words they use.

1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:47.480
 I mean, it just becomes a giant mess.

1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:52.480
 And I think the solution is to ignore all of that

1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:56.480
 and to be transparent, to be honest, to be vulnerable,

1:12:56.480 --> 1:13:03.480
 and to express the full uncertainty of what you're operating under

1:13:03.480 --> 1:13:05.480
 to present all the possible actions

1:13:05.480 --> 1:13:08.480
 and to be honest about the mistakes they made in the past.

1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:11.480
 I mean, there's something, even if you're not directly responsible

1:13:11.480 --> 1:13:15.480
 for those mistakes, taking responsibility for them

1:13:15.480 --> 1:13:17.480
 is a way to win people over.

1:13:17.480 --> 1:13:21.480
 I don't think leaders realize this often in the modern age.

1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:24.480
 In the internet age, they can see through your bullshit.

1:13:24.480 --> 1:13:28.480
 And it's really inspiring when you take ownership,

1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:32.480
 sort of do the thought experiment in public,

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:34.480
 do a thought experiment if there was a lab leak,

1:13:34.480 --> 1:13:38.480
 and then lay out all the funding, the EcoHealth Alliance,

1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:41.480
 all the incredible science going on

1:13:41.480 --> 1:13:45.480
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the NIH.

1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:48.480
 Lay out all the possible ethical problems.

1:13:48.480 --> 1:13:53.480
 Lay out all the possible mistakes that could have been made

1:13:53.480 --> 1:13:55.480
 and say, like, this could have happened,

1:13:55.480 --> 1:13:59.480
 and if this happened, here's the best way to respond to it

1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:00.480
 and to prevent it in the future.

1:14:00.480 --> 1:14:02.480
 And just lay all that complexity out.

1:14:02.480 --> 1:14:05.480
 I mean, I wish we would have seen it.

1:14:05.480 --> 1:14:08.480
 And I have hope that this conversation,

1:14:08.480 --> 1:14:13.480
 conversations like at your work and books on this topic

1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:15.480
 will inspire young people today

1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:19.480
 when they become in the Anthony Fauci's role

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:21.480
 to be much more transparent and much more humble

1:14:21.480 --> 1:14:23.480
 and all of those kinds of things,

1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:25.480
 that this is just a relic of the past.

1:14:25.480 --> 1:14:27.480
 When there's a person, no offense to me,

1:14:27.480 --> 1:14:30.480
 in a suit that has to stand up and speak

1:14:30.480 --> 1:14:32.480
 with clarity and certainty.

1:14:32.480 --> 1:14:34.480
 I mean, that's just a relic of the past.

1:14:34.480 --> 1:14:39.480
 This is my hope, but...

1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:41.480
 Do you mind if I...

1:14:41.480 --> 1:14:45.480
 Because I agree with a great deal of what you said,

1:14:45.480 --> 1:14:48.480
 and it's really unfortunate

1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:50.480
 that certainly the Chinese government,

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:55.480
 as I said before, our government wasn't as transparent

1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:56.480
 as I feel they should have been,

1:14:56.480 --> 1:14:59.480
 particularly in the early days of the pandemic

1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:03.480
 and particularly with regard to the issue of pandemic origins.

1:15:03.480 --> 1:15:06.480
 I mean, we know that Dr. Fauci was on calls

1:15:06.480 --> 1:15:10.480
 with people like Christian Anderson at Scripps and others

1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:13.480
 in those early days raising questions,

1:15:13.480 --> 1:15:15.480
 is this an engineered virus?

1:15:15.480 --> 1:15:17.480
 There were a lot of questions.

1:15:17.480 --> 1:15:19.480
 And it's kind of sad.

1:15:19.480 --> 1:15:23.480
 I mean, as I mentioned before, I've been one,

1:15:23.480 --> 1:15:25.480
 and certainly there were others,

1:15:25.480 --> 1:15:28.480
 but there weren't a lot of us of the people

1:15:28.480 --> 1:15:30.480
 who from the earliest days of the pandemic

1:15:30.480 --> 1:15:34.480
 were raising questions about, hey, not so fast here.

1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:38.480
 And I launched my website on pandemic origins

1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:40.480
 in April of last year, April 2020.

1:15:40.480 --> 1:15:42.480
 It got a huge amount of attention.

1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:44.480
 And actually, my friend Matt Pottinger,

1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:46.480
 who was the deputy national security advisor,

1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:49.480
 when he was reaching out to people in the U.S. government

1:15:49.480 --> 1:15:51.480
 and in allied government saying,

1:15:51.480 --> 1:15:53.480
 hey, we should look into this,

1:15:53.480 --> 1:15:56.480
 what he was sending them was my website.

1:15:56.480 --> 1:15:59.480
 It wasn't some U.S. government information.

1:15:59.480 --> 1:16:02.480
 And by the way, people should still go to the website.

1:16:02.480 --> 1:16:04.480
 You keep getting, you keep updating it,

1:16:04.480 --> 1:16:06.480
 and it's an incredible resource.

1:16:06.480 --> 1:16:09.480
 Well, thank you. Thank you. JamieMetall.com.

1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:12.480
 And it's really unfortunate that our governments

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:14.480
 and international institutions,

1:16:14.480 --> 1:16:17.480
 for pretty much all of 2020,

1:16:17.480 --> 1:16:21.480
 weren't doing their jobs of really probing this issue.

1:16:21.480 --> 1:16:25.480
 People were hiding behind this kind of false consensus.

1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:27.480
 And I'm critical of many people,

1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:31.480
 even when I heard Francis Collins interview with you.

1:16:31.480 --> 1:16:34.480
 I just felt, well, he wasn't as balanced

1:16:34.480 --> 1:16:36.480
 on the issue of COVID origins.

1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:39.480
 Certainly Dr. Fauci could have,

1:16:39.480 --> 1:16:41.480
 in his conversation with Rand Paul,

1:16:41.480 --> 1:16:43.480
 it wasn't even a conversation,

1:16:43.480 --> 1:16:45.480
 but in some process in the aftermath,

1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:47.480
 could have laid things out a bit better.

1:16:47.480 --> 1:16:50.480
 He did say, and Francis Collins did say,

1:16:50.480 --> 1:16:53.480
 that we don't know the origins, and that was a shift.

1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:55.480
 And we need to have an investigation.

1:16:55.480 --> 1:16:59.480
 So now, but having said all of that,

1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:03.480
 I do kind of, one, I have tremendous respect

1:17:03.480 --> 1:17:06.480
 for Dr. Fauci for the work that he's done on HIV AIDS.

1:17:06.480 --> 1:17:10.480
 I mean, I have been vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine.

1:17:10.480 --> 1:17:13.480
 Dr. Fauci was a big part of the story

1:17:13.480 --> 1:17:15.480
 of getting us these vaccines

1:17:15.480 --> 1:17:18.480
 that have saved millions and millions of lives.

1:17:18.480 --> 1:17:22.480
 And so I don't think, I mean, there's a lot to this story.

1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:25.480
 And then the second thing is it's really hard

1:17:25.480 --> 1:17:28.480
 to be a public health expert because you have,

1:17:28.480 --> 1:17:31.480
 your mission is public health.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:34.480
 And so, and you have to, if you are leading

1:17:34.480 --> 1:17:36.480
 with all of your uncertainty,

1:17:36.480 --> 1:17:39.480
 it's a really hard way to do things.

1:17:39.480 --> 1:17:42.480
 And so like even now, like if I go to CVS

1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:47.480
 and I get a Tylenol, somebody has done a calculation

1:17:47.480 --> 1:17:50.480
 of how many people will die from taking Tylenol.

1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:53.480
 And they say, well, all right, we can live with that.

1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:55.480
 And that's why we have regulation.

1:17:55.480 --> 1:17:58.480
 And so all of us are doing kind of summaries.

1:17:58.480 --> 1:18:00.480
 And then we have people in public health who are saying,

1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:04.480
 well, we've summed it all up and you should do it.

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:08.480
 You should get your kids vaccinated for measles.

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:12.480
 You should not drive your car at 100 miles an hour.

1:18:12.480 --> 1:18:14.480
 You should don't drink lighter fluid,

1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:16.480
 whatever these things are.

1:18:16.480 --> 1:18:19.480
 And we want them to kind of give us broad guidelines

1:18:19.480 --> 1:18:24.480
 and yet now our information world is so fragmented

1:18:24.480 --> 1:18:29.480
 that if you're not being honest about something,

1:18:29.480 --> 1:18:32.480
 something material, someone's going to find out

1:18:32.480 --> 1:18:34.480
 and it's going to undermine your credibility.

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:40.480
 And so I agree with you that there's a greater requirement

1:18:40.480 --> 1:18:42.480
 for transparency now.

1:18:42.480 --> 1:18:44.480
 Maybe there always has been,

1:18:44.480 --> 1:18:48.480
 but there's an even greater requirement for it now

1:18:48.480 --> 1:18:53.480
 because people want to trust that you're speaking honestly

1:18:53.480 --> 1:18:55.480
 and that you're saying, well, here's what I know.

1:18:55.480 --> 1:18:58.480
 And this is based on what I know.

1:18:58.480 --> 1:19:00.480
 Here are the conclusions that I draw.

1:19:00.480 --> 1:19:03.480
 But if it's just, and again, I don't think the words

1:19:03.480 --> 1:19:06.480
 I'm science or whatever it was are the right words.

1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:10.480
 But if it's just, you know, trust me because of who I am,

1:19:10.480 --> 1:19:14.480
 I don't think that flies anywhere anymore.

1:19:14.480 --> 1:19:17.480
 Can I just ask you about the Francis Collins interview

1:19:17.480 --> 1:19:18.480
 that I did?

1:19:18.480 --> 1:19:19.480
 If you got a chance to hear that part,

1:19:19.480 --> 1:19:23.480
 I think in the beginning we talk about the loud leak.

1:19:23.480 --> 1:19:25.480
 What are your thoughts about his response?

1:19:25.480 --> 1:19:28.480
 Basically saying it's worthy of an investigation,

1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:33.480
 but I mean, I don't know how you would interpret it.

1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:39.480
 See, it's funny because I heard it in the moment

1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:46.480
 as it's great for the head of NIH to be open minded on this.

1:19:46.480 --> 1:19:51.480
 But then the internet and Mr. Joe Rogan and a bunch of friends

1:19:51.480 --> 1:19:56.480
 and colleagues told me that, yeah, well, that's too late

1:19:56.480 --> 1:19:58.480
 and too little.

1:19:58.480 --> 1:20:02.480
 Yeah, so first let me say I've been on Joe's podcast twice

1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:05.480
 and I love the guy, which doesn't mean that I agree

1:20:05.480 --> 1:20:09.480
 with everything he does or says.

1:20:09.480 --> 1:20:13.480
 And on this issue, and I'm normally a pretty calm

1:20:13.480 --> 1:20:16.480
 and measured guy, and when you're just out running

1:20:16.480 --> 1:20:22.480
 with your AirPods on and you start yelling into the wind

1:20:22.480 --> 1:20:26.480
 in Central Park, nobody else knows why you're yelling.

1:20:26.480 --> 1:20:28.480
 So you had such a moment?

1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:30.480
 I had a moment with Collins.

1:20:30.480 --> 1:20:33.480
 And again, Francis Collins is someone I respect enormously.

1:20:33.480 --> 1:20:38.480
 I mean, I live a big chunk of my life living in the world

1:20:38.480 --> 1:20:42.480
 of genetics and biotech and my book Hacking Darwin

1:20:42.480 --> 1:20:44.480
 is about the future of human engineering

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:47.480
 and his work on the Human Genome Project

1:20:47.480 --> 1:20:49.480
 and so many other things have been fantastic.

1:20:49.480 --> 1:20:53.480
 And I'm a huge fan of the work of NIH

1:20:53.480 --> 1:20:56.480
 and he was right to say that the Chinese government

1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:58.480
 hasn't been forthcoming and we need to look into it.

1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:01.480
 But then you asked him, well, how will we know?

1:21:01.480 --> 1:21:06.480
 And then his answer was, we need to find the intermediate host.

1:21:06.480 --> 1:21:09.480
 Remember I said before, and so that made it clear

1:21:09.480 --> 1:21:13.480
 that he thought, well, we should have an investigation

1:21:13.480 --> 1:21:16.480
 but it comes from nature and we just need to find

1:21:16.480 --> 1:21:20.480
 that whatever it is, that intermediate animal host

1:21:20.480 --> 1:21:22.480
 in the wild and that'll tell us the story.

1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:25.480
 So he already had the conclusion in mind

1:21:25.480 --> 1:21:27.480
 and they're just waiting for the evidence

1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:28.480
 to support the conclusion.

1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:29.480
 That was my feeling.

1:21:29.480 --> 1:21:33.480
 I felt like he was open in general but he was tilting

1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:36.480
 and again, your first question was where do I fall?

1:21:36.480 --> 1:21:41.480
 He was like, I'm 85% or whatever it is, 80, 75, 90,

1:21:41.480 --> 1:21:44.480
 whatever it is in the direction of a lab incident.

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:49.480
 It made it feel that he was 90, 10 in the other direction

1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:53.480
 which still means that he's open minded about the possibility

1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:57.480
 and that's why in my view, every single person

1:21:57.480 --> 1:22:00.480
 who talks about this issue, I think the right answer

1:22:00.480 --> 1:22:04.480
 in my view is we don't know conclusively.

1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:06.480
 In my, then this is my personal view,

1:22:06.480 --> 1:22:09.480
 the circumstantial evidence is strongly in favor

1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:12.480
 of a lab incident origin but that could immediately shift

1:22:12.480 --> 1:22:14.480
 with additional information.

1:22:14.480 --> 1:22:19.480
 We need transparency but we should come together

1:22:19.480 --> 1:22:23.480
 in absolutely condemning the outrageous coverup

1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:25.480
 carried out by the Chinese government

1:22:25.480 --> 1:22:30.480
 which to this day is preventing any meaningful investigation

1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:32.480
 into pandemic origins.

1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:35.480
 We have, if you use the economist numbers,

1:22:35.480 --> 1:22:40.480
 15 million people who are dead as a result of this pandemic

1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:44.480
 and I believe that the actions of the Chinese government

1:22:44.480 --> 1:22:49.480
 are disgracing the memory of these 15 million dead.

1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:54.480
 They're insulting the families and the billions of people

1:22:54.480 --> 1:22:56.480
 around the world who have suffered

1:22:56.480 --> 1:23:00.480
 from this totally avoidable pandemic

1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:03.480
 and whatever the origin, the fact the criminal coverup

1:23:03.480 --> 1:23:06.480
 carried out by the Chinese government

1:23:06.480 --> 1:23:09.480
 which continues to this day but most intensely

1:23:09.480 --> 1:23:11.480
 in the first months following the outbreak,

1:23:11.480 --> 1:23:16.480
 that's the reason why we have so many dead

1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:18.480
 and certainly as I was saying before,

1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:22.480
 I and a small number of others have been carrying this flame

1:23:22.480 --> 1:23:26.480
 since early last year but it's kind of crazy

1:23:26.480 --> 1:23:29.480
 that our governments haven't been demanding it

1:23:29.480 --> 1:23:33.480
 and we can talk about the World Health Organization process

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:35.480
 which was deeply compromised in the beginning.

1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:38.480
 Now it's become much, much better

1:23:38.480 --> 1:23:42.480
 but again, it was the pressure of outsiders

1:23:42.480 --> 1:23:44.480
 that played such an important role

1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:48.480
 in shifting our national and international institutions

1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:50.480
 and while that's better than nothing,

1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:52.480
 it would have been far better

1:23:52.480 --> 1:23:55.480
 if our governments and international organizations

1:23:55.480 --> 1:23:56.480
 had done the right thing from this point.

1:23:56.480 --> 1:24:04.480
 If I could just make a couple of comments about Joe Rogan.

1:24:04.480 --> 1:24:08.480
 So there's a bunch of people in my life

1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:11.480
 who have inspired me, who have taught me a lot,

1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:14.480
 who I even look up to.

1:24:14.480 --> 1:24:18.480
 Many of them are alive, most of them are dead.

1:24:18.480 --> 1:24:22.480
 I want to say that Joe said a few critical words

1:24:22.480 --> 1:24:24.480
 about the conversation with Francis Collins.

1:24:24.480 --> 1:24:29.480
 Most of it offline with a lot of great conversations about it.

1:24:29.480 --> 1:24:32.480
 Some he said publicly.

1:24:32.480 --> 1:24:41.480
 And he was also critical to say that

1:24:41.480 --> 1:24:47.480
 me asking hard questions in an interview is not my strong suit.

1:24:47.480 --> 1:24:52.480
 And I really want to kind of respond to that

1:24:52.480 --> 1:24:56.480
 which I did privately as well publicly

1:24:56.480 --> 1:25:00.480
 to say that Joe is 100% right on that.

1:25:00.480 --> 1:25:03.480
 But that doesn't mean that always has to be the case.

1:25:03.480 --> 1:25:06.480
 And that is definitely something I want to work on

1:25:06.480 --> 1:25:08.480
 because most of the conversations I have,

1:25:08.480 --> 1:25:12.480
 I want to see the beautiful ideas in people's minds.

1:25:12.480 --> 1:25:16.480
 But there's some times where you have to ask the hard questions

1:25:16.480 --> 1:25:19.480
 to bring out the beautiful ideas.

1:25:19.480 --> 1:25:22.480
 And it's hard to do.

1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:23.480
 It's a skill.

1:25:23.480 --> 1:25:26.480
 And Joe is very good at this.

1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:29.480
 He says the way he put it in his criticisms

1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:31.480
 and he does this in his conversations,

1:25:31.480 --> 1:25:34.480
 which is, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:38.480
 There's a kind of sense like, did you just say what you said?

1:25:38.480 --> 1:25:42.480
 Let's make sure we get to the bottom,

1:25:42.480 --> 1:25:47.480
 we clarify what you mean.

1:25:47.480 --> 1:25:54.480
 Because sometimes really big negative or difficult ideas

1:25:54.480 --> 1:25:58.480
 can be said as a quick aside in a sentence.

1:25:58.480 --> 1:26:00.480
 Like it's nothing.

1:26:00.480 --> 1:26:02.480
 But it could be everything.

1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:04.480
 And you want to make sure you catch that

1:26:04.480 --> 1:26:06.480
 and you talk about it.

1:26:06.480 --> 1:26:08.480
 And not as a gotcha,

1:26:08.480 --> 1:26:12.480
 not as a kind of way to destroy another human being

1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:14.480
 but to reveal something profound.

1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:16.480
 And that's definitely something I want to work on.

1:26:16.480 --> 1:26:21.480
 I also want to say that as you said,

1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:24.480
 you disagree with Joe on quite a lot of things.

1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:26.480
 So for a long time, Joe was somebody

1:26:26.480 --> 1:26:28.480
 that I was just a fan of and listened to.

1:26:28.480 --> 1:26:30.480
 He's now a good friend.

1:26:30.480 --> 1:26:34.480
 And I would say we disagree more than we agree.

1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:36.480
 And I love doing that.

1:26:36.480 --> 1:26:41.480
 But at the same time, I learned from that.

1:26:41.480 --> 1:26:46.480
 So it's like dual, like nobody in this world

1:26:46.480 --> 1:26:48.480
 can tell me what to think.

1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:53.480
 But I think everybody has a lesson to teach me.

1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:56.480
 I think that's a good way to approach it.

1:26:56.480 --> 1:26:59.480
 Whenever somebody has words of criticism,

1:26:59.480 --> 1:27:04.480
 I assume they're right and walk around with that idea.

1:27:04.480 --> 1:27:07.480
 To really sort of empathize with that idea

1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:09.480
 because there's a lesson there.

1:27:09.480 --> 1:27:16.480
 Sometimes my understanding of a topic

1:27:16.480 --> 1:27:22.480
 is altered completely or it becomes much more nuanced

1:27:22.480 --> 1:27:27.480
 and much richer for that kind of empathetic process.

1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:32.480
 But definitely, I do not allow anybody to tell me what to think,

1:27:32.480 --> 1:27:37.480
 whether it's Joe Rogan or Fyodor Dostoyevsky or Nietzsche

1:27:37.480 --> 1:27:44.480
 or my parents or the proverbial girlfriend

1:27:44.480 --> 1:27:46.480
 which I don't actually have.

1:27:46.480 --> 1:27:49.480
 But she's still busting my balls.

1:27:49.480 --> 1:27:52.480
 Exactly, in my imagination.

1:27:52.480 --> 1:27:57.480
 I have a girlfriend in Canada that I have to imagine.

1:27:57.480 --> 1:27:59.480
 Exactly, imagine conversations.

1:27:59.480 --> 1:28:01.480
 I don't want to mention that.

1:28:01.480 --> 1:28:04.480
 But also, I don't know if you've gotten a chance to see this.

1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:09.480
 I'd love to also mention this Twitter feud

1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:12.480
 between two other interesting people,

1:28:12.480 --> 1:28:15.480
 which is Brett Weinstein and Sam Harris

1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:18.480
 or Sam Harris and others in general.

1:28:18.480 --> 1:28:22.480
 It kind of breaks my heart that these two people I listen to

1:28:22.480 --> 1:28:25.480
 that are very thoughtful about a bunch of issues.

1:28:25.480 --> 1:28:27.480
 Let's put COVID aside

1:28:27.480 --> 1:28:30.480
 because people are very emotional about this topic.

1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:37.480
 I mean, I think they're deeply thoughtful and intelligent

1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:39.480
 whether you agree with them or not.

1:28:39.480 --> 1:28:42.480
 And I always learn something from their conversations.

1:28:42.480 --> 1:28:46.480
 And they are legitimately or have been for a long time friends.

1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:49.480
 And it's a little bit heartbreaking to me

1:28:49.480 --> 1:28:53.480
 to see that they basically don't talk in private anymore

1:28:53.480 --> 1:28:57.480
 and there's occasional jabs on Twitter.

1:28:57.480 --> 1:29:00.480
 And I hope that changes.

1:29:00.480 --> 1:29:02.480
 I hope that changes in general for COVID

1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:06.480
 that COVID brought out the, I would say,

1:29:06.480 --> 1:29:10.480
 the most emotional sides of people, the worst than people.

1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:14.480
 And I think there hasn't been enough love

1:29:14.480 --> 1:29:16.480
 and empathy and compassion.

1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:20.480
 And to see two people from whom I've learned a lot,

1:29:20.480 --> 1:29:23.480
 whether it's Eric Weinstein, Brett Weinstein, Sam Harris,

1:29:23.480 --> 1:29:25.480
 you can criticize them as much as you want,

1:29:25.480 --> 1:29:27.480
 their ideas as much as you want.

1:29:27.480 --> 1:29:30.480
 But if you're not sufficiently open minded

1:29:30.480 --> 1:29:34.480
 to admit that you have a lot to learn from their conversations,

1:29:34.480 --> 1:29:37.480
 I think you're not being honest.

1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:40.480
 And so I do hope they have those conversations.

1:29:40.480 --> 1:29:42.480
 And I hope we can kind of,

1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:45.480
 I think there's a lot of repairing to be done post COVID

1:29:45.480 --> 1:29:49.480
 of relationships, of conversations.

1:29:49.480 --> 1:29:53.480
 And I think empathy and love can help a lot there.

1:29:53.480 --> 1:29:55.480
 And this is also just a,

1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:58.480
 I talked to Sam privately,

1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:00.480
 but this is also a public call out

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:07.480
 to put a little bit more love in the world.

1:30:07.480 --> 1:30:14.480
 And for these difficult conversations to happen.

1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:22.480
 Because Brett Weinstein could be very wrong

1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:25.480
 about a bunch of topics here around COVID.

1:30:25.480 --> 1:30:27.480
 But he could also be right.

1:30:27.480 --> 1:30:30.480
 And the only way to find out is to have those conversations.

1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:33.480
 Because there's a lot of people listening to both Sam Harris

1:30:33.480 --> 1:30:35.480
 and Brett Weinstein.

1:30:35.480 --> 1:30:41.480
 And if you go into these silos where you just keep telling

1:30:41.480 --> 1:30:46.480
 each other that you are the possessors of truth

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:48.480
 and nobody else is the possessor of truth,

1:30:48.480 --> 1:30:53.480
 what starts happening is you both lose track

1:30:53.480 --> 1:30:56.480
 or the capability of arriving at the truth.

1:30:56.480 --> 1:30:58.480
 Because nobody's in the possession of the truth.

1:30:58.480 --> 1:31:00.480
 So anyway, there's just a call out that we should have

1:31:00.480 --> 1:31:02.480
 a little bit more conversation, a little bit more love.

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:04.480
 I totally agree.

1:31:04.480 --> 1:31:08.480
 And both of those guys are guys who I respect.

1:31:08.480 --> 1:31:11.480
 And as you know, Brett and again, as I mentioned,

1:31:11.480 --> 1:31:15.480
 they're just a handful of us who were the early people

1:31:15.480 --> 1:31:17.480
 raising questions about the origins of this.

1:31:17.480 --> 1:31:20.480
 He was there also talking.

1:31:20.480 --> 1:31:25.480
 So people have heard him speak quite a bit about any viral drugs

1:31:25.480 --> 1:31:26.480
 and all that kind of stuff.

1:31:26.480 --> 1:31:30.480
 But he was also raising concerns about lab leak early on.

1:31:30.480 --> 1:31:31.480
 Yeah, exactly.

1:31:31.480 --> 1:31:35.480
 But I completely agree with you that we don't have to agree

1:31:35.480 --> 1:31:40.480
 with everybody, but it's great to have healthy conversations.

1:31:40.480 --> 1:31:41.480
 That's how we grow.

1:31:41.480 --> 1:31:46.480
 And absolutely, we live in a world where we're kind of,

1:31:46.480 --> 1:31:49.480
 if we're not careful, pushed into these little information

1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:50.480
 pockets.

1:31:50.480 --> 1:31:53.480
 And certainly on social media, I have different parts of my life.

1:31:53.480 --> 1:31:58.480
 One is focusing on issues of COVID origins.

1:31:58.480 --> 1:32:00.480
 And then I have genetics and biotechnology.

1:32:00.480 --> 1:32:02.480
 And then I have, which maybe we'll talk about later,

1:32:02.480 --> 1:32:06.480
 One Shared World, which is about how do we build a safer future.

1:32:06.480 --> 1:32:09.480
 And when I say critical things like the Chinese government,

1:32:09.480 --> 1:32:13.480
 we have to demand a full investigation into pandemic origins.

1:32:13.480 --> 1:32:14.480
 This is an outrage.

1:32:14.480 --> 1:32:16.480
 Then it's really popular.

1:32:16.480 --> 1:32:19.480
 When I say, let's build a better future for everyone in peace

1:32:19.480 --> 1:32:22.480
 and love, it's like, wow, three people liked it.

1:32:22.480 --> 1:32:24.480
 And one was my mother.

1:32:24.480 --> 1:32:27.480
 And so I just feel like we need to build.

1:32:27.480 --> 1:32:32.480
 We used to have that connectivity just built in because we had

1:32:32.480 --> 1:32:35.480
 these town squares and you couldn't get away from them.

1:32:35.480 --> 1:32:37.480
 Now we can get away from them.

1:32:37.480 --> 1:32:41.480
 So engaging with people who have a different background is really

1:32:41.480 --> 1:32:42.480
 essential.

1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:47.480
 I'm on Fox News sometimes three, four times a week.

1:32:47.480 --> 1:32:52.480
 And I wouldn't, in my normal life, I'm not watching that much of

1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:55.480
 Fox News or even television more generally.

1:32:55.480 --> 1:33:00.480
 But I just feel like if I just speak to people who are very similar

1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:03.480
 to me, it'll be comfortable.

1:33:03.480 --> 1:33:05.480
 But what have I contributed?

1:33:05.480 --> 1:33:09.480
 And so I think we really have to have those kinds of conversations

1:33:09.480 --> 1:33:14.480
 and recognize that at the end of the day, most people want to be

1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:15.480
 happy.

1:33:15.480 --> 1:33:17.480
 They want to live in a better world.

1:33:17.480 --> 1:33:19.480
 They maybe have different paths to get there.

1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:23.480
 But if we just break into camps that don't even connect with

1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:28.480
 each other, that's a much more dangerous world.

1:33:28.480 --> 1:33:31.480
 Let's dive back into the difficult pool.

1:33:31.480 --> 1:33:37.480
 Just like you said, in the English speaking world, it seems

1:33:37.480 --> 1:33:44.480
 popular, almost easy to demonize China, the Chinese government,

1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:46.480
 I should say.

1:33:46.480 --> 1:33:50.480
 But even China, like there's this kind of gray area that people

1:33:50.480 --> 1:33:51.480
 just fall into.

1:33:51.480 --> 1:33:54.480
 And I'm really uncomfortable with that.

1:33:54.480 --> 1:33:58.480
 Perhaps because in my mind, in my heart, in my blood, it echoes

1:33:58.480 --> 1:34:03.480
 of the Cold War and that kind of tension.

1:34:03.480 --> 1:34:08.480
 It feels like we almost desire conflict.

1:34:08.480 --> 1:34:11.480
 So we see demons when there is none.

1:34:11.480 --> 1:34:15.480
 So I'm a little cautious to demonize.

1:34:15.480 --> 1:34:17.480
 But at the same time, you have to be honest.

1:34:17.480 --> 1:34:22.480
 So it's like honest with the demons that are there and honest

1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:24.480
 when they're not.

1:34:24.480 --> 1:34:28.480
 This is kind of a geopolitical therapy session, the sorts.

1:34:28.480 --> 1:34:32.480
 So let's keep talking about China a little bit from different

1:34:32.480 --> 1:34:33.480
 angles.

1:34:33.480 --> 1:34:38.480
 So let's return to the director of the Center of Emerging

1:34:38.480 --> 1:34:41.480
 Infectious Disease at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

1:34:41.480 --> 1:34:47.480
 Shijian Li, colloquially referred to as Batwoman.

1:34:47.480 --> 1:34:51.480
 So do you think she's lying?

1:34:51.480 --> 1:34:52.480
 Yes.

1:34:52.480 --> 1:34:54.480
 Do you think she's being forced to lie?

1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:55.480
 Yes.

1:34:55.480 --> 1:34:59.480
 I've known a bunch of virologists in private and public

1:34:59.480 --> 1:35:03.480
 conversation that respect her as a human being, as a scientist.

1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:04.480
 I respect her as a human being.

1:35:04.480 --> 1:35:07.480
 Sorry, as a scientist, not a human being, because I think

1:35:07.480 --> 1:35:08.480
 they don't know the human.

1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:10.480
 They know the scientist and they respect her a lot as a

1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:11.480
 scientist.

1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:12.480
 Yeah, I respect her.

1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:13.480
 I've never met her.

1:35:13.480 --> 1:35:16.480
 We had one exchange, which I'll mention in a second in a

1:35:16.480 --> 1:35:18.480
 virtual forum, but I do respect her.

1:35:18.480 --> 1:35:21.480
 I actually think that she is somebody who has tried to do

1:35:21.480 --> 1:35:22.480
 the right thing.

1:35:22.480 --> 1:35:25.480
 She was one of the heroes of tracking down the origins of

1:35:25.480 --> 1:35:30.480
 SARS 1, and that was a major contribution.

1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:36.480
 But as we talked about earlier, it's a different thing,

1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:40.480
 living, being a scientist, or really kind of anything.

1:35:40.480 --> 1:35:44.480
 It's different being one of those people in an

1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:49.480
 authoritarian society than it is being in a different type

1:35:49.480 --> 1:35:50.480
 of society.

1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:56.480
 And so when Shijing Li said that the reason the WIV

1:35:56.480 --> 1:36:00.480
 database was taken offline in September 19 was because of

1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:03.480
 computer hacks, I don't think that's the story.

1:36:03.480 --> 1:36:07.480
 I don't think she thinks that's the story.

1:36:07.480 --> 1:36:12.480
 When I asked her in March of 2021, March of this year in a

1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:17.480
 Rutgers online forum, when I asked her whether the Chinese

1:36:17.480 --> 1:36:21.480
 military had any engagement with the Wuhan Institute of

1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:25.480
 Virology in any way, and she said absolutely not,

1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:27.480
 paraphrasing, I think she was lying.

1:36:27.480 --> 1:36:31.480
 Do I think that she had the ability to say, well, either

1:36:31.480 --> 1:36:35.480
 one, yes, but I can't talk about it, or I know there are a

1:36:35.480 --> 1:36:38.480
 lot of things that are happening at this institute that I

1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:41.480
 don't know about, and that could be one.

1:36:41.480 --> 1:36:46.480
 Could she have said that the personnel at the Wuhan

1:36:46.480 --> 1:36:49.480
 Institute of Virology have all had to go through

1:36:49.480 --> 1:36:54.480
 classification training so that they can know about what

1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:56.480
 can and can't be said?

1:36:56.480 --> 1:36:59.480
 Like she could have said all those things, but she

1:36:59.480 --> 1:37:01.480
 couldn't say all of those things.

1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:06.480
 And so, and I think that's why so many, at least in my

1:37:06.480 --> 1:37:10.480
 view, so many people in the, certainly in the Western

1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:14.480
 world got this story wrong from the beginning because if

1:37:14.480 --> 1:37:18.480
 your only prism was the science, and you just assumed

1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:22.480
 this is a science question to be left to the scientists,

1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:26.480
 Xu Jingli is just like any scientist working in

1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:30.480
 Switzerland or Norway, the Chinese government isn't

1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:34.480
 interfering in any way, and we can trust them.

1:37:34.480 --> 1:37:36.480
 That would lead you down one path.

1:37:36.480 --> 1:37:40.480
 In my view, the reason why I progressed as I did is I

1:37:40.480 --> 1:37:43.480
 felt like I had two keys, and I had one key as I live in

1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:47.480
 the science world through my work with WHO and my

1:37:47.480 --> 1:37:51.480
 books and things like that, but I also have another

1:37:51.480 --> 1:37:55.480
 part of my life in the world of geopolitics as an

1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:58.480
 Asia, quote unquote, expert and former National

1:37:58.480 --> 1:38:01.480
 Security Council official and other things, and I

1:38:01.480 --> 1:38:05.480
 felt, for me, I needed both keys to open that door.

1:38:05.480 --> 1:38:09.480
 But if I only had the science key, I wouldn't have

1:38:09.480 --> 1:38:12.480
 had the level of doubt and suspicion that I have.

1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:15.480
 But if my starting point was only doubt and suspicion,

1:38:15.480 --> 1:38:18.480
 well, it's coming from China, it must be that the

1:38:18.480 --> 1:38:23.480
 government is guilty, like that wouldn't help either.

1:38:23.480 --> 1:38:28.480
 I wonder what's in her mind, whether it's fear or

1:38:28.480 --> 1:38:33.480
 habit, because I think a lot of people in the former

1:38:33.480 --> 1:38:37.480
 Soviet Union, it's like Chernobyl, it's not really

1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:42.480
 fear, it's almost like a momentum, it's like the

1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:45.480
 reason I showed up to this interview weren't clothes

1:38:45.480 --> 1:38:47.480
 as opposed to being naked.

1:38:47.480 --> 1:38:53.480
 It's like, all right, it's like all of us are doing

1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:55.480
 the clothes thing.

1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:58.480
 Well, there was a startup years ago called Naked

1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:00.480
 News, did you ever hear about that?

1:39:00.480 --> 1:39:02.480
 They just would read the exact news.

1:39:02.480 --> 1:39:03.480
 With naked.

1:39:03.480 --> 1:39:06.480
 No, after each story, they'd take something off until

1:39:06.480 --> 1:39:07.480
 the end.

1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:08.480
 I don't think.

1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:09.480
 It's a good idea for podcasts.

1:39:09.480 --> 1:39:10.480
 They have an IPO.

1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:11.480
 Stay tuned.

1:39:11.480 --> 1:39:13.480
 Next time I'm with Michael Mells.

1:39:13.480 --> 1:39:14.480
 Yeah.

1:39:14.480 --> 1:39:15.480
 Okay.

1:39:15.480 --> 1:39:19.480
 So what do you think, I mean, because the reason I

1:39:19.480 --> 1:39:23.480
 asked that question is how do we kind of take

1:39:23.480 --> 1:39:27.480
 steps to improve without any kind of revolutionary

1:39:27.480 --> 1:39:28.480
 action?

1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:32.480
 You could say we need to inspire the Chinese people

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:38.480
 to elect, to sort of revolutionize the system

1:39:38.480 --> 1:39:43.480
 from within, but like, who are we to suggest that

1:39:43.480 --> 1:39:45.480
 because we have our flaws too.

1:39:45.480 --> 1:39:48.480
 We should be working on our flaws as well.

1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:52.480
 But at the individual scientist level, what are

1:39:52.480 --> 1:39:56.480
 the small acts of rebellion that can be done?

1:39:56.480 --> 1:39:58.480
 How can we improve this?

1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:01.480
 Well, I don't know about small acts of rebellion,

1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:05.480
 but I'll try to answer your question from a few

1:40:05.480 --> 1:40:07.480
 different perspectives.

1:40:07.480 --> 1:40:11.480
 So right now, actually, as we speak, there is a

1:40:11.480 --> 1:40:14.480
 special session of the World Health Assembly going

1:40:14.480 --> 1:40:15.480
 on.

1:40:15.480 --> 1:40:17.480
 The World Health Assembly is the governing authority

1:40:17.480 --> 1:40:19.480
 over the World Health Organization where it's

1:40:19.480 --> 1:40:23.480
 represented by states and territories, 194 of them

1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:27.480
 tragically not including Taiwan because of the

1:40:27.480 --> 1:40:29.480
 Chinese government's assistance.

1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:32.480
 They're now beginning a process of trying to

1:40:32.480 --> 1:40:36.480
 negotiate a global pandemic treaty to try to have a

1:40:36.480 --> 1:40:39.480
 better process for responding to crises exactly

1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:41.480
 like we're in.

1:40:41.480 --> 1:40:45.480
 But unfortunately, for the exact same reasons that

1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:48.480
 we have failed, I mean, we had a similar process

1:40:48.480 --> 1:40:49.480
 after the first SARS.

1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:51.480
 We set up what we thought was the best available

1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:54.480
 system, and it has totally failed here.

1:40:54.480 --> 1:40:59.480
 And it's failed here because of the inherent

1:40:59.480 --> 1:41:02.480
 pathologies of the Chinese government system.

1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:06.480
 We are suffering from a pandemic that exists

1:41:06.480 --> 1:41:09.480
 because of the internal pathologies of the

1:41:09.480 --> 1:41:11.480
 Chinese state.

1:41:11.480 --> 1:41:14.480
 And that's why on one hand, I totally get this

1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:15.480
 impulse.

1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:16.480
 Well, we do it our way.

1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:17.480
 They do it their way.

1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:20.480
 Who's to say that one way is better?

1:41:20.480 --> 1:41:23.480
 And certainly right now in the United States,

1:41:23.480 --> 1:41:25.480
 we're at each other's throats.

1:41:25.480 --> 1:41:27.480
 We have a hard time getting anything meaningful

1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:28.480
 done.

1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:31.480
 And I'm sure there are people who are saying,

1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:33.480
 well, that model looks appealing.

1:41:33.480 --> 1:41:36.480
 But just as people could look to the United

1:41:36.480 --> 1:41:38.480
 States and say, well, because the United States

1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:41.480
 has such a massive reach, what we do domestically

1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:44.480
 has huge implications for the rest of the world,

1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:47.480
 they become stakeholders in our politics.

1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:49.480
 And that's why I think for a lot of years,

1:41:49.480 --> 1:41:51.480
 people have just been looking at U.S.

1:41:51.480 --> 1:41:53.480
 politics not because it's interesting, but because

1:41:53.480 --> 1:41:56.480
 the decisions that we make have big implications

1:41:56.480 --> 1:41:57.480
 for their lives.

1:41:57.480 --> 1:41:59.480
 The same is true for ours.

1:41:59.480 --> 1:42:03.480
 You could say that the lack of civil and political

1:42:03.480 --> 1:42:06.480
 rights in China is the...

1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:09.480
 It's up to the Chinese, not even people, because

1:42:09.480 --> 1:42:12.480
 they have no say, but to their government.

1:42:12.480 --> 1:42:14.480
 And they weren't democratically elected, that

1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:17.480
 they are recognized as the government.

1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:22.480
 But some significant percentage of the 15

1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:25.480
 million people now dead from COVID are dead

1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:29.480
 because in the earliest days following the outbreak,

1:42:29.480 --> 1:42:32.480
 whatever the origin, the voices of people

1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:35.480
 sounding the alarm were suppressed.

1:42:35.480 --> 1:42:37.480
 That the Chinese government had an...

1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:39.480
 Just like in Chernobyl, the Chinese government

1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:42.480
 had a greater incentive to lie to the

1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:46.480
 international community than to tell the truth.

1:42:46.480 --> 1:42:49.480
 And everybody was incentivized to pretty

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:51.480
 much do the wrong thing.

1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:54.480
 And so that's why I think one of the big messages

1:42:54.480 --> 1:42:57.480
 of this pandemic is that all of our fates are

1:42:57.480 --> 1:42:59.480
 tied to everybody else's fates.

1:42:59.480 --> 1:43:02.480
 And so while we can say and should say,

1:43:02.480 --> 1:43:04.480
 well, let's focus on our own communities

1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:07.480
 and our countries, we're all stakeholders

1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:09.480
 in what happens elsewhere.

1:43:09.480 --> 1:43:14.480
 Gasko, a weird question.

1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:19.480
 So I'm going to do a few podcast interviews

1:43:19.480 --> 1:43:23.480
 with interesting people in Russia, in the

1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:26.480
 Russian language, because I could speak Russian.

1:43:26.480 --> 1:43:30.480
 And a lot of those people have, you know,

1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:35.480
 are not usually speaking in these kinds of formats.

1:43:35.480 --> 1:43:38.480
 Do you think it's possible to interview

1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:40.480
 Xi Jinping?

1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:42.480
 Do you think it's possible to interview

1:43:42.480 --> 1:43:47.480
 like her or anyone in the Chinese government?

1:43:47.480 --> 1:43:49.480
 I think not.

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:53.480
 And I think the reason is because I think

1:43:53.480 --> 1:43:56.480
 they would, one, be uncomfortable being in any

1:43:56.480 --> 1:44:00.480
 environment where really unknown questions

1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:02.480
 will be asked.

1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:05.480
 And actually, so as you know, on this topic,

1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:07.480
 the Chinese, as I mentioned earlier,

1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:09.480
 the Chinese government has a gag order

1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:11.480
 on Chinese scientists.

1:44:11.480 --> 1:44:13.480
 And I think that's the reason why

1:44:13.480 --> 1:44:15.480
 I'm talking about prior government approval.

1:44:15.480 --> 1:44:17.480
 Xuejing Li has been able to speak.

1:44:17.480 --> 1:44:19.480
 And she's spoken at a number of forums.

1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:21.480
 I mentioned this Rutgers event.

1:44:21.480 --> 1:44:23.480
 What was the nature of that forum?

1:44:23.480 --> 1:44:26.480
 It was all of them were kind of science

1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:31.480
 conversations about the pandemic, including

1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:33.480
 the origins issue.

1:44:33.480 --> 1:44:36.480
 But I think that she, in her response to my question,

1:44:36.480 --> 1:44:38.480
 it was kind of this funny thing.

1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:42.480
 So they had this event for organized by Rutgers.

1:44:42.480 --> 1:44:45.480
 And I went on, it was an online event on Zoom.

1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:47.480
 But I got on there and I just realized

1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:49.480
 it was very poorly organized.

1:44:49.480 --> 1:44:51.480
 Like normally the controls that you would have

1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:54.480
 about who gets to chat to who, who gets to ask questions,

1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:56.480
 none of them were set.

1:44:56.480 --> 1:44:58.480
 And so I kind of couldn't believe it.

1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:01.480
 I was just sitting at home in my neon green fleece.

1:45:01.480 --> 1:45:06.480
 And I just started sending chat messages to Xuejing Li.

1:45:06.480 --> 1:45:08.480
 Anybody could.

1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:09.480
 It was insane.

1:45:09.480 --> 1:45:11.480
 And so I, but I thought, wow, this is incredible.

1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:15.480
 And so then it was unclear who got to ask questions.

1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:17.480
 And so I was like posting questions.

1:45:17.480 --> 1:45:20.480
 And then I was sending chats to the organizers of the event

1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:23.480
 saying, I really have a question.

1:45:23.480 --> 1:45:26.480
 And first they said, well, you can submit your questions

1:45:26.480 --> 1:45:28.480
 and we'll have submitted questions.

1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:30.480
 And then if we have time, we'll open up.

1:45:30.480 --> 1:45:32.480
 So I just, I mean, I just thought, well, what the hell?

1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:34.480
 I just sent messages to everybody.

1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:36.480
 And then the event was already done.

1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:38.480
 They were 15 minutes over time.

1:45:38.480 --> 1:45:41.480
 And then they said, all right, we have time just for one question.

1:45:41.480 --> 1:45:44.480
 And it's Jamie Metzel.

1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:46.480
 And like I said, I'm sitting there in my running clothes.

1:45:46.480 --> 1:45:49.480
 Like I wasn't, I was like multitasking and I heard my name.

1:45:49.480 --> 1:45:55.480
 And so I went diving back and I asked this question about,

1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:59.480
 did you know all of the work that was happening

1:45:59.480 --> 1:46:02.480
 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:05.480
 not just your work?

1:46:05.480 --> 1:46:10.480
 And can you confirm that U.S. intelligence has said

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:13.480
 that the military played a role.

1:46:13.480 --> 1:46:16.480
 It was engaged with the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:19.480
 Do you deny that the Chinese military was involved in any way

1:46:19.480 --> 1:46:21.480
 with the Wuhan Institute of Virology?

1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:24.480
 And as I said before, she said, this is crazy.

1:46:24.480 --> 1:46:26.480
 Absolutely not.

1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:28.480
 It actually got, that one question got covered in the media

1:46:28.480 --> 1:46:31.480
 because it was like, I think an essential question.

1:46:31.480 --> 1:46:34.480
 But I just think that since then, to my knowledge,

1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:37.480
 she's not been in any public forums.

1:46:37.480 --> 1:46:41.480
 But that's why most people would be shocked that to date,

1:46:41.480 --> 1:46:44.480
 there has been no comprehensive international investigation

1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:46.480
 into pandemic origins.

1:46:46.480 --> 1:46:48.480
 There is no whistleblower provision.

1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:52.480
 So if you're, my guess is there are at least tens,

1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:56.480
 maybe hundreds of people in China who have relevant information

1:46:56.480 --> 1:46:59.480
 about the origins of the pandemic who are terrified

1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:01.480
 and don't dare share it.

1:47:01.480 --> 1:47:05.480
 And let's just say somebody wanted to get that information out,

1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:08.480
 to send it somewhere.

1:47:08.480 --> 1:47:10.480
 There's no official address.

1:47:10.480 --> 1:47:12.480
 The WHO doesn't have that.

1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:13.480
 Nobody has that.

1:47:13.480 --> 1:47:16.480
 And so I would love, you may as well ask.

1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:20.480
 I don't think it's likely that there'll be a yes.

1:47:20.480 --> 1:47:23.480
 But it could well be that there are defectors

1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:25.480
 who will want to speak.

1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:29.480
 So let me also push back on this idea.

1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:33.480
 So one, I want to ask if the language barrier is a thing.

1:47:33.480 --> 1:47:37.480
 Because I've talked to, so I understand Russian culture,

1:47:37.480 --> 1:47:42.480
 I think, or not understand, this is this.

1:47:42.480 --> 1:47:45.480
 I don't understand basically anything in this world.

1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:50.480
 But I mean, I hear the music that is Russian culture

1:47:50.480 --> 1:47:51.480
 and I enjoy it.

1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:55.480
 I don't hear that music for Chinese culture.

1:47:55.480 --> 1:47:57.480
 It's just not something I've experienced.

1:47:57.480 --> 1:47:59.480
 So it's a beautiful, rich, complex culture.

1:47:59.480 --> 1:48:05.480
 And from my sense, it seems distant to me.

1:48:05.480 --> 1:48:10.480
 Like whenever I look, even like we mentioned offline Japan

1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:14.480
 and so on, I probably don't even understand Japanese culture.

1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:17.480
 I believe I kind of do because I did martial arts my whole life.

1:48:17.480 --> 1:48:20.480
 But even that, it's just so distant.

1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:23.480
 If you've lived in Japan foreigners for like 20 years,

1:48:23.480 --> 1:48:25.480
 say the exact same thing.

1:48:25.480 --> 1:48:26.480
 It makes me sad.

1:48:26.480 --> 1:48:30.480
 It makes me sad because I will never be able to fully appreciate

1:48:30.480 --> 1:48:35.480
 the literature, the conversations, the people,

1:48:35.480 --> 1:48:38.480
 the little humor and the subtleties.

1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:40.480
 And those are all essential to understand

1:48:40.480 --> 1:48:43.480
 even this cold topics of science.

1:48:43.480 --> 1:48:46.480
 Because all of that is important to understand.

1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:49.480
 So that's a question for me if you think language barrier is a thing.

1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:54.480
 But the other thing I just want to kind of comment on is

1:48:54.480 --> 1:49:00.480
 the criticism of journalism that somebody like

1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:05.480
 Xi Jinping or even Xi Jinping, just anybody in China,

1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:08.480
 it's very skeptical to have really conversations

1:49:08.480 --> 1:49:11.480
 with anybody in the Western media.

1:49:11.480 --> 1:49:16.480
 Because it's like what are the odds that they will try

1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:19.480
 to bring out the beautiful ideas in the person.

1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:23.480
 And honestly, just this is a harsh criticism.

1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:26.480
 I apologize, but I kind of mean it.

1:49:26.480 --> 1:49:33.480
 Is the journalists that have some of these high profile conversations

1:49:33.480 --> 1:49:36.480
 often don't do the work.

1:49:36.480 --> 1:49:39.480
 They come off as not very intelligent.

1:49:39.480 --> 1:49:41.480
 And I know they're intelligent people.

1:49:41.480 --> 1:49:43.480
 They have not done the research.

1:49:43.480 --> 1:49:46.480
 They have not come up and read a bunch of books.

1:49:46.480 --> 1:49:48.480
 They have not even read the Wikipedia article.

1:49:48.480 --> 1:49:52.480
 Meaning put in the minimal effort to empathize,

1:49:52.480 --> 1:49:54.480
 to try to understand the culture of the people,

1:49:54.480 --> 1:49:58.480
 all the complexities, all the different ideas in the spaces.

1:49:58.480 --> 1:50:00.480
 Do all the incredible, not all,

1:50:00.480 --> 1:50:03.480
 but some of the incredible work that you've done initially.

1:50:03.480 --> 1:50:07.480
 Like that, you have to do that work to earn the right

1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:11.480
 to have a deep real conversation with some of these folks.

1:50:11.480 --> 1:50:15.480
 It's just disappointing to me that journalists often don't do that work.

1:50:15.480 --> 1:50:19.480
 So on that, just first, I completely agree with you.

1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:23.480
 I mean, there is just an incredible beauty in Chinese culture.

1:50:23.480 --> 1:50:27.480
 And I think all cultures, but certainly China has such a deep

1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:31.480
 and rich history, amazing literature and art,

1:50:31.480 --> 1:50:34.480
 and just human beings.

1:50:34.480 --> 1:50:37.480
 I mean, I'm a massive critic of the Chinese government.

1:50:37.480 --> 1:50:42.480
 I'm very vociferous about the really genocide in Xinjiang,

1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:46.480
 the absolute effort to destroy Tibetan culture,

1:50:46.480 --> 1:50:50.480
 the destruction of democracy in Hong Kong,

1:50:50.480 --> 1:50:54.480
 incredibly illegal efforts to seize basically

1:50:54.480 --> 1:50:56.480
 the entire South China Sea.

1:50:56.480 --> 1:50:59.480
 And I could go on and on and on.

1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:02.480
 But Chinese culture is fantastic.

1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:05.480
 And I can't speak to every technical field,

1:51:05.480 --> 1:51:08.480
 but just in terms of having journalists,

1:51:08.480 --> 1:51:10.480
 and I'll speak to American journalists,

1:51:10.480 --> 1:51:14.480
 people like Peter Hessler, who have really invested the time

1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:18.480
 to live in China, to learn the language, learn the culture.

1:51:18.480 --> 1:51:22.480
 Peter himself, who is maybe one of our best journalists

1:51:22.480 --> 1:51:25.480
 covering China from a soul level,

1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:27.480
 he was kicked out of China.

1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:30.480
 So it's very, very difficult.

1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:32.480
 Yeah, it's really...

1:51:32.480 --> 1:51:36.480
 I mean, you talked about my website on Pandemic Origins.

1:51:36.480 --> 1:51:38.480
 So when I launched it, I had it...

1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:40.480
 I'm not a Chinese speaker,

1:51:40.480 --> 1:51:43.480
 but I had the entire site translated into Chinese,

1:51:43.480 --> 1:51:47.480
 and I have it up on my website just because I felt like,

1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:51.480
 well, if somebody, I mean, the Great Firewall

1:51:51.480 --> 1:51:53.480
 makes it very, very difficult for people in China

1:51:53.480 --> 1:51:56.480
 to access that kind of information.

1:51:56.480 --> 1:51:58.480
 But I figured if somebody gets there

1:51:58.480 --> 1:52:01.480
 and they want to have it in their own language,

1:52:01.480 --> 1:52:05.480
 but it's hard because the Chinese government is represented

1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:08.480
 by these, quote, unquote, wolf warriors,

1:52:08.480 --> 1:52:11.480
 which is like these basic ruffians,

1:52:11.480 --> 1:52:14.480
 and I personally was condemned by name

1:52:14.480 --> 1:52:17.480
 by the spokesman of the Chinese Foreign Ministry

1:52:17.480 --> 1:52:20.480
 from the podium in Beijing.

1:52:20.480 --> 1:52:24.480
 And so it's really hard because I absolutely think

1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:27.480
 the American people and the Chinese people,

1:52:27.480 --> 1:52:30.480
 I mean, maybe all people, but we have so much in common.

1:52:30.480 --> 1:52:35.480
 I mean, yes, China is an ancient civilization,

1:52:35.480 --> 1:52:38.480
 but they kind of wiped out their own civilization

1:52:38.480 --> 1:52:40.480
 in the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution.

1:52:40.480 --> 1:52:42.480
 They burned their scrolls.

1:52:42.480 --> 1:52:44.480
 They smashed their artworks.

1:52:44.480 --> 1:52:48.480
 And so it's a very young society, kind of like America

1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:50.480
 is a young society.

1:52:50.480 --> 1:52:53.480
 So we have a lot in common.

1:52:53.480 --> 1:52:56.480
 And if we just kind of got out of our own ways,

1:52:56.480 --> 1:52:59.480
 we could have a beautiful relationship.

1:52:59.480 --> 1:53:01.480
 But there's a lot of things that are happening.

1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:03.480
 Certainly the United States feels responsible

1:53:03.480 --> 1:53:06.480
 to defend the postwar international order

1:53:06.480 --> 1:53:09.480
 that past generations helped build,

1:53:09.480 --> 1:53:11.480
 and I'm a certain believer in that,

1:53:11.480 --> 1:53:14.480
 and China is challenging that.

1:53:14.480 --> 1:53:16.480
 And the Chinese government,

1:53:16.480 --> 1:53:19.480
 and they've shared that view with the Chinese people,

1:53:19.480 --> 1:53:21.480
 feel that they haven't been adequately respected,

1:53:21.480 --> 1:53:25.480
 and now they're building a massive nuclear arsenal

1:53:25.480 --> 1:53:28.480
 and all these other things to try to position themselves

1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:30.480
 in the world with an articulated goal

1:53:30.480 --> 1:53:32.480
 of being the lead country in the world.

1:53:32.480 --> 1:53:34.480
 And that puts them at odds with the United States.

1:53:34.480 --> 1:53:36.480
 So there are a lot of real reasons

1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:39.480
 that we need to be honest about for division.

1:53:39.480 --> 1:53:41.480
 But if that's all we focus on,

1:53:41.480 --> 1:53:45.480
 if we don't say that there's another side of the story

1:53:45.480 --> 1:53:47.480
 that brings us together,

1:53:47.480 --> 1:53:50.480
 we'll put ourselves on an inevitable glide path

1:53:50.480 --> 1:53:52.480
 to a terrible outcome.

1:53:52.480 --> 1:53:55.480
 What do you make of Xi Jinping?

1:53:55.480 --> 1:53:57.480
 So two questions.

1:53:57.480 --> 1:54:00.480
 So one in general, and two more on Lableak

1:54:00.480 --> 1:54:04.480
 and his meeting with our President Biden

1:54:04.480 --> 1:54:07.480
 in discussion of Lableak.

1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:13.480
 So I feel that Xi Jinping has a very narrow goal

1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:17.480
 of articulated, of establishing China

1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:19.480
 as the lead country in the world

1:54:19.480 --> 1:54:22.480
 by the 100th anniversary of the founding

1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:25.480
 of the modern Chinese state.

1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:28.480
 And it's ruthless and it's strategic.

1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:31.480
 There's a great book called The Long Game

1:54:31.480 --> 1:54:35.480
 by Rush Doshi, who's actually now working in the White House

1:54:35.480 --> 1:54:40.480
 about this goal and a pretty clearly articulated goal

1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:44.480
 to subvert the postwar international order

1:54:44.480 --> 1:54:46.480
 and in China's interest.

1:54:46.480 --> 1:54:49.480
 And maybe every leader wants to organize the world

1:54:49.480 --> 1:54:52.480
 around their interests, but I feel that his vision

1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:57.480
 of what that entails is not one that I think

1:54:57.480 --> 1:54:59.480
 is shareable for the rest of the world.

1:54:59.480 --> 1:55:01.480
 I mean, the strength of the United States

1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:06.480
 with all of our flaws is particularly in that postwar period.

1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:10.480
 We put forward a model that was desirable to a lot of people.

1:55:10.480 --> 1:55:13.480
 Certainly it was desirable to people in Western Europe

1:55:13.480 --> 1:55:17.480
 and then Eastern Europe and Japan and Korea.

1:55:17.480 --> 1:55:18.480
 It doesn't mean it's perfect.

1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:21.480
 The United States is deeply flawed.

1:55:21.480 --> 1:55:25.480
 As articulated to date, I don't think most people

1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:29.480
 and countries would like to live in a sinocentric world.

1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:32.480
 And so I certainly, as I mentioned before,

1:55:32.480 --> 1:55:34.480
 I'm a huge critic of what Xi Jinping is doing,

1:55:34.480 --> 1:55:39.480
 the incredible brutality in Xinjiang, in Tibet,

1:55:39.480 --> 1:55:42.480
 and elsewhere.

1:55:42.480 --> 1:55:47.480
 Yeah, the censorship one, it gives me a lot of trouble.

1:55:47.480 --> 1:55:52.480
 On the science realm and just in journalism and just the world,

1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:55.480
 it prevents us from having conversations with each other.

1:55:55.480 --> 1:55:58.480
 Do you know about the Winnie the Pooh thing?

1:55:58.480 --> 1:56:00.480
 Yes. I mean, it's ridiculous.

1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:07.480
 So to me, that's such a good illustration of censorship being petty.

1:56:07.480 --> 1:56:09.480
 Well, censorship has to be petty

1:56:09.480 --> 1:56:11.480
 because the goal of censorship,

1:56:11.480 --> 1:56:14.480
 maybe you experienced in the Soviet Union,

1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:16.480
 is to get into your head.

1:56:16.480 --> 1:56:20.480
 Like if it's just censorship, like you say down with the state

1:56:20.480 --> 1:56:22.480
 and you can't say that.

1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:26.480
 But you can say all the other things up to that point.

1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:29.480
 Eventually, people will feel empowered to say down with the state.

1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:33.480
 And so I think the goal of this kind of authoritarian censorship

1:56:33.480 --> 1:56:36.480
 is to turn you into the censor.

1:56:36.480 --> 1:56:38.480
 And so the...

1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:39.480
 Like self censorship.

1:56:39.480 --> 1:56:41.480
 Because they almost have to have you think,

1:56:41.480 --> 1:56:44.480
 well, if I'm going to make any criticism,

1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:46.480
 maybe they're going to come and get me.

1:56:46.480 --> 1:56:48.480
 So it's safer to not do.

1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:51.480
 I mean, I've traveled through North Korea pretty extensively

1:56:51.480 --> 1:56:53.480
 and I've seen that in its ultimate form.

1:56:53.480 --> 1:56:56.480
 But that's what they're trying to do in China too.

1:56:56.480 --> 1:56:57.480
 Yeah.

1:56:57.480 --> 1:56:59.480
 So for people who are not familiar,

1:56:59.480 --> 1:57:03.480
 it's such a clear illustration of just the pettiness of censorship

1:57:03.480 --> 1:57:06.480
 and leaders, the corrupting nature of power.

1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:13.480
 But there's a meme of Xi Jinping with, I guess, Barack Obama

1:57:13.480 --> 1:57:20.480
 and the meme is that he looks like Winnie the Pooh in that picture.

1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:23.480
 And that was...

1:57:23.480 --> 1:57:26.480
 The presidential Xi Jinping looks like Winnie the Pooh.

1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:28.480
 And I guess that became...

1:57:28.480 --> 1:57:30.480
 Because that got censored.

1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:33.480
 Like, mentions of Winnie the Pooh got censored all across China.

1:57:33.480 --> 1:57:38.480
 Winnie the Pooh became the unknowing revolutionary hero

1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:41.480
 that represents freedom of speech and so on.

1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:44.480
 But it's just such an absurd thing.

1:57:44.480 --> 1:57:47.480
 Because we spend all so much time in this conversation

1:57:47.480 --> 1:57:49.480
 to talk about the censorship

1:57:49.480 --> 1:57:52.480
 that's a little bit more understandable to me.

1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:55.480
 Which is like, we messed up.

1:57:55.480 --> 1:57:57.480
 And it wasn't...

1:57:57.480 --> 1:58:02.480
 Maybe it's almost understandable errors that happen in the progress of science.

1:58:02.480 --> 1:58:09.480
 I mean, you can always argue that there's a lot of mistakes along the way

1:58:09.480 --> 1:58:12.480
 and censorship along the way caused the big mistake.

1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:14.480
 You can argue that same way for the Chernobyl.

1:58:14.480 --> 1:58:18.480
 But those are sort of understandable and difficult topics.

1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:20.480
 Like, Winnie the Pooh.

1:58:20.480 --> 1:58:22.480
 But in your message, it shows both sides of the story.

1:58:22.480 --> 1:58:26.480
 I mean, one, how petty authoritarian censors have to be.

1:58:26.480 --> 1:58:30.480
 And that's why the messaging from the Chinese government is so consistent.

1:58:30.480 --> 1:58:34.480
 No matter who you are, you have to be careful what you say.

1:58:34.480 --> 1:58:39.480
 It's the story of Peng Shui, the tennis player.

1:58:39.480 --> 1:58:42.480
 She dared raise her voice in an individual way.

1:58:42.480 --> 1:58:49.480
 Jack Ma, the richest man in China, had a minor criticism of the Chinese government.

1:58:49.480 --> 1:58:54.480
 He had basically disappeared from the public eye.

1:58:54.480 --> 1:58:58.480
 Fan Bingbing, who's like one of the leading Chinese movie stars,

1:58:58.480 --> 1:59:03.480
 she was seen as not loyal enough and she just vanished.

1:59:03.480 --> 1:59:07.480
 So the message is, no matter who you are, no matter what level,

1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:12.480
 if you don't mind everything you say, you could lose everything.

1:59:12.480 --> 1:59:15.480
 I'm pretty hopeful, optimistic about a lot of things.

1:59:15.480 --> 1:59:21.480
 And so for me, if the Chinese government stays with its current structure,

1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:26.480
 I think what I hope they start fixing is the freedom of speech.

1:59:26.480 --> 1:59:27.480
 But they can't.

1:59:27.480 --> 1:59:32.480
 I mean, the thing is, if they open up freedom of speech,

1:59:32.480 --> 1:59:38.480
 really in a meaningful way, they can't maintain their current form of government.

1:59:38.480 --> 1:59:42.480
 And it's connected, as I was saying before, to the origins of the pandemic.

1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:48.480
 I mean, if my hypothesis was right, that was the big choice that the national government had.

1:59:48.480 --> 1:59:51.480
 Do we really investigate the origins of the pandemic?

1:59:51.480 --> 1:59:55.480
 Do we deliver a message that transparency is required,

1:59:55.480 --> 1:59:58.480
 public transparency is required from local officials?

1:59:58.480 --> 2:00:06.480
 If they do that, the entire system collapse, pretty much everybody in China has a relative

2:00:06.480 --> 2:00:10.480
 who has died as a result of the actions of the Communist Party,

2:00:10.480 --> 2:00:12.480
 particularly in the Great Leap Forward.

2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:18.480
 It's nearly 50 million people died as a result of Mao's disastrous policies.

2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:23.480
 And yet, why is Mao's picture still on Tiananmen Square and it's on the money?

2:00:23.480 --> 2:00:29.480
 Because maintaining that fiction is the foundation of the legitimacy of the Chinese state.

2:00:29.480 --> 2:00:32.480
 If people were allowed, just say what you want.

2:00:32.480 --> 2:00:39.480
 Do you really think Mao was such a great guy, even though your own relatives are dead as a result?

2:00:39.480 --> 2:00:45.480
 Do you really buy, even on this story that China did nothing wrong,

2:00:45.480 --> 2:00:48.480
 even though in the earliest days of the pandemic,

2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:54.480
 at least two, at least Chinese scientists themselves courageously issued a preprint paper

2:00:54.480 --> 2:00:58.480
 that was later almost certainly forcibly retracted,

2:00:58.480 --> 2:01:03.480
 saying, well, this looks like this comes from one of the Wuhan labs that we're studying.

2:01:03.480 --> 2:01:11.480
 If you opened up that window, I think that the Chinese government would not be able to continue

2:01:11.480 --> 2:01:14.480
 in its current form, then that's why they cracked down at Tiananmen Square.

2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:17.480
 That's why with Feng Shui, the tennis player,

2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:24.480
 if they had let her accuse somebody from the Communist Party of sexual assault,

2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:30.480
 and they said, okay, now people, you can use social media and you can have your Me Too moment

2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:37.480
 and let us know who in the Chinese Communist Party or your boss in a business has assaulted you.

2:01:37.480 --> 2:01:45.480
 Just like in every society, I'm sure there's tons of women who've been sexually assaulted, manipulated, abused by men.

2:01:45.480 --> 2:01:50.480
 I certainly hope that there can be that kind of opening,

2:01:50.480 --> 2:01:56.480
 but if I were an authoritarian dictator, that's the thing I would be most afraid of.

2:01:56.480 --> 2:02:01.480
 Yeah, a dictator perhaps, but I think you can gradually increase the freedom of speech.

2:02:01.480 --> 2:02:06.480
 I think you can maintain control over the freedom of press first.

2:02:06.480 --> 2:02:13.480
 Control the press more, but let the lower levels open up YouTube.

2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:17.480
 Open up where individual citizens can make content.

2:02:17.480 --> 2:02:19.480
 There's a lot of benefits to that.

2:02:19.480 --> 2:02:25.480
 From an authoritarian perspective, you can just say that's misinformation,

2:02:25.480 --> 2:02:28.480
 that's conspiracy theories, all those kinds of things,

2:02:28.480 --> 2:02:35.480
 but at least I think if you open up that freedom of speech at the level of the individual citizen,

2:02:35.480 --> 2:02:41.480
 that's good for entrepreneurship, for the development of ideas, of exchange of ideas, all that kind of stuff.

2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:44.480
 I just think that increased the GDP of the country.

2:02:44.480 --> 2:02:46.480
 There's a lot of benefits.

2:02:46.480 --> 2:02:50.480
 I feel like you can still play some dark thoughts here,

2:02:50.480 --> 2:03:00.480
 but I feel like you can still play the game of thrones, still maintain power while giving freedom to the citizenry.

2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:10.480
 I think just like with North Korea is a good example of where cracking down too much can completely destroy your country.

2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:17.480
 There's some balance you can strike in your evil mind and still maintain authoritarian control over the country.

2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:24.480
 Obviously, it's not obvious, but I'm a big supporter of freedom of speech.

2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:26.480
 It seems to work really well.

2:03:26.480 --> 2:03:29.480
 I don't know what the failure cases for freedom of speech are.

2:03:29.480 --> 2:03:38.480
 Probably we're experiencing them with Twitter and where the nature of truth is being completely flipped upside down,

2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:48.480
 but it seems like on the whole, the ability to defeat lies with more, not through censorship,

2:03:48.480 --> 2:03:52.480
 but through more conversations, more information is the right way to go.

2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:53.480
 Can I tell you a little story?

2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:55.480
 Two stories about North Korea.

2:03:55.480 --> 2:04:04.480
 A number of years ago, I was invited to be part of a small six person delegation advising the government of North Korea

2:04:04.480 --> 2:04:13.480
 on how to establish special economic zones, because other countries have used these SEZs as a way of building their economies.

2:04:13.480 --> 2:04:20.480
 When I was invited, I thought, well, maybe there's an opening, and I certainly believe in that.

2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:30.480
 We flew to China, crossed the border into North Korea, and then we were met by our partners from the North Korean Development Organization.

2:04:30.480 --> 2:04:39.480
 We zigzagged the country for almost two weeks visiting all these sites where they were intended to create these special economic zones.

2:04:39.480 --> 2:04:46.480
 And in each site, they had their local officials, and they had a map, and they showed us where everything that was going to be built.

2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:51.480
 And the other people who were really technical experts on how to set up a special economic zone,

2:04:51.480 --> 2:04:57.480
 they were asking questions, well, should you put the entrance over here, or shouldn't you put it over there, and what if there's flooding?

2:04:57.480 --> 2:05:02.480
 And I kept asking just these basic questions, like, what do you think you're going to do here?

2:05:02.480 --> 2:05:07.480
 Why do you think you can be competitive? Do you know anything about who you're competing against?

2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:11.480
 Are you empowering your workers to innovate because everybody else is innovating?

2:05:11.480 --> 2:05:15.480
 So at the end of the trip, they flew us to Pyongyang, and they put us in this...

2:05:15.480 --> 2:05:22.480
 It looked kind of like the United Nations. They probably had 500 people there, and I gave a speech to them.

2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:29.480
 I obviously was in English, and it was translated. And I figured, you know, I've come all this way.

2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:34.480
 I'm just going to be honest. If they arrest me for being honest, that's on them.

2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:41.480
 And I said, I'm here because I believe we can never give up hope that we always have to try to connect.

2:05:41.480 --> 2:05:49.480
 I'm also here because I think that North Korea connecting to the world economy is an important first step.

2:05:49.480 --> 2:05:55.480
 But having visited all of your special economic zone sites and having met with all of your or many of your officials,

2:05:55.480 --> 2:06:03.480
 I don't think your plan has any chance of succeeding because you're trying to sell into a global market.

2:06:03.480 --> 2:06:14.480
 But you need to have market information. And I gave examples of GE and others that the innovation can't only happen at one place.

2:06:14.480 --> 2:06:20.480
 And if you want innovation to happen from the people who are doing this, you have to empower them.

2:06:20.480 --> 2:06:23.480
 They have to have access. They have to have voice.

2:06:23.480 --> 2:06:32.480
 I mean, nobody... I mean, people after they kind of had to condemn me because what I was saying was challenging.

2:06:32.480 --> 2:06:37.480
 So I certainly agree with you. And then just one side story of them that night.

2:06:37.480 --> 2:06:43.480
 And it was just kind of bizarre because North Korea is so desperately poor, but they were trying to impress us.

2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:48.480
 And so we had these embarrassingly sumptuous banquets.

2:06:48.480 --> 2:06:54.480
 And so for our final dinner that night, it really looked like something from Beauty and the Beast.

2:06:54.480 --> 2:07:01.480
 I mean, it was like China and waiters and tuxedos, and they had this beautiful dinner.

2:07:01.480 --> 2:07:06.480
 And then afterwards, because we'd now spent two weeks with our North Korean partners,

2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:14.480
 they brought out this karaoke machine and our North Korean counterparts, they sang songs to us in Korean.

2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:20.480
 And so I said, well, we want to reciprocate. Do you have any English songs on your karaoke machine?

2:07:20.480 --> 2:07:22.480
 It's North Korea, obviously they didn't.

2:07:22.480 --> 2:07:24.480
 But there was... And I said, well, I have an idea.

2:07:24.480 --> 2:07:29.480
 And so there was one of the women who'd been part of the North Korean delegation.

2:07:29.480 --> 2:07:35.480
 She was able just to play the piano, just like you could hum a tune and she could play it on the piano.

2:07:35.480 --> 2:07:40.480
 And so I said, all right, here's this tune, which I whispered in her ear.

2:07:40.480 --> 2:07:45.480
 When I give you the signal, just play this tune over and over.

2:07:45.480 --> 2:07:49.480
 And so I got these... I mean, there were the six of us and maybe 20 North Koreans.

2:07:49.480 --> 2:07:52.480
 And we are all in this circle, Sarah. Everybody hold hands.

2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:57.480
 And then put your right... Just try to put your right foot in front of your left,

2:07:57.480 --> 2:08:00.480
 and then left foot in front of the right, going sideways.

2:08:00.480 --> 2:08:06.480
 And I said, all right, hit it. And she played a North Korean version of Havana Gila.

2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:11.480
 And I think it was the first and only horror that they've ever done in North Korea.

2:08:11.480 --> 2:08:12.480
 That's hilarious.

2:08:12.480 --> 2:08:13.480
 I survived.

2:08:13.480 --> 2:08:14.480
 Was this recorded or not?

2:08:14.480 --> 2:08:15.480
 It was not.

2:08:15.480 --> 2:08:16.480
 Oh, no.

2:08:16.480 --> 2:08:19.480
 Yeah. If they had free YouTube, this would have been a big one.

2:08:21.480 --> 2:08:24.480
 Let's return to the beginning and just...

2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:33.480
 Patient zero. It's kind of always incredible to think that there's one human at which it all started.

2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:37.480
 Who do you think was patient zero?

2:08:37.480 --> 2:08:46.480
 Do you think it was somebody that worked at Wuhan Institute of Virology?

2:08:46.480 --> 2:08:54.480
 Do you think it was... There was a leak of some other kind that led to the infection?

2:08:54.480 --> 2:09:02.480
 Like, what do we know? Because there's this December 8th slash December 16th case of...

2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:04.480
 Maybe you can describe what that is.

2:09:04.480 --> 2:09:09.480
 And then there's like... What's his name?

2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:12.480
 Michael Warabi has a nice timeline.

2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:14.480
 I'm sure you have a timeline.

2:09:14.480 --> 2:09:22.480
 But he has a nice timeline that puts the average at like November or something, like 18th and November 16th.

2:09:22.480 --> 2:09:30.480
 That's the average estimate for when the patient zero got infected, when the first human infection happened.

2:09:30.480 --> 2:09:32.480
 Yeah. So just two points.

2:09:32.480 --> 2:09:37.480
 One is it may be that there's infectee zero and patient zero.

2:09:37.480 --> 2:09:43.480
 It could be that the first person infected was asymptomatic because we know there's a lot of people who are asymptomatic.

2:09:43.480 --> 2:09:47.480
 And then there's the question of, well, who is patient zero?

2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:56.480
 Meaning the first person to present themselves in some kind of health facility where that diagnosis could be made.

2:09:56.480 --> 2:09:58.480
 So can we actually link on that definition?

2:09:58.480 --> 2:09:59.480
 Yeah.

2:09:59.480 --> 2:10:01.480
 So is that to you a good definition of patient zero?

2:10:01.480 --> 2:10:05.480
 Okay, there's a bunch of stuff here because this virus is weird.

2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:06.480
 Yeah.

2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:14.480
 So one is who gets infected, one who is infectious or the first person to infect others.

2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:15.480
 Yeah.

2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:17.480
 And who shows up to hospital?

2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:18.480
 Yeah.

2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:22.480
 So I think that's why I'm calling the first person to show up to a hospital who's diagnosed with COVID 19.

2:10:22.480 --> 2:10:25.480
 I'm calling that person patient zero.

2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:30.480
 There's also, there is somewhere, the first person to be infected.

2:10:30.480 --> 2:10:37.480
 And that person maybe never showed up in a hospital because maybe they were asymptomatic and never got sick.

2:10:37.480 --> 2:10:41.480
 So let me start with what I'm calling infectee zero.

2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:42.480
 Here are some options.

2:10:42.480 --> 2:10:48.480
 I talked before about some person who was a villager in some remote village.

2:10:48.480 --> 2:10:54.480
 It's almost impossible to imagine, but possible to imagine because strange things happen.

2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:58.480
 And that person somehow gets to Wuhan.

2:10:58.480 --> 2:11:01.480
 Yeah, just to still man that argument.

2:11:01.480 --> 2:11:06.480
 There's not an argument, it's a statement, but strange things happen all the time.

2:11:06.480 --> 2:11:07.480
 No, I agree.

2:11:07.480 --> 2:11:11.480
 It doesn't mean that logic doesn't apply and probabilities don't apply.

2:11:11.480 --> 2:11:20.480
 But we all, I mean, in general principle, everyone, if we were honest, should be agnostic about everything.

2:11:20.480 --> 2:11:27.480
 I think I'm Jamie, but is there a 0.01% chance or 001% chance that I'm not?

2:11:27.480 --> 2:11:28.480
 It could be.

2:11:28.480 --> 2:11:33.480
 There's a large number of people arguing about the meaning of the word I in that I'm Jamie.

2:11:33.480 --> 2:11:34.480
 Exactly.

2:11:34.480 --> 2:11:35.480
 What is consciousness?

2:11:35.480 --> 2:11:36.480
 Exactly.

2:11:36.480 --> 2:11:39.480
 So we could spend another three hours going into that one.

2:11:39.480 --> 2:11:42.480
 So one possibility is there's some remote villager.

2:11:42.480 --> 2:11:52.480
 Another possibility is there's some somehow bizarrely there are these infected animals that come from Southern China, most likely.

2:11:52.480 --> 2:11:57.480
 Maybe there's only one of them that's infected, which how could that possibly be?

2:11:57.480 --> 2:11:59.480
 And it's only sent to Wuhan.

2:11:59.480 --> 2:12:04.480
 It's not sent anywhere else to any of the markets there or whatever.

2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:06.480
 And then maybe somebody in a market is infected.

2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:10.480
 That's one remote possibility, but a possibility.

2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:17.480
 Another is that researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology go down to Southern China.

2:12:17.480 --> 2:12:21.480
 We haven't talked about it yet, but in 2012, there were six minors.

2:12:21.480 --> 2:12:26.480
 There were six minors were sent into a copper mine in Southern China and Yunnan province.

2:12:26.480 --> 2:12:31.480
 All of them got very sick with what now appear like COVID 19 like symptoms.

2:12:31.480 --> 2:12:33.480
 Half of them died.

2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:40.480
 Blood samples from them were taken to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and elsewhere.

2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:53.480
 And then after that, there were multiple site visits to that mine collecting viral samples that were brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

2:12:53.480 --> 2:13:04.480
 Included among those samples was this now infamous RETG 13 virus, which is among the genetically closest viruses to SARS CoV2.

2:13:04.480 --> 2:13:12.480
 There were eight other viruses that were collected from that mine that were presumably very similar to that.

2:13:12.480 --> 2:13:20.480
 And again, we have no access to the information about those and many of the other, most, almost all of the other viruses.

2:13:20.480 --> 2:13:30.480
 So could it be that one of the people who was sent from the Wuhan Institute of Virology or the Wuhan Centers for Disease Control,

2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:35.480
 they went down there to collect and they got infected asymptomatically and brought it back?

2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:39.480
 Could it be that they were working on these viruses in the laboratory?

2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:42.480
 And there was an issue with waste disposal.

2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:47.480
 We know that the Wuhan CDC had a major problem with waste disposal.

2:13:47.480 --> 2:13:54.480
 And just before the pandemic, one, they put out an RFP to fix their waste disposal.

2:13:54.480 --> 2:14:04.480
 And in early 2019, they moved to their new site, which was basically across the street from the Huanan seafood market.

2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:09.480
 So could there have been an issue of somebody infected in the lab of waste disposal?

2:14:09.480 --> 2:14:18.480
 Could a laboratory animal, their experiences in China, actually China just recently passed a law saying it's illegal to sell laboratory animals in the market

2:14:18.480 --> 2:14:28.480
 because there were scientists or one scientist who was selling laboratory animals in the market and people would just come and buy it.

2:14:28.480 --> 2:14:31.480
 So there are so many scenarios.

2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:40.480
 But if I, again, connect it to my 85% number, I think in the whole category of laboratory related incidents,

2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:47.480
 whether it's collection, waste, something connected to the lab, I think that's the most likely.

2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:52.480
 But there are other credible people who would say they think it's not the most likely.

2:14:52.480 --> 2:14:56.480
 And I welcome their views and we need to have this conversation.

2:14:56.480 --> 2:14:59.480
 So in your write up, what's the URL?

2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:03.480
 Because I always find it by doing Jamie Marshall lab leak.

2:15:03.480 --> 2:15:05.480
 That's probably the easiest.

2:15:05.480 --> 2:15:14.480
 No, but if you just go to jamymetzle.com, then there's just a thing, it's COVID origins.

2:15:14.480 --> 2:15:19.480
 Or you could just Google jamymetzle lab leak.

2:15:19.480 --> 2:15:22.480
 Google search engine is such a powerful thing.

2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:30.480
 You mentioned in that write up that you don't think, this could be just me misreading it or it's just slightly miswritten,

2:15:30.480 --> 2:15:40.480
 but you don't think that the viruses from that 2012 mind, which is fascinating, could be the backbone for SARS CoV2.

2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:47.480
 So what I mean, just the specific virus, which I mentioned RATG13, and there's a whole history of that,

2:15:47.480 --> 2:15:56.480
 because it had a different name and it looked and should Zheng Li provided wrong information about when it had been sequenced.

2:15:56.480 --> 2:16:00.480
 I mean, there was a whole issue connected to that.

2:16:00.480 --> 2:16:09.480
 But the genetic difference, even though it's 96.2% similar to the SARS CoV2 virus,

2:16:09.480 --> 2:16:19.480
 that's actually a significant difference, even though that and a virus called banal 52 that was collected in Laos are the two most similar.

2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:21.480
 There still are differences.

2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:31.480
 So I'm not saying RATG13 is the backbone, but is there, I believe there is a possibility that other viruses that were collected,

2:16:31.480 --> 2:16:44.480
 either in that mine in Yunnan in Southern China or in Laos or Cambodia, because that was with the EcoHealth Alliance proposals and documents.

2:16:44.480 --> 2:16:53.480
 Their plan was to collect viruses in Laos and Cambodia and elsewhere and bring them to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

2:16:53.480 --> 2:16:58.480
 So that there are people, as a matter of fact, just when I was sitting here before this message,

2:16:58.480 --> 2:17:03.480
 I got, before this interview, I got a message from somebody who was saying,

2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:09.480
 well, Peter Dezak is telling everybody that the viral sample, the banal 52 from Laos,

2:17:09.480 --> 2:17:16.480
 proves that there's not a lab incident origin of the pandemic and it actually doesn't prove that at all,

2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:27.480
 because these viruses were being collected in places like Laos and Cambodia and being brought to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

2:17:27.480 --> 2:17:32.480
 So those are like early, early, like the prequel.

2:17:32.480 --> 2:17:37.480
 So these are, they're not sufficiently similar to be, to serve as a backbone,

2:17:37.480 --> 2:17:44.480
 but they kind of tell a story that they could have been brought to the lab through several processes including genetic modification

2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:48.480
 or through the natural evolution processes, accelerated evolution.

2:17:48.480 --> 2:17:56.480
 They could have arrived at something that has the spike protein and the cleavage, the foreign cleavage site and all that kind of stuff.

2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:01.480
 So what I'm saying is the essential point is if we had access,

2:18:01.480 --> 2:18:08.480
 if we knew everything that was being, every virus that was being held at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Wuhan CDC,

2:18:08.480 --> 2:18:13.480
 we had full access, we had full access to everybody's lab notes,

2:18:13.480 --> 2:18:20.480
 and we did just the kind of forensic investigation that has been so desperately required since day one,

2:18:20.480 --> 2:18:26.480
 we'd be able to say, well, what did you have? Because if we knew, if it should come out,

2:18:26.480 --> 2:18:31.480
 that the Wuhan Institute of Virology had in its repository prior to the outbreak,

2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:39.480
 either SARS CoV2 or a reasonable precursor to it, that would prove the lab incident hypothesis.

2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:45.480
 In my mind, that's almost certainly why they are preventing any kind of meaningful investigation.

2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:53.480
 So my hypothesis is not that what RITG13 says is because, as I mentioned earlier,

2:18:53.480 --> 2:18:58.480
 the genetics of virus are constantly recombinating.

2:18:58.480 --> 2:19:06.480
 So what that means is if you don't have very many total outlier viruses in a BAT community,

2:19:06.480 --> 2:19:10.480
 because these viruses are always mixing and matching with each other,

2:19:10.480 --> 2:19:18.480
 and so if you have RITG13, which is relatively similar to SARS CoV2, there's a pretty decent likelihood

2:19:18.480 --> 2:19:27.480
 there was other stuff that was collected at this mine called Mojang Mine in Yunnan province,

2:19:27.480 --> 2:19:35.480
 maybe in Laos and Cambodia, and that's why we need to have that information.

2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:40.480
 Do you think somebody knows who patient zero is within China?

2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:45.480
 Well, there's two things. One is, I think, somebody and people probably know.

2:19:45.480 --> 2:19:52.480
 And then two, it's been incredibly curious that the best virus chasers in the world are in China,

2:19:52.480 --> 2:20:00.480
 and they are in Wuhan. And we can talk about this deeply compromised, now vastly improved,

2:20:00.480 --> 2:20:07.480
 world health organization process. But when they went there, the local and national Chinese authorities

2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:13.480
 said, oh, we haven't tested the samples in our blood center. We haven't done any of this tracing.

2:20:13.480 --> 2:20:23.480
 And these deeply compromised people who were part of the international part of the joint study tour,

2:20:23.480 --> 2:20:27.480
 when they came out with their visit early this year and came out with their report,

2:20:27.480 --> 2:20:33.480
 they had, in my mind, just an absurd letter to the editor in nature saying,

2:20:33.480 --> 2:20:37.480
 well, if we don't hurry back, we're not going to know what happened,

2:20:37.480 --> 2:20:44.480
 assuming that the people in China are like bumpkins who on their own don't know how to trace the origin of a virus.

2:20:44.480 --> 2:20:51.480
 And the opposite is the case. So I think there are people in China who at least know a lot.

2:20:51.480 --> 2:20:59.480
 They know a lot more than they're saying. And the best case scenario is the Chinese government wants to prevent

2:20:59.480 --> 2:21:06.480
 any investigation, including by them. The worst case scenario is that there are people who already know.

2:21:06.480 --> 2:21:15.480
 And that's why, again, my point from day one has been we need a comprehensive international investigation in Wuhan

2:21:15.480 --> 2:21:21.480
 with full access to all relevant records, samples and personnel. When this, again, deeply flooded,

2:21:21.480 --> 2:21:26.480
 can I give you a little history of this WHO process?

2:21:26.480 --> 2:21:31.480
 Okay. Who are the... That's funny. I'm so...

2:21:31.480 --> 2:21:32.480
 Who's on first?

2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:37.480
 Who's on first. I'm so funny with the jokes. Look at me go.

2:21:37.480 --> 2:21:42.480
 Who are the WHO? So what is this organization? What is its purpose?

2:21:42.480 --> 2:21:50.480
 What role did it play in the pandemic? It certainly was demonized in the realm of politics.

2:21:50.480 --> 2:21:56.480
 This is an institution that was supposed to save us from this pandemic.

2:21:56.480 --> 2:22:01.480
 A lot of people believe it failed. Has it failed? Why did it fail?

2:22:01.480 --> 2:22:03.480
 And you said it's improving. How's it improving?

2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:08.480
 Great. All right. I hope you don't mind. I'm going to have to talk for a little bit of extra...

2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:09.480
 I love this.

2:22:09.480 --> 2:22:11.480
 Okay. Good. Good. Good. Good.

2:22:11.480 --> 2:22:20.480
 So the WHO is an absolutely essential organization created in 1948 in that wonderful period after

2:22:20.480 --> 2:22:26.480
 the Second World War when the United States and allied countries asked the big, bold questions,

2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:32.480
 how do we build a safer world for everyone? And so that's the WHO.

2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:38.480
 Although there are many critics of the WHO, if we didn't have it, we would need to invent it

2:22:38.480 --> 2:22:45.480
 because the whole nature of these big public health issues, and certainly for pandemics,

2:22:45.480 --> 2:22:50.480
 but all sorts of things, is that they are transnational in nature.

2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:56.480
 And so we cannot just build moats. We cannot build walls. We are all connected to it.

2:22:56.480 --> 2:22:58.480
 So that's the idea.

2:22:58.480 --> 2:23:04.480
 There's a political process because the United Nations and the WHO is part of it.

2:23:04.480 --> 2:23:12.480
 It exists within a political context. And so the current Director General of the World Health Organization,

2:23:12.480 --> 2:23:19.480
 who was just reelected for his second five year term, is Dr. Tedros Adanom Gabrielsus,

2:23:19.480 --> 2:23:24.480
 who is from Ethiopia, Tigrayan from Ethiopia.

2:23:24.480 --> 2:23:30.480
 And in full disclosure, I have a lot of respect for Tedros.

2:23:30.480 --> 2:23:36.480
 Tedros got his job. He was not America's candidate. He was not Britain's candidate.

2:23:36.480 --> 2:23:42.480
 Our candidate was a guy named David Nabarro, who I also know and have tremendous respect for.

2:23:42.480 --> 2:23:49.480
 China led the process of putting Tedros in this position.

2:23:49.480 --> 2:23:57.480
 And in the earliest days of the pandemic, Tedros, in my view, even though I have tremendous respect for him,

2:23:57.480 --> 2:24:04.480
 I think he made a mistake. The WHO doesn't have its own independent surveillance network.

2:24:04.480 --> 2:24:07.480
 It's not organized to have it, and the states have not allowed it.

2:24:07.480 --> 2:24:12.480
 So it's dependent on member states for providing it information.

2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:20.480
 And because it's a poorly funded organization dependent on its bosses who are these governments,

2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:28.480
 its natural instinct isn't to condemn its bosses. It's to say, well, let's quietly work with everybody.

2:24:28.480 --> 2:24:33.480
 Having said that, the Chinese government knowingly lied to Tedros.

2:24:33.480 --> 2:24:38.480
 And Tedros, in repeating the position of the Chinese government, which incidentally, I would say,

2:24:38.480 --> 2:24:41.480
 Donald Trump also did the exact same thing.

2:24:41.480 --> 2:24:48.480
 Donald Trump had a private conversation with Xi Jinping and then repeated what she had told him.

2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:51.480
 Both of them were wrong.

2:24:51.480 --> 2:24:59.480
 Dr. Tedros, I think when Chinese government was lying, knowingly lying, saying there's no human to human transmission,

2:24:59.480 --> 2:25:04.480
 Dr. Tedros said that. And even though within the World Health Organization,

2:25:04.480 --> 2:25:10.480
 there were private critiques saying China is now doing exactly what it did in SARS 1.

2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:13.480
 It's not providing access. It's not providing information.

2:25:13.480 --> 2:25:20.480
 Tedros's instinct, because of his background, because of his role and wrongly,

2:25:20.480 --> 2:25:25.480
 was to have a more collaborative relationship with China,

2:25:25.480 --> 2:25:30.480
 particularly by making assertions based on the information that was wrong.

2:25:30.480 --> 2:25:33.480
 Don't call people liars. They're not going to be happy with you.

2:25:33.480 --> 2:25:38.480
 They're not going to be happy. And the job of the WHO isn't to condemn states.

2:25:38.480 --> 2:25:41.480
 It's to do the best possible job of addressing problems.

2:25:41.480 --> 2:25:48.480
 And I think that the culture was, well, let's do the most that we can if we totally alienate China on day one.

2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:52.480
 We're in even worse shape than if we call them out for...

2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:57.480
 I'm not exactly sure, by the way, that maybe you can also steal man that argument.

2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:02.480
 It's not completely obvious that that's a terrible decision.

2:26:02.480 --> 2:26:06.480
 If you and I were in that role, we would make that decision.

2:26:06.480 --> 2:26:11.480
 It's complicated because you want China on your side to help solve this.

2:26:11.480 --> 2:26:18.480
 So I would have made a different decision, which is why I never would have been selected as the director general.

2:26:18.480 --> 2:26:23.480
 There's a selection criteria that everybody kind of needs to support you.

2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:26.480
 This is just the beginning.

2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:33.480
 Can you also just elaborate or kind of restate what were the inaccuracies that you quickly mentioned?

2:26:33.480 --> 2:26:36.480
 So human to human transmission, what were the...

2:26:36.480 --> 2:26:40.480
 So the most important, there were a few things.

2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:45.480
 One, China didn't report the outbreak.

2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:55.480
 Two, they had the sequenced genome of the SARS CoV2 virus and they didn't share it for two critical weeks.

2:26:55.480 --> 2:26:58.480
 And when they did share it, it was inadvertent.

2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:05.480
 I mean, there was a very, very courageous scientist who essentially leaked it and was later punished for leaking it,

2:27:05.480 --> 2:27:09.480
 even though the Chinese government is now saying we were so great by releasing...

2:27:09.480 --> 2:27:11.480
 Wait, I was really confused. Really?

2:27:11.480 --> 2:27:14.480
 So I'm so clueless about this as most things.

2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:23.480
 Because I thought, because there's a celebration of, isn't this amazing that we got the sequence,

2:27:23.480 --> 2:27:29.480
 like this amazing and then the scientific community across the world stepped up

2:27:29.480 --> 2:27:32.480
 and were able to do a lot of stuff really quickly with that sharing?

2:27:32.480 --> 2:27:34.480
 Because I thought the Chinese government shared it.

2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:36.480
 No, no, they sat on it for two weeks.

2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:37.480
 Oh, no.

2:27:37.480 --> 2:27:40.480
 When they shared it against their will, it was incredible.

2:27:40.480 --> 2:27:46.480
 Moderna, 48 hours later, after getting the information, getting the sequence genome,

2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:51.480
 they had the formulation for what's now the Moderna COVID 19 vaccine.

2:27:51.480 --> 2:27:54.480
 But that's two critical weeks.

2:27:54.480 --> 2:28:04.480
 In those early days, they blocked the World Health Organization from sending its experts to Wuhan for more than three weeks.

2:28:04.480 --> 2:28:07.480
 I said they lied about human to human transmission.

2:28:07.480 --> 2:28:12.480
 During that time, they were aggressively enacting their cover up, destroying records,

2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:19.480
 hiding samples, imprisoning people who were asking tough questions.

2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:23.480
 They soon after established their gag order.

2:28:23.480 --> 2:28:31.480
 They fought internally in the World Health Organization to prevent the declaration of a global emergency.

2:28:31.480 --> 2:28:38.480
 So China definitely, I mean, I couldn't be stronger in my critique of China,

2:28:38.480 --> 2:28:40.480
 particularly what it did in those early days.

2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:44.480
 But it really, what it's doing even to today is outrageous.

2:28:44.480 --> 2:28:51.480
 So then there was the question of, well, how do we examine what actually happened?

2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:57.480
 And the Prime Minister of Australia then and now, Scott Morrison, was incredibly courageous.

2:28:57.480 --> 2:28:59.480
 And he said, we need a full investigation.

2:28:59.480 --> 2:29:07.480
 And because of that, the Chinese government attacked him personally and imposed trade sanctions on Australia

2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:12.480
 to try not just to punish Australia, but to deliver a message to every other country.

2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:16.480
 So if you ask questions, we're going to punish you ruthlessly.

2:29:16.480 --> 2:29:21.480
 And that certainly was the message that was delivered.

2:29:21.480 --> 2:29:28.480
 The Australians brought that idea of a full investigation to the World Health Assembly in May of 2020.

2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:36.480
 As I mentioned before, the WHA is the governing authority of states above the World Health Organization.

2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:42.480
 And so, but instead of passing a resolution calling for a full investigation,

2:29:42.480 --> 2:29:53.480
 what ended up ironically and tragically passing with Chinese support was a mandate to have essentially a Chinese controlled joint study

2:29:53.480 --> 2:29:57.480
 where half of the team, a little more than half of the team was Chinese experts,

2:29:57.480 --> 2:29:59.480
 government affiliated Chinese experts,

2:29:59.480 --> 2:30:07.480
 and half were independent international experts but organized by the WHO.

2:30:07.480 --> 2:30:12.480
 And then it took six months to negotiate the terms of reference.

2:30:12.480 --> 2:30:16.480
 And again, while China was doing all this cover up, they delayed and delayed and delayed.

2:30:16.480 --> 2:30:25.480
 And by the terms of reference that were negotiated, China had veto power over who got to be a member of the international group.

2:30:25.480 --> 2:30:30.480
 And that group was not entitled to access to raw data.

2:30:30.480 --> 2:30:39.480
 The Chinese side would give them conclusions based on their own analysis of the raw data, which was totally outrageous.

2:30:39.480 --> 2:30:45.480
 So then, and I was a big eye and others, now friend of mine, although we've never met in person,

2:30:45.480 --> 2:30:53.480
 Gilles de Manouf in New Zealand, he did a great job of chronicling just the letter by letter of the terms of reference.

2:30:53.480 --> 2:31:00.480
 So then it took, now it's January of this year, January 2021,

2:31:00.480 --> 2:31:07.480
 this deeply flawed, deeply compromised international group is sent to Wuhan.

2:31:07.480 --> 2:31:10.480
 What's the connection between this group and the joint study?

2:31:10.480 --> 2:31:13.480
 So the joint study had had the Chinese side and the international side.

2:31:13.480 --> 2:31:19.480
 So these international experts, then part of their examination was going for one month to Wuhan.

2:31:19.480 --> 2:31:22.480
 And the nature of the flaws of this international group?

2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:24.480
 It's okay, really important point.

2:31:24.480 --> 2:31:26.480
 And I'm sorry, I wasn't clear on that.

2:31:26.480 --> 2:31:34.480
 Rather, the mandate of what they were doing was not to investigate the origins of the pandemic.

2:31:34.480 --> 2:31:40.480
 It was to have a joint study into the zoonotic origins of the virus,

2:31:40.480 --> 2:31:45.480
 which was interpreted to mean the natural origins hypothesis.

2:31:45.480 --> 2:31:53.480
 They weren't empowered for a single hypothesis, so that they weren't empowered to examine the lab incident origin.

2:31:53.480 --> 2:31:56.480
 They were there to look at the natural origin hypothesis.

2:31:56.480 --> 2:31:58.480
 To shop for some meat at the markets?

2:31:58.480 --> 2:32:00.480
 How do you do this investigation?

2:32:00.480 --> 2:32:03.480
 So then they were there for a month.

2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:09.480
 Of the makeup of the team, guess who was?

2:32:09.480 --> 2:32:13.480
 So the United States government proposed three experts for this team.

2:32:13.480 --> 2:32:15.480
 People who had a lot of background.

2:32:15.480 --> 2:32:22.480
 This was the Trump administration, people who had a lot of background, including in investigating lab incidents.

2:32:22.480 --> 2:32:24.480
 None of those people were accepted.

2:32:24.480 --> 2:32:26.480
 The one American who was accepted.

2:32:26.480 --> 2:32:28.480
 Don't tell me it's Peter Desick.

2:32:28.480 --> 2:32:35.480
 Peter Desick, who had this funding relationship for many years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology,

2:32:35.480 --> 2:32:43.480
 whose entire basically professional reputation was based on his collaboration with Xu Zhengli,

2:32:43.480 --> 2:32:49.480
 who had written the February 2020 Lancet letter saying it comes from natural origin

2:32:49.480 --> 2:32:53.480
 and anybody who's suggesting otherwise is a conspiracy theorist,

2:32:53.480 --> 2:33:00.480
 and who, at least according to me, had been at very, very least the opposite of transparent

2:33:00.480 --> 2:33:03.480
 and at most engaged in a massive disinformation campaign.

2:33:03.480 --> 2:33:07.480
 He is the one American who's on this.

2:33:07.480 --> 2:33:10.480
 So they go there, they have one month in Wuhan.

2:33:10.480 --> 2:33:15.480
 Two weeks of it are spent in quarantine, just in their hotel rooms.

2:33:15.480 --> 2:33:19.480
 So then they have two weeks, but really it's just 10 working days.

2:33:19.480 --> 2:33:23.480
 One of the earliest, and so then they're kind of, we've all seen the pictures,

2:33:23.480 --> 2:33:26.480
 they're traveling around Wuhan in little buses.

2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:33.480
 One of the first visits they have is to this museum exhibition on the,

2:33:33.480 --> 2:33:37.480
 it's basically a propaganda exhibition on the success,

2:33:37.480 --> 2:33:40.480
 Xi Jinping and the success in fighting COVID.

2:33:40.480 --> 2:33:42.480
 And they said, well, we had to show respect to our Chinese hosts.

2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:47.480
 I think what the Chinese hosts were saying is let's just, we're just going to rub your noses in this.

2:33:47.480 --> 2:33:52.480
 You're going to go where we tell you, you're going to hear what we want you to hear.

2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:54.480
 So they have that little short time.

2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:56.480
 They spend a few hours.

2:33:56.480 --> 2:33:59.480
 So they weren't in control of where the bus goes.

2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:01.480
 No, I mean, they made recommendations.

2:34:01.480 --> 2:34:05.480
 Many of their recommendations were accepted.

2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:10.480
 But they, like when they went to the Wuhan Institute of Virology and some of them did,

2:34:10.480 --> 2:34:15.480
 they had a, they weren't able to do any kind of audit when they had asked for access to raw data.

2:34:15.480 --> 2:34:18.480
 They weren't provided, they weren't provided that.

2:34:18.480 --> 2:34:22.480
 They were, it was, as I said in my 60 minutes interview,

2:34:22.480 --> 2:34:24.480
 it was a chaperoned study tour.

2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:27.480
 It was not even remotely close to an investigation.

2:34:27.480 --> 2:34:31.480
 And the thing they were looking at wasn't the origins of the pandemic.

2:34:31.480 --> 2:34:38.480
 It was the single hypothesis of a quote unquote natural, natural origins.

2:34:38.480 --> 2:34:46.480
 Then, I mean, it was really so shocking for me on February 9 of this year in Wuhan,

2:34:46.480 --> 2:34:54.480
 the Chinese government sets up a joint press event where it's the Chinese side and the international side.

2:34:54.480 --> 2:35:00.480
 And during that press event, a guy named Peter Ben Embarak, and it's a little confusing.

2:35:00.480 --> 2:35:09.480
 He was basically the head of this delegation and he works for the WHO even though this was an independent committee.

2:35:09.480 --> 2:35:11.480
 It was organized by the WHO.

2:35:11.480 --> 2:35:18.480
 So Peter Ben Embarak gets up there and says, we think it's most likely it comes from nature.

2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:25.480
 Then he says, we think it's possible it comes through frozen food, which is absolutely outrageous.

2:35:25.480 --> 2:35:27.480
 I mean, it's basically preposterous.

2:35:27.480 --> 2:35:33.480
 Alina Chan calls this popsicle origins, but it's really, really unlikely.

2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:47.480
 But then most significantly, he says that we've all agreed that a lab incident origin is quote unquote extremely unlikely and shouldn't be investigated.

2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:57.480
 We later learned that the way they came up with that determination was by a show of hands vote of the international experts and the Chinese experts.

2:35:57.480 --> 2:36:05.480
 And the Chinese experts had to do their vote in front of the Chinese government officials who were constantly there.

2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:12.480
 So even if whatever they thought there was no possibility that someone raises their hand is, oh yeah, I think it's a lab origin.

2:36:12.480 --> 2:36:14.480
 So that was outrageous thing number one.

2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:20.480
 Outrageous thing number two, which I mean, I'll come back to my response in February.

2:36:20.480 --> 2:36:27.480
 Outrageous thing number two is months later, Peter Ben Embarak does an interview on Danish television.

2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:42.480
 And he says, actually, I was lying about extremely unlikely because the Chinese side, they didn't want any mention of a lab incident origin anywhere, including in the report that later came out.

2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:53.480
 And so the deal we made, even though he himself thought that at least some manifestation of a lab incident origin was likely and that there should be an investigation particularly.

2:36:53.480 --> 2:37:03.480
 He said, well, that's kind of weird that the Wuhan CDC moved just across from the Huanan seafood market just before the beginning of the pandemic.

2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:14.480
 But he said, as a horse trading deal with the Chinese authorities, it shouldn't be that he agreed to say it was extremely unlikely and shouldn't be investigated.

2:37:14.480 --> 2:37:22.480
 So I was in actually in Colorado staying with my parents and I stayed up late watching this press event.

2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:29.480
 And I was appalled because I knew after two weeks there was no way they could possibly come to that conclusion.

2:37:29.480 --> 2:37:41.480
 So I immediately sent a private message to Tedros, the WHO Director General, essentially saying there's no way they had enough access to come to this conclusion.

2:37:41.480 --> 2:37:53.480
 If the WHO doesn't distance itself from this, the WHO itself is going to be in danger because it's going to be basically institutional capture by the Chinese.

2:37:53.480 --> 2:38:08.480
 This was repeating the Chinese government's propaganda points and Tedros sent me a really, again, why I have so much respect for Tedros, sent me a private note saying, don't worry, we are determined to do the right thing.

2:38:08.480 --> 2:38:11.480
 And so I got that private message and again, I really like Tedros.

2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:14.480
 But I thought, well, what are you going to do?

2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:22.480
 Three days later, Tedros makes a public statement and he says, I've heard this thing.

2:38:22.480 --> 2:38:25.480
 I don't think that this is a final answer.

2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:29.480
 We need to have a full investigation into this process.

2:38:29.480 --> 2:38:42.480
 He then released two more statements saying we need to have a full investigation with access to raw data and we need a full audit of the Wuhan labs.

2:38:42.480 --> 2:38:52.480
 And that part was really, really great. But then this saga continues because so I was part of a group, as I mentioned before, this Paris group.

2:38:52.480 --> 2:39:04.480
 It was about two dozen or so experts and we'd been meeting since 2020 and having regular meetings and we just present papers, present data, debate to try to really get to the bottom of things.

2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:05.480
 And it was all private.

2:39:05.480 --> 2:39:12.480
 So I went to this group and I said, look, this playing field is now skewed.

2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:14.480
 These guys, they've put out this thing.

2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:16.480
 LabN is in origin extremely unlikely.

2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:19.480
 It's in every newspaper in the world.

2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:23.480
 We can't just be our own little private group talking to each other.

2:39:23.480 --> 2:39:32.480
 So I led the political process of drafting what became four open letters that many of us signed, most of us signed.

2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:40.480
 That saying, all right, here's why this investigation, not in this study group and the report are not credible.

2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:41.480
 Here's what's wrong.

2:39:41.480 --> 2:39:45.480
 Here's what a full investigation would look like.

2:39:45.480 --> 2:39:52.480
 Here's a treasure map of all the resources where people can look and we demand a comprehensive investigation.

2:39:52.480 --> 2:40:02.480
 So those four open letters were in pretty much every newspaper in the world and it played a really significant role along with some other things.

2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:11.480
 There was later, there was a letter, a short letter in science making basically similar points in a much more condensed way.

2:40:11.480 --> 2:40:19.480
 There were some higher profile articles by Nicholas Wade and Nick Baker and others.

2:40:19.480 --> 2:40:24.480
 And those collectively shifted the conversation.

2:40:24.480 --> 2:40:33.480
 And then really impressively, the WHO and with Tedros's leadership did something that was really incredible.

2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:46.480
 And that is earlier this year, they, meaning the leadership of the WHO, not the World Health Assembly, but the leadership of the WHO announced the establishment of what's called SAGO,

2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:51.480
 the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens.

2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:59.480
 And basically what they did was overrule their own governing board and say, we're going to create our own entity.

2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:04.480
 And so it basically dissolved that deeply flawed international joint study group.

2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:11.480
 And a lot of those people, they have become very critical, like the Chinese of Tedros.

2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:17.480
 And they had an open call for nominations to be part of SAGO.

2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:25.480
 And so a lot of people put in their nominations, they selected 26 people.

2:41:25.480 --> 2:41:30.480
 But our group, we had a meeting and we were unhappy with that list of 26.

2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:34.480
 It still felt skewed toward the natural origin hypothesis.

2:41:34.480 --> 2:41:46.480
 So again, I drafted and we worked on together an open letter which we submitted to the WHO saying, we think this list, it's a step in the right direction, but it's not good enough.

2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:53.480
 And we call on these three people to be removed and we have these three people who we think should be added.

2:41:53.480 --> 2:42:03.480
 Incredibly, and I was in private touch with the WHO, after announcing the 26 people, the WHO said, we're reopening the process.

2:42:03.480 --> 2:42:13.480
 So send in more and then they added two more people, one of whom is an expert in the audit, auditing of lab incidents.

2:42:13.480 --> 2:42:16.480
 And then one of the, so they added those two.

2:42:16.480 --> 2:42:32.480
 And then when they just released the list of people who are part of SAGO, this one woman, a highly respected Dutch virologist named Marion Koepmans, who had been part of that deeply flawed and compromised international study group

2:42:32.480 --> 2:42:38.480
 who had called, who has consistently called a lab incident origin, quote unquote, a debunked conspiracy theory.

2:42:38.480 --> 2:42:42.480
 As of now, her name is not on the list.

2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:44.480
 We haven't seen any announcements.

2:42:44.480 --> 2:42:49.480
 So I summary, and I'm sorry to go on for so long and to be so animated about this.

2:42:49.480 --> 2:42:59.480
 I genuinely feel that the WHO is trying to do the right thing, but they exist within a political context.

2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:07.480
 And they're kind of, it's like, they're pushing at the edges, but there's only so far that they can go.

2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:12.480
 And that's why we definitely need to have full accountability for the WHO.

2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:18.480
 We need to expand the mandate to WHO, but we need to recognize that states have a big role.

2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:28.480
 And China is an incredibly influential state that's doing everything possible to prevent the kind of full investigation into pandemic origins that's so desperately required.

2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:33.480
 Well, it sounds like the leadership made all the difference in the WHO.

2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:38.480
 So like the way to change the momentum of large institutions is through the leadership.

2:43:38.480 --> 2:43:44.480
 Leadership and empowerment, as I mentioned, the World Health Assembly is meeting now.

2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:50.480
 And I think that it shouldn't be that we require superhumans.

2:43:50.480 --> 2:44:00.480
 And there are some people who are big critics of WHO, the leader of the WHO in SARS 1 was definitely more aggressive.

2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:05.480
 She had a different set of powers at that time.

2:44:05.480 --> 2:44:14.480
 But it can't be entirely, I mean, we definitely need strong willed, aggressive, independent people in these kinds of roles.

2:44:14.480 --> 2:44:27.480
 We also need a more empowered WHO, like when the Chinese government in the earliest days of the pandemic said, we're just not going to allow you to send a team to collect your own information.

2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:34.480
 And we're not going to allow you to have any kind of independent surveillance.

2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:46.480
 There's very little that the WHO could do because of the limitations of its mandate. And we can't just say we're going to have a WHO that only compromises Chinese sovereignty.

2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:57.480
 If we want to have a powerful WHO, we should say you have emergency teams when the director general says an emergency team needs to go somewhere.

2:44:57.480 --> 2:45:05.480
 If they aren't allowed to go there that day, you could say there's an immediate referral to the Security Council, there needs to be something.

2:45:05.480 --> 2:45:08.480
 But we have all these demands rightfully.

2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:16.480
 So of the WHO, which doesn't have the authorities, the WHO itself only controls 20% of its own budget.

2:45:16.480 --> 2:45:21.480
 So the governments are saying, we're going to give you money to do this or that.

2:45:21.480 --> 2:45:28.480
 So we need a stronger WHO to protect us, but we also have to build that.

2:45:28.480 --> 2:45:34.480
 So looking a little bit into the future, let's first step into the past.

2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:39.480
 So there's a philosophical question about China.

2:45:39.480 --> 2:45:50.480
 If you were to put yourself in the shoes of the Chinese government, if there were to be more transparent, how should they be more transparent?

2:45:50.480 --> 2:45:57.480
 Because it's easier to say we want to see this.

2:45:57.480 --> 2:46:08.480
 But from a perspective of government, and not just the Chinese government, but a government on whose geographic territory, say it's a lab leak.

2:46:08.480 --> 2:46:23.480
 A lab leak occurred that has resulted in trillions of dollars of loss, countless of lives, just all kinds of damage to the world.

2:46:23.480 --> 2:46:37.480
 If they were to admit or show data that could serve as evidence for a lab leak, that's something that people could, like in the worst case, start wars over.

2:46:37.480 --> 2:46:49.480
 Or in the most likely case, just constantly bring that up at every turn, making you powerless in negotiations.

2:46:49.480 --> 2:46:55.480
 Whenever you want to do something in a geopolitical sense, the United States will bring up,

2:46:55.480 --> 2:47:01.480
 oh, remember that time you cost us trillions of dollars because of your fuck up?

2:47:01.480 --> 2:47:07.480
 So what is the incentive for the Chinese government to be transparent?

2:47:07.480 --> 2:47:11.480
 And if it is to be transparent, how should it do it?

2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:24.480
 So there's a bunch of people, like the reason I'm talking to you, as opposed to a bunch of other folks, because you are kind hearted and thoughtful and open minded and really respected.

2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:36.480
 There's a bunch of people that are talking about lab leak that are a little bit less interested in building a better world and more interested in pointing out the emperor has no clothes.

2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:43.480
 They want step one, which is saying basically tearing down the bullshitters.

2:47:43.480 --> 2:47:48.480
 They don't want to do the further steps of building.

2:47:48.480 --> 2:47:59.480
 So as a Chinese government, I would be nervous about being transparent with anybody that just wants to tear our power centers, our power structures down.

2:47:59.480 --> 2:48:08.480
 Anyway, that's a long way to ask, how should the Chinese government be transparent now and in the future?

2:48:08.480 --> 2:48:12.480
 So maybe I'll break that down into a few sub questions.

2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:18.480
 The first is, what should, in an ideal world, what should the Chinese government do?

2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:20.480
 And that's pretty straightforward.

2:48:20.480 --> 2:48:23.480
 They should be totally transparent.

2:48:23.480 --> 2:48:32.480
 The South African government now, there's an outbreak of this Omicron variant and the South African government has done what we would want a government to do.

2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:33.480
 Say, hey, there's an outbreak.

2:48:33.480 --> 2:48:35.480
 We don't have all of the information.

2:48:35.480 --> 2:48:36.480
 We need help.

2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:38.480
 We want to alert the world.

2:48:38.480 --> 2:48:43.480
 And in some ways, they're being punished for it through these travel bans, but it's a separate topic.

2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:48.480
 But I actually think short term travel bans actually are not a terrible idea.

2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:56.480
 They should have, on day one, if they should have allowed WHO experts in, they should have shared information.

2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:07.480
 They should have allowed a full and comprehensive investigation with international partnerships to understand what went wrong.

2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:10.480
 They should have shared their raw data.

2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:20.480
 They should have allowed their scientists to speak and write publicly because nobody knows more about this stuff, certainly in the early days than their scientists do.

2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:26.480
 So it's relatively easy to say what they should do.

2:49:26.480 --> 2:49:29.480
 It's a hard question to say, well, what would happen?

2:49:29.480 --> 2:49:32.480
 Let's just say, let's just say tomorrow.

2:49:32.480 --> 2:49:49.480
 We prove for certain that this pandemic stems from both from an accidental lab incident and then from what I've consistently called a criminal cover up because the cover up has done in many ways as much or more damage than the incident.

2:49:49.480 --> 2:49:50.480
 Well, what happens?

2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:57.480
 You could easily imagine Xi Jinping has had two terms as the leader of China.

2:49:57.480 --> 2:49:59.480
 And he can now have unlimited terms.

2:49:59.480 --> 2:50:02.480
 They've changed the rules for that, but he's got a lot of enemies.

2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:06.480
 I mean, there are a lot of people who are waiting in line to step up.

2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:12.480
 So is there a chance that Xi Jinping could be deposed if it was proven that this comes from a lab?

2:50:12.480 --> 2:50:14.480
 I think there's a real possibility.

2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:21.480
 Would people in the United States Congress, for example, demand reparations from China?

2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:27.480
 So we've had four and a half trillion dollars of stimulus, all of the economic losses.

2:50:27.480 --> 2:50:32.480
 We owe a lot of money to China from our debt.

2:50:32.480 --> 2:50:37.480
 I'm quite certain that members of Congress would say, you know, we're just going to wipe that out.

2:50:37.480 --> 2:50:41.480
 It would destroy the global financial system, but I think they would be extremely likely.

2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:52.480
 Would other countries like India that have lost millions of people and had terrible economic damages, would they demand reparations?

2:50:52.480 --> 2:51:02.480
 So I think from a Chinese perspective, starting from now, it would have major geopolitical implications and go back to Chernobyl.

2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:07.480
 There was a reason why the Soviet Union went to such length to cover things up.

2:51:07.480 --> 2:51:20.480
 And when it came out, I mean, there are different theories, but certainly Chernobyl played some role in the end of communist power in the Soviet Union.

2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:24.480
 So the Chinese are very, very aware of that.

2:51:24.480 --> 2:51:31.480
 But the difference, of course, with Chernobyl, the damage to the rest of the world was not as nearly as significant as COVID.

2:51:31.480 --> 2:51:44.480
 So you say that the cover up is a crime, but everything you just described, the response of the rest of the world is, I could say, unfair.

2:51:44.480 --> 2:51:53.480
 So if we say the best possible version of the story, you know, lab leaks happen.

2:51:53.480 --> 2:51:57.480
 They shouldn't happen, but they happen.

2:51:57.480 --> 2:52:01.480
 And how is that on the Chinese government?

2:52:01.480 --> 2:52:03.480
 I mean, what's a good example?

2:52:03.480 --> 2:52:05.480
 Well, the Union Carbide.

2:52:05.480 --> 2:52:08.480
 There was this American company operating in India.

2:52:08.480 --> 2:52:10.480
 They had this leak.

2:52:10.480 --> 2:52:12.480
 All these people were killed.

2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:15.480
 The company admitted responsibility.

2:52:15.480 --> 2:52:23.480
 I was working in the White House when the United States government, in my view, which I know to be the case, but other people in China think differently,

2:52:23.480 --> 2:52:25.480
 bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.

2:52:25.480 --> 2:52:29.480
 And so the United States government allowed a full investigation.

2:52:29.480 --> 2:52:34.480
 Then we paid reparations to the family, the families.

2:52:34.480 --> 2:52:43.480
 So to your question, if I were, let's just say I were the Chinese government, not, I mean, kind of an idealized version of the Chinese government.

2:52:43.480 --> 2:52:48.480
 And let's just say that they had come to the conclusion that it was a lab incident.

2:52:48.480 --> 2:52:58.480
 And let's just say they knew that even if they continued to cover it up, eventually this information would come out.

2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:04.480
 I mean, maybe there was a whistleblower, maybe they knew of some evidence that we didn't know about or something.

2:53:04.480 --> 2:53:08.480
 What would I do starting right now?

2:53:08.480 --> 2:53:16.480
 What I would do is I would hold a press conference and we would say, and I would say, we had this terrible accident.

2:53:16.480 --> 2:53:30.480
 The reason why we were doing this research in Wuhan and elsewhere is that we had SARS 1 and we felt a responsibility to do everything possible to prevent that kind of terrible thing happening again for our country and for the world.

2:53:30.480 --> 2:53:37.480
 That was why we collaborated with France, with the United States in building up those capacities.

2:53:37.480 --> 2:53:48.480
 We know that nothing is perfect, but we're a sovereign country and we have our own system and so we had to adapt our systems so that they made sense internally.

2:53:48.480 --> 2:53:53.480
 When this outbreak began, we didn't know how it started.

2:53:53.480 --> 2:53:57.480
 And that was why we wanted to look into things.

2:53:57.480 --> 2:54:09.480
 When the process of investigating became so political, it gave us pause and we were worried that our enemies were trying to use this investigation in order to undermine us.

2:54:09.480 --> 2:54:23.480
 Having said that, now that we've dug deeper, we have recognized, because we have access to additional information that we didn't have then, that this pandemic started from an accidental lab incident.

2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:30.480
 And we feel really terribly about that and we know that we were very aggressive in covering up information in the beginning.

2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:37.480
 But the reason we were doing that is because we thoroughly, we fully believe that it came from a natural origin.

2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:40.480
 Now that we see otherwise, we feel terribly.

2:54:40.480 --> 2:54:44.480
 Therefore, we're doing a few different things.

2:54:44.480 --> 2:55:08.480
 One is we are committing ourselves to establishing a stronger WHO, a new pandemic treaty that addresses the major challenges that we face and allows the World Health Organization to pierce the veil of absolute sovereignty because we know that when these pandemics happen, they affect everybody.

2:55:08.480 --> 2:55:25.480
 We are also putting, and you can pick your number, but let's start with five trillion US dollars, some massive amount, into a fund that we will be distributing to the victims of COVID 19 and their...

2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:27.480
 China would do that?

2:55:27.480 --> 2:55:29.480
 This is a fantasy speech.

2:55:29.480 --> 2:55:31.480
 But I disagree with your...

2:55:31.480 --> 2:55:36.480
 So you think China has responsibility?

2:55:36.480 --> 2:55:40.480
 So it's not just a lab leak.

2:55:40.480 --> 2:55:46.480
 If China on day one had said, we have this outbreak, we don't know where it came from.

2:55:46.480 --> 2:55:49.480
 We want to have a full investigation.

2:55:49.480 --> 2:55:55.480
 We call on responsible international partners to join us in that process.

2:55:55.480 --> 2:56:02.480
 And we're going to do everything in our power to share the relevant information because however this started, we're all victims.

2:56:02.480 --> 2:56:12.480
 That's a totally different story than punishing Australia, preventing the WHO, blocking any investigation, condemning people who are trying to look.

2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:19.480
 So cover up for a couple of weeks, you can understand maybe because there's so much uncertainty.

2:56:19.480 --> 2:56:25.480
 You're like, oh, let's hide all the Winnie the Pooh pictures while we figure this out.

2:56:25.480 --> 2:56:35.480
 But the moment you really figure out what happened, you always, as a joke, always find like a blame the Jews kind of situation a little bit.

2:56:35.480 --> 2:56:36.480
 Just a little bit.

2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:39.480
 You're like, all right, it's not us.

2:56:39.480 --> 2:56:40.480
 I'm just kidding.

2:56:40.480 --> 2:56:44.480
 But be proactive and saying...

2:56:44.480 --> 2:56:55.480
 The joke about that is there's a big problem because a lot of people have to leave the Jewish socialist conspiracy to make it for the Jewish capitalist conspiracy meeting.

2:56:55.480 --> 2:56:58.480
 I love it.

2:56:58.480 --> 2:57:02.480
 So I would say not five trillion, but some large amount.

2:57:02.480 --> 2:57:12.480
 And I would really focus on the future, which is every time we talk about the lab leak, the unfortunate thing is I feel like people don't focus enough about the future.

2:57:12.480 --> 2:57:29.480
 To me, the lab leak is important because we want to construct a kind of framework of thinking and a global conversation that minimizes the damage done by future lab leaks, which will almost certainly happen.

2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:34.480
 And so to me, any lab leak is about the future.

2:57:34.480 --> 2:57:50.480
 I would launch a giant investment in saying we're going to create a testing infrastructure, like all of this kind of infrastructure investments that help minimize the damage of a lab leak here in the rest of the world.

2:57:50.480 --> 2:58:09.480
 So the challenge with that is, one, it's hard to imagine a fully accountable future system to prevent these kinds of terrible pandemics that's built upon obfuscation and coverup regarding the origins of this worst pandemic in a century.

2:58:09.480 --> 2:58:13.480
 So it's just like that foundation isn't strong enough.

2:58:13.480 --> 2:58:20.480
 Second, China across the fields of science is looking to leapfrog the rest of the world.

2:58:20.480 --> 2:58:26.480
 So China has current plans to build BSL for labs in every of its province.

2:58:26.480 --> 2:58:29.480
 Yeah, they're scaling up everything.

2:58:29.480 --> 2:58:39.480
 And so with the plan on leading, and that's why, again, I was saying before, I think there's a lot of similarity between this story, at least as I see it, at least the most probable case.

2:58:39.480 --> 2:58:43.480
 And these other areas where China gets knowledge and then tries to leapfrog.

2:58:43.480 --> 2:58:47.480
 It's the same with AI and autonomous killer robots.

2:58:47.480 --> 2:58:57.480
 It's the same with human genome editing, with animal experimentation, with so many, basically all areas of advanced science.

2:58:57.480 --> 2:59:01.480
 So the question is, would China stop in that process?

2:59:01.480 --> 2:59:15.480
 And then third, it's a little bit of a historical background, but defending national sovereignty is one of the core principles of, certainly, of the Chinese state.

2:59:15.480 --> 2:59:30.480
 And the historical issue is, for those of us who come from the West, one of the lessons of the postwar planners was that absolute national sovereignty was actually a major feeder into the first and second world wars.

2:59:30.480 --> 2:59:33.480
 That we had all these conflicting states.

2:59:33.480 --> 2:59:46.480
 And therefore, the logic of the postwar system is we need to, in some ways, pool sovereignty that's like the EU and have transnational organizations like the UN organizations and the Bretton Woods organizations.

2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:58.480
 For most Asian states, and also even for some African, the people who are kind of on the colonized side of history, sovereignty was the thing that was denied them.

2:59:58.480 --> 3:00:01.480
 That was the thing that they want, that the European power is denied.

3:00:01.480 --> 3:00:06.480
 And so the idea of giving up sovereignty was the absolute opposite.

3:00:06.480 --> 3:00:12.480
 And so that's why China is, and again, I mentioned this Rush Doshi book.

3:00:12.480 --> 3:00:20.480
 It's not that China is trying to strengthen this rules based international order, which is based on the principle that, well, there are certain things that we share.

3:00:20.480 --> 3:00:25.480
 And how do we build a governance system to protect those things?

3:00:25.480 --> 3:00:31.480
 What it seems to be doing is trying to advance its own sovereignty.

3:00:31.480 --> 3:00:39.480
 And so I think, I agree with you, but I don't think that we can just go forward without some accountability for the...

3:00:39.480 --> 3:00:41.480
 So the cover up was a big problem.

3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:49.480
 It's like, I find myself playing devil's advocate because I'm trying to sort of empathize.

3:00:49.480 --> 3:00:59.480
 And then I forget that like two or three people listen to this thing and then they're like, look, Lex is defending the Chinese government with their cover up.

3:00:59.480 --> 3:01:04.480
 No, I'm not, you know, I'm just trying to understand.

3:01:04.480 --> 3:01:18.480
 I mean, it's the same reason I'm reading Mein Kampf now is like, you have to really understand the minds of people as if I too could have done that.

3:01:18.480 --> 3:01:22.480
 You know, you have to understand that we're all the same to some degree.

3:01:22.480 --> 3:01:29.480
 And that kind of empathy is required to figure out solutions for the future.

3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:35.480
 It's just in empathizing with the Chinese government in this whole situation.

3:01:35.480 --> 3:01:44.480
 I'm still not sure I understand how to minimize the chance of a cover up in the future, whether for China or for the United States.

3:01:44.480 --> 3:01:51.480
 I'm not exactly sure we would be with all the emphasis we put on freedom of speech.

3:01:51.480 --> 3:02:02.480
 With all the emphasis we put on freedom of the press and access to the press to sort of all aspects of government.

3:02:02.480 --> 3:02:05.480
 I'm not sure the US government would do a similar kind of cover up.

3:02:05.480 --> 3:02:07.480
 Let me put it this way.

3:02:07.480 --> 3:02:09.480
 So we're in Texas now doing this interview.

3:02:09.480 --> 3:02:16.480
 Imagine there's a kind of horseshoe bat that we'll call the Texas horseshoe bat.

3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:19.480
 There's a lot of bats in Austin by the way.

3:02:19.480 --> 3:02:20.480
 It's true.

3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:21.480
 It's true.

3:02:21.480 --> 3:02:22.480
 It's true.

3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:27.480
 And so let's just say that the Texas horseshoe bats only exist in Texas.

3:02:27.480 --> 3:02:31.480
 But in Montana, we have a thing.

3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:35.480
 It's called the Montana Institute of Virology.

3:02:35.480 --> 3:02:54.480
 And at the Montana Institute of Virology, they have the world's largest collection of Texas horseshoe bats, including horseshoe bats that are associated with a previous global pandemic called the Texas horseshoe bat pandemic.

3:02:54.480 --> 3:03:14.480
 And let's just say that people in Montana, in the same town where this Montana Institute of Virology is, start getting a version of this Texas horseshoe bat syndrome that is genetically relatively similar to the outbreak in Texas.

3:03:14.480 --> 3:03:17.480
 There are no horseshoe bats there.

3:03:17.480 --> 3:03:24.480
 And the government says, it's your same point, Alina's point about the unicorns, like nothing to see here.

3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:25.480
 Just move along.

3:03:25.480 --> 3:03:27.480
 You know, I would.

3:03:27.480 --> 3:03:28.480
 No, but what's the instead?

3:03:28.480 --> 3:03:32.480
 Joe Rogan and Brett Weinstein and Josh Rogan.

3:03:32.480 --> 3:03:36.480
 And I mean, would they say, oh, I guess, I mean, I just think that.

3:03:36.480 --> 3:03:40.480
 No, no, but the point is the government going to say it.

3:03:40.480 --> 3:03:44.480
 So Joe Rogan is a comedian.

3:03:44.480 --> 3:03:47.480
 Brett Weinstein is a podcaster.

3:03:47.480 --> 3:03:48.480
 Yeah.

3:03:48.480 --> 3:03:54.480
 The point is what we want is not just those folks to have the freedom to speak.

3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:55.480
 That's important.

3:03:55.480 --> 3:04:03.480
 But you want the government to have the transparent, like, like, I don't think Joe Rogan is enough to hold the government accountable.

3:04:03.480 --> 3:04:06.480
 I think they're going to do their thing anyway.

3:04:06.480 --> 3:04:08.480
 But I think that's our system.

3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:11.480
 And that was the genius of the founding fathers.

3:04:11.480 --> 3:04:12.480
 Was that enough?

3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:17.480
 They said that the government probably is going to have a lot of instincts to do the wrong thing.

3:04:17.480 --> 3:04:21.480
 That was the experience in England before.

3:04:21.480 --> 3:04:26.480
 And so that's why we have free speech to hold the government accountable.

3:04:26.480 --> 3:04:34.480
 I mean, I'm a kind of broadly a gun control person, but the people who say, well, we need to have broad gun rights.

3:04:34.480 --> 3:04:38.480
 As somebody who's now in Texas, I am offended.

3:04:38.480 --> 3:04:42.480
 But their argument is, look, we don't fully trust the government.

3:04:42.480 --> 3:04:50.480
 If the government, just like we fought against the British, if the government's wrong, we want to at least have some authority.

3:04:50.480 --> 3:04:53.480
 So that's our system is to have that kind of voice.

3:04:53.480 --> 3:04:57.480
 And that is the public voice actually balances.

3:04:57.480 --> 3:05:02.480
 Because every government, as you correctly said, every government has the same instincts.

3:05:02.480 --> 3:05:14.480
 And that's why we have, and it's imperfect here, but kind of these ideas of separation of powers of inalienable rights so that we can have, it's almost like a vast market where we can have balance.

3:05:14.480 --> 3:05:28.480
 So you think if the lab leak occurred in the United States, what probability would you put some kind of public report led by Rand Paul would come out saying this was a lab leak?

3:05:28.480 --> 3:05:31.480
 You have good confidence that that would happen?

3:05:31.480 --> 3:05:32.480
 That would be a decent comment.

3:05:32.480 --> 3:05:36.480
 And the reason I say I mentioned that I'm a, I think of myself.

3:05:36.480 --> 3:05:47.480
 I'm sure I'm not anymore as I get older, but as a progressive person, I'm a Democrat and I worked in Democratic administrations, worked for President Clinton on the National Security Council.

3:05:47.480 --> 3:05:59.480
 But my kind of best friend in the United States Senate, who I talk to all the time, is a senator from Kansas named Roger Marshall.

3:05:59.480 --> 3:06:08.480
 And Roger, I mean, if you just lined up our positions on all sorts of things, we're radically different.

3:06:08.480 --> 3:06:11.480
 But we have a great relationship.

3:06:11.480 --> 3:06:19.480
 We talk all the time and we share a commitment to saying, well, let's ask the tough questions about how this started.

3:06:19.480 --> 3:06:24.480
 And again, if we had, like what is the United States government?

3:06:24.480 --> 3:06:27.480
 Yeah, it's the executive branch, but there's also Congress.

3:06:27.480 --> 3:06:35.480
 You talk about Rand Paul and as a former executive branch worker when I was on the National Security Council.

3:06:35.480 --> 3:06:42.480
 And I guess technically when I was at the State Department, all of this stuff, all of this process, it just seems like a pain in the ass.

3:06:42.480 --> 3:06:46.480
 It's like these, you know, efforts, they're just attacking us.

3:06:46.480 --> 3:06:53.480
 We tried to do this thing with, we had all the best intentions and now they're holding hearings and they're trying to box us in and whatever.

3:06:53.480 --> 3:06:54.480
 But that's our process.

3:06:54.480 --> 3:07:00.480
 And there's like a form of accountability as chaotic, as crazy as it is.

3:07:00.480 --> 3:07:02.480
 And so it makes it really difficult.

3:07:02.480 --> 3:07:11.480
 I mean, we have other problems of just chaos and everybody doing their own thing, but it makes it difficult to have a kind of systematic cover up.

3:07:11.480 --> 3:07:22.480
 And again, all of that is predicated on my hypothesis, not fully proven, although I think likely that there is a lab incident origin of this pandemic.

3:07:22.480 --> 3:07:40.480
 Well, I mean, we're having like several layers of conversation, but I think whether a lab leak hypothesis is true or not, it does seem that the likelihood of a cover up if it leaked from a lab is high.

3:07:40.480 --> 3:07:44.480
 And that's the more important conversation to be having.

3:07:44.480 --> 3:07:53.480
 Well, you could argue a lot of things, but to me, arguably, that's the more important conversation is about what is the likelihood of a cover up?

3:07:53.480 --> 3:07:54.480
 100%.

3:07:54.480 --> 3:08:01.480
 Like in my mind, there is a legitimate debate about the origins of the pandemic.

3:08:01.480 --> 3:08:05.480
 There are people who I respect, who I don't necessarily agree with.

3:08:05.480 --> 3:08:15.480
 People like Stuart Neil, who's a virologist in the UK, who's been very open minded, engaged in productive debate about the origin.

3:08:15.480 --> 3:08:17.480
 And you know where I stand.

3:08:17.480 --> 3:08:24.480
 There is and can be no debate about whether or not there has been a cover up.

3:08:24.480 --> 3:08:25.480
 There has been a cover up.

3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:36.480
 There is, in my mind, no credible argument that there hasn't been a cover up and we can just see it in the regulations, in the lack of access.

3:08:36.480 --> 3:08:45.480
 There's an incredible woman named Zhang Zhang, who is a Chinese, we have to call her a citizen journalist because everything is controlled by the state.

3:08:45.480 --> 3:08:51.480
 But in the early days of the pandemic, she went to Wuhan, started taking videos and posting them.

3:08:51.480 --> 3:08:56.480
 She was imprisoned for picking quarrels, which is kind of a catchall.

3:08:56.480 --> 3:09:01.480
 And now she's engaged in a hunger strike and she's near death.

3:09:01.480 --> 3:09:16.480
 And so there's no question that there has been a cover up and there's no question in my mind that that cover up is responsible for a significant percentage of the total deaths due to COVID 19.

3:09:16.480 --> 3:09:18.480
 And a pivot.

3:09:18.480 --> 3:09:21.480
 Can I talk to you about sex?

3:09:21.480 --> 3:09:23.480
 Let's roll.

3:09:23.480 --> 3:09:29.480
 Okay, so you're the author of a book, Hacking Darwin.

3:09:29.480 --> 3:09:49.480
 So humans have used sex, allegedly, as I've read about, to make genetic information to produce offspring and sort of through that kind of process, adapt to their environment.

3:09:49.480 --> 3:09:55.480
 Lex, you mentioned earlier about you're asking tough questions and people pushing you to ask tough questions.

3:09:55.480 --> 3:09:56.480
 This is...

3:09:56.480 --> 3:09:57.480
 Is it okay if I just...

3:09:57.480 --> 3:10:00.480
 So you said have done this as I've read about.

3:10:00.480 --> 3:10:02.480
 As I've read about on the internet.

3:10:02.480 --> 3:10:03.480
 Yeah.

3:10:03.480 --> 3:10:13.480
 All I'm saying as a person sitting with you to people who would be open minded in experimenting of as I've read about to reality.

3:10:13.480 --> 3:10:19.480
 What I would say is Lex Friedman is handsome, charming.

3:10:19.480 --> 3:10:20.480
 He's...

3:10:20.480 --> 3:10:22.480
 I'm going to open a Tinder account and publish this one.

3:10:22.480 --> 3:10:23.480
 Really a great guy.

3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:24.480
 I'm sorry to interrupt.

3:10:24.480 --> 3:10:25.480
 Thank you.

3:10:25.480 --> 3:10:26.480
 I appreciate that.

3:10:26.480 --> 3:10:28.480
 Okay, so I was reading about this last night.

3:10:28.480 --> 3:10:32.480
 I was going to tweet it, but then I'm like, this is going to be misinterpreted.

3:10:32.480 --> 3:10:34.480
 But it's...

3:10:34.480 --> 3:10:39.480
 This is why I like podcasts because I can say stuff like this.

3:10:39.480 --> 3:10:52.480
 It's kind of incredible to me that the average human male produces like 500 billion plus sperm cells in their lifetime.

3:10:52.480 --> 3:10:57.480
 Each one of those are genetically unique.

3:10:57.480 --> 3:11:00.480
 They can produce unique humans.

3:11:00.480 --> 3:11:06.480
 500 billion, there's like 100 billion people who's ever lived.

3:11:06.480 --> 3:11:09.480
 Maybe like 110, whatever the number is.

3:11:09.480 --> 3:11:18.480
 So it's like five times the number of people who ever lived is produced by each male of genetic information.

3:11:18.480 --> 3:11:21.480
 So those are all possible trajectories of lives that could have lived.

3:11:21.480 --> 3:11:32.480
 Like those are all little people that could have been in like all the possible stories, all the Hitlers and Einstein's that could have been created and all that.

3:11:32.480 --> 3:11:40.480
 I mean, I don't know, this kind of you're painting this possible future and we get to see only one little string of that.

3:11:40.480 --> 3:12:04.480
 I mean, I suppose the magic of that is also captured by the, in the space of physics of having like multiple dimensions and the many worlds hypothesis of quantum mechanics that the interpretation that we're basically just at every point, there's an infinite offspring of universes that are created.

3:12:04.480 --> 3:12:11.480
 But I don't know that that's just like a magic of this game of genetics that we're playing.

3:12:11.480 --> 3:12:16.480
 And the winning sperm is not the fastest.

3:12:16.480 --> 3:12:20.480
 The winning sperm is basically the luckiest as the right timing.

3:12:20.480 --> 3:12:34.480
 So it's not, I also got into this whole, I started reading papers about like, is there something to be said about who wins the race, right, genetically.

3:12:34.480 --> 3:12:41.480
 So it's fascinating because there's studies and animals and so on to answer that question because it's interesting because like, because I'm a winner, right.

3:12:41.480 --> 3:12:43.480
 I won, I won a race.

3:12:43.480 --> 3:12:53.480
 And so you want to know like, what, what does that say about me in this, in this fascinating genetic race against, I think, what is it, 200, 200 million others, I think.

3:12:53.480 --> 3:13:02.480
 So one, you know, pool of sperm cells is about something like 200 million.

3:13:02.480 --> 3:13:07.480
 It could be, yes, some, but that millions, I thought it was much, much lower than that.

3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:13.480
 So like that, those are all brothers and sisters of mine.

3:13:13.480 --> 3:13:15.480
 And I beat them all out.

3:13:15.480 --> 3:13:16.480
 I won.

3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:24.480
 And so it's interesting to know there's a temptation to say I'm somehow better than them, right.

3:13:24.480 --> 3:13:32.480
 And now that goes into the next stage of something you're or deeply thinking about.

3:13:32.480 --> 3:13:49.480
 Which is if we have more control now over the winning genetic code that becomes offspring, if we have first not even control just information and then control.

3:13:49.480 --> 3:14:00.480
 What do you think that world looks like from a biological perspective and from an ethical perspective when we start getting more information and more control.

3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:02.480
 Yeah, great, great question.

3:14:02.480 --> 3:14:10.480
 So first on the sperm, there can be up to about 1.2 billion sperm cells in a male ejaculation.

3:14:10.480 --> 3:14:20.480
 So as I mentioned in Hacking Darwin, male sperm, it's kind of a dime a dozen with all the guys in all the world just doing whatever they do with it.

3:14:20.480 --> 3:14:30.480
 And it's an open question how competitive, I mean, there is an element of luck and there is an element of competition.

3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:39.480
 And it's an open question how much that competition impacts the outcome or whether it's just luck.

3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:44.480
 But my guess is there's some combination of fitness and luck.

3:14:44.480 --> 3:14:59.480
 But you're absolutely right that all of those other sperm cells in the ejaculation, if that's how the union of sperm and egg is happening, all of them represent a different future.

3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:11.480
 And there's a wonderful book called Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, and he even talks about a city as something like this where everybody, you have your life.

3:15:11.480 --> 3:15:23.480
 But then you have all these alternate lives, and every time you make any decision, you're kind of end so, but in this Invisible Cities, there's a little string that goes toward that alternate life.

3:15:23.480 --> 3:15:34.480
 And then the city becomes this weaving of all the strings of people's real lives and the alternate lives that they could have taken had they made any other different steps.

3:15:34.480 --> 3:15:43.480
 It's like a deep philosophical question, it's not just for us, it's baked into evolutionary biology.

3:15:43.480 --> 3:15:48.480
 It's just what are the different strategies for different species to achieve fitness.

3:15:48.480 --> 3:15:55.480
 And there are some of the different corals or other fish where they just kind of release the eggs into the water.

3:15:55.480 --> 3:15:58.480
 And there's all different kinds of ways.

3:15:58.480 --> 3:16:17.480
 And then you're right, in my book Hacking Darwin, and in the full titles Hacking Darwin, Genetic Engineering and the Future of Humanity, I kind of go deep into exploring the big picture implications of the future of human reproduction.

3:16:17.480 --> 3:16:27.480
 We are already participating in a revolutionary transformation, not just because of the diagnostics that we have, things like ultrasound.

3:16:27.480 --> 3:16:44.480
 But because now an increasing number of us are being born through in vitro fertilization, which means the eggs are extracted from the mother, they're fertilized by the father's sperm in vitro in a lab, and then re implanted in the mother.

3:16:44.480 --> 3:16:55.480
 On top of that, there's a somewhat newer but still now older technology called preimplantation genetic testing.

3:16:55.480 --> 3:17:05.480
 And so as everyone knows from high school biology, you have the fertilized egg, and then it goes one cell to two cells to four to eight and whatever.

3:17:05.480 --> 3:17:12.480
 And after around five days, in this PGT process, a few cells are extracted.

3:17:12.480 --> 3:17:16.480
 So let's say you have 10 fertilized eggs, early stage embryos.

3:17:16.480 --> 3:17:24.480
 A few cells are extracted from each, and those cells, if they would, the ones that are extracted, would end up becoming the placenta.

3:17:24.480 --> 3:17:30.480
 But every one of our cells has, other than a few, has our full genome.

3:17:30.480 --> 3:17:32.480
 And so then you sequence those cells.

3:17:32.480 --> 3:17:46.480
 And with preimplantation genetic testing now, what you can do is you can screen out deadly single gene mutation disorders, things that could be deadly or life ruining.

3:17:46.480 --> 3:17:59.480
 And so people use it to determine which of those 10 early stage embryos to implant in a mother as we shift towards a much greater understanding of genetics.

3:17:59.480 --> 3:18:03.480
 And that is part of just the broader genetics revolution.

3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:15.480
 But within that, in our transition from personalized to precision healthcare, more and more of us are going to have our whole genome sequenced because it's going to be the foundation of getting personalized healthcare.

3:18:15.480 --> 3:18:22.480
 We're going to have already millions, but very soon billions of people who've had their whole genome sequenced.

3:18:22.480 --> 3:18:29.480
 And then we'll have big databases of people's genetic, genotypic information and life or phenotypic information.

3:18:29.480 --> 3:18:41.480
 And using, coming into your area, our tools of machine learning and data analytics, we're going to be able to increasingly understand patterns of genetic expression, even though we're all different.

3:18:41.480 --> 3:18:44.480
 So predict how that genetic information will get expressed.

3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:49.480
 Never perfectly perhaps, but more and more, always more and more.

3:18:49.480 --> 3:19:03.480
 And so with that information, we aren't going to just be in the, even now, we aren't going to just be selecting based on which of these 10 early stage embryos is carrying a deadly genetic disorder.

3:19:03.480 --> 3:19:16.480
 But we can, we'll be able to know everything that can be partly or entirely predicted by genetics. And there's a lot of our humanity that fits into that category.

3:19:16.480 --> 3:19:23.480
 And certainly simple traits like height and eye color and things like that.

3:19:23.480 --> 3:19:30.480
 I mean, height is not at all simple, but if you have good nutrition, it's entirely or mostly genetic.

3:19:30.480 --> 3:19:41.480
 But even personality traits and personality styles, there are a lot of things that we see just as the experience, the beauty of life that are partly have a genetic foundation.

3:19:41.480 --> 3:19:53.480
 And so whatever part of these traits are definable and influenced by genetics, we're going to have greater and greater predictability within a range.

3:19:53.480 --> 3:20:01.480
 And so selecting those embryos will be informed by that kind of knowledge.

3:20:01.480 --> 3:20:10.480
 And that's why in Hacking Daru, when I talk about embryo selection as being a key driver of the future of human evolution.

3:20:10.480 --> 3:20:26.480
 But then on top of that, there is in 2012, Shania Yamanaka, a Japanese, amazing Japanese scientist, won the Nobel Prize for developing a process for creating what are called induced pluripotent stem cells, IPS cells.

3:20:26.480 --> 3:20:34.480
 And what IPS cells are is you can induce an adult cell to go back in evolutionary time and become a stem cell.

3:20:34.480 --> 3:20:43.480
 And a stem cell is like when we're a fertilized egg, like our entire blueprint is in that one cell, and that cell can be anything.

3:20:43.480 --> 3:20:51.480
 But then our cells start to specialize, and that's why we have skin cells and blood cells and all the different types of things.

3:20:51.480 --> 3:20:59.480
 So with the Yamanaka process, we can induce an adult cell to become a stem cell.

3:20:59.480 --> 3:21:04.480
 So the relevance to this story is what you can do, and it works now in animal models.

3:21:04.480 --> 3:21:10.480
 And as far as I know, it hasn't yet been done in humans, but it works pretty well in animal models.

3:21:10.480 --> 3:21:15.480
 You take any adult cell, but skin cells are probably the easiest.

3:21:15.480 --> 3:21:19.480
 You induce this skin cell into a stem cell.

3:21:19.480 --> 3:21:23.480
 And if you just take a little skin graft, it would have millions of cells.

3:21:23.480 --> 3:21:26.480
 So you induce those skin cells into stem cells.

3:21:26.480 --> 3:21:31.480
 Then you induce those stem cells into egg precursor cells.

3:21:31.480 --> 3:21:36.480
 Then you induce those egg precursor cells into eggs, egg cells.

3:21:36.480 --> 3:21:49.480
 Then because we have this massive overabundance of male sperm, then you could fertilize, let's call it 10,000 of the mother's eggs.

3:21:49.480 --> 3:21:52.480
 So you have 10,000 eggs which are fertilized.

3:21:52.480 --> 3:21:53.480
 Sounds like a party.

3:21:53.480 --> 3:22:02.480
 Yeah. Then you have an automated process for what I mentioned before in preimplantation genetic testing.

3:22:02.480 --> 3:22:04.480
 You grow them all for five days.

3:22:04.480 --> 3:22:06.480
 You extract a few cells from each.

3:22:06.480 --> 3:22:07.480
 You test them.

3:22:07.480 --> 3:22:14.480
 And that's why I had a piece in the New York Times a couple of years ago imagining what it would be like to go to a fertility clinic in the year 2050.

3:22:14.480 --> 3:22:15.480
 And the choice is not...

3:22:15.480 --> 3:22:16.480
 No humans involved.

3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:17.480
 Yeah.

3:22:17.480 --> 3:22:22.480
 Well, no, no, there are, but the choice is not, do you want a kid who does or doesn't have,

3:22:22.480 --> 3:22:25.480
 let's call it TaySax.

3:22:25.480 --> 3:22:35.480
 It's a whole range of possibilities, including very intimate traits like height, IQ, personality style.

3:22:35.480 --> 3:22:41.480
 It doesn't mean you can predict everything, but it means there will be increasing predictability.

3:22:41.480 --> 3:22:49.480
 So if you're choosing from 10,000 eggs, fertilized eggs, early stage embryos, that's a lot of choice.

3:22:49.480 --> 3:22:57.480
 And on top of that, then we have the new technology of human genome editing.

3:22:57.480 --> 3:22:59.480
 Many people have heard of CRISPR.

3:22:59.480 --> 3:23:11.480
 But what I say is if you think of human genome editing as a pie, human genome engineering as a pie, genome editing is a slice and CRISPR is just a sliver of that slice.

3:23:11.480 --> 3:23:16.480
 It's just one of our tools for genome editing and things are getting better and better.

3:23:16.480 --> 3:23:22.480
 Then you can go in and change, let's say, I mean, again, it starts simple.

3:23:22.480 --> 3:23:29.480
 A small number of genes, let's say you've selected from among the one of 10 or the one of 10,000.

3:23:29.480 --> 3:23:33.480
 But there are a number of changes that you would like to make to achieve some kind of outcome.

3:23:33.480 --> 3:23:38.480
 And biology is incredibly complex, and it's not that one gene does one thing.

3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:51.480
 One gene does probably a lot of things simultaneously, which is why the decision about changing one gene if it's causing deathly harm is easier than when we think about the complexity of biology.

3:23:51.480 --> 3:24:05.480
 But if the machine learning gets better and better predicting the full complexity of biology, so like as one gets better than your editing, your ability to reliably edit such that the conclusions are predictable gets better and better.

3:24:05.480 --> 3:24:07.480
 So those are two or a couple together.

3:24:07.480 --> 3:24:08.480
 Exactly.

3:24:08.480 --> 3:24:20.480
 And then so that's why, and people would say, well, that, I mean, I wrote about that in my two science fiction novels, Genesis Code and Eternal Sonata, years ago, especially with Genesis Code, I wrote about that.

3:24:20.480 --> 3:24:29.480
 And as a sci fi, and I had actually testified before Congress, but now 15 years ago saying, here's what the future looks like.

3:24:29.480 --> 3:24:38.480
 But even I, and in my first edition of Hacking Darwin, when it was already in production.

3:24:38.480 --> 3:24:57.480
 And then in November 2018, this scientist, Hu Zhongkui, announced in Hong Kong that the world's first two and later three crisper babies had been born, which he had genetically altered in and misguided in my view and dangerous view.

3:24:57.480 --> 3:25:06.480
 A dangerous goal of making it so they would have increased resistance to HIV.

3:25:06.480 --> 3:25:11.480
 And so I called my publisher, and I said, I've got good news and bad news.

3:25:11.480 --> 3:25:16.480
 I'll start with the bad news is that the world's first crisper babies have been born.

3:25:16.480 --> 3:25:28.480
 And so we need to pull my book out of production because you can't have a book on the future of human genetic engineering and have it not mentioned the first crisper babies that had been born.

3:25:28.480 --> 3:25:35.480
 But the good news is in the book, I had predicted that it's going to happen and it's going to happen in China.

3:25:35.480 --> 3:25:37.480
 And here's why.

3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:48.480
 And all we need to do is add a few more sentences in that was the hardback and then I updated it more in the paperback saying, and it happened and it was announced on this day.

3:25:48.480 --> 3:25:49.480
 Yeah.

3:25:49.480 --> 3:25:52.480
 Well, then let's fast forward.

3:25:52.480 --> 3:25:59.480
 Given your predictions are slowly becoming reality.

3:25:59.480 --> 3:26:03.480
 Let's talk about some philosophy and ethics, I suppose.

3:26:03.480 --> 3:26:17.480
 So I can, I'm not being too self deprecating here and saying if my parents had the choice, I would be probably less likely to come out the winner.

3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:26.480
 We're all weird and I'm certainly a very distinctly weird specimen of the human species.

3:26:26.480 --> 3:26:34.480
 I can give the full long list of flaws and we can be very poetic of saying like those are features and so on.

3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:36.480
 But they're not.

3:26:36.480 --> 3:26:39.480
 If you look at the menu.

3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:47.480
 Again, for these women who are listening, apropos of your thing, they're all kind of charming individualities.

3:26:47.480 --> 3:26:48.480
 Yeah, so it's beautiful.

3:26:48.480 --> 3:26:49.480
 That's one.

3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:50.480
 Yes, thank you.

3:26:50.480 --> 3:26:57.480
 Anyway, but on the full sort of individual, let's say IQ alone, right?

3:26:57.480 --> 3:27:13.480
 What do we do about a world where IQ could be selected on a menu when you're having children?

3:27:13.480 --> 3:27:15.480
 What concerns you about that world?

3:27:15.480 --> 3:27:19.480
 What excites you about that world?

3:27:19.480 --> 3:27:25.480
 Are there certain metrics that excite you more than others?

3:27:25.480 --> 3:27:31.480
 IQ has been a source of.

3:27:31.480 --> 3:27:32.480
 I don't know.

3:27:32.480 --> 3:27:48.480
 I'm not sure IQ as a measure flawed as it is has been used to celebrate the successes of the human species nearly as much as has been used to divide people to say negative things about people.

3:27:48.480 --> 3:27:53.480
 To make negative claims about people.

3:27:53.480 --> 3:28:07.480
 And in that same way, it seems like when there's a selection or genetic selection based on IQ, you can start now having classes of citizenry and like further divide.

3:28:07.480 --> 3:28:09.480
 The rich get richer.

3:28:09.480 --> 3:28:23.480
 You know, it'll be very rich people, they'll be able to do kind of fine selection of IQ and they will start forming these classes of super intelligent people.

3:28:23.480 --> 3:28:37.480
 And those super intelligent people in their minds would of course be the right people to be making global authoritarian decisions about everybody else, all the usual aspects of human nature, but now magnified with the new tools of technology.

3:28:37.480 --> 3:28:43.480
 Anyway, all that to say is what's exciting to you or what's concerning to you?

3:28:43.480 --> 3:28:45.480
 It's a great question.

3:28:45.480 --> 3:28:51.480
 And just stepping into the IQ, we'll call it a quagmire for now.

3:28:51.480 --> 3:28:56.480
 It raises a lot of big issues which are complicated.

3:28:56.480 --> 3:29:09.480
 Maybe you've listened to Sam Harris's interview with Charles Murray and then that spawned out kind of a whole industry of debate.

3:29:09.480 --> 3:29:23.480
 So first, just the background of IQ and it's from the early 20th century and there was the idea that we can measure people's general intelligence and there are so many different kinds of intelligence.

3:29:23.480 --> 3:29:26.480
 This was measuring a specific thing.

3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:33.480
 So my feeling is that IQ is not a perfect measure of intelligence, but it's a perfect measure of IQ.

3:29:33.480 --> 3:29:43.480
 Like it's measuring what it's measuring, but that thing correlates to a lot of things which are rewarded in our society.

3:29:43.480 --> 3:29:53.480
 So every study of IQ has shown that people with higher IQs, they make more money, they live longer, they have more stable relationships.

3:29:53.480 --> 3:30:06.480
 That could be something in the testing, but as Sam Harris has talked about a lot, you could line up all of these kind of IQ and IQ like tests correlate with each other.

3:30:06.480 --> 3:30:18.480
 So the people who score high on one score high on all of them and people think that IQ tests are like a thing like the Earl of Dorchester is coming for dinner.

3:30:18.480 --> 3:30:22.480
 Does he have two forks or three forks or something like that?

3:30:22.480 --> 3:30:23.480
 It's not that.

3:30:23.480 --> 3:30:35.480
 A lot of them are things that I think a lot of us would recognize are relevant, just like how much stuff can you memorize if you see some shapes, how can you position them and things like that.

3:30:35.480 --> 3:30:46.480
 And so IQ, I mean, it really hit its stride and certainly in the Second World War when our governments were processing a lot of people and trying to figure out who to put in what jobs.

3:30:46.480 --> 3:30:48.480
 So that's the starting point.

3:30:48.480 --> 3:31:01.480
 Let me start first with the negatives that our societies, when we talk about diversity in Darwinian terms, it's not like diversity is from Darwinian terms.

3:31:01.480 --> 3:31:09.480
 Oh, wouldn't it be nice if we have some moths of different colors because it'll be really fun to have different colored moths?

3:31:09.480 --> 3:31:15.480
 Diversity is the sole survival strategy of our species and of every species.

3:31:15.480 --> 3:31:22.480
 And it's impossible to predict what diversity is going to be rewarded.

3:31:22.480 --> 3:31:31.480
 And I've said this before, if you went down and you had, if you spoke T. rex and you spoke to the dinosaurs and said, hey, you can select your kids.

3:31:31.480 --> 3:31:33.480
 What criteria do you want?

3:31:33.480 --> 3:31:41.480
 And they say, oh yeah, sharp teeth, cruel fangs, roar, whatever it is that makes you a great T. rex.

3:31:41.480 --> 3:31:58.480
 But the answer from an evolutionary perspective, from an Earth perspective was always much better to be like a cockroach or an alligator or some little nothing or a little shrew because the dinosaurs are going to get wiped out when the asteroid hits.

3:31:58.480 --> 3:32:01.480
 And so there's no better or worse in evolution.

3:32:01.480 --> 3:32:05.480
 There's just better or worse suited for a given environment.

3:32:05.480 --> 3:32:13.480
 And when that environment changes, the best suited person from the old system could be the worst suited person for the new one.

3:32:13.480 --> 3:32:24.480
 So if we start selecting for the things that we value the most, including things like IQ, but even disease resistance.

3:32:24.480 --> 3:32:43.480
 I mean, this is well known, but if people who are recessive carrier of sickle cell disease have increased resistance to malaria, which is the biggest reason why that trait hasn't just disappeared, given how deadly sickle cell disease is.

3:32:43.480 --> 3:32:45.480
 Biology is incredibly complex.

3:32:45.480 --> 3:32:53.480
 We understand such a tiny percentage of it that we need to have, in your words, just a level of humility.

3:32:53.480 --> 3:32:56.480
 There are huge equity issues as you've articulated.

3:32:56.480 --> 3:33:04.480
 Let's just say that it is the case that in our society IQ and IQ like traits are highly rewarded.

3:33:04.480 --> 3:33:07.480
 There isn't an equity issue, but it works in both ways.

3:33:07.480 --> 3:33:18.480
 Because my guess is let's just say that we had a society where we were doing genome sequencing of everybody who was born and we had some predictive model to predict IQ.

3:33:18.480 --> 3:33:24.480
 And we had decided as a society that IQ was going to be what we were going to select for.

3:33:24.480 --> 3:33:28.480
 We were going to put the highest IQ people in these different roles.

3:33:28.480 --> 3:33:35.480
 I guarantee you the people in those roles would not be the people who are legacy admissions to Harvard.

3:33:35.480 --> 3:33:49.480
 They would very likely be people who are born in slums, people who are born with no opportunity or in refugee camps who are just wasting away because we've thrown them away.

3:33:49.480 --> 3:34:02.480
 It's the idea of just being able to look under the hood of our humanity is really scary for everybody and it should be.

3:34:02.480 --> 3:34:05.480
 I'm also an Ashkenazi Jew.

3:34:05.480 --> 3:34:07.480
 My father was born in Austria.

3:34:07.480 --> 3:34:12.480
 My father and grandparents came here as refugees after the war.

3:34:12.480 --> 3:34:14.480
 Most of that side of the family was killed.

3:34:14.480 --> 3:34:25.480
 So I get what it means to be on the other side of the story when someone said, well, here's what's good and you're not good.

3:34:25.480 --> 3:34:28.480
 So I totally get that.

3:34:28.480 --> 3:34:37.480
 Having said that, I do believe that we're moving toward a new way of procreating.

3:34:37.480 --> 3:34:44.480
 And we're going to have to decide what are the values that we would like to realize through that process.

3:34:44.480 --> 3:34:53.480
 Is it randomness, which is what we currently have now, which is not totally random because we have a sort of mating through colleges and other things.

3:34:53.480 --> 3:34:58.480
 When mating through what? Colleges?

3:34:58.480 --> 3:35:07.480
 If you go to Harvard or wherever and your wife also goes to Harvard, it's like a location based mating.

3:35:07.480 --> 3:35:09.480
 Well, it's not location, it's selection.

3:35:09.480 --> 3:35:16.480
 It's like there are selections that are made about who gets to a certain place and when it's like Harvard admissions is a filter.

3:35:16.480 --> 3:35:24.480
 So we're going to have to decide what are the values that we want to realize through this process because diversity, it's just baked into our biology.

3:35:24.480 --> 3:35:33.480
 We're the first species ever that has the opportunity to make choices about things that were otherwise baked into our biology.

3:35:33.480 --> 3:35:44.480
 And there's a real danger that if we make bad choices, even with good intentions, it could even drive us toward extinction and certainly undermine our humanity.

3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:52.480
 And that's why I always say, and like I said, I'm deeply involved with WHO and other things, that these aren't conversations about science.

3:35:52.480 --> 3:35:57.480
 Science brings us to the conversation, but the conversation is about values and ethics.

3:35:57.480 --> 3:36:04.480
 As you described, that world is wide open. It's not even a subtly different world.

3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:18.480
 That world is fundamentally different from anything we understand about life on earth because natural selection, this random process is so fundamental how we think about life.

3:36:18.480 --> 3:36:32.480
 Being able to program, I mean, it has a chance to, I mean, it'll probably make my question about the ethical concerns around IQ based selection just meaningless.

3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:37.480
 Because it'll change the nature of identity.

3:36:37.480 --> 3:36:48.480
 Like it's possible it will dissolve identity because we take so much pride in all the different characteristics that make us who we are.

3:36:48.480 --> 3:36:54.480
 Whenever you have some control over those characteristics, those characteristics start losing meaning.

3:36:54.480 --> 3:37:07.480
 And what may start gaining meaning is the ideas inside our heads, for example, versus like the details of like, is it a Commodore 64?

3:37:07.480 --> 3:37:13.480
 Is it a PC? Is it a Mac? It's going to be less important than the software that runs on it.

3:37:13.480 --> 3:37:19.480
 So we can more and more be operating in the digital space and the identity could be something that borrows multiple bodies.

3:37:19.480 --> 3:37:27.480
 Like the legacy of our ideas may become more important than the details of our physical embodiment.

3:37:27.480 --> 3:37:43.480
 I mean, I'm saying perhaps ridiculous sounding things, but the point is it will bring up so many new ethical concerns that are narrow minded thinking about the current ethical concerns will not apply.

3:37:43.480 --> 3:37:48.480
 But it's important to think about all this kind of stuff like actively.

3:37:48.480 --> 3:37:51.480
 What are the right conversations to be having now?

3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:59.480
 Because it feels like it's an ongoing conversation that then continually evolves like with an NIH involved.

3:37:59.480 --> 3:38:06.480
 Like do you do experiments with animals? Do you build these brain organoids?

3:38:06.480 --> 3:38:15.480
 Like through that process you describe with the stem cells, like do you experiment with a bunch of organisms to see how genetic material,

3:38:15.480 --> 3:38:20.480
 what form that actually takes, how to minimize the chance of cancer and all those kinds of things.

3:38:20.480 --> 3:38:24.480
 What are the negative consequences of that? What are the positive consequences?

3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:28.480
 Yeah, it's a fascinating world. It's a really fascinating world.

3:38:28.480 --> 3:38:31.480
 Yeah, but those conversations are just so essential.

3:38:31.480 --> 3:38:36.480
 Like we have to be talking about ethics and then that raises the question of who is the we?

3:38:36.480 --> 3:38:41.480
 And coming back to your conversation about science communication,

3:38:41.480 --> 3:38:52.480
 maybe there was a time earlier when these conversations were held among a small number of experts who made decisions on behalf of everybody else.

3:38:52.480 --> 3:38:56.480
 But what we're talking about here is really the future of our species.

3:38:56.480 --> 3:39:04.480
 And I think that conversation is too important to be left just to experts and government officials.

3:39:04.480 --> 3:39:12.480
 So I mentioned that I'm a member, we just ended our work after two years of the World Health Organization Expert Advisory Committee on Human Genome Editing.

3:39:12.480 --> 3:39:22.480
 And my big push in that process was to have education, engagement and empowerment of the broad public to bring,

3:39:22.480 --> 3:39:28.480
 not just bring people into the conversation with the tools to be able to engage,

3:39:28.480 --> 3:39:31.480
 but also into the decision making process.

3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:36.480
 And that's, it's a real shift and there are countries that are doing it better than others.

3:39:36.480 --> 3:39:40.480
 I mean, Denmark is obviously a much smaller country than the United States,

3:39:40.480 --> 3:39:48.480
 but they have a really well developed infrastructure for public engagement around really complicated scientific issues.

3:39:48.480 --> 3:39:54.480
 And I just think that we have to, like it's great that we have Twitter and all these other things.

3:39:54.480 --> 3:40:02.480
 But we need structured conversations where we can really bring people together and listen to each other,

3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:05.480
 which feels like it's harder than ever.

3:40:05.480 --> 3:40:10.480
 But even now in this process where all these people are shouting at each other,

3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:14.480
 at least there are a bunch of people who are in the conversation.

3:40:14.480 --> 3:40:20.480
 So we have a foundation, but we just really need to do more work.

3:40:20.480 --> 3:40:26.480
 And again and again and again, it's about ethics and values because we're at an age,

3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:31.480
 and this has become a cliche of exponential technological change.

3:40:31.480 --> 3:40:36.480
 And so the rate of change is faster going forward than it has been in the past.

3:40:36.480 --> 3:40:43.480
 So in our minds, we under appreciate how quickly things are changing and will change.

3:40:43.480 --> 3:40:48.480
 And if we're not careful, if we don't know who we are and what our values are,

3:40:48.480 --> 3:40:51.480
 we're going to get lost and we don't have to know technology.

3:40:51.480 --> 3:40:53.480
 We have to know who we are.

3:40:53.480 --> 3:40:58.480
 Our values are hard won over thousands of years.

3:40:58.480 --> 3:41:04.480
 No matter how new the technology is, we shouldn't and can't jettison our values

3:41:04.480 --> 3:41:07.480
 because that is our primary navigational tool.

3:41:07.480 --> 3:41:17.480
 Absurd question because we were saying that sexual reproduction is not the best way to define the offspring.

3:41:17.480 --> 3:41:20.480
 You think there'll be a day when humans stop having sex?

3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:25.480
 I don't think we'll stop having sex because it's so enjoyable.

3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:30.480
 But we may significantly stop having sex for reproduction.

3:41:30.480 --> 3:41:34.480
 Even today, most human sex is not for making babies.

3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:40.480
 It's for other things, whether it's pleasure or love or pair bonding or whatever.

3:41:40.480 --> 3:41:41.480
 Intimacy.

3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:42.480
 Intimacy.

3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:44.480
 Some people do it for intimacy.

3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:46.480
 Some people do it for pleasure with strangers.

3:41:46.480 --> 3:41:54.480
 I feel like the people that do it for pleasure, I feel like there will be better ways to achieve that same chemical pleasure.

3:41:54.480 --> 3:41:57.480
 There's just so many different kinds of people.

3:41:57.480 --> 3:42:04.480
 I just saw this on television, but there are people who put on those big bunny outfits and go and have sex with other people.

3:42:04.480 --> 3:42:08.480
 There's just an unlimited number of different kinds of people.

3:42:08.480 --> 3:42:10.480
 I remember hearing about this.

3:42:10.480 --> 3:42:15.480
 I think Dan Savage is a podcast.

3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:17.480
 I think they're called Furries.

3:42:17.480 --> 3:42:18.480
 Furries.

3:42:18.480 --> 3:42:19.480
 Furry parties.

3:42:19.480 --> 3:42:20.480
 Exactly.

3:42:20.480 --> 3:42:23.480
 I love people.

3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:25.480
 That's the thing.

3:42:25.480 --> 3:42:28.480
 Whenever you hear these words, it's like humans.

3:42:28.480 --> 3:42:30.480
 What will they think of next?

3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:43.480
 I do think, and I write about this in hacking Darwin, that as people come to believe that making children through the application of science

3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:54.480
 is safer and more beneficial than having children through sex, we'll start to see a shift over time toward reproduction through science.

3:42:54.480 --> 3:43:00.480
 We'll still have sex for all the same great reasons that we do it now.

3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:04.480
 It's just reproduction less and less through the act of sex.

3:43:04.480 --> 3:43:08.480
 Man, it's such a fascinating future.

3:43:08.480 --> 3:43:16.480
 As somebody I value flaws, I think it's the goodwill hunting.

3:43:16.480 --> 3:43:18.480
 That's the good stuff.

3:43:18.480 --> 3:43:25.480
 The flaws, the weird quirks of humans, that's what makes us who we are, the weird.

3:43:25.480 --> 3:43:27.480
 The weird is the beautiful.

3:43:27.480 --> 3:43:32.480
 There's a fear of optimization that I...

3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:33.480
 You should have it.

3:43:33.480 --> 3:43:35.480
 I mean, it's very healthy.

3:43:35.480 --> 3:43:51.480
 I think that's the danger of all of this selection is that we make selections just based on social norms that are so deeply internal that they feel like they're eternal truths.

3:43:51.480 --> 3:43:54.480
 We talked about selecting for IQ.

3:43:54.480 --> 3:43:56.480
 What about selecting for a kind heart?

3:43:56.480 --> 3:44:05.480
 There are lots of people who talked about Hitler and Mein Kampf Hitler had certainly had a high IQ and I guess is higher than average IQ.

3:44:05.480 --> 3:44:13.480
 That's why I was saying before, diversity is baked into our biology.

3:44:13.480 --> 3:44:30.480
 The key lesson, and I've said this many times before, the key lesson of this moment in our history is that after nearly 4 billion years of evolution, our one species suddenly has the unique and increasing ability to read, write, and hack the code of life.

3:44:30.480 --> 3:44:49.480
 So as we apply these godlike powers that we've now assumed for ourselves, we better be pretty careful because it's so easy to make mistakes, particularly mistakes that are guided by our best intentions.

3:44:49.480 --> 3:45:00.480
 To jump briefly back on the lab leak, and I swear there's a reason for that, what did you think about the John Stuart this moment?

3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:13.480
 I forget when it was, maybe a few months ago in the summer, I think of 2021, where he went on Colbert Report, or not the Colbert Report, sorry, the Stephen Colbert's whatever his show is.

3:45:13.480 --> 3:45:21.480
 Again, John Stuart reminded us how valuable his wit and brilliance within the humor was for our culture.

3:45:21.480 --> 3:45:32.480
 And so he did this whole bit that highlighted the common sense nature about what was the metaphor he used about the Hershey factory in Pennsylvania.

3:45:32.480 --> 3:45:34.480
 So what did you think about that whole bit?

3:45:34.480 --> 3:45:46.480
 I loved it. And so not to be overly self referential, but it's hard not to be overly self referential when you're doing whatever, however long we are, five hour interview about yourself.

3:45:46.480 --> 3:45:55.480
 Which he reminds like when you had Brett Weinstein on, he said, I have no ego, but these 57 people have screwed me over.

3:45:55.480 --> 3:46:08.480
 It's hard. I am a person I will confess, it's enjoyable. Some people feel different. I kind of like talking about all this stuff and talking, period.

3:46:08.480 --> 3:46:16.480
 So for me, in the earliest, I remember those early days of when the pandemic started, I was just sitting down, it was late January or early February, 2020.

3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:26.480
 And I just was laying out all of the evidence that I could collect, trying to say, make sense of where does this come from?

3:46:26.480 --> 3:46:38.480
 And it was just logic. It was all of the things that John Stuart said, which in some overly wordy form were all at that time on my website.

3:46:38.480 --> 3:46:48.480
 Like, what are the odds of having this outbreak of a bad coronavirus more than a thousand miles away from where these bats have their natural habitat?

3:46:48.480 --> 3:47:01.480
 Where they have the largest collection of these bat coronaviruses in the world, and they're doing all these very aggressive research projects to make them more aggressive.

3:47:01.480 --> 3:47:08.480
 And then you have the outbreak of a virus that's primed for human to human transmission.

3:47:08.480 --> 3:47:16.480
 It was just logic was my first step, and I kept gathering the information.

3:47:16.480 --> 3:47:22.480
 But John Stuart distilled that in a way that just everybody got.

3:47:22.480 --> 3:47:37.480
 And I think that, like, I loved it. And I just think that there's a way of reaching people. It's the reason why I write science fiction in addition to thinking and writing about the science is that we kind of have to reach people where they are.

3:47:37.480 --> 3:48:00.480
 And I just thought it was just, there was a lot of depth, I thought, and maybe that's too self serving, but like in the analysis, but he captured that into the, into those things about, it's like the, whatever, the chewy, the outbreak of chewy goodness near the Hershey factory.

3:48:00.480 --> 3:48:01.480
 I wonder where that came from.

3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:15.480
 Yeah, there's the humor, there's metaphor. Also, the, like sticking with the joke when the audience is in the audience and Stephen Colbert, he was like resisting it.

3:48:15.480 --> 3:48:21.480
 He was very uncomfortable with it. Maybe that was part of the bit. I'm not sure, but it didn't look like it.

3:48:21.480 --> 3:48:32.480
 So Stephen, in that moment, kind of represented the discomfort of the scientific community. I think it's kind of interesting, that whole dynamic. And I think that was a pivotal moment.

3:48:32.480 --> 3:49:00.480
 That just kind of highlights the value of comedy, the value of, like when Joe Rogan says, I'm just a comedian. I mean, that's such a funny thing to say. It's like saying, I'm just a podcaster or I'm just a writer. I'm just a, you know, that ability in so few words to express what everybody else is thinking.

3:49:00.480 --> 3:49:10.480
 It's so refreshing. And I wish the scientific communicators would do that too. A little humor, a little humor. I mean, that's why I love Elon Musk very much.

3:49:10.480 --> 3:49:24.480
 So like the way he communicates is like, it's so refreshing for a CEO of a major company, several major companies, to just have a sense of humor and say ridiculous shit every once in a while.

3:49:24.480 --> 3:49:33.480
 That's so, there's something to that. Like it shakes up the whole conversation to where it gives you freedom to like think publicly.

3:49:33.480 --> 3:49:42.480
 If you're always trying to say the proper thing, you lose the freedom to think, to reason out, to be authentic and genuine.

3:49:42.480 --> 3:49:55.480
 When you allow yourself the freedom to regularly say stupid shit, have fun, make fun of yourself, I think you give yourself freedom to really be a great scientist.

3:49:55.480 --> 3:50:00.480
 Honestly, I think scientists have a lot to learn from comedians.

3:50:00.480 --> 3:50:07.480
 Well, for sure. I think we all do about just distilling and communicating in ways that people can hear.

3:50:07.480 --> 3:50:14.480
 And a lot of us say things and people just can't hear them either because of the way we're saying them or where they are.

3:50:14.480 --> 3:50:20.480
 And like I said before, I'm a big fan of Joe Rogan. I've been on his show twice.

3:50:20.480 --> 3:50:36.480
 And whatever it would, Francis Collins was in his conversation with you, he said, which I think makes sense, is that when somebody has that kind of platform and people rightly or wrongly who follow them and look to them for guidance,

3:50:36.480 --> 3:50:46.480
 I do think that there is some responsibility for people in those roles to make whatever judgment that they make and to share that.

3:50:46.480 --> 3:50:54.480
 And as I mentioned to you when we were off mic, Sanjay Gupta is a very close friend of mine. We've been friends for many years.

3:50:54.480 --> 3:51:01.480
 And I fully supported Sanjay's instinct to go on the Joe Rogan show.

3:51:01.480 --> 3:51:11.480
 I thought it was great. At the end of that whole conversation, Joe said, well, I'm just a comedian. What do I know?

3:51:11.480 --> 3:51:19.480
 And I just felt that, yes, Joe Rogan is a comedian. I wouldn't say just a comedian among other things.

3:51:19.480 --> 3:51:34.480
 But I also felt that he had a responsibility for just saying whatever he believed, even if he believed or believes, as I think is the case, that Ivermectin should be studied more, which I certainly agree.

3:51:34.480 --> 3:51:42.480
 And that healthy people shouldn't get vaccinated, healthy young people, which I don't agree.

3:51:42.480 --> 3:51:47.480
 I just felt at the end of that conversation to say, well, I'm just a comedian. What do I know?

3:51:47.480 --> 3:51:55.480
 I feel like it didn't fully integrate the power that a person like Joe Rogan has to set the agenda.

3:51:55.480 --> 3:52:02.480
 So I think the reason he says I'm just a comedian is the same reason I say I'm an idiot, which I truly believe.

3:52:02.480 --> 3:52:21.480
 I could explain exactly what I mean by that, but it's more for him or in this case for me to just keep yourself humble. Because I think it's a slippery slope when you think you have a responsibility to then think you actually have an authority.

3:52:21.480 --> 3:52:30.480
 Because a lot of people listen to you, you think you have an authority to actually speak to those people and you have enough authority to know what the hell you're talking about.

3:52:30.480 --> 3:52:38.480
 And I think there's just the humility to just kind of make it fun of yourself that's extremely valuable and saying I'm just a comedian.

3:52:38.480 --> 3:52:48.480
 And I think it's a reminder to himself that, you know, he's often full of shit, so are all of us.

3:52:48.480 --> 3:52:53.480
 And so that's a really powerful way for himself to keep himself humble.

3:52:53.480 --> 3:53:02.480
 I mean, I think that's really useful to in some kind of way for people in general to make fun of themselves a little bit in whatever way that means.

3:53:02.480 --> 3:53:05.480
 And saying I'm just a comedian is just one way to do that.

3:53:05.480 --> 3:53:13.480
 Now that couple that with the responsibility of doing the research and really having an open mind and all those kinds of stuff.

3:53:13.480 --> 3:53:18.480
 I think that's something that Joe does really well on a lot of topics, but he can't do that and everything.

3:53:18.480 --> 3:53:26.480
 And so it's up to the people to decide how well he does it on certain topics and not others.

3:53:26.480 --> 3:53:29.480
 But how do you think Sanjay did in that conversation?

3:53:29.480 --> 3:53:35.480
 So I know I'm going to get myself into trouble here because Sanjay is a very close friend.

3:53:35.480 --> 3:53:41.480
 Joe, my personal interaction with him has been our two interviews, but it's like my interview with now.

3:53:41.480 --> 3:53:49.480
 If you sit down with somebody for four hours, it's a lot and great and then private communication.

3:53:49.480 --> 3:53:58.480
 So I am personally more sympathetic to the arguments that Sanjay was making or trying to make.

3:53:58.480 --> 3:54:04.480
 I believe that the threat of the virus is greater than the threat of the vaccine.

3:54:04.480 --> 3:54:13.480
 That doesn't mean that we can guarantee 100% safety for the vaccine, but these are really well tolerated vaccines.

3:54:13.480 --> 3:54:20.480
 And we know for all the reasons we've been talking about, this is a really scary virus and particularly the mRNA vaccines.

3:54:20.480 --> 3:54:29.480
 What they're basically doing is getting your body to replicate a tiny little piece of the virus, the spike protein, and then your body responds to that.

3:54:29.480 --> 3:54:37.480
 And so that's a much less of an insult to your body than being infected by the virus.

3:54:37.480 --> 3:54:47.480
 So I'm more sympathetic to the people who say, well, everybody should get vaccinated, but people who've already been infected,

3:54:47.480 --> 3:54:52.480
 we should study whether they need to be vaccinated or not.

3:54:52.480 --> 3:55:00.480
 Having said all of that, I felt that Joe Rogan won the debate.

3:55:00.480 --> 3:55:08.480
 And the reason that I felt that he won the debate was they had two different categories of arguments.

3:55:08.480 --> 3:55:16.480
 So Sanjay, what he was trying to do, which I totally respect, was saying there's so much animosity on these different sides.

3:55:16.480 --> 3:55:25.480
 And let's lower the temperature, let's model that we can have a respectful dialogue with each other where we can actually listen.

3:55:25.480 --> 3:55:34.480
 And Sanjay, again, I've known him for many years, he's a very empathic, humble, just an all around wonderful human being.

3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:36.480
 And I really love him.

3:55:36.480 --> 3:55:41.480
 And so he was making cases that were based on kind of averages, studies and things like that.

3:55:41.480 --> 3:55:48.480
 And Joe was saying, well, I know a guy whose sister's cousin had this experience.

3:55:48.480 --> 3:55:56.480
 And I'm sure that it's all true in the sense that we have millions of people who are getting vaccinated and different things.

3:55:56.480 --> 3:56:01.480
 And what Sanjay should have said was, I know that's anecdote.

3:56:01.480 --> 3:56:11.480
 Here's another anecdote of like when Francis Collins was with you and he talked about the world wrestling guy who was like 6x6 and a big, muscly guy.

3:56:11.480 --> 3:56:15.480
 And then he got COVID and he was anti vax and then he got COVID and almost died.

3:56:15.480 --> 3:56:16.480
 And he said, I'm going to...

3:56:16.480 --> 3:56:18.480
 By the way, I don't know if you know this part.

3:56:18.480 --> 3:56:19.480
 No.

3:56:19.480 --> 3:56:21.480
 This is funny. Joe's going to listen to this.

3:56:21.480 --> 3:56:22.480
 He's going to be laughing.

3:56:22.480 --> 3:56:28.480
 Does Joe listen to the four hours of this in addition to the three hours of his interviews every day?

3:56:28.480 --> 3:56:32.480
 Well, not every day, but he listens to a lot of these and we talk about it.

3:56:32.480 --> 3:56:33.480
 We argue about it.

3:56:33.480 --> 3:56:34.480
 Hi, Joe.

3:56:34.480 --> 3:56:35.480
 Hey, Joe.

3:56:35.480 --> 3:56:37.480
 We love you, Joe.

3:56:37.480 --> 3:56:45.480
 So that particular case, I don't know why Francis said what he said there, but that's not accurate.

3:56:45.480 --> 3:56:46.480
 Oh, really?

3:56:46.480 --> 3:56:49.480
 So the wrestler never...

3:56:49.480 --> 3:56:51.480
 He didn't almost die.

3:56:51.480 --> 3:56:53.480
 It was no big deal at all for him.

3:56:53.480 --> 3:56:54.480
 And he said that to him.

3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:59.480
 I think I'm not sure... I think something got mixed up in Francis's memory.

3:56:59.480 --> 3:57:02.480
 There was another case he must have been like...

3:57:02.480 --> 3:57:07.480
 Because I don't imagine he would bring that case up and just make it up.

3:57:07.480 --> 3:57:09.480
 Because it's like, why?

3:57:09.480 --> 3:57:11.480
 But that was not at all...

3:57:11.480 --> 3:57:13.480
 That was a pretty public case.

3:57:13.480 --> 3:57:15.480
 He had an interview with him.

3:57:15.480 --> 3:57:17.480
 That wrestler, he was just fine.

3:57:17.480 --> 3:57:19.480
 So that anecdotal case...

3:57:19.480 --> 3:57:21.480
 I mean, Francis should not have done that.

3:57:21.480 --> 3:57:25.480
 So I have a bunch of criticism of how that went.

3:57:25.480 --> 3:57:35.480
 People who criticize that interview, I feel like don't give enough respect to the full range of things that Francis Collins has done in his career.

3:57:35.480 --> 3:57:37.480
 He's an incredible scientist.

3:57:37.480 --> 3:57:39.480
 And I also think a really good human being.

3:57:39.480 --> 3:57:44.480
 But yes, that conversation was flawed in many ways.

3:57:44.480 --> 3:57:53.480
 And one of them was why when you're trying to present some kind of critical...

3:57:53.480 --> 3:57:58.480
 Like criticize Joe Rogan, why bring up anecdotal evidence at all?

3:57:58.480 --> 3:58:03.480
 And if you do bring up anecdotal evidence, which is not scientific.

3:58:03.480 --> 3:58:06.480
 If you're a scientist, you should not be using anecdotal evidence.

3:58:06.480 --> 3:58:10.480
 If you do bring it up, why bring up one that's not...

3:58:10.480 --> 3:58:12.480
 That's first not true.

3:58:12.480 --> 3:58:13.480
 And you know it's not true.

3:58:13.480 --> 3:58:16.480
 So I know that pretend...

3:58:16.480 --> 3:58:18.480
 So you don't know it's not true.

3:58:18.480 --> 3:58:22.480
 So yes, that would find another case where...

3:58:22.480 --> 3:58:33.480
 So the basic thing in coming back to Sanjay and Joe's conversation was that Sanjay was trying to use statistical evidence and Joe was using anecdotal evidence.

3:58:33.480 --> 3:58:42.480
 And so I think that for Sanjay, and there are all kinds of things where there are debates where often the person who's better at debating wins...

3:58:42.480 --> 3:58:46.480
 Wins the debate regardless of the topic.

3:58:46.480 --> 3:58:55.480
 So I think what Sanjay could have done, and Sanjay is such a smart guy, is to say, well, that's an anecdote.

3:58:55.480 --> 3:58:59.480
 Here's another anecdote, and there are lots of different anecdotes.

3:58:59.480 --> 3:59:07.480
 And there certainly are people who have taken the vaccine and have had problems that could reasonably be traced to the vaccines.

3:59:07.480 --> 3:59:19.480
 And there are certainly lots of people, I would argue, more people who've not had the vaccine, but who've gotten COVID and have either died or our hospitals are now full of people who weren't vaccinated.

3:59:19.480 --> 3:59:25.480
 In many ways, I mean, our emergency rooms are full of unvaccinated people here in the United States.

3:59:25.480 --> 3:59:36.480
 So I think what Sanjay could have done, but there was a conflict between wanting to kind of win the debate and wanting to take the temperature down.

3:59:36.480 --> 3:59:40.480
 And what he could have done is to say, well, here's an anecdote.

3:59:40.480 --> 3:59:43.480
 I have a counter anecdote, and we can go on all day.

3:59:43.480 --> 3:59:45.480
 But here's what the statistics show.

3:59:45.480 --> 3:59:48.480
 And I think that was the things.

3:59:48.480 --> 3:59:50.480
 I think it's a healthy conversation.

3:59:50.480 --> 3:59:54.480
 There are a lot of people who are afraid of the vaccine.

3:59:54.480 --> 3:59:59.480
 There are a lot of people who don't trust the scientific establishment, and lots of them have good reason.

3:59:59.480 --> 4:00:14.480
 I mean, it's not just people think of like Trump Republicans, there are lots of people in the African American community who've had a historical, terrible experience with the Tuskegee and all sorts of things.

4:00:14.480 --> 4:00:17.480
 So they don't trust the messages that were being delivered up.

4:00:17.480 --> 4:00:25.480
 I live in New York City, and we had a piece in the New York Times where in the earliest days of the vaccines, there was this big movement.

4:00:25.480 --> 4:00:37.480
 Let's make sure that the poorest people in the city have first access to the vaccines because they're the ones, they have higher density in their homes, they're relying on public transport.

4:00:37.480 --> 4:00:39.480
 So there's this whole liberal effort.

4:00:39.480 --> 4:00:46.480
 And then in the black community in New York, according to the New York Times, there was very low acceptance of the vaccines.

4:00:46.480 --> 4:00:54.480
 And they interviewed people in that article, and they said, well, if the white people want us to have it first, there must be something wrong with it.

4:00:54.480 --> 4:00:56.480
 They must be doing something.

4:00:56.480 --> 4:00:59.480
 And so we have to listen to each other.

4:00:59.480 --> 4:01:04.480
 Like I would never, I mean, I have a disrespect for everybody.

4:01:04.480 --> 4:01:12.480
 And if somebody is cautious about the vaccine for themselves or for their children, we have to listen to that.

4:01:12.480 --> 4:01:34.480
 And at the same time, public health is about creating public health. And there's no doubt. I think Joe was absolutely right that older people, obese people are at greater risk for being harmed or killed by COVID 19 than young healthy people.

4:01:34.480 --> 4:01:46.480
 But by everybody getting vaccinated, we reduce the risk to everybody else. And so I feel like, like with everything, there's the individual benefit argument.

4:01:46.480 --> 4:01:50.480
 And then there's the community argument. And I absolutely think.

4:01:50.480 --> 4:02:05.480
 I'm expressing that clearly, that there's a difference between the individual health and freedoms and the community health and freedoms and steel manning each side of this. So this is one of the problems that people don't do enough of is be able to.

4:02:05.480 --> 4:02:19.480
 So how do you just steel man an argument? You describe that argument in the best possible way. You have to first understand that argument. Let's go to the non controversial thing like flat earth.

4:02:19.480 --> 4:02:30.480
 Like most people, most colleagues of mine at MIT, don't even read about like the full argument that the flat earthers make.

4:02:30.480 --> 4:02:45.480
 I feel it's disingenuous for people in the physics community to roll their eyes at flat earthers. If they haven't read their arguments, you should feel bad that you don't read their arguments.

4:02:45.480 --> 4:02:55.480
 And like, it's the rolling of the eyes. That's a big problem. You haven't read it. Your intuition says that these are a bunch of crazy people. Okay.

4:02:55.480 --> 4:03:04.480
 But you don't get, you haven't earned the right to roll your eyes. You've earned your right to maybe not read it, but then don't have an opinion.

4:03:04.480 --> 4:03:11.480
 Don't roll your eyes. Don't do any of that dismissive stuff. And the same thing in the scientific community around COVID and so on.

4:03:11.480 --> 4:03:19.480
 There's often this kind of saying, oh, cut, that's conspiracy theories. That's misinformation without actually looking into what they're saying.

4:03:19.480 --> 4:03:28.480
 If you haven't looked into what they're saying, then don't talk about it. Like if you're a scientific leader and the communicator, you need to look into it. It's not that much effort.

4:03:28.480 --> 4:03:34.480
 I totally agree. And I think that humility, it's a constant theme of your podcast. And I love that.

4:03:34.480 --> 4:03:45.480
 And so after the conversation, debate, whatever it was between Sanjay and Joe, I reached out on Twitter to someone I've never met in person.

4:03:45.480 --> 4:03:55.480
 But I'm in touch privately to a guy named Daniel Griffin, who's a professor at Columbia Medical School and just so smart.

4:03:55.480 --> 4:04:08.480
 He gives regular updates on COVID 19 on a thing called TWIV this week in virology. I'm a critic of TWIV for its coverage of pandemic origins.

4:04:08.480 --> 4:04:24.480
 But on this issue, on just having regular updates, Daniel is great. And so I said to him, I said, why don't we have an honest process to get the people who are raising concerns about the vaccines in their own words?

4:04:24.480 --> 4:04:37.480
 To raise what are their concerns? And then let's do our best job of saying, well, here are these concerns. And then here is our evidence making a counterclaim.

4:04:37.480 --> 4:04:44.480
 And here are links to if you want to look at the studies upon which these claims are made, here they are.

4:04:44.480 --> 4:04:54.480
 And Daniel, who's incredibly busy, I mean, he reads every, I mean, it seems every paper that comes out every week and it's unbelievable.

4:04:54.480 --> 4:05:12.480
 But he sent me a link to the CDC Q&A page on the CDC website. And it wasn't that. It was people who were, I mean, it was written by people like me, who were convinced in the benefit of these vaccines.

4:05:12.480 --> 4:05:24.480
 So the questions were framed, they were kind of like, they weren't really the framing of the people with the concerns, they were framing of people who were just kind of imagining something else.

4:05:24.480 --> 4:05:32.480
 I mean, you always talk about kind of humility and active listening. I know you don't mean, and it doesn't mean that we don't stand for something.

4:05:32.480 --> 4:05:46.480
 Like I certainly am a strong proponent of vaccines and masks and all of those things. But if we don't hear the other people, we don't let them hear their voice in the conversation.

4:05:46.480 --> 4:05:53.480
 If it's just saying, well, you may think this and here's why it's wrong, the argument may be right, it'll just never break through.

4:05:53.480 --> 4:06:05.480
 By the way, my interpretation of Joe and Sanjay, I listened to that conversation without looking at Twitter or the internet. And I thought that was a great conversation and I thought Sanjay actually really succeeded in bringing the temperature down.

4:06:05.480 --> 4:06:14.480
 To me, the goal was bringing the temperature down. I didn't even think of it as a debate. I was like, oh, cool. This isn't going to be some weird, it's like two friendly people talking.

4:06:14.480 --> 4:06:24.480
 And then I look at the internet and then the internet says, Joe Rogan slam such like, as if it was a heated debate that Joe won.

4:06:24.480 --> 4:06:33.480
 And it's like, all right, it's really the temperature being brought down, real conversation between two humans that wasn't really a debate.

4:06:33.480 --> 4:06:37.480
 It was just a conversation. And that was a success.

4:06:37.480 --> 4:06:53.480
 I definitely think it was a success. But I also felt that a takeaway, because this is something that I don't agree with, even though I have great, as I've said, respect for Joe,

4:06:53.480 --> 4:07:04.480
 I think a reasonable person listening to that conversation would come away with the conclusion that all in all these vaccines are a good thing.

4:07:04.480 --> 4:07:17.480
 But if you're young and healthy, you probably don't need it. And I just felt that there was a stronger case to be made, even though Sanjay made it.

4:07:17.480 --> 4:07:28.480
 It wasn't that Sanjay didn't make it. It was just that in the flow of that conversation, I felt that the case for the vaccines, and the vaccines both as an individual choice,

4:07:28.480 --> 4:07:37.480
 and then certainly, again, as I said before, I think that while people can be afraid of the vaccines, the virus itself is much scarier.

4:07:37.480 --> 4:07:43.480
 And we're seeing it now in real time with these variations and variants.

4:07:43.480 --> 4:07:49.480
 I just felt that that was kind of the rough takeaway from that conversation.

4:07:49.480 --> 4:07:56.480
 And I felt that Sanjay, again, whom I love, I felt it could have made his case a little bit stronger.

4:07:56.480 --> 4:08:08.480
 So the way the thing he succeeded is he didn't come off as like a science expert looking down at everybody, talking down to everybody.

4:08:08.480 --> 4:08:11.480
 So he succeeded in that, which is very respectful.

4:08:11.480 --> 4:08:25.480
 But I also think making the case for taking the vaccine where when you're a young, healthy person, when you're sitting across from Joe Rogan is like a high difficulty on the video game level.

4:08:25.480 --> 4:08:26.480
 For sure.

4:08:26.480 --> 4:08:29.480
 So it's difficult to do.

4:08:29.480 --> 4:08:30.480
 Yeah, for sure.

4:08:30.480 --> 4:08:31.480
 It's difficult to do.

4:08:31.480 --> 4:08:38.480
 And also it's difficult to do because it's not like, it's not as simple as like look at the data.

4:08:38.480 --> 4:08:41.480
 There's a lot of data to go through here.

4:08:41.480 --> 4:08:42.480
 Yeah.

4:08:42.480 --> 4:08:50.480
 And there's also a lot of non data stuff, like the fact that, first of all, questioning the sources of the data, the quality of the data,

4:08:50.480 --> 4:09:01.480
 because it's also disappointing about COVID is that the quality of the data is not great, but also questioning all the motivations of the different parties involved,

4:09:01.480 --> 4:09:11.480
 whether it's major organizations that develop the vaccine, whether it's major institutions like NIH or NIA that are sort of communicating to us about the vaccine,

4:09:11.480 --> 4:09:20.480
 whether it's the CDC and the WHO, whether it's the Biden or the Trump administration, whether it's China and all those kinds of things.

4:09:20.480 --> 4:09:23.480
 You have to, that's part of the conversation here.

4:09:23.480 --> 4:09:28.480
 I mean, vaccination is not just a public health tool.

4:09:28.480 --> 4:09:32.480
 It's also a tool for a government to gain more control over the populace.

4:09:32.480 --> 4:09:35.480
 Like there's a lot of truth to that too.

4:09:35.480 --> 4:09:46.480
 Things that have a lot of benefit can also be used as a Trojan horse to increase bureaucracy and control.

4:09:46.480 --> 4:09:49.480
 But that has to be on the table for a conversation.

4:09:49.480 --> 4:09:51.480
 Yeah, I think it has to be on the conversation.

4:09:51.480 --> 4:10:01.480
 But I mean, your parents, when they were in the Soviet Union and here in the United States, and actually it was a big collaboration between US and the Soviet Union,

4:10:01.480 --> 4:10:09.480
 when the polio vaccine came out, there were people all around the world who had a different life trajectory, no longer living in fear.

4:10:09.480 --> 4:10:15.480
 And all of these people who were paralyzed or killed from polio, smallpox has been eradicated.

4:10:15.480 --> 4:10:19.480
 It was one of the great successes in human history.

4:10:19.480 --> 4:10:27.480
 And while it for sure is true that you could imagine some kind of fraudulent vaccination effort,

4:10:27.480 --> 4:10:36.480
 but here I genuinely think, I mean, whatever the number, 15 million, 16 million is the economist number of dead from COVID 19.

4:10:36.480 --> 4:10:41.480
 Many, many, many more people would be dead but for these vaccines.

4:10:41.480 --> 4:10:53.480
 And so I get that any activity that needs to be coordinated by a central government has the potential to increase bureaucracy and increase control.

4:10:53.480 --> 4:11:05.480
 But there are certain things that central governments do like the development, particularly these mRNA vaccines, which it's purely a US government victory.

4:11:05.480 --> 4:11:13.480
 I mean, it was huge DARPA funding and then the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease NIH funding.

4:11:13.480 --> 4:11:21.480
 I mean, this was a public private partnership throughout and that we got a working vaccine in 11 months was a miracle.

4:11:21.480 --> 4:11:23.480
 It's not purely a victory.

4:11:23.480 --> 4:11:26.480
 Again, you have to be open minded.

4:11:26.480 --> 4:11:41.480
 I'm with you here playing a bit of devil's advocate, but the people who discuss any viral drugs like hypermectin and other alternatives would say that the extreme focus on the vaccine distracted us from considering other possibilities.

4:11:41.480 --> 4:11:50.480
 And saying that this is purely a success is distracting from the story that there could have been other solutions.

4:11:50.480 --> 4:12:01.480
 So yes, it's a huge success that the vaccine was developed so quickly and surprisingly way more effective than it was hoped for.

4:12:01.480 --> 4:12:07.480
 But there could have been other solutions and they completely distracted from us from that.

4:12:07.480 --> 4:12:12.480
 In fact, it distracted us from looking into a bunch of things like the lab leak.

4:12:12.480 --> 4:12:20.480
 So it's not a pure victory and there's a lot of people that criticize the overreach of government and all of this.

4:12:20.480 --> 4:12:30.480
 One of the things that makes the United States great is the individualism and the hesitancy to ideas of mandates.

4:12:30.480 --> 4:12:53.480
 Even if the mandates on mass will have a positive, even strongly positive result, many Americans will still say no because in the long arc of history, saying no in that moment will actually lead to a better country and a better world.

4:12:53.480 --> 4:12:59.480
 So that's a messed up aspect of America, but it's also a beautiful part.

4:12:59.480 --> 4:13:03.480
 We're skeptical even about good things.

4:13:03.480 --> 4:13:04.480
 I agree.

4:13:04.480 --> 4:13:10.480
 And certainly we should all be cautious about government overreach.

4:13:10.480 --> 4:13:11.480
 Absolutely.

4:13:11.480 --> 4:13:16.480
 And it happens in all kinds of scenarios with incarceration, with a thousand things.

4:13:16.480 --> 4:13:30.480
 And we also should be afraid of government underreach that if there is a problem that could be solved by governments and that's why we have governments in the first place is that there's just certain things that individuals can't do on their own.

4:13:30.480 --> 4:13:38.480
 And that's why we pool our resources and we in some ways sacrifice our rights for this common thing.

4:13:38.480 --> 4:13:49.480
 And that's why we don't have hopefully people, murderers, marauding or people driving 200 miles down the street that we have a process for arriving at a set of common rules.

4:13:49.480 --> 4:13:54.480
 And so, well, I fully agree that we need to respect and we need to listen.

4:13:54.480 --> 4:13:56.480
 We need to find that right balance.

4:13:56.480 --> 4:14:00.480
 And you've raised the magic I word, ivermectin.

4:14:00.480 --> 4:14:08.480
 And so in ivermectin, like my view has always been ivermectin could be effective.

4:14:08.480 --> 4:14:09.480
 It could not be effective.

4:14:09.480 --> 4:14:11.480
 Let's study it through a full process.

4:14:11.480 --> 4:14:21.480
 And when you had Francis Collins with you, even while he was making up stories about this wrestler, he was saying, yeah, exactly.

4:14:21.480 --> 4:14:32.480
 But he was saying that they're going to do a full randomized highest level trial of ivermectin and if ivermectin works, then that's another tool in our toolbox.

4:14:32.480 --> 4:14:33.480
 And I think we should.

4:14:33.480 --> 4:14:48.480
 And I think that Sanjay was absolutely correct to concede the point to Joe that it was disingenuous for people, including people on CNN, to say that ivermectin is for livestock.

4:14:48.480 --> 4:14:56.480
 And so I definitely think that we have to have some kind of process that allows us to come together.

4:14:56.480 --> 4:15:03.480
 And I totally agree that the great strength of America is that we empower individuals.

4:15:03.480 --> 4:15:06.480
 It's the history of our frontier mentality in our country.

4:15:06.480 --> 4:15:19.480
 So I 100% agree that we have to allow that even if sometimes it creates messy processes and uncomfortable feelings and all those sorts of things.

4:15:19.480 --> 4:15:22.480
 You are an ultramarathon runner.

4:15:22.480 --> 4:15:23.480
 Yes.

4:15:23.480 --> 4:15:27.480
 What are you running from?

4:15:27.480 --> 4:15:28.480
 No.

4:15:28.480 --> 4:15:36.480
 It's the funny thing is, so I'm an ultramarathon runner and I've done 13 Ironmans and people say, oh my God, that's amazing.

4:15:36.480 --> 4:15:40.480
 13 Ironmans and what I always say, no, one Ironman is impressive.

4:15:40.480 --> 4:15:44.480
 13 Ironmans, there's something effing wrong with you.

4:15:44.480 --> 4:15:45.480
 We just need to figure out what it is.

4:15:45.480 --> 4:15:48.480
 Yeah, there's some demons you're trying to work through.

4:15:48.480 --> 4:15:53.480
 I mean, what you're doing the work though, most people just kind of let the demons sit in the attic.

4:15:53.480 --> 4:16:06.480
 No, what have you learned about yourself, about your mind, about your body, about life from taking your body limit in that kind of way to running those kinds of distances?

4:16:06.480 --> 4:16:08.480
 Well, it's a great question.

4:16:08.480 --> 4:16:12.480
 I know that you are also kind of exploring the limits of the physical.

4:16:12.480 --> 4:16:27.480
 And so for me in doing the Ironmans and the ultramarathons, it's always the same kind of lesson, which is just when you think you have nothing left, you actually have a ton left.

4:16:27.480 --> 4:16:38.480
 There are a lot of resources that are there if you call on them and the ability to call on them has to be cultivated.

4:16:38.480 --> 4:16:45.480
 And so for me, especially in the Ironman, and Ironman in many ways is harder than the ultramarathons.

4:16:45.480 --> 4:16:57.480
 Because I'll be at, I mean, it's 140 miles, I'll be at 100 mile, 120, having done the swim and then the bike and I'll be whatever, six miles into the run.

4:16:57.480 --> 4:17:00.480
 And I'll think, I feel like shit.

4:17:00.480 --> 4:17:02.480
 I have nothing left.

4:17:02.480 --> 4:17:07.480
 How am I possibly going to run 20 miles more?

4:17:07.480 --> 4:17:10.480
 But there's always more.

4:17:10.480 --> 4:17:20.480
 And I think that for me, these extreme sports are my process of exploring what is what's possible.

4:17:20.480 --> 4:17:30.480
 And I feel like it applies in so many different areas of life where you're kind of pushing and it feels like the limit.

4:17:30.480 --> 4:17:40.480
 And one of my friend of mine, who I just have so much respect for, who actually be a great guest if you haven't already interviewed him, is Charlie Engel.

4:17:40.480 --> 4:17:47.480
 And Charlie, he was a drug addict, he was in prison, his life was total shit.

4:17:47.480 --> 4:17:55.480
 And somehow, and I can't remember the full story, he just started running around the prison yard.

4:17:55.480 --> 4:18:07.480
 And it's like Forrest Gump, he just kept running and running and then he got out of prison and he kept running and he started doing ultramarathons, started inspiring all these other people.

4:18:07.480 --> 4:18:09.480
 Now he's written all these books.

4:18:09.480 --> 4:18:23.480
 As a matter of fact, we just spoke a few months ago that he's planning on running from the Dead Sea to somehow to the top of Mount Everest from the lowest point to the highest point on Earth.

4:18:23.480 --> 4:18:25.480
 And I said, well, why are you stopping there?

4:18:25.480 --> 4:18:41.480
 Why don't you get whatever camera in and go down to the lowest part of the ocean, go to the lowest part of the ocean and then talk to Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos and go to the kind of the highest place in the stratosphere you can get.

4:18:41.480 --> 4:18:54.480
 But it's this thing of possibility and I just feel like so many of us and myself included, we get stuck in a sense of what we think is our range.

4:18:54.480 --> 4:18:57.480
 And if we're not careful, that can become our range.

4:18:57.480 --> 4:19:07.480
 And that's why for me in all of life, it's all about, like we've been talking about, challenging the limits, challenging assumptions, challenging ourselves.

4:19:07.480 --> 4:19:11.480
 And hopefully, you know, we do it in a way that kind of doesn't hurt anybody.

4:19:11.480 --> 4:19:20.480
 You know, when I'm at the Ironman, they have all these little kids and have these little shirts and it'll say, like, my dad is a hero and have the little Ironman logo.

4:19:20.480 --> 4:19:30.480
 And I want to say it's like, no, your dad is actually a narcissistic dick who goes on eight mile bike rides every Sunday rather than spend time with you.

4:19:30.480 --> 4:19:33.480
 And so we shouldn't hurt anybody.

4:19:33.480 --> 4:19:48.480
 But for me, I also find it very enjoyable and I hope I'm not disclosing too much about our conversation before we went live where you're doing so many different things with running and your martial arts.

4:19:48.480 --> 4:19:55.480
 And I encourage you to do ultramarathons because there's so many great ones in Texas.

4:19:55.480 --> 4:19:59.480
 It's actually surprisingly a very enjoyable way to spend a day.

4:19:59.480 --> 4:20:04.480
 How would you recommend, so yeah, for people who might not know, I've never actually even run a marathon.

4:20:04.480 --> 4:20:07.480
 I've run 22 miles at one time at most.

4:20:07.480 --> 4:20:15.480
 I did the 4x4x48 challenge with David Goggins where you run four miles every four hours.

4:20:15.480 --> 4:20:20.480
 It's less to do with the distance and more to do with the sleep deprivation.

4:20:20.480 --> 4:20:26.480
 What advice would you give to a first time ultramarathon like me trying to run 50 or more miles?

4:20:26.480 --> 4:20:31.480
 Or for anybody else interested in this kind of exploration of their range?

4:20:31.480 --> 4:20:36.480
 Yeah, what I always tell is the same advice is register.

4:20:36.480 --> 4:20:40.480
 Pick your timeline of when you think you can be ready, depending on where you are now.

4:20:40.480 --> 4:20:44.480
 Make it six months, make a year, and then register for the race.

4:20:44.480 --> 4:20:49.480
 And then once you're registered, just work back from there what's it going to take.

4:20:49.480 --> 4:20:55.480
 But one of the things for people who are just getting going, you really do need to make sure that your body is ready for it.

4:20:55.480 --> 4:21:02.480
 And so particularly as we get older, strengthening is really important.

4:21:02.480 --> 4:21:05.480
 So I'll do a plug for my brother, Jordan Metzel.

4:21:05.480 --> 4:21:10.480
 He's a doctor at hospital for special surgery, but his whole thing is functional strength.

4:21:10.480 --> 4:21:14.480
 And people know about, and you can actually even go to his website.

4:21:14.480 --> 4:21:17.480
 You can just Google Jordan Metzel, Iron Strength.

4:21:17.480 --> 4:21:24.480
 But it's all about burpees and just building your muscular strength so that you don't get injured as you increase.

4:21:24.480 --> 4:21:28.480
 And then just increase your mileage in some steady way.

4:21:28.480 --> 4:21:36.480
 Make sure that you take rest days and listen to your body because people like you who are just very kind of mind over matter,

4:21:36.480 --> 4:21:41.480
 like you were telling me before about you have an injury, but you kind of run a little bit differently.

4:21:41.480 --> 4:21:47.480
 And we need to listen to our bodies because our bodies are communicating.

4:21:47.480 --> 4:21:53.480
 But I think if it's kind of little by little, magic is possible.

4:21:53.480 --> 4:21:57.480
 And what I will say is, and I've done lots and lots of marathons,

4:21:57.480 --> 4:22:02.480
 and I always tell people that the ultra marathons, at least the ones that I do,

4:22:02.480 --> 4:22:04.480
 and I shouldn't misrepresent myself.

4:22:04.480 --> 4:22:07.480
 I mean, there are people who do 500 mile races.

4:22:07.480 --> 4:22:12.480
 The ones that I do are 50k mountain trail runs, which is 32 miles.

4:22:12.480 --> 4:22:17.480
 So I do the kind of the easier side of ultras.

4:22:17.480 --> 4:22:26.480
 But it's actually much easier than a marathon because the mountain ones, sometimes it's so steep that you have to walk it

4:22:26.480 --> 4:22:28.480
 because walking is faster than running.

4:22:28.480 --> 4:22:35.480
 And every four or five miles in the supported races, you stop and eat blinces and foiled potatoes.

4:22:35.480 --> 4:22:36.480
 It's actually quite enjoyable.

4:22:36.480 --> 4:22:41.480
 But as I started to tell you before we went live,

4:22:41.480 --> 4:22:48.480
 I've done for lots of years these 50k mountain trail runs and I was going to Taiwan a number of years ago for something else.

4:22:48.480 --> 4:22:52.480
 And I thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to do an ultra marathon in Taiwan?

4:22:52.480 --> 4:22:57.480
 I looked and the weekend after my visit, there was a marathon.

4:22:57.480 --> 4:22:59.480
 It was called the ultra marathon.

4:22:59.480 --> 4:23:01.480
 It was called the Taiwan Beast.

4:23:01.480 --> 4:23:03.480
 And I figured, oh, beasts, what are they talking about?

4:23:03.480 --> 4:23:06.480
 It's 50k mountain trail and I've done a million of them.

4:23:06.480 --> 4:23:07.480
 And then I went to register.

4:23:07.480 --> 4:23:11.480
 And then as part of registration, they said, you need to have all of this equipment.

4:23:11.480 --> 4:23:14.480
 And there was all this wilderness survival equipment.

4:23:14.480 --> 4:23:18.480
 And I was thinking, God, these Taiwanese, what a bunch of whims.

4:23:18.480 --> 4:23:19.480
 Wait a dramatic.

4:23:19.480 --> 4:23:20.480
 You have to carry.

4:23:20.480 --> 4:23:21.480
 Give me a break.

4:23:21.480 --> 4:23:22.480
 50k mountain trail.

4:23:22.480 --> 4:23:27.480
 So I get there and the race starts at 4.30 in the morning in the middle of nowhere.

4:23:27.480 --> 4:23:29.480
 And you have to wear headlamps and everyone's carrying all this stuff.

4:23:29.480 --> 4:23:34.480
 And you kind of go running out into the rainforest.

4:23:34.480 --> 4:23:36.480
 It was the hardest thing I've ever done.

4:23:36.480 --> 4:23:37.480
 It took 19 hours.

4:23:37.480 --> 4:23:41.480
 There were maybe 15 cliff faces, like a real cliff.

4:23:41.480 --> 4:23:44.480
 And somebody had dangled like a little piece of string.

4:23:44.480 --> 4:23:48.480
 And so they had to hold on to the string with one hand while it was in the pouring rain.

4:23:48.480 --> 4:23:49.480
 Climb up these cliffs.

4:23:49.480 --> 4:23:56.480
 There were maybe 20 river crossings, but not just like a little stream, like a torrential

4:23:56.480 --> 4:23:57.480
 river.

4:23:57.480 --> 4:24:02.480
 There were some things where it was so steep that everyone was just climbing up and then

4:24:02.480 --> 4:24:04.480
 you'd slide all the way down and climb up.

4:24:04.480 --> 4:24:10.480
 And people I met on the way out there who were saying, oh yeah, I did the Sahara 500

4:24:10.480 --> 4:24:15.480
 kilometer race and those people were just sprawled out.

4:24:15.480 --> 4:24:17.480
 A lot of them didn't finish.

4:24:17.480 --> 4:24:20.480
 So that was the hardest thing I've ever.

4:24:20.480 --> 4:24:22.480
 So how do you get through something like that?

4:24:22.480 --> 4:24:24.480
 You're just one step at a time.

4:24:24.480 --> 4:24:31.480
 Do you remember, is there dark moments or is it kind of all spread out thinly?

4:24:31.480 --> 4:24:33.480
 It wasn't really dark moments.

4:24:33.480 --> 4:24:38.480
 There was one thing where I'd been running so long, I thought, well, I must almost be

4:24:38.480 --> 4:24:39.480
 done.

4:24:39.480 --> 4:24:44.480
 And then I found out I had like 15 miles more.

4:24:44.480 --> 4:24:52.480
 But I guess with all of these things, it's the messages that we tell ourselves.

4:24:52.480 --> 4:24:58.480
 So for me, the message I always tell myself is quitting isn't an option.

4:24:58.480 --> 4:25:03.480
 I mean, once in a while, you kind of have to quit if like listen to the universe, whatever

4:25:03.480 --> 4:25:05.480
 you're going to kill yourself or something.

4:25:05.480 --> 4:25:10.480
 But for me, it was just, you know, whatever it takes, there's no way I'm stopping.

4:25:10.480 --> 4:25:16.480
 And I have to go up this muddy hill 20 times because I keep sliding.

4:25:16.480 --> 4:25:18.480
 I'm sure there's a way.

4:25:18.480 --> 4:25:21.480
 It's probably a personality flaw.

4:25:21.480 --> 4:25:23.480
 What is your love for chocolate come from?

4:25:23.480 --> 4:25:25.480
 Oh, it's a great question.

4:25:25.480 --> 4:25:29.480
 Both of my Joe Rogan interviews, that's the first question that he asked.

4:25:29.480 --> 4:25:31.480
 So I'm glad that we've gotten to that.

4:25:31.480 --> 4:25:36.480
 So one, I've always loved chocolate and I call it like a secret.

4:25:36.480 --> 4:25:41.480
 But now that I keep telling, if you keep telling the same secret, it's actually no longer a

4:25:41.480 --> 4:25:47.480
 secret that I have a secret, which is not secret because I'm telling you on a podcast,

4:25:47.480 --> 4:25:50.480
 life as a chocolate shaman.

4:25:50.480 --> 4:25:56.480
 So when I give keynotes at tech conference, I say, I'm happy to give a keynote, but I want to

4:25:56.480 --> 4:25:59.480
 lead a sacred cacao ceremony in the night.

4:25:59.480 --> 4:26:04.480
 I'm actually, believe it or not, the official chocolate shaman of what used to be called

4:26:04.480 --> 4:26:07.480
 exponential medicine, which is part of Singularity University.

4:26:07.480 --> 4:26:12.480
 Now, my friend Daniel Kraft, who runs it, it's going to be called next med.

4:26:12.480 --> 4:26:19.480
 And so, but I'll have to go back as I was going to Berlin a lot of years ago.

4:26:19.480 --> 4:26:25.480
 And I've always loved chocolate, but I was going to Berlin to give a keynote at a big conference

4:26:25.480 --> 4:26:28.480
 called TOA, Tech Open Air.

4:26:28.480 --> 4:26:33.480
 And so when I got there, the first night, I was supposed to give a talk, but there had been

4:26:33.480 --> 4:26:34.480
 some mix up.

4:26:34.480 --> 4:26:36.480
 They'd forgotten to reserve the room.

4:26:36.480 --> 4:26:38.480
 And so the talk got canceled.

4:26:38.480 --> 4:26:43.480
 And in the brochure, they had all these different events around Berlin that you could go to.

4:26:43.480 --> 4:26:46.480
 And one of them was a cacao ceremony.

4:26:46.480 --> 4:26:52.480
 And so I went there and actually met somebody, Viviana, who is still a friend, but I met

4:26:52.480 --> 4:26:56.480
 going in there and there was this cacao ceremony, these kind of hippie dudes.

4:26:56.480 --> 4:26:59.480
 And then everybody got the cacao.

4:26:59.480 --> 4:27:03.480
 And then they said, all right, as they talked a little bit about the process.

4:27:03.480 --> 4:27:07.480
 And then they said, all right, everyone just stand and kind of we're going to spin around

4:27:07.480 --> 4:27:09.480
 in a circle for 45 minutes.

4:27:09.480 --> 4:27:14.480
 And so I spun around in the circle for like 10 minutes, but then I had to leave because

4:27:14.480 --> 4:27:16.480
 I had to go to something else.

4:27:16.480 --> 4:27:18.480
 And so I thought that was that.

4:27:18.480 --> 4:27:23.480
 But then I saw Viviana the next day and I said, how did the cacao ceremony go?

4:27:23.480 --> 4:27:28.480
 And she showed me these pictures of all of these people mostly naked.

4:27:28.480 --> 4:27:31.480
 It turned into chaos.

4:27:31.480 --> 4:27:33.480
 And it was like, ha, so let me get this straight.

4:27:33.480 --> 4:27:39.480
 People drank chocolate, then they spun around in a circle and something else happened.

4:27:39.480 --> 4:27:44.480
 Anyway, so then two days later, I was invited to another cacao ceremony, which was also

4:27:44.480 --> 4:27:46.480
 actually part of this toa.

4:27:46.480 --> 4:27:51.480
 And that was kind of more structured and it was more sane because it was part of this thing.

4:27:51.480 --> 4:27:57.480
 And at the end of that, I had this, I thought, one, how the greatest thing ever, a sacred

4:27:57.480 --> 4:28:01.480
 cacao ceremony, like you drink chocolate milk and everybody's free.

4:28:01.480 --> 4:28:05.480
 And I love that idea because I've never done drugs.

4:28:05.480 --> 4:28:07.480
 I don't drink.

4:28:07.480 --> 4:28:12.480
 Part of it is because I think whatever, like I was saying with the ultra running, all of

4:28:12.480 --> 4:28:16.480
 the possibilities are within us if we can get out of our own way.

4:28:16.480 --> 4:28:22.480
 And then I thought, well, I think I can do a better job than what I experienced in Berlin.

4:28:22.480 --> 4:28:26.480
 So I came back and I thought, all right, I'm going to get accredited as a cacao shaman.

4:28:26.480 --> 4:28:30.480
 And this will shock you because I know if you're going to be like a rabbi or a priest

4:28:30.480 --> 4:28:32.480
 or something, there's some process.

4:28:32.480 --> 4:28:37.480
 And shockingly, there's no official process to accommodate chocolate shaman.

4:28:37.480 --> 4:28:42.480
 And so I thought, all right, well, you know, I'm just going to train myself and when I'm

4:28:42.480 --> 4:28:45.480
 ready, I'm going to declare my chocolate shamanism.

4:28:45.480 --> 4:28:47.480
 So I started studying different things.

4:28:47.480 --> 4:28:52.480
 And when I was ready, I just said, now I'm a chocolate shaman, self declared.

4:28:52.480 --> 4:28:53.480
 Self declared.

4:28:53.480 --> 4:28:58.480
 And so, but I do these ceremonies and I've done them at tech conferences.

4:28:58.480 --> 4:29:01.480
 I did one in Soho House in New York.

4:29:01.480 --> 4:29:04.480
 I did it at Place Rancho La Puerta in Mexico.

4:29:04.480 --> 4:29:10.480
 And every time it's the same thing because it's just if people are given a license to be free.

4:29:10.480 --> 4:29:12.480
 Just it doesn't matter.

4:29:12.480 --> 4:29:16.480
 And what I always say is you're here for a sacred cacao ceremony, but the truth is there's

4:29:16.480 --> 4:29:20.480
 no such thing as sacred cacao and there's no sacred mountains and there's no sacred people

4:29:20.480 --> 4:29:27.480
 and there's no sacred plans because nothing is sacred if we don't attribute ascribe sacredness

4:29:27.480 --> 4:29:28.480
 to it.

4:29:28.480 --> 4:29:33.480
 But if we recognize that everything is sacred, then we'll live different lives.

4:29:33.480 --> 4:29:37.480
 And for the purpose of this ceremony, we're just going to say, all right, we're going

4:29:37.480 --> 4:29:43.480
 to focus on this cacao, which actually has been used ceremonially for 5,000 years.

4:29:43.480 --> 4:29:46.480
 It has all these wonderful properties.

4:29:46.480 --> 4:29:51.480
 But it's just people who get that license and then they're just free and people are

4:29:51.480 --> 4:29:52.480
 dancing and all sorts of things.

4:29:52.480 --> 4:30:00.480
 Is the goal to celebrate life in general, is it to celebrate the senses, like taste?

4:30:00.480 --> 4:30:03.480
 Is it to celebrate yourself, each other?

4:30:03.480 --> 4:30:08.480
 I think the core is gratitude and just appreciation.

4:30:08.480 --> 4:30:10.480
 All the experiences in life.

4:30:10.480 --> 4:30:15.480
 Yeah, just of being alive, of just living in this sacred world where we have all these

4:30:15.480 --> 4:30:19.480
 things that we don't even pay any attention to.

4:30:19.480 --> 4:30:26.480
 My friend AJ Jacobs, he had a wonderful book that I used the spirit of it in the ceremonies,

4:30:26.480 --> 4:30:33.480
 not exactly, but he was in a restaurant in New York, a coffee shop, and his child said,

4:30:33.480 --> 4:30:35.480
 hey, where does the coffee come from?

4:30:35.480 --> 4:30:38.480
 I mean, he's like a wonderful big thinker.

4:30:38.480 --> 4:30:42.480
 And he started really answering that question, well, here's where the beans come from, but

4:30:42.480 --> 4:30:46.480
 how did the beans get here and who painted the yellow line on the street so the truck

4:30:46.480 --> 4:30:49.480
 didn't crash and who made the cup?

4:30:49.480 --> 4:30:55.480
 And he spent a year making a full spreadsheet of all of the people who in one way or another

4:30:55.480 --> 4:30:59.480
 played some role in that one cup of coffee.

4:30:59.480 --> 4:31:03.480
 And he traveled all around the world thanking them.

4:31:03.480 --> 4:31:06.480
 It's like, thank you for painting the yellow line on the road.

4:31:06.480 --> 4:31:11.480
 And so for me with the cacao, part of when I do these ceremonies is just to say, like,

4:31:11.480 --> 4:31:15.480
 you're drinking this cacao, but there's a person who planted the seed.

4:31:15.480 --> 4:31:17.480
 There's a person who watered the plant.

4:31:17.480 --> 4:31:18.480
 There's a person.

4:31:18.480 --> 4:31:24.480
 And I just think that level of awareness, and it's true with anything like you have

4:31:24.480 --> 4:31:26.480
 in front of you a stuffed hedgehog.

4:31:26.480 --> 4:31:28.480
 Somebody made that.

4:31:28.480 --> 4:31:29.480
 I love it.

4:31:29.480 --> 4:31:30.480
 It's great.

4:31:30.480 --> 4:31:34.480
 But if we just said, all right, where does this stuffed hedgehog come from?

4:31:34.480 --> 4:31:40.480
 We would have a full story of globalization, of the interconnection of people all around

4:31:40.480 --> 4:31:44.480
 the world doing all sorts of things, of human imagination.

4:31:44.480 --> 4:31:49.480
 It's beyond our capacity and our daily, we'd go insane if every day, like we're speaking

4:31:49.480 --> 4:31:55.480
 into a microphone, well, what are the hundreds of years of technology that make this possible?

4:31:55.480 --> 4:32:01.480
 But if just once in a while, we just focus on one thing and say, this thing is sacred.

4:32:01.480 --> 4:32:06.480
 And because I'm recognizing that and I'm having an appreciation for the world around me, it

4:32:06.480 --> 4:32:09.480
 just kind of makes my life feel more sacred.

4:32:09.480 --> 4:32:12.480
 It makes me recognize my connection to others.

4:32:12.480 --> 4:32:14.480
 So that's the gist of it.

4:32:14.480 --> 4:32:15.480
 Yeah, it's funny.

4:32:15.480 --> 4:32:31.480
 I often look at things in this world and moments and just am in awe of the full universe that

4:32:31.480 --> 4:32:33.480
 brought that to be.

4:32:33.480 --> 4:32:38.480
 In a similar way as you're saying, but I don't as often think about exactly what you're saying,

4:32:38.480 --> 4:32:42.480
 which is the number of people behind every little thing we get to enjoy.

4:32:42.480 --> 4:32:48.480
 I mean, yeah, this hedgehog, this microphone is like directly like thousands of people

4:32:48.480 --> 4:32:49.480
 involved.

4:32:49.480 --> 4:32:50.480
 Millions.

4:32:50.480 --> 4:33:00.480
 And then indirectly millions, like, and they're all like this microphone that there's like

4:33:00.480 --> 4:33:05.480
 artists essentially, like people who made it their life's work all across like from the

4:33:05.480 --> 4:33:11.480
 factories to the manufacturer, there's families that the production of this microphone and

4:33:11.480 --> 4:33:17.480
 this hedgehog are fed because of the skill of this human that helped contribute to that

4:33:17.480 --> 4:33:18.480
 development.

4:33:18.480 --> 4:33:19.480
 Yeah, it's.

4:33:19.480 --> 4:33:23.480
 And like Isaac Newton and John Von Neumann are in this microphone.

4:33:23.480 --> 4:33:25.480
 They're standing on the shoulders of John.

4:33:25.480 --> 4:33:32.480
 So we're standing on their shoulders and somebody will be standing on ours.

4:33:32.480 --> 4:33:37.480
 You mentioned one shared world.

4:33:37.480 --> 4:33:38.480
 Yeah.

4:33:38.480 --> 4:33:39.480
 What is it?

4:33:39.480 --> 4:33:41.480
 Well, thanks for asking.

4:33:41.480 --> 4:33:46.480
 And by the way, what I will say is the people who are listening, this is so incredible.

4:33:46.480 --> 4:33:49.480
 And I'm so thrilled to have this kind of long conversation.

4:33:49.480 --> 4:33:51.480
 A little person who's listening.

4:33:51.480 --> 4:33:52.480
 Exactly.

4:33:52.480 --> 4:33:53.480
 Thank you.

4:33:53.480 --> 4:33:54.480
 Past the five hour mark.

4:33:54.480 --> 4:33:55.480
 Thanks, mom.

4:33:55.480 --> 4:33:56.480
 The.

4:33:56.480 --> 4:33:57.480
 I salute you.

4:33:57.480 --> 4:33:58.480
 Yeah.

4:33:58.480 --> 4:34:01.480
 Somebody was like sleeping for the first four hours and just woke up.

4:34:01.480 --> 4:34:02.480
 Now is the good stuff.

4:34:02.480 --> 4:34:04.480
 I've been saving it.

4:34:04.480 --> 4:34:11.480
 And I have to say that so much of our lives is forced into these short bursts that I'm

4:34:11.480 --> 4:34:15.480
 just so appreciative to have the chance to have this conversation.

4:34:15.480 --> 4:34:16.480
 So thank you for that one.

4:34:16.480 --> 4:34:18.480
 Some people would say five hours is short, so.

4:34:18.480 --> 4:34:19.480
 Not seeing that.

4:34:19.480 --> 4:34:20.480
 Let's go.

4:34:20.480 --> 4:34:23.480
 And that's it.

4:34:23.480 --> 4:34:30.480
 My girlfriend says that if I was captured and tortured and they were going to interrogate

4:34:30.480 --> 4:34:32.480
 me, it's like at the end they'd say, all right.

4:34:32.480 --> 4:34:34.480
 No, we're sick of this guy.

4:34:34.480 --> 4:34:35.480
 We quit.

4:34:35.480 --> 4:34:36.480
 Let him go.

4:34:36.480 --> 4:34:37.480
 I love it.

4:34:37.480 --> 4:34:43.000
 So background on one shared world, I mentioned I'm on a faculty for Singularity University

4:34:43.000 --> 4:34:48.440
 in the earliest days of the pandemic, I was invited to give a talk on whether the tools

4:34:48.440 --> 4:34:52.480
 of the genetics and biotech revolutions were a match for the outbreak.

4:34:52.480 --> 4:34:57.480
 And my view was then as now that the answer to that question is yes.

4:34:57.480 --> 4:35:02.880
 But I woke up that morning and I felt that that wasn't the most important talk that I

4:35:02.880 --> 4:35:03.880
 could give.

4:35:03.880 --> 4:35:06.200
 There was something else that was more pressing for me.

4:35:06.200 --> 4:35:10.920
 And that was the realization, they were asking the question, well, why weren't we prepared

4:35:10.920 --> 4:35:12.240
 for this pandemic?

4:35:12.240 --> 4:35:15.360
 Because we could have been, we weren't.

4:35:15.360 --> 4:35:23.080
 And because of that, why can't we respond adequately to this outbreak?

4:35:23.080 --> 4:35:28.520
 And then there was the thing, well, even if we respond somehow miraculously overcome

4:35:28.520 --> 4:35:35.600
 this pandemic, it's a periodic victory if we don't prepare ourselves to respond to the

4:35:35.600 --> 4:35:40.160
 broader category of pandemics, particularly as we enter the age of synthetic biology.

4:35:40.160 --> 4:35:46.080
 But if somehow miraculously we solve that problem, but we don't solve the problem of

4:35:46.080 --> 4:35:48.120
 climate change, well, kind of who cares?

4:35:48.120 --> 4:35:51.560
 We didn't have a pandemic, but we wiped everybody out from climate change.

4:35:51.560 --> 4:35:57.240
 And let's just say, you get where this is going, that we organize ourselves and we solve

4:35:57.240 --> 4:35:58.960
 climate change.

4:35:58.960 --> 4:36:04.800
 And then we have a nuclear war because everybody's particularly China now, but US, former Soviet

4:36:04.800 --> 4:36:07.100
 Union are building all of these nuclear weapons.

4:36:07.100 --> 4:36:10.480
 Who cares that we solve climate change because we're all gone anyway?

4:36:10.480 --> 4:36:17.040
 And the meta category bringing all of those things together was this mismatch between

4:36:17.040 --> 4:36:24.280
 the increasingly global and shared nature of the biggest challenges that we face and

4:36:24.280 --> 4:36:29.580
 our inability to solve that entire category of problems.

4:36:29.580 --> 4:36:36.520
 And there's a historical issue, which is that prior to the 30 years war in the 17th century,

4:36:36.520 --> 4:36:42.320
 we had all these different kinds of sovereignty and religious and different kinds of organizational

4:36:42.320 --> 4:36:48.080
 principles and everybody got in this war and in the series of treaties that together are

4:36:48.080 --> 4:36:53.680
 called the piece of Westphalia, the framework for the modern, what we now understand as

4:36:53.680 --> 4:36:55.920
 the modern nation state was late.

4:36:55.920 --> 4:37:03.560
 And then through colonialism and other means, that idea of a state is what it is today spread

4:37:03.560 --> 4:37:06.320
 throughout the world.

4:37:06.320 --> 4:37:12.800
 Then through particularly the late 19th and early 20th century, we realized how unstable

4:37:12.800 --> 4:37:17.760
 that system was because you always had these jockeying between sovereign states and some

4:37:17.760 --> 4:37:21.160
 were rising and some were falling and you ended up in war.

4:37:21.160 --> 4:37:25.720
 And that was the genius of the generations who came together in 1945 in San Francisco

4:37:25.720 --> 4:37:30.920
 and the planning had even started before then who said, well, we can't just have that world.

4:37:30.920 --> 4:37:38.080
 We need to have an overlay and we talked about the UN and the WHO of systems which transcend

4:37:38.080 --> 4:37:39.800
 our national sovereignty.

4:37:39.800 --> 4:37:44.280
 They don't get rid of them, but they transcend them so we can solve this category of problems.

4:37:44.280 --> 4:37:49.680
 But we're now reaching a point where our reach as humans, even individually but collectively,

4:37:49.680 --> 4:37:54.960
 is so great that there's a mismatch between, as I said, the nature of the problems and the

4:37:54.960 --> 4:37:58.240
 ability to solve those problems.

4:37:58.240 --> 4:38:04.320
 And unless we can address that broader global collective action problem, we're going to

4:38:04.320 --> 4:38:08.840
 extinct ourselves and we see these different what I call verticals, whether it's climate

4:38:08.840 --> 4:38:14.720
 change or trying to prevent nuclear weapons proliferation or anything else.

4:38:14.720 --> 4:38:19.640
 But none of those can succeed and frankly, it doesn't even matter if one succeeds because

4:38:19.640 --> 4:38:24.400
 all of them have the potential to lead to extinction level events.

4:38:24.400 --> 4:38:30.000
 So anyway, I gave that talk and that talk went viral.

4:38:30.000 --> 4:38:32.920
 I stayed up all night the next night and I drafted.

4:38:32.920 --> 4:38:37.960
 I think it was like an insanity, but I think a lot of us were manic in those early days

4:38:37.960 --> 4:38:40.280
 of the pandemics wanting to do something.

4:38:40.280 --> 4:38:45.560
 And so I stayed up all night and I drafted what I called a declaration of global interdependence.

4:38:45.560 --> 4:38:49.800
 And I posted that on my website, my jamiemuscle.com, it's still there.

4:38:49.800 --> 4:38:51.920
 And that went viral.

4:38:51.920 --> 4:38:56.600
 And so then I called a meeting just on the people on my personal email list.

4:38:56.600 --> 4:38:59.760
 And so we had people from 25 countries.

4:38:59.760 --> 4:39:02.560
 There were all of these people who were having the same thing.

4:39:02.560 --> 4:39:07.800
 There's something wrong in the world and they wanted to be part of a process of fixing it.

4:39:07.800 --> 4:39:12.960
 And so it was a crazy 35 days where we broke into eight different working groups.

4:39:12.960 --> 4:39:18.800
 We had an amazing team that helped redraft what became the Declaration of Interdependence,

4:39:18.800 --> 4:39:21.520
 which is now in 20 languages.

4:39:21.520 --> 4:39:23.400
 We laid out a work plan.

4:39:23.400 --> 4:39:27.000
 We founded this organization called One Shared World.

4:39:27.000 --> 4:39:29.000
 The URL is oneshared.world.

4:39:29.000 --> 4:39:31.560
 And it's just been this incredible journey.

4:39:31.560 --> 4:39:37.000
 We now have people who are participating in one way or another from 120 different countries.

4:39:37.000 --> 4:39:43.040
 We have our public events exploring these issues, get millions of viewers.

4:39:43.040 --> 4:39:46.760
 We have world leaders who are participating.

4:39:46.760 --> 4:39:52.440
 So the vision is to work on some of these big problems, arbitrary number of problems

4:39:52.440 --> 4:39:56.840
 that present themselves in the world that face all of human civilization and to be able

4:39:56.840 --> 4:39:57.840
 to work together.

4:39:57.840 --> 4:40:04.120
 Well, that is, but there's a macro, a meta problem, which is the global collective action

4:40:04.120 --> 4:40:05.120
 problem.

4:40:05.120 --> 4:40:11.480
 And so the idea is even if we just focus on the verticals, on the manifestations of the

4:40:11.480 --> 4:40:16.600
 global collective action problem, there'll be an infinite number of those things.

4:40:16.600 --> 4:40:22.800
 So while we work on those things like climate change, pandemics, WMD, and other things,

4:40:22.800 --> 4:40:27.480
 we also have to ask the bigger questions of why can't we solve this category of problems.

4:40:27.480 --> 4:40:35.200
 And the idea is, at least from my observation, is that whenever big decisions are being made,

4:40:35.200 --> 4:40:40.120
 our national leaders and corporate leaders are doing exactly what we've hired them to

4:40:40.120 --> 4:40:41.120
 do.

4:40:41.120 --> 4:40:46.400
 They're maximizing for national interest, even or corporate interest, even at the expense

4:40:46.400 --> 4:40:48.640
 of everybody.

4:40:48.640 --> 4:40:52.200
 And so it's not that we want to get rid of states, states are essential in our world

4:40:52.200 --> 4:40:53.200
 system.

4:40:53.200 --> 4:40:58.000
 It's not we want to undermine the UN, which is also essential, but massively underperforming.

4:40:58.000 --> 4:41:03.880
 What we want to do is to create an empowered global constituency of people who are demanding

4:41:03.880 --> 4:41:10.120
 that their leaders at all levels just do a better job of balancing broader and narrower

4:41:10.120 --> 4:41:11.120
 interests.

4:41:11.120 --> 4:41:18.040
 So this is more like a make it more symmetric in terms of power.

4:41:18.040 --> 4:41:24.040
 It's holding accountable the nations, the leaders.

4:41:24.040 --> 4:41:27.040
 The problem is nations are powerful.

4:41:27.040 --> 4:41:29.400
 We talked about China quite a bit.

4:41:29.400 --> 4:41:36.880
 How do you have an organization of citizens of Earth that can solve this collective problem

4:41:36.880 --> 4:41:39.280
 that holds China accountable?

4:41:39.280 --> 4:41:44.040
 It's difficult because the UN, you could say a lot of things, but to call it effective

4:41:44.040 --> 4:41:46.040
 is hard.

4:41:46.040 --> 4:41:55.560
 The internet almost is a kind of representation of a collective force that holds nations accountable.

4:41:55.560 --> 4:42:03.480
 Not to give Twitter too much credit, but social networks broadly speaking.

4:42:03.480 --> 4:42:09.240
 So you have hope that there's possible to build such collections of humans that really

4:42:09.240 --> 4:42:10.880
 resist China.

4:42:10.880 --> 4:42:17.240
 Not necessarily resist China, but our cultures change over time.

4:42:17.240 --> 4:42:23.320
 The idea of the modern nation state would not have made sense to people in the 13th

4:42:23.320 --> 4:42:24.600
 or 14th century.

4:42:24.600 --> 4:42:31.760
 The idea that became the United Nations, it had its earliest days in the philosophies

4:42:31.760 --> 4:42:33.840
 of Kant.

4:42:33.840 --> 4:42:40.000
 It took a long time for these ideas to be realized.

4:42:40.000 --> 4:42:44.840
 And so the idea, and we're far from successful.

4:42:44.840 --> 4:42:47.880
 We've had little minor successes, which we're very proud of.

4:42:47.880 --> 4:42:53.240
 We got the G20 leaders to incorporate the language that we provided on addressing the

4:42:53.240 --> 4:42:59.840
 needs of the world's most vulnerable populations into the final summit communique from the

4:42:59.840 --> 4:43:01.880
 G20 summit in Riyadh.

4:43:01.880 --> 4:43:08.040
 This year, we're just on the verge of having our language pat on the same issue, ensuring

4:43:08.040 --> 4:43:11.960
 everyone on earth has access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene and essential

4:43:11.960 --> 4:43:18.600
 pandemic protection by 2030 passed as part of a resolution in the United Nations General

4:43:18.600 --> 4:43:19.600
 Assembly.

4:43:19.600 --> 4:43:23.640
 And it's, we're primarily, it's young people all around the world.

4:43:23.640 --> 4:43:26.920
 And when I told them in the beginning of this year, this is our goal.

4:43:26.920 --> 4:43:32.280
 We're going to get the UN General Assembly to pass a resolution with our language in it.

4:43:32.280 --> 4:43:38.280
 I mean, first, I think they all thought it was insane, but they were too young and inexperienced

4:43:38.280 --> 4:43:39.880
 to know how insane it was.

4:43:39.880 --> 4:43:43.800
 But now these, these young people are just so excited that it's actually happening.

4:43:43.800 --> 4:43:49.800
 So what we're trying to do is, is really to create a movement, which we don't feel that

4:43:49.800 --> 4:43:53.160
 we need to do from scratch because there are a lot of movements.

4:43:53.160 --> 4:43:59.000
 Like right now, we just had the Glasgow G20, I mean, I'm sorry, the Glasgow climate change,

4:43:59.000 --> 4:44:00.600
 COP26.

4:44:00.600 --> 4:44:06.000
 And then Greta Thunberg, who has a huge following and who is an amazing young woman, but I was

4:44:06.000 --> 4:44:09.000
 kind of disappointed in what she said afterwards.

4:44:09.000 --> 4:44:13.240
 It became like a meme on Twitter, which was blah, blah, blah.

4:44:13.240 --> 4:44:15.240
 And basically it was like, blah, blah, blah.

4:44:15.240 --> 4:44:19.200
 These old people are just screwing around and it's, it's a waste of time.

4:44:19.200 --> 4:44:25.960
 And definitely the critique is merited, but young people have never been more empowered,

4:44:25.960 --> 4:44:29.440
 educated, connected than they are now.

4:44:29.440 --> 4:44:37.040
 And so that's what we've had a process with, with One Shared World, where we partnered

4:44:37.040 --> 4:44:42.080
 with the Model United Nations, the Aga Khan Foundation, the India Sanitation Coalition.

4:44:42.080 --> 4:44:46.440
 And what we did is say, all right, we have this goal, water sanitation, hygiene and pandemic

4:44:46.440 --> 4:44:49.600
 protection for everyone on earth by 2030.

4:44:49.600 --> 4:44:54.920
 And we had debates and consultations using the Model UN framework all around the world

4:44:54.920 --> 4:44:59.680
 in multiple languages, and we said, come up with a plan for how this could be achieved.

4:44:59.680 --> 4:45:04.920
 And these brilliant young people in every country, not every country, most countries,

4:45:04.920 --> 4:45:05.920
 they all contributed.

4:45:05.920 --> 4:45:07.160
 Then we had a plan.

4:45:07.160 --> 4:45:11.920
 Then I recruited friends of mine, like my friend Hans Karel in Sweden, who's the former

4:45:11.920 --> 4:45:17.720
 chief counsel of the whole United Nations, and asked him and others to work with these

4:45:17.720 --> 4:45:24.920
 young people and representative to turn that into what looks exactly like a UN resolution.

4:45:24.920 --> 4:45:28.480
 It's just written by a bunch of kids all around the world.

4:45:28.480 --> 4:45:34.440
 We then sent that to every permanent representative, every government representative at the UN.

4:45:34.440 --> 4:45:38.960
 And that was why working with the German and Spanish governments, why the language essentialized

4:45:38.960 --> 4:45:42.080
 from that document, is about to pass the UN.

4:45:42.080 --> 4:45:46.680
 And it doesn't mean that just passing a UN general assembly resolution changes anything.

4:45:46.680 --> 4:45:50.880
 But we think that there's a model of engaging people, just like you're talking about with

4:45:50.880 --> 4:45:58.120
 these people who are outside of the traditional power structures and who want to have a voice.

4:45:58.120 --> 4:46:03.000
 But I think we need to give a little bit of structure because just going, I'm a big fan

4:46:03.000 --> 4:46:08.560
 of global citizen, but just going to a global citizen concert and waving your iPhone back

4:46:08.560 --> 4:46:14.400
 and forth and tweeting about it isn't enough to drive the kind of change that's required.

4:46:14.400 --> 4:46:20.360
 We need to come together even in nontraditional ways and articulate the change we want and

4:46:20.360 --> 4:46:23.040
 build popular movements to make that happen.

4:46:23.040 --> 4:46:29.960
 And popular means scale and then movements at scale that actually, at the individual level,

4:46:29.960 --> 4:46:35.440
 do something and that's then magnified with the scale to actually have a significant impact.

4:46:35.440 --> 4:46:42.920
 I mean, at its best, you hear a lot of folks talk about the various cryptocurrencies as

4:46:42.920 --> 4:46:44.600
 possibly helping.

4:46:44.600 --> 4:46:50.600
 You have young people get involved in challenging the power structures by challenging the monetary

4:46:50.600 --> 4:46:51.600
 system.

4:46:51.600 --> 4:46:56.800
 And some of it is number go up.

4:46:56.800 --> 4:47:01.280
 People get excited when they can make a little bit of money.

4:47:01.280 --> 4:47:07.840
 But that's actually almost like an entry point because then you almost feel empowered.

4:47:07.840 --> 4:47:13.080
 And because of that, you start to think about some of these philosophical ideas that I as

4:47:13.080 --> 4:47:16.920
 a young person have the power to change the world.

4:47:16.920 --> 4:47:23.120
 All of these senior folks in the position of power, they were like, first of all, they

4:47:23.120 --> 4:47:26.640
 were once young and powerless like me.

4:47:26.640 --> 4:47:30.400
 And I could be part of the next generation that makes a change.

4:47:30.400 --> 4:47:34.800
 Although the things I see that are wrong with the world, I can make it better.

4:47:34.800 --> 4:47:41.800
 And it's very true that the overly powerful nations of the world could be a relic of the

4:47:41.800 --> 4:47:43.600
 past.

4:47:43.600 --> 4:47:52.000
 That could be a 20th century and before idea that was tried, create a lot of benefit.

4:47:52.000 --> 4:47:59.040
 But we also saw the problems with that kind of world, extreme nationalism.

4:47:59.040 --> 4:48:05.560
 We see the benefits and the problems of the Cold War, arguably Cold War got us to the

4:48:05.560 --> 4:48:06.640
 moon.

4:48:06.640 --> 4:48:11.640
 But there could be a lot of other different mechanisms that inspired competition, especially

4:48:11.640 --> 4:48:16.560
 friendly competition between nations versus adversarial competition that resulted in the

4:48:16.560 --> 4:48:22.440
 response to COVID, for example, with China and the United States and Russia and the secrecy,

4:48:22.440 --> 4:48:26.440
 the censorship.

4:48:26.440 --> 4:48:32.720
 All the things that are basically against the spirit of science and resulted in the

4:48:32.720 --> 4:48:37.880
 loss of trillions of dollars in the cost of countless lives.

4:48:37.880 --> 4:48:41.800
 What gives you hope about the future, Jamie?

4:48:41.800 --> 4:48:48.040
 One of the things, you mentioned cryptocurrency and then as you know better than most, there's

4:48:48.040 --> 4:48:53.160
 cryptocurrency and then underneath the cryptocurrency, there's the blockchain and the distributed

4:48:53.160 --> 4:48:54.320
 ledger.

4:48:54.320 --> 4:48:58.560
 And then, like we talked about, there are all these young people who are able to connect

4:48:58.560 --> 4:49:03.360
 with each other, to organize in new ways.

4:49:03.360 --> 4:49:09.600
 And I work with these young people every single day through one shared world primarily, but

4:49:09.600 --> 4:49:11.400
 also other things.

4:49:11.400 --> 4:49:19.040
 And there's so much optimism, there's so much hope that I just have a lot of faith that

4:49:19.040 --> 4:49:20.680
 we're going to figure something out.

4:49:20.680 --> 4:49:27.480
 I'm an optimist by nature and that doesn't mean that we need to be blind to the dangers.

4:49:27.480 --> 4:49:34.840
 There are very, very real dangers, but just given half the chance, people want to be good.

4:49:34.840 --> 4:49:37.280
 People want to do the right thing.

4:49:37.280 --> 4:49:44.480
 And I do believe that there's a role for the at least near term for governments, but there's

4:49:44.480 --> 4:49:47.160
 always a role for leadership.

4:49:47.160 --> 4:49:53.800
 And I'm I guess like a Gramscian in the sense that I think that we need to create frameworks

4:49:53.800 --> 4:49:58.760
 and structures that allow leaders to emerge.

4:49:58.760 --> 4:50:06.560
 And we need to build norms so that the leaders who emerge are leaders who call on us, inspire

4:50:06.560 --> 4:50:10.960
 our best instincts and not drive us toward our worst.

4:50:10.960 --> 4:50:19.600
 But I really see a lot of hope and when you say this all the time in your podcast, and

4:50:19.600 --> 4:50:24.720
 you may even be more optimistic to me because you look at the darkest moments of human history

4:50:24.720 --> 4:50:29.240
 and see hope, but we're kind of a crazy, wonderful species.

4:50:29.240 --> 4:50:34.400
 I mean, yes, we figured out ways to slaughter each other at scale, but we've come up with

4:50:34.400 --> 4:50:38.960
 these wonderful philosophies about love and all of those things.

4:50:38.960 --> 4:50:44.920
 And yeah, maybe the bonobos have some love in their cultures, but we're kind of a wonderful

4:50:44.920 --> 4:50:45.920
 magical species.

4:50:45.920 --> 4:50:52.080
 And if we just can create enough of an infrastructure, it doesn't need to be and shouldn't be controlling

4:50:52.080 --> 4:50:57.640
 just enough of an infrastructure so that people are stakeholders, feel like they're stakeholders

4:50:57.640 --> 4:51:00.320
 in contributing to a positive story.

4:51:00.320 --> 4:51:04.640
 I just really feel that the sky is the limit.

4:51:04.640 --> 4:51:08.640
 So if there's somebody who's young right now, or somebody in high school, somebody in college

4:51:08.640 --> 4:51:12.600
 listening to you, you've done a lot of incredible things.

4:51:12.600 --> 4:51:22.080
 You're respected by a lot of the elites, you're respected by the people, so you're both able

4:51:22.080 --> 4:51:32.880
 to speak to all groups, walk through the fire, like you mentioned with this lab leak.

4:51:32.880 --> 4:51:39.000
 What advice would you give to young kids today that are inspired by your story?

4:51:39.000 --> 4:51:40.000
 Well, thank you.

4:51:40.000 --> 4:51:46.320
 I mean, I think there's one, there's lots of, I'm honored if anybody is inspired, but

4:51:46.320 --> 4:51:51.680
 it's the same thing as I said with the science that it's all about values.

4:51:51.680 --> 4:51:55.640
 The core of everything is knowing who you are.

4:51:55.640 --> 4:52:02.720
 And so yes, I mean, there's the broader thing of following your passions, a creative mind

4:52:02.720 --> 4:52:08.120
 and an inquisitive mind is the core of everything because the knowledge base is constantly sharing,

4:52:08.120 --> 4:52:10.640
 so learning how to learn.

4:52:10.640 --> 4:52:16.880
 But at the core of everything is investing in knowing who you are and what you stand

4:52:16.880 --> 4:52:25.400
 for because that's the way, that's the path to leading a meaningful life, to contributing,

4:52:25.400 --> 4:52:33.560
 to not feeling alienated from your life as you get older and just like you live, it's

4:52:33.560 --> 4:52:39.520
 an ongoing process and we all make mistakes and we all kind of travel down wrong paths

4:52:39.520 --> 4:52:44.880
 and just have some love for yourself and recognize that just at every, like I was saying with

4:52:44.880 --> 4:52:52.040
 the Iron Man, just when you think there's no possibility that you can go on, there's

4:52:52.040 --> 4:52:58.220
 a 100% possibility that you can go on and just when you think that nothing better will

4:52:58.220 --> 4:53:03.960
 happen to you, there's a 100% chance that something better will happen to you, you just

4:53:03.960 --> 4:53:04.960
 got to keep going.

4:53:04.960 --> 4:53:08.720
 Jamie, this I've been a fan of yours.

4:53:08.720 --> 4:53:15.240
 I think first heard you on your Rogan experience, but been following your work, your bold, fearless

4:53:15.240 --> 4:53:21.520
 work with speaking about the lab leak and everything you represent from your brilliance

4:53:21.520 --> 4:53:27.800
 to your kindness and the fact that you spend your valuable time with me today and now I

4:53:27.800 --> 4:53:35.120
 officially made you miss your flight and the fact that you said that whether you were being

4:53:35.120 --> 4:53:39.760
 nice or not, I don't know that you would be okay with that means the world to me and

4:53:39.760 --> 4:53:42.440
 I'm really honored that you will spend your time with me today.

4:53:42.440 --> 4:53:48.680
 Well, really, it's been such a great pleasure and thank you for creating a forum to have

4:53:48.680 --> 4:53:55.640
 these kinds of long conversations, so I really enjoyed it and thank you and if anybody has

4:53:55.640 --> 4:54:01.080
 now listened for what's it been, five and a half hours?

4:54:01.080 --> 4:54:02.080
 Thank you for listening.

4:54:02.080 --> 4:54:03.080
 Welcome.

4:54:03.080 --> 4:54:04.080
 Five hour club.

4:54:04.080 --> 4:54:05.080
 Exactly.

4:54:05.080 --> 4:54:06.080
 Represent.

4:54:06.080 --> 4:54:07.080
 Thank you, Jamie.

4:54:07.080 --> 4:54:08.080
 Thanks, Lex.

4:54:08.080 --> 4:54:09.080
 This is awesome.

4:54:09.080 --> 4:54:11.560
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Jamie Metzel.

4:54:11.560 --> 4:54:16.160
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

4:54:16.160 --> 4:54:21.680
 And now let me leave you some words from Richard Feynman about science and religion, which

4:54:21.680 --> 4:54:27.120
 I think also applies to science and geopolitics because I believe scientists have the responsibility

4:54:27.120 --> 4:54:31.880
 to think broadly about the world so that they may understand the bigger impact of their

4:54:31.880 --> 4:54:33.520
 inventions.

4:54:33.520 --> 4:54:39.520
 The quote goes like this, in this age of specialization, men who thoroughly know one field

4:54:39.520 --> 4:54:43.040
 are often incompetent to discuss another.

4:54:43.040 --> 4:54:47.840
 The old problems, such as the relation of science and religion, are still with us and

4:54:47.840 --> 4:54:53.960
 I believe present as difficult dilemmas as ever, but they are not often publicly discussed

4:54:53.960 --> 4:54:57.960
 because of the limitations of specialization.

4:54:57.960 --> 4:55:14.040
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
