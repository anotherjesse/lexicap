00:00.000 --> 00:02.120
 The following is a conversation with John Clark.

00:02.520 --> 00:06.680
 He's a friend, a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu black belt, former MMA

00:06.680 --> 00:10.160
 fighter, and at least in my opinion, one of the great UFC

00:10.160 --> 00:11.760
 cornermen coaches to listen to.

00:12.280 --> 00:16.320
 And also he's my current Jiu Jitsu coach at Broadway Jiu Jitsu in

00:16.320 --> 00:17.160
 South Boston.

00:17.680 --> 00:23.160
 He was once for a time a philosophy major in college and is now,

00:23.280 --> 00:27.000
 I would say, a kind of practicing philosopher, opinionated,

00:27.000 --> 00:30.920
 brilliant, and someone I always enjoy talking to, even when,

00:31.360 --> 00:35.120
 especially when we disagree, which we do often.

00:35.840 --> 00:38.520
 He's definitely someone I can see talking to many times on this

00:38.520 --> 00:39.160
 podcast.

00:39.600 --> 00:44.920
 In fact, he hosts a new podcast of his own called, Please Allow

00:44.920 --> 00:45.240
 Me.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.040
 Quick mention of each sponsor followed by some thoughts

00:49.040 --> 00:50.120
 related to the episode.

00:50.520 --> 00:54.640
 Thank you to TheraGun, the device I use for post workout muscle

00:54.640 --> 00:58.600
 recovery, magic spoon, low carb, keto friendly cereal that I

00:58.600 --> 01:03.000
 think is delicious, aid sleep, a mattress that cools itself and

01:03.000 --> 01:07.360
 gives me yet another reason to enjoy sleep, and Cash App, the

01:07.360 --> 01:08.920
 app I use to send money to friends.

01:09.400 --> 01:12.400
 Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a

01:12.400 --> 01:14.320
 discount and to support this podcast.

01:15.160 --> 01:18.360
 As a side note, let me say that martial arts, especially Jiu

01:18.360 --> 01:21.640
 Jitsu and Judo have been a big part of my growth as a human

01:21.640 --> 01:25.040
 being, so I think I will talk to a few martial artists on

01:25.040 --> 01:26.440
 occasion on this podcast.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.840
 I hope that is of interest to you.

01:29.160 --> 01:31.920
 I won't talk to people who are simply great fighters or great

01:31.920 --> 01:35.440
 athletes, but people who have a philosophy that I find to be

01:35.440 --> 01:39.520
 interesting and worth exploring, even if I disagree with parts

01:39.760 --> 01:40.440
 or most of it.

01:41.200 --> 01:43.480
 I like alternating between historians and computer

01:43.480 --> 01:47.000
 scientists, fighters and biologists, and between totally

01:47.000 --> 01:51.280
 different world views and personalities like Elon Musk and

01:51.280 --> 01:52.280
 Michael Malice.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.640
 This world, to me, is fascinating because of the

01:56.640 --> 01:59.920
 diversity of weirdness that is human civilization.

02:00.640 --> 02:04.000
 I love the weird and the brilliant, and hope you join

02:04.000 --> 02:05.680
 me on the journey of exploring both.

02:06.320 --> 02:08.440
 If you don't like an episode, skip it.

02:09.040 --> 02:12.520
 For an OCD person like myself, sometimes not listening to a

02:12.520 --> 02:15.000
 podcast episode is an act of courage.

02:15.720 --> 02:18.720
 It's like not finishing a book even though you're 80% done.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.240
 Try it sometimes.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.160
 Listen to the ones you like, and don't listen to the ones you

02:23.160 --> 02:23.840
 don't like.

02:24.200 --> 02:26.160
 I know it's profound advice.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.960

02:38.000 --> 02:41.760
 And now here's my conversation with John Clark.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.760
 You ready for this?

02:44.360 --> 02:45.720
 I've been ready for this my whole life.

02:45.880 --> 02:46.400
 All right.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.760
 I was thinking of doing a Kerouac style road trip across

02:49.760 --> 02:53.720
 the United States, you know, after this whole COVID thing

02:53.720 --> 02:55.760
 lifts, you ever take a trip like that?

02:56.280 --> 03:01.040
 I've done a handful of long distance driving trips, up and

03:01.040 --> 03:04.760
 down the East Coast, but also from the West Coast, back to

03:04.760 --> 03:07.680
 the East Coast, and then returning to California.

03:08.160 --> 03:11.600
 So I've definitely done my fair share of driving in this

03:11.600 --> 03:12.080
 country.

03:12.080 --> 03:14.680
 Do you have the longing for the great American road trip?

03:15.920 --> 03:18.560
 I think there are so many things that I've been lucky

03:18.560 --> 03:21.560
 enough to see in the world that I now, at this point in my

03:21.560 --> 03:24.920
 life, realize there are tons of things that I need to see here

03:25.160 --> 03:27.600
 in this country, and a road trip could potentially be the

03:27.600 --> 03:29.200
 best way to see them.

03:30.480 --> 03:33.560
 I think to do it effectively, you need an amount of time

03:33.880 --> 03:36.240
 where you can be as leisurely as possible.

03:36.280 --> 03:39.080
 There's no deadline and there's no, I've got to make it from

03:39.080 --> 03:42.480
 Chicago to St. Louis by sundown to get to this place at this

03:42.480 --> 03:42.880
 time.

03:43.240 --> 03:47.800
 I think you really need to be able to take your time and kind

03:47.800 --> 03:51.200
 of like let the road take you where you need to go.

03:51.240 --> 03:52.640
 It feels like you need a mission though.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.480
 Ultimately, like there's a reason you need to be in San

03:55.480 --> 03:56.040
 Francisco.

03:56.040 --> 03:57.320
 That's like the Kerouac thing.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.240
 You have to meet somebody somewhere kind of loosely in a

04:00.240 --> 04:05.440
 few weeks, and then it's the, as you struggle on towards

04:05.440 --> 04:08.200
 that mission, you meet weird characters that get in your

04:08.200 --> 04:11.120
 way, but ultimately sort of create an experience.

04:11.440 --> 04:14.480
 I think having a loose deadline is good, but that's a

04:14.480 --> 04:15.680
 beginning and an end point.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.440
 And what I mean is I don't want to have to be, all right,

04:18.440 --> 04:21.440
 we're leaving, say Boston on Sunday night.

04:21.840 --> 04:24.680
 Let's get to New York by Monday morning.

04:24.800 --> 04:27.560
 And then from New York, we're going to go to Philly, and we've

04:27.560 --> 04:28.840
 got to be in Philly at four.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.840
 A vague beginning and end is fine, but I think having very

04:32.840 --> 04:37.240
 strict guidelines in between will rob you of certain

04:37.240 --> 04:38.640
 experiences along the way.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.120
 If you have a timeframe to get from Philly to Indianapolis,

04:43.120 --> 04:45.840
 in some awesome shit starts to happen in Philly, do you really

04:45.840 --> 04:47.520
 want to have to cut it short because you've got to be in

04:47.520 --> 04:49.120
 Indianapolis by sunup?

04:49.560 --> 04:52.720
 Why do you have to be anywhere by any time for any reason?

04:52.720 --> 04:53.200
 Really?

04:53.680 --> 04:54.440
 Well, plans change.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.280
 Plans change all the time, exactly.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.720
 But if we're talking about having a mission or the type of

05:00.720 --> 05:04.120
 road trip, I just think it would be best to have it as loose

05:04.160 --> 05:06.120
 and flexible as possible.

05:06.880 --> 05:07.520
 I don't know.

05:07.520 --> 05:12.040
 You got to make hard deadlines and then break them, totally

05:12.040 --> 05:14.920
 change the plans, disappoint people, break promises.

05:15.280 --> 05:16.320
 That's the way of life.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.480
 Somebody's waiting for you in St. Louis, and all of a sudden

05:19.480 --> 05:23.000
 you fell in love with a biker in New York.

05:23.280 --> 05:23.840
 I don't know.

05:23.880 --> 05:24.880
 I don't know what you're up to.

05:25.080 --> 05:26.200
 I can appreciate that.

05:27.760 --> 05:33.080
 But on a trip like that, I feel like a trip with deadlines is

05:33.080 --> 05:34.400
 for a different point in your life.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.880
 And at this point in my life, I don't want any of the deadlines

05:37.160 --> 05:40.280
 because it's not about meeting someone and disappointing them

05:40.280 --> 05:41.040
 in St. Louis.

05:41.040 --> 05:44.280
 It's about me not disappointing myself.

05:44.760 --> 05:48.320
 You want to have enough time in what you're doing to make sure

05:48.320 --> 05:51.840
 that you get the full breadth of every experience that you encounter.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.320
 How would you fully experience a place?

05:54.720 --> 05:55.280
 How would you?

05:55.280 --> 05:57.840
 You know, I don't think I've actually fully experienced Boston.

05:58.160 --> 06:02.240
 Like how, if you were showing up to a city for a week on this road

06:02.240 --> 06:03.520
 trip, what would you do?

06:03.840 --> 06:05.720
 So I'm going to answer that in two parts.

06:06.000 --> 06:08.280
 A few years ago, I had an opportunity to move out of Boston.

06:08.280 --> 06:11.880
 And the thing that kept me here, no question about it, was the fact

06:11.880 --> 06:17.400
 that I felt like I had a contract with my students and I did not.

06:17.720 --> 06:22.400
 I felt like a great many of them took a leap of faith by joining my gym

06:22.400 --> 06:25.120
 and like, you know, asking me to teach them what I know.

06:25.360 --> 06:29.720
 And when I had an opportunity to leave Boston, I thought of those people

06:29.960 --> 06:32.120
 and I thought, I want to fulfill my obligation to them.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.400
 So because I made a decision to stay here, I then that summer made a

06:36.400 --> 06:38.680
 decision to endear myself to the city of Boston.

06:38.680 --> 06:41.280
 And I tried to find lots and lots of different things to do.

06:41.720 --> 06:44.680
 I can tell you that the coolest thing that I found to do in this city

06:44.680 --> 06:50.240
 is the MFA, where they have like on Friday nights, they'll have

06:50.240 --> 06:51.640
 like different exhibits and stuff.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.560
 And they'll have like little beer carts and food tents.

06:54.560 --> 06:58.840
 And you can go do a painting class off in the, on the side, very

06:58.840 --> 07:00.400
 cool night of things to do.

07:00.960 --> 07:05.520
 But in general, whenever I'm in a new city, I try not to pay attention

07:05.520 --> 07:09.240
 to Google and I try not to do anything that I find on a travel site.

07:09.640 --> 07:13.320
 The best thing to do is to walk out of your hotel or wherever it is you're

07:13.320 --> 07:18.520
 staying and find the most normal looking bar, have a drink and talk to a bar tender.

07:18.760 --> 07:22.920
 So the people, the people, the people, and then you can experience that town,

07:22.920 --> 07:26.240
 the way that they experience it, even in a city where there are tons

07:26.240 --> 07:31.760
 of tourist attractions, locals probably visit the same tourist attractions

07:31.760 --> 07:33.320
 when they have visitors come from out of town.

07:33.320 --> 07:37.040
 But you want to see how they view those places and how they visit them.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.920
 And you want to go to eat where they're going to eat.

07:39.960 --> 07:44.640
 Like, you know, you're going to, for the most part, the North End is not

07:44.640 --> 07:48.960
 a place where I would take someone and say, Hey, this is Boston's, the

07:48.960 --> 07:51.760
 pinnacle of Boston dining, because it's very touristy.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.360
 There are a handful of really good restaurants there.

07:53.600 --> 07:57.160
 But I want to know where the, where the, I want to go to Bogie's place.

07:57.160 --> 08:00.920
 I want to know like the down low spots where the hell's Bogie's place.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.160
 It's like a little steakhouse in the back of jam, Curly's, exactly.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.080
 It's like a shitty bar, jam, Curly's.

08:06.080 --> 08:08.240
 No, it's just a bar with like bar food.

08:08.480 --> 08:12.440
 But I think that like, it's not Boston, it is in Boston.

08:12.440 --> 08:13.520
 Yeah, it's like South Boston.

08:13.520 --> 08:18.040
 No, it's in, it's in the downtown area.

08:18.040 --> 08:21.760
 Like, I don't know what the neighborhoods are called here, honestly,

08:21.760 --> 08:24.680
 because they call, they, they have an area called downtown Boston.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.280
 And I don't even know what the hell that means.

08:26.560 --> 08:27.720
 And they used to have financial districts.

08:27.720 --> 08:31.080
 Where's Southie, because I've heard about this, Southie.

08:31.080 --> 08:32.440
 Southie is South Boston.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.080
 But is there, is there a difference in South Boston, Southie?

08:36.400 --> 08:37.320
 No, it's the same thing.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.400
 No, but like, you know, the mythical Southie.

08:39.400 --> 08:43.800
 I think the mythical Southie is something that's long gone now.

08:44.040 --> 08:48.200
 And the term now actually is Sobo.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.560
 Oh, no.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.000
 Yeah, it's, it's changed.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.400
 What, who, who took over?

08:52.400 --> 08:55.240
 What, what's the, you know, the goodwill hunting personality?

08:55.240 --> 08:56.200
 That's Southie, isn't it?

08:56.200 --> 08:58.280
 Strong accent, those badass dudes.

08:58.360 --> 09:02.200
 I came here right at the end of like, what was South Boston?

09:02.200 --> 09:07.120
 So when I got, and my gym is in South Boston, the neighborhood was just starting to change.

09:07.400 --> 09:16.640
 So I think as gentrification happened and they started building more luxury condominiums,

09:16.800 --> 09:19.760
 they were buying all these old businesses out, all the mom and pop businesses.

09:19.760 --> 09:25.760
 And I think that kind of changed the, the makeup of the community.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.400
 And it wasn't only because there was an influx of new young people with disposable

09:30.400 --> 09:35.240
 income is because there's an exodus of the older people who kind of grew up and raised

09:35.240 --> 09:38.960
 their families there because they were being offered humongous sums of money for their homes

09:38.960 --> 09:42.280
 that they had bought like in the late seventies and early eighties so that they could develop

09:42.280 --> 09:42.880
 those areas.

09:43.160 --> 09:47.440
 So you have a combination of the influx of new people and the exodus of the old.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.680
 And now you just got this totally new neighborhood in its place.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.400
 What do you love about Boston?

09:53.400 --> 09:56.320
 Is there a love still for Boston?

09:58.440 --> 10:01.640
 You certainly have the love of the thing that's gone as well.

10:01.680 --> 10:06.640
 Yeah, I think I don't want to pinpoint pin this on Boston because it's happening in all great cities.

10:07.920 --> 10:12.160
 As these areas become gentrified, what's happening is the personality and the character

10:12.160 --> 10:14.280
 of the neighborhood is just being run out.

10:14.840 --> 10:18.160
 And I have nothing against people coming in and making money and things like that.

10:18.160 --> 10:22.920
 But when you do it at the expense of the culture, the character and the personality

10:22.920 --> 10:27.120
 of the neighborhood, I mean, you're kind of standing on the shoulders of giants.

10:27.120 --> 10:29.480
 These are the people that came here and built these areas up.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.760
 It happens here in Boston.

10:31.760 --> 10:36.160
 It happens in all over New York, happens on the West Coast.

10:36.640 --> 10:42.360
 So what I love about Boston is not nearly as romantic as what it might have been 15

10:42.360 --> 10:44.520
 years ago and what I used to love about New York.

10:45.000 --> 10:49.800
 What I love about Boston is that it's walkable.

10:49.800 --> 10:54.200
 Well, the food scene is on the rise here.

10:55.800 --> 11:02.400
 But I think you're hard pressed to find the charm that people think of when they think

11:02.400 --> 11:04.480
 of old Boston and old New England city.

11:04.560 --> 11:05.840
 Yeah, I see it differently.

11:05.840 --> 11:11.160
 People sometimes criticize like MIT for the thing that it is now.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.360
 But I think it is always like that.

11:13.360 --> 11:21.000
 I tend to prefer to carry the flame of the greatness, the greatest moments of its history

11:21.320 --> 11:26.080
 and like sort of enjoy that, the echoes of that in the halls of MIT.

11:26.080 --> 11:31.640
 In the same way in Boston, you think about the history and that history lives on in the few individuals.

11:32.000 --> 11:37.440
 Like you can't just look around where Boston is now and be like, what has Boston become?

11:37.640 --> 11:42.000
 I think it was always carried by a minority of individuals.

11:42.000 --> 11:47.280
 I think we kind of look back in history and think like times were greater in a certain

11:47.280 --> 11:53.560
 kind of dimension back then, but that's because we remember this is a ridiculous,

11:53.800 --> 12:00.960
 non data driven assertion of mine is to remember just the the the brightest stars of that history.

12:01.200 --> 12:02.720
 And so we romanticize it.

12:02.720 --> 12:06.480
 But I think if you look around now, those special people are still living in Boston.

12:06.480 --> 12:10.120
 For which Boston will be remembered as a great city in like 50 years.

12:10.120 --> 12:11.840
 I think you're probably right.

12:11.840 --> 12:19.040
 But isn't there some sort of theory about the point that there's like a certain age in your life

12:19.040 --> 12:21.040
 where things resonate differently to you?

12:21.040 --> 12:26.440
 Like I think they've done studies where most people stop searching for new music after age 19.

12:26.640 --> 12:32.480
 Most dads you see like wearing super old clothes, like that's the style of the time period

12:32.480 --> 12:34.440
 of the last great part of their life.

12:34.640 --> 12:40.040
 So like there's an evolution in people and it could also be the most important thing

12:40.040 --> 12:41.440
 in the memories of where they live.

12:41.640 --> 12:46.280
 And when I was 17, of course, my neighborhood was the best then because I was having the most fun.

12:46.480 --> 12:50.400
 And we always kind of look at things through that that tint, I think.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.680
 And you're right.

12:51.880 --> 12:55.400
 And I don't think there's anything wrong with the way cities are evolving now.

12:55.600 --> 13:02.720
 It's just not I I prefer to time of like a mom and pop store, not a fabricated

13:02.920 --> 13:08.280
 like gastropub that could just be like on a four lane super highway on your

13:08.280 --> 13:13.120
 way out of Epcot Center and it's actually owned by like some conglomerate.

13:13.320 --> 13:19.080
 But there's still the special places like I this takes us back to the road trip is

13:19.280 --> 13:25.520
 maybe I tend to romanticize the experiences of like the diners in the middle of nowhere.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.200
 What would you say makes for like

13:29.400 --> 13:36.080
 it feels like life is made up of these experiences that maybe on paper seem mundane,

13:36.080 --> 13:43.280
 but are actually somehow give you a chance to pause and reflect on life with like a certain

13:43.480 --> 13:47.600
 kind of people, whether like really close friends or complete strangers,

13:47.800 --> 13:50.000
 maybe alcohol is involved in the middle of nowhere.

13:50.200 --> 13:53.720
 It seems like a road trip facilitates that if you allow it to.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.960
 Like what do you think makes for those kinds of experience?

13:56.160 --> 13:57.480
 Have you had any?

13:57.680 --> 14:02.480
 I think in the context of a road trip, I think it's like hyper localization.

14:02.480 --> 14:13.120
 And I think it is those those experiences along the way with people and

14:13.320 --> 14:17.600
 the people that you're with will color the experiences differently depending on the person.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.960
 The road trip you took was with somebody else or alone.

14:20.160 --> 14:26.480
 So I've driven up and down the East Coast several times when I drove from LA to New York.

14:26.680 --> 14:29.680
 My friend was on the run from the cops.

14:29.880 --> 14:30.200
 Yeah.

14:30.200 --> 14:33.200
 So we were trying to get traffic tickets.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.400
 Yeah, traffic tickets.

14:34.600 --> 14:39.400
 Yeah, allegedly we were trying to get out of LA because he was going to have to go away

14:39.600 --> 14:40.280
 for a little while.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.800
 So we drove from LA and we just, you know, we're young kids.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.880
 We had no idea what we were doing and we drove east and then, you know,

14:48.080 --> 14:52.040
 we had an unbelievable trip mostly because we didn't really have a destination.

14:52.040 --> 14:53.280
 We didn't really have a time frame.

14:53.480 --> 14:56.840
 Thank goodness, because he got arrested again in Pennsylvania.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.840
 So we got kind of stuck there.

14:58.840 --> 15:05.600
 And then, you know, and then we drove back to LA when he got out in Pennsylvania.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.680
 But all the stops along the way

15:08.880 --> 15:11.840
 were kind of like weird things like you have no money, right?

15:12.040 --> 15:16.600
 So you're finding that like a little diamond in the rough place to eat the diner you talk

15:16.800 --> 15:18.000
 about like that place.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.600
 I once was in, where was I?

15:20.800 --> 15:23.320
 I think I was in Buenos Aires and the guy that I was with,

15:23.520 --> 15:26.640
 he said, I know this quaint little spot around the corner.

15:26.640 --> 15:30.720
 And I was young, I was like 25 and I thought the coolest thing in the world

15:30.920 --> 15:35.200
 would be to be such a citizen of the world that you know these quaint little

15:35.400 --> 15:37.920
 spots around the corner in like all these great cities.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.160
 Like I know where to get this great chicken sandwich in Argentina.

15:41.360 --> 15:43.720
 I know where to get this great meal in Costa Rica.

15:43.920 --> 15:47.960
 I know where to get this super local like egg in another country.

15:48.160 --> 15:49.640
 I just thought that that was really cool.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.240
 The ability to do that anywhere in the world.

15:52.440 --> 15:55.440
 Did you get closer with that guy when through the trip?

15:55.440 --> 16:00.720
 I found that like, so I took a trip across the United States with a guy friend of mine.

16:00.920 --> 16:02.000
 We had different goals.

16:02.200 --> 16:06.400
 I was searching for a meaning in life and he was searching for

16:06.600 --> 16:09.360
 what's the politically correct way of phrasing it.

16:09.560 --> 16:15.040
 But just basically trying to sleep with every kind of woman that this world has to offer.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.760
 What's the difference between those two things?

16:16.960 --> 16:20.920
 Well, I guess he was searching for the different kinds of meanings.

16:20.920 --> 16:27.360
 I mean, I just I still think that you can't find meaning between a woman's legs,

16:27.560 --> 16:31.440
 I suppose that made you try to all of them.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.880
 But there was a tension there.

16:34.080 --> 16:38.520
 We grew closer with those experiences, but we've gotten in fights.

16:38.720 --> 16:43.160
 You know, there was a lot of like literal almost fights and then we're close.

16:43.360 --> 16:47.600
 And there was like silences, but then we were like brothers and this whole weird

16:47.800 --> 16:49.800
 journey of friendship that we went on.

16:49.800 --> 16:55.400
 I think any time you spend that much time in like a small space with another person,

16:55.600 --> 16:59.160
 you're going to have the the different parts of the relationship will manifest themselves.

16:59.160 --> 17:00.560
 You'll have the periods of closeness.

17:00.760 --> 17:04.080
 You'll have the periods of vulnerability where it's like maybe you're driving

17:04.080 --> 17:06.800
 through Denver and it's three in the morning and you talk about something you

17:06.800 --> 17:08.320
 might not have otherwise talked about.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.640
 You'll have the periods where you don't want to see that motherfucker ever again,

17:11.840 --> 17:16.320
 right? He didn't and depending could be because of anything.

17:16.320 --> 17:21.720
 But the guy that I drove twice with, we are still we're still in contact.

17:21.920 --> 17:22.680
 We're still buddies.

17:22.880 --> 17:26.760
 We we have very different goals also.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.800
 But at that point in our lives, we were not.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.480
 We never even contemplated the meaning of life.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.360
 We were about

17:33.560 --> 17:35.680
 probably more to the point of the friend that you drove with.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.640
 We were more about racking up experiences, whatever they were.

17:38.840 --> 17:39.840
 Right.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.840
 I want to be able to retell this.

17:42.040 --> 17:42.520
 Hmm.

17:42.720 --> 17:43.200
 Stories.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.880
 Yeah, I want to be able to retell this and it's got to sound cool.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.800
 Like, I don't want to retell the story about, yeah, and then we drove through

17:49.800 --> 17:53.320
 Alabama and they've got a lovely library and I checked out this book and, you know,

17:53.320 --> 17:54.520
 I'm not interested in retelling that.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.720
 Do you remember any?

17:56.920 --> 17:58.080
 Well, this is a kids show.

17:58.280 --> 18:02.800
 Do you remember any stories that the kids would enjoy from those times that were

18:03.000 --> 18:05.120
 profound in some kind of way?

18:05.320 --> 18:08.040
 There were some impactful moments

18:08.240 --> 18:12.320
 on the beginning of our road trip where we had no money and as a couple of kids who

18:12.320 --> 18:17.200
 knew nothing, we literally had to, we stopped in Vegas and we went to Circus Circus

18:17.400 --> 18:21.560
 at the time they had $3 blackjack and we had like 12 bucks and my buddy was a kind

18:21.560 --> 18:23.400
 of a degenerate gambler, so he knew what was up.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.240
 I was just like kind of stuffing chips in my pockets, making sure we could pay for

18:26.440 --> 18:32.280
 the gas and just being at the point, which is like a starting line and like we drove

18:32.480 --> 18:37.120
 from LA to Vegas, which is only about four hours and being at the starting line

18:37.320 --> 18:40.880
 and realizing like we may not even like get off the starting line here.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.520
 And if we don't, what are we doing?

18:42.520 --> 18:44.600
 We're going to be two guys stuck in Vegas with no money.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.680
 We can't go west because you're going to get pinched.

18:46.680 --> 18:47.920
 We have no money to go east.

18:47.920 --> 18:48.720
 What the hell are we going to do?

18:48.720 --> 18:51.280
 We're going to wind up in Vegas.

18:51.480 --> 18:55.040
 So, you know, that that was kind of a profound thing where you just

18:55.240 --> 18:58.960
 it's a turning it potentially could have been a turning point in our lives.

18:59.160 --> 19:03.680
 Had we not made enough money to continue going east?

19:03.880 --> 19:07.680
 That's the beautiful thing about road trips when you're broke is like

19:07.680 --> 19:12.920
 in retrospect, everything turned out fine, but you're facing the complete

19:13.120 --> 19:16.400
 darkness, the uncertainty of the possibilities laid before you.

19:16.600 --> 19:21.720
 And like, I don't know if you were confident at that time, but like I was

19:21.920 --> 19:27.240
 really full of self doubt, like just like all I could see is all the trajectories

19:27.240 --> 19:28.520
 where you just screw up your life.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.800
 Like, what am I doing with my life?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.280
 I'm a failure like all these dreams I've had.

19:32.280 --> 19:34.600
 I've never realized I'm a complete piece of shit.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.760
 All those kinds of I had no concept of consequence.

19:37.960 --> 19:41.760
 I like I was I probably had toxoplasmosis.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.800
 I had literally no concept of consequence.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.160
 Immediate gratification was all I cared about.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.640
 Oh, so existentialist.

19:48.840 --> 19:55.440
 Yeah, it did not it did not even enter my mind at in my like early 20s that

19:55.640 --> 19:59.400
 anything that I was doing at that point could reverberate for the rest of my life.

19:59.600 --> 20:02.160
 I think part of me didn't even think I'd make it this far.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.520
 And so I was not interested in like the long play.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.720
 I remember thinking like, why should I be acting now in a way that might impact a

20:09.920 --> 20:11.720
 point in my life I never reach?

20:11.920 --> 20:18.480
 And yet now you are a man who searches for meaning in life, at least.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.080
 I would say to put another way, you have

20:22.280 --> 20:28.160
 you think deeply about this world and in a philosophical context, while also

20:28.160 --> 20:35.400
 appreciating the violence of hurting other friends of yours, right?

20:35.600 --> 20:36.400
 On a regular basis.

20:36.600 --> 20:40.680
 So what why do you think I mean, maybe there's a broader question there,

20:40.880 --> 20:42.240
 but also a personal question.

20:42.440 --> 20:47.000
 It seems that people who fight

20:47.200 --> 20:50.040
 for prolonged periods of time, like Jiu Jitsu people,

20:50.240 --> 20:54.400
 a martial arts mixed martial arts people, even military folks,

20:54.600 --> 20:57.160
 become over time philosophers.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.240
 What what is that?

20:58.440 --> 21:03.040
 Is that is there a parallel between fighting and violence and the philosophical

21:03.240 --> 21:06.840
 depth with which you now have a right from the starting point of being the full

21:07.040 --> 21:13.360
 existentialist of like just living in the moment to like being introspective

21:13.560 --> 21:20.680
 human now, I would say to that being a soldier or a warrior

21:20.880 --> 21:25.800
 hundreds of years ago is probably what started the marriage between martial

21:25.800 --> 21:27.920
 arts and philosophy.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.440
 If you're constantly under someone else's charge and you're told to go out and walk

21:32.640 --> 21:40.520
 in a line and overtake some Germanic tribe somewhere and that happens all the time,

21:40.720 --> 21:42.760
 your job is being a soldier.

21:42.960 --> 21:46.360
 There's on any given day, you might not come home.

21:46.560 --> 21:50.480
 So I think that you have to start your day by thinking deeply about

21:50.680 --> 21:54.280
 how you've lived to that point and the people that are living in and around you

21:54.280 --> 21:58.160
 and how you've treated them and I think that probably is what started the marriage

21:58.360 --> 22:02.200
 of being kind of like a philosophical martial artist.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.720
 You've got to really like

22:04.920 --> 22:09.840
 on a daily basis take stock of of what's going on around you and inside you

22:10.040 --> 22:13.680
 because we all suffer with this kind of idea.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.400
 If today is my last day, did I do it right?

22:16.400 --> 22:19.600
 And we don't really do it so much nowadays because we're so comfortable.

22:19.800 --> 22:22.080
 But if we're being marched out to war every day,

22:22.080 --> 22:25.680
 I think you'd see people live a little bit differently.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.880
 You know, and you treat the people around you a little bit differently.

22:29.080 --> 22:34.240
 Do you think there's echoes of that in just even the sport of like grappling

22:34.440 --> 22:36.880
 and Jiu Jitsu where you're facing your own mortality?

22:37.080 --> 22:39.360
 We don't really think of it that way, but.

22:39.560 --> 22:43.600
 To be honest, I think that a lot of people that train in a martial art

22:43.800 --> 22:47.720
 in contemporary society, I don't consider them all martial artists.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.440
 I think just because you train a martial art does not mean you're a martial artist.

22:51.440 --> 22:55.400
 There are so many people that use martial arts as a form of exercise

22:55.600 --> 22:59.880
 and like this little piece of self concept.

23:00.080 --> 23:04.600
 They use martial arts as a tagline in their Instagram bio.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.400
 And it's really a form of exercise.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.560
 It's something they do.

23:07.760 --> 23:09.040
 It's not something they are.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.480
 And I think there's a big difference there.

23:11.680 --> 23:13.520
 There's a bunch of stuff mixed up in there

23:13.720 --> 23:17.600
 because the Instagram thing is something you do for.

23:17.600 --> 23:23.040
 It's also it could be something you are for display versus who you are in the

23:23.240 --> 23:27.400
 private moments of searching and thinking and struggling and all that kind of stuff.

23:27.600 --> 23:32.640
 Instagram is a surface layer that much of modern society

23:32.840 --> 23:37.040
 operates in, which is really problematic because there's that gap

23:37.240 --> 23:42.280
 between the person you show to the world and the person you are in private life.

23:42.480 --> 23:47.080
 And if you make majority of your project of the human project of your

23:47.080 --> 23:52.120
 sort of few years on this earth, the optimization of the public Instagram

23:52.320 --> 23:55.880
 profile, then you never develop this private person.

23:55.960 --> 23:58.240
 But it does seem that if you do just so long enough,

23:58.440 --> 24:03.440
 it's very difficult not to fall into like this has become

24:03.640 --> 24:06.200
 a personal journey, an intellectual journey.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.320
 Because like if you get your ass kicked thousands of times,

24:09.520 --> 24:14.400
 there's a certain point to where that maybe it's like a defense mechanism.

24:14.400 --> 24:17.960
 But that turns into some kind of deeply profound introspective

24:18.160 --> 24:21.680
 experience versus like exercise yoga.

24:21.880 --> 24:27.360
 Yeah. So let me let me go back first and address the Instagram point, which I think

24:27.560 --> 24:32.400
 there's a difference between people who whose Instagram is intrinsically tied

24:32.600 --> 24:35.680
 to their profession and they have to put a specific profile out there.

24:35.880 --> 24:38.360
 And I think in general,

24:38.560 --> 24:43.640
 people who truthfully are their businesses tied to their Instagram profile.

24:43.640 --> 24:45.080
 I want to exclude them.

24:45.280 --> 24:49.800
 I think that most people Instagram is how they want to be seen.

24:50.000 --> 24:53.080
 And that's not always congruent with who you are.

24:53.280 --> 24:57.760
 But I think there is a level of dishonesty there.

24:57.960 --> 24:58.360
 Yeah.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.440
 Like this is how I want people to see me.

25:00.440 --> 25:03.320
 I'm going to put all this stuff in my Instagram bio, but

25:03.520 --> 25:04.680
 that's really not me.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.760
 And when you do that,

25:07.960 --> 25:11.600
 I think it's it's a little disingenuous and you're right.

25:11.600 --> 25:15.160
 There's not you're never really going to marry those two things together and it

25:15.360 --> 25:17.320
 gets tough. Let me sorry to interrupt.

25:17.320 --> 25:18.680
 Let me push back on something.

25:18.880 --> 25:21.120
 It's a good time to address

25:21.320 --> 25:25.520
 the the many flaws of the great and powerful John Clark.

25:25.720 --> 25:31.200
 OK, let's let's let's let's go there because it's interesting.

25:31.400 --> 25:38.240
 You strive so hard for excellence in your life and for extreme competence

25:38.240 --> 25:43.880
 that you are visibly and physically off put by people who are who have not

25:44.080 --> 25:46.720
 achieved competence.

25:46.920 --> 25:53.000
 Do you think we should be nicer to the people who are those early?

25:53.200 --> 25:56.400
 Like you mentioned, a person who first picks up an art,

25:56.600 --> 26:01.360
 picks up, becomes vegan, starts through and cross fists are doing jiu jitsu for

26:01.560 --> 26:05.280
 the first time and create that as their, you know, they're they're struggling

26:05.280 --> 26:09.960
 through this, like, who am I and they're really overly proud and it's kind of

26:10.160 --> 26:16.760
 ridiculous and you and your wise chair of CVC in many battles, yeah,

26:16.960 --> 26:19.560
 that you see the ridiculousness of that.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.840
 I tend to

26:22.040 --> 26:28.000
 I'm learning to give those folks not to mock them and to sort of give them a

26:28.200 --> 26:32.160
 chance to do their ridiculousness because I think I was that too.

26:32.160 --> 26:37.480
 Let me first clarify, I want to be clear about what you mean when you say a level

26:37.680 --> 26:41.120
 of competence. Now, I I've never won a world championship.

26:41.320 --> 26:45.800
 I've never, you know, there are plenty of things in my life where I've not

26:46.000 --> 26:53.720
 achieved what most people would consider to be the penultimate level of success.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.960
 Now, that's accomplishments.

26:56.160 --> 26:58.360
 It's accomplishments, it's ribbons, it's things like that.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.440
 And it's not that those things don't mean anything to me.

27:00.440 --> 27:06.560
 And the fact that I haven't in some arenas is is something that I want to change,

27:06.760 --> 27:09.200
 which is we can talk about that in a second.

27:09.400 --> 27:15.320
 But I think that there's a difference between the very eager noob of whatever

27:15.520 --> 27:21.520
 it is they're doing, who does the thing so that they can

27:21.720 --> 27:23.720
 signal they do the thing.

27:23.920 --> 27:26.480
 That's a person I have less respect for.

27:26.680 --> 27:29.560
 So we know each other primarily through Jiu Jitsu.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.440
 Look at a Jiu Jitsu tournament.

27:32.640 --> 27:36.880
 There's this there's this idea that people espouse online.

27:37.080 --> 27:41.920
 I respect anyone with the guts to get on the mat and put it on the line and sign

27:42.120 --> 27:47.280
 up for a tournament. That is the biggest load of shit I have ever heard.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.120
 This is great.

27:48.320 --> 27:52.360
 Do you know, do you know how easy it is for you to put your name on something and

27:52.360 --> 27:54.120
 pay the registration fee and walk in there?

27:54.320 --> 27:55.280
 That's not the hard part.

27:55.480 --> 27:57.040
 That's the easiest part.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.880
 I don't care if you lose your first match,

27:58.880 --> 28:03.680
 but I respect the person who signs up for the tournament, registers for the tournament,

28:03.880 --> 28:08.480
 goes on a diet, loses weight the right way, trains their ass off and does the things

28:08.680 --> 28:10.480
 properly and then goes on the mat.

28:10.680 --> 28:15.840
 The person who simply signs their name on the registration form and jumps on the mat.

28:16.040 --> 28:19.440
 If they haven't done these other things, they actually have nothing to lose.

28:19.640 --> 28:21.200
 Because what they've done is they've stepped

28:21.400 --> 28:25.240
 onto the mat in the ring in the cage with a bucket full of excuses.

28:25.440 --> 28:25.720
 Yeah.

28:25.920 --> 28:26.800
 Sure, you signed up.

28:26.800 --> 28:31.680
 But you're not really vulnerable because you didn't run, you didn't do this.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.400
 You didn't do all the things you were supposed to do.

28:33.600 --> 28:35.480
 The person who

28:35.680 --> 28:41.000
 eliminates every possible excuse and then steps on the mat and gets their ass kicked

28:41.200 --> 28:45.480
 in the first round, I have so much more respect for that person than the person who

28:45.480 --> 28:48.480
 does nothing and maybe on natural ability wins a couple of matches.

28:48.680 --> 28:53.440
 And then writes on Facebook on how I lost to the eventual champion.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.960
 That's worth zero.

28:55.160 --> 28:56.000
 That's worth zero.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.480
 And in that process, what did you learn about yourself?

28:58.680 --> 29:02.920
 You learned about yourself that you've got a natural level of aptitude for whatever

29:03.120 --> 29:07.320
 this activity is that you're doing, but you didn't actually learn how to maximize

29:07.520 --> 29:12.120
 it through training and through dedication and through all these other things.

29:12.320 --> 29:17.160
 I'm an incredibly interested, novice musician.

29:17.360 --> 29:20.040
 I love I like to play bass, but I don't put that on anything.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.000
 And, you know, I stink at it.

29:22.200 --> 29:23.760
 I would really love to be sick at it.

29:23.960 --> 29:25.160
 I'm currently not.

29:25.160 --> 29:30.320
 But like I'm not running around, you know, talking about entering, you know,

29:30.320 --> 29:33.400
 any of those other things like I do it, it's for myself.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.960
 And I want to I want to reach a level of competence in that.

29:37.160 --> 29:44.400
 So the person that you have respect for is a person who takes it fully seriously,

29:44.600 --> 29:47.360
 takes takes the effort fully seriously.

29:47.560 --> 29:51.560
 So for bass, that would be that you agree with yourself that you're going to perform

29:51.560 --> 29:55.160
 live and just in your own private moments, your private thoughts,

29:55.360 --> 29:59.120
 you're not going to give yourself an excuse out like, I'm just going to have fun.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.360
 This is a nice experience.

30:00.360 --> 30:04.440
 You're going to you're going to think I'm going to try to be the best possible

30:04.640 --> 30:08.680
 bass player given given everything that's going on in my life, but I'm going to do

30:08.880 --> 30:11.880
 my like, yes, and put it all on the line.

30:12.080 --> 30:16.400
 And if I fail, that is that's not because I didn't try.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.120
 It's because I'm a failure.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.080
 Exactly.

30:20.080 --> 30:24.640
 And then and then sit in that sick feeling of like, I'm a failure.

30:24.840 --> 30:26.320
 But isn't that an important thing to know?

30:26.520 --> 30:27.400
 Absolutely.

30:27.600 --> 30:30.800
 But there there's a there's a.

30:31.680 --> 30:34.080
 That's like the best thing we could be.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.720
 But sometimes it's fun to lose yourself in

30:37.920 --> 30:42.320
 in the in the bragging in the in the lesser ways of life.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.600
 And I think I'm careful not to

30:46.600 --> 30:51.880
 because too many people in my life, when I brought them with like a little candle

30:52.080 --> 30:57.240
 of a fire of a dream, they would just go like, you know, they would just blow that

30:57.440 --> 31:03.640
 fire out that they would dismiss me because they see like, you know, I would say,

31:03.840 --> 31:07.360
 I've said I've said a lot of ridiculous stuff, but the one, you know, I've always

31:07.560 --> 31:15.560
 dreamed about like putting a I always dreamed of having this world full of robots.

31:15.560 --> 31:18.440
 And, you know, every time I would

31:18.640 --> 31:22.800
 bring these ideas up, they'll be shut down by the different people by my parents.

31:23.000 --> 31:28.040
 But, you know, you know, then you need to first get to get an education.

31:28.240 --> 31:32.080
 You need to succeed in these dimensions in order to do all these things.

31:32.080 --> 31:33.200
 You have to get good grades.

31:33.400 --> 31:34.680
 You have to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

31:34.880 --> 31:39.880
 Like there's all this stuff that it's indirect or direct ways of blowing out

31:40.080 --> 31:42.920
 that little ridiculous dream that you present.

31:42.920 --> 31:47.880
 And it's like, you know, I remember sort of bringing up,

31:48.080 --> 31:50.600
 I don't know,

31:50.800 --> 31:55.960
 things like becoming a state champion and wrestling, right?

31:56.160 --> 32:00.320
 It's a it's a weird dance because, of course, the coaches will tell they'll

32:00.520 --> 32:04.400
 kind of dismiss that it's like, OK, OK.

32:04.600 --> 32:08.760
 But at the same time, it feels like in those early days, you have to preserve that

32:08.760 --> 32:12.800
 little, little fire, that's Johnny I've, I don't know if you know who that is, is a

32:12.800 --> 32:14.760
 designer at Apple, he was a chief designer.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.320
 He's behind most iPhone, all that stuff.

32:17.520 --> 32:22.160
 And he always talked about that he wouldn't bring his ideas to Steve Jobs until

32:22.160 --> 32:25.360
 they were matured because he would always shit on them.

32:25.560 --> 32:29.880
 He would he wanted them to like little as little babies like live for a little bit

32:30.080 --> 32:31.680
 before they get completely shut down.

32:31.880 --> 32:35.160
 And I always think about that when I see a beginner sort of bragging on Instagram.

32:35.360 --> 32:37.000
 You have to be careful.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.160
 Let let them play with that little dream.

32:40.360 --> 32:42.160
 You know, are you playing with a little

32:42.160 --> 32:45.160
 dream that you're nurturing and you're trying to take that little flame and you're

32:45.360 --> 32:50.400
 trying to create a roaring blaze with it, or are you playing with the idea of it?

32:50.600 --> 32:53.920
 And behind behind that, there's no substance.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.200
 It's hard to know the difference.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.520
 That's why I struggle with is it.

32:56.720 --> 32:58.040
 I don't think it necessarily is.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.080
 Certainly, you're wrong.

32:59.280 --> 33:03.640
 And when I say Instagram, I don't want to impute a bunch of strangers,

33:03.840 --> 33:05.320
 but I have a gym with a lot of members.

33:05.320 --> 33:08.440
 And I can tell you that the number of years I've been in the gym,

33:08.640 --> 33:12.120
 when someone comes to me and says, this is my goal, I don't I don't tell them

33:12.320 --> 33:17.040
 yes or no in general, but I know I can tell by the way they say it to me.

33:17.240 --> 33:18.400
 I can thin slice it.

33:18.600 --> 33:20.320
 I've seen the look on people's faces.

33:20.520 --> 33:24.920
 And when people start to like say they want to do X, Y and Z, I know right off

33:24.920 --> 33:28.440
 the bat, this person is either going to put an effort in or they're not going to

33:28.640 --> 33:33.360
 put an effort in. So to me, it's about the effort behind that.

33:33.360 --> 33:36.920
 If you're busting your ass and you're a new at something and you're brand new,

33:37.120 --> 33:40.400
 but you're working really hard and you have a series of like moderate

33:40.600 --> 33:45.680
 successes in that like that's the guy I want to champion because that persistence

33:45.880 --> 33:49.720
 and that grit over time, those successes will no longer be moderate.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.760
 They'll be huge.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.640
 But the person who's having moderate success by doing nothing,

33:53.840 --> 33:58.600
 chances are they'll never learn to put that work in and the successes will never grow.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.240
 You have an admiration for Mike Tyson.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.320
 I love him.

34:03.520 --> 34:07.560
 I was going to let that sit for a brief moment.

34:07.760 --> 34:08.920
 Why?

34:09.120 --> 34:10.600
 I think there's a combination of factors.

34:10.800 --> 34:16.720
 One is like the timeliness of his career and like the age I was when he came to

34:16.920 --> 34:26.200
 prominence, the raw, brutal violence and the raw, brutal honesty when he speaks.

34:26.400 --> 34:30.920
 I think it's easy for people to hear him or see his life and cast him aside as

34:30.920 --> 34:35.880
 some simianesque, like just cretin scourge on society.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.920
 But when you hear him speak like this is not a guy who's unintelligent.

34:40.120 --> 34:44.400
 This is a guy who knows himself better than probably most of us know ourselves.

34:44.600 --> 34:52.200
 It's disarming and, you know, that's a humongous part of my admiration for him.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.720
 Who is Mike Tyson?

34:53.920 --> 34:58.160
 Because it feels like there's similarity between him and you.

34:58.160 --> 35:04.480
 It feels like there's a violent person in there, but also a really kind person.

35:04.680 --> 35:08.760
 And they're all like living together in a little house and you're the same.

35:08.760 --> 35:12.320
 There's a thoughtful person, but there's also a scary, violent person.

35:12.520 --> 35:14.320
 And they're like having a picnic.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.720
 They're having a picnic.

35:15.920 --> 35:18.760
 I think there are dialectical tensions in everyone.

35:18.960 --> 35:23.520
 These opposing forces that are constantly pulling at you and at different

35:23.720 --> 35:26.080
 points in your life, like it's sliding scale.

35:26.080 --> 35:32.200
 And I think that it's certainly when I was a younger person that there was a lot

35:32.400 --> 35:38.600
 more manifestation of the violence and a lot less of the kindness.

35:38.800 --> 35:40.520
 People who were not as close to me

35:40.520 --> 35:43.680
 probably saw more of the violent side and only the very close people to me.

35:43.880 --> 35:46.400
 So I like what would pass for the kind side.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.400
 And now that's sliding in the other direction.

35:49.600 --> 35:53.280
 And I worry actually sometimes that

35:53.280 --> 35:57.800
 there could be a situation where I need that old version of me and he's getting

35:58.000 --> 36:01.600
 further and further away and I can't call him up if I need him.

36:01.800 --> 36:06.960
 And that that concerns me to a to a certain degree.

36:07.160 --> 36:13.520
 The sad aging warrior seeing his girl self fade away, but you still compete.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.200
 Is that that person returned?

36:15.400 --> 36:19.760
 Seems like for Mike Tyson, that person returned at the prospect of competition.

36:19.760 --> 36:24.920
 It returns, but I've learned I've learned better how to manifest it in

36:25.120 --> 36:29.320
 competition in terms of like the effects that that type of emotion has on you

36:29.320 --> 36:31.040
 physically in the middle of a competition.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.160
 So I've better learned how to utilize that energy.

36:34.360 --> 36:39.080
 But I think another side effect of this is like having a gym where you're a bigger

36:39.280 --> 36:43.280
 guy and you're the head instructor, you can't be as mean and violent as you once

36:43.480 --> 36:46.120
 were, because you're also now trying to run a business.

36:46.120 --> 36:51.680
 And you spend so long, so many so many years trying not to be mean and to

36:51.880 --> 36:56.040
 soften your your technique a little bit, that that all of a sudden just becomes

36:56.240 --> 36:58.520
 who you are. And I don't necessarily like that.

36:58.720 --> 37:02.560
 So I've been trying to reclaim that a little bit on the mat.

37:02.760 --> 37:06.720
 But I think in competition.

37:06.920 --> 37:08.440
 There's

37:08.640 --> 37:11.200
 there has to be.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.720
 An athlete really wants to score the points.

37:14.720 --> 37:17.280
 A fighter really wants to

37:17.480 --> 37:21.320
 incapacitate you and put you in a position where they can do their own bidding.

37:21.520 --> 37:25.280
 And the result in a Jiu Jitsu match might just still be two points,

37:25.480 --> 37:28.040
 but the motivations are very, very different.

37:28.240 --> 37:32.560
 What do you make of Tyson on Joe Rogan saying that he was aroused by violence?

37:32.760 --> 37:34.120
 Do you think that's insane?

37:34.320 --> 37:36.720
 Do you think that's deeply honest for him?

37:36.920 --> 37:42.840
 And do you think that rings true for many of us others who practices in different degrees?

37:42.840 --> 37:45.560
 I don't I can't speak for a lot of people.

37:45.760 --> 37:48.800
 And I think that it was a brutally honest statement by him.

37:48.800 --> 37:52.160
 And I think it's something that even if a lot of people feel it,

37:52.360 --> 37:55.120
 they're not that comfortable admitting it or saying it.

37:55.320 --> 38:01.160
 But I think like there's there is great joy.

38:01.360 --> 38:06.960
 And like landing a flush right hand on someone's jaw and then watching them crumble.

38:07.160 --> 38:08.160
 You don't even feel it.

38:08.360 --> 38:09.920
 You ever play baseball as a kid?

38:09.920 --> 38:13.080
 You can hit a base hit off the end of the bat and it will sting your hands

38:13.280 --> 38:14.840
 because of the way that you hit it.

38:15.040 --> 38:19.800
 You can hit a home run and you won't feel anything and it just feels so good in your hands.

38:20.000 --> 38:25.160
 And that's, I think, like one of the joys of physical contact.

38:25.360 --> 38:28.800
 When you do it the right way, that goes for all physical contact.

38:29.000 --> 38:35.280
 When you do it the right way, the physical pleasure you can derive from it and the mental pleasure,

38:35.480 --> 38:37.880
 it's it's unparalleled.

38:37.880 --> 38:40.840
 See, but that's different. Let me let me draw a distinction.

38:41.040 --> 38:43.120
 I'm not.

38:44.640 --> 38:48.600
 I've had the fortune of being a wrestler.

38:48.800 --> 38:54.440
 And I would draw a distinction between a very well executed and competition,

38:54.640 --> 38:57.680
 double leg, single leg takedown or a pin.

38:57.880 --> 39:00.960
 There's some as an OCD person, there's something so

39:01.160 --> 39:05.720
 comforting about a well executed pin because it's like two seconds and it's just like

39:05.720 --> 39:09.320
 everything is flush and nice and like it's all clean.

39:09.520 --> 39:14.040
 I mean, OK, is this OCD person who likes to align show show is just beautiful.

39:14.240 --> 39:17.040
 OK, that's good technique.

39:17.240 --> 39:20.360
 Wrestling also provides you.

39:20.560 --> 39:25.520
 Maybe more than other sports, the feeling of dominating another human.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.120
 Yes. Of breaking.

39:27.320 --> 39:32.040
 No, not just of them being very cocky and very powerful.

39:32.240 --> 39:34.880
 You feel this power of another human being.

39:34.880 --> 39:39.640
 And then you breaking them and like.

39:39.840 --> 39:42.200
 I'm not as honest as Mike Tyson.

39:42.400 --> 39:45.560
 Well, but that's that.

39:45.760 --> 39:49.400
 I don't think I've ever sort of looked in the mirror and said

39:49.600 --> 39:52.800
 like that that was I enjoyed that aspect of it.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.080
 But it certainly seems like you chase that.

39:56.280 --> 39:59.760
 So when I was a wrestler in high school,

39:59.760 --> 40:05.720
 I lost so many matches because of over aggressiveness, like,

40:05.920 --> 40:09.320
 you know, I would pick the top position and let you stand just so that I could do

40:09.520 --> 40:11.960
 a mat return and I wasn't trying to return you to the mat.

40:12.160 --> 40:16.280
 I was actually trying to like drive you through the mat and through the ground.

40:16.480 --> 40:20.160
 Like I took like I it gave me joy to do that.

40:20.360 --> 40:24.360
 Yeah, like it wasn't like I was trying to, you know, just return you to the mat

40:24.360 --> 40:28.280
 so that I could pin you that what you just talked about, like the the dominating

40:28.280 --> 40:31.560
 another person, I used to look at that as you've got someone who in theory is

40:31.760 --> 40:36.040
 equally trained and equally skilled as you are and you're you're absolutely out

40:36.240 --> 40:38.160
 there totally dominating them.

40:38.360 --> 40:43.440
 There's joy in that you could get in an MMA fight and you could take someone down

40:43.640 --> 40:47.000
 and you could mount them and all that feels great.

40:47.200 --> 40:50.840
 But when you start raining down the punches on their face from Mount and like

40:51.040 --> 40:54.840
 dropping elbows and stuff like there's another level of satisfaction there.

40:54.840 --> 41:01.000
 And it's it's tough to describe and I don't think that everyone is made for it.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.880
 When I was I think when I was a senior in high school,

41:04.080 --> 41:08.360
 my wrestling coach said, look, you've got to stop with all this crazy aggressive

41:08.560 --> 41:11.760
 wrestling like they try to turn me into a technician.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.000
 And and it and it did work to a degree.

41:15.200 --> 41:18.480
 And it was a humongous shift for me in terms of success.

41:18.680 --> 41:23.320
 But it wasn't the same level of enjoyment out of it.

41:23.320 --> 41:27.360
 Like, I mean, I got disqualified from New England because my coach said cross face

41:27.360 --> 41:31.040
 and I cross face and he said harder and I basically wound up and blasted a kid in

41:31.240 --> 41:33.480
 the face and his nose got busted everywhere.

41:33.680 --> 41:37.080
 But I didn't think not to do it because that felt good.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.240
 It felt good to cross face him like that.

41:39.440 --> 41:41.960
 I was I was a lot of like.

41:42.160 --> 41:46.560
 That's a weird American warrior ethos that I've picked up.

41:46.760 --> 41:52.000
 But I also have in me the the Russian, the city of brothers that don't see it.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.240
 Don't see it as that they don't get drawn.

41:56.440 --> 42:01.520
 They think that there is a tension between the art of the martial art

42:01.720 --> 42:05.800
 and the violence of the martial art is a poetic way.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.880
 I could put it, but they're not so fascinated with this.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.760
 Dan Gable dominating another human.

42:11.960 --> 42:18.400
 They think of the effortlessness, the effortlessness of the technique

42:18.400 --> 42:22.040
 and your mastery of the art is exhibited in its effortlessness.

42:22.240 --> 42:26.280
 How much you lose yourself in the moment and the timing that just the beauty of a

42:26.480 --> 42:31.400
 timing like there's much more like one example in judo, but also in wrestling.

42:31.600 --> 42:37.840
 You can look at the foot sweep wrestlers in America and even judo players in

42:38.040 --> 42:42.040
 America and much of the world don't admire the beauty of the foot sweep.

42:42.240 --> 42:46.240
 But a well timed foot sweep, which is a way to sort of off balance to find the right

42:46.240 --> 42:54.560
 timing to just effortlessly change the tape, turn the tables of dominate your

42:54.760 --> 43:00.760
 opponent is as seen as the highest form of mastery in Russian wrestling.

43:00.960 --> 43:04.000
 And in the case of judo, it's in Japanese judo.

43:04.200 --> 43:05.040
 It's interesting.

43:05.240 --> 43:08.320
 I'm not sure I'm not sure what what that tension is about.

43:08.520 --> 43:13.240
 I think it actually takes me back to, I don't know, if you listen to Dan

43:13.240 --> 43:19.520
 Carl in hardcore history and Genghis Khan, if you've ever read a great, great book

43:19.720 --> 43:22.840
 on Genghis Khan, I'm still, I'm still trying to adjust.

43:23.040 --> 43:28.920
 Most of my life said Genghis Khan, but the right pronunciation is actually Genghis

43:29.120 --> 43:30.840
 Khan.

43:31.040 --> 43:32.800
 There's a tension there.

43:33.000 --> 43:38.320
 We kind of think, I don't know, we, I kind of thought as Genghis Khan is

43:38.320 --> 43:43.760
 a ultra violent, a leader of ultra violent men.

43:43.960 --> 43:53.160
 But another view, another way to see them is the people who warriors that

43:53.360 --> 44:00.480
 valued extreme competence and mastery of the art of fighting with weapons, with

44:00.680 --> 44:03.280
 bows, with horse riding, all that kind of stuff.

44:03.280 --> 44:10.280
 And I'm not sure exactly where to place them on my sort of thinking about violence

44:10.480 --> 44:12.440
 in our human history.

44:12.640 --> 44:18.240
 I think in a context of like combat sports, I think there's a difference between

44:18.440 --> 44:23.400
 an athlete winning a contest under a certain set of rules and a fighter winning

44:23.600 --> 44:25.960
 a fight under those exact same rules.

44:26.160 --> 44:28.080
 There's a different approach to it.

44:28.280 --> 44:31.760
 And I don't think one is any better than the other.

44:31.760 --> 44:36.640
 And like in MMA, I think a great example would be George St. Pierre.

44:36.840 --> 44:39.960
 George St. Pierre is a tremendous, it's a tremendous athlete.

44:40.160 --> 44:43.160
 And he considers himself to be a martial artist first.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.600
 He's trying to win an athletic competition.

44:45.800 --> 44:48.960
 Like Nick Diaz is trying to bust your ass.

44:49.160 --> 44:51.000
 Right. There's a different approach to it.

44:51.200 --> 44:55.040
 And yes, they've had different results at the highest level of competition.

44:55.240 --> 44:59.480
 But it's difficult to attribute the difference in results just to their

44:59.480 --> 45:01.960
 approach to the sport, because they're different human beings with different

45:02.160 --> 45:06.600
 abilities and different physical attributes.

45:06.800 --> 45:11.360
 The CITF brothers have that luxury of being able to talk about the beauty of a

45:11.560 --> 45:14.120
 perfectly timed slide by, right?

45:14.320 --> 45:16.760
 There are other wrestlers that will never be able to pull that off.

45:16.960 --> 45:20.920
 And therefore they have to pursue other ways to defeat someone.

45:21.120 --> 45:25.360
 And maybe it is the Dan Gable breaking a man's spirit by outworking him type thing,

45:25.560 --> 45:28.400
 which is beautiful in its own way.

45:28.400 --> 45:34.560
 But we we we tend to self select the ways in which we're able to be successful

45:34.760 --> 45:37.000
 and then kind of take a deep dive into that.

45:37.200 --> 45:39.360
 What do you think is more beautiful?

45:39.560 --> 45:49.120
 Brute force or effortless execution of technique that dominates another human?

45:49.320 --> 45:54.960
 I think it's a subjective thing based on what skills you perceive yourself to have.

45:54.960 --> 46:02.000
 I'm never I've never been a slick, super athletic, dexterous, competitor in anything.

46:02.200 --> 46:05.120
 And I've always been more about I've got to outwork you.

46:05.120 --> 46:06.040
 I've got to out grind you.

46:06.240 --> 46:07.040
 I've got to out mean you.

46:07.240 --> 46:11.840
 And so because I've lived that, I tend to see the beauty in that more because I

46:12.040 --> 46:16.440
 have a perceptual awareness that I don't have for the people who have the luxury

46:16.640 --> 46:20.720
 of being very slick and athletic and and using beautiful technique.

46:20.720 --> 46:26.160
 Now, that said, there's a phenomenal little video the other day I sent to a friend

46:26.360 --> 46:31.760
 of a compilation of foot sweeps by Liotta Machida in MMA.

46:31.960 --> 46:34.560
 And they're so beautiful and they're so awesome.

46:34.760 --> 46:37.800
 And it's not that I don't have an appreciation for those.

46:38.000 --> 46:42.320
 But I can't emulate those because I lack the physical ability to do that.

46:42.520 --> 46:48.760
 Whereas I at least have a chance to emulate some of the people who do it through grit

46:48.760 --> 46:50.840
 and through outworking people.

46:51.040 --> 46:56.440
 But I would love to return to Genghis Khan and get your thoughts about,

46:56.640 --> 47:00.960
 like I have so many mixed feelings about

47:01.160 --> 47:06.800
 whether he is evil or not, whether

47:07.000 --> 47:14.720
 the violence that he brought to the world had ultimately the fact that he had maybe

47:14.720 --> 47:19.760
 kind of like Dan Carlin describes, cleansed the landscape.

47:19.960 --> 47:25.640
 It's like a reset for the world through violence had ultimately

47:26.840 --> 47:32.800
 a progressive effect on human civilization, even though in the short term it led to

47:33.000 --> 47:36.360
 massive, you could say, suffering.

47:36.560 --> 47:38.000
 I don't know what to make of that, man.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.880
 What are your thoughts on Genghis Khan?

47:40.880 --> 47:45.960
 I think it's always difficult to look at a historical figure and their actions of

47:46.160 --> 47:52.120
 their time through a modern day lens, because it's very easy for us to

47:52.320 --> 47:58.360
 kind of impugn their achievements and the things that they did and say, oh, well,

47:58.560 --> 48:00.840
 you know, what he did was wrong.

48:01.040 --> 48:03.160
 Well, of course, that can be true.

48:03.360 --> 48:07.880
 But a lot of times we don't actually have any real good context or concept of

48:07.880 --> 48:11.960
 the times they were living in and what really was deemed wrong and what really

48:11.960 --> 48:14.280
 wasn't. We're looking at it through a very cushy modern lens.

48:14.480 --> 48:18.680
 That being said, from what I've read about Genghis Khan,

48:18.880 --> 48:21.920
 yeah, he was a violent dude, but also he gave you an option.

48:22.120 --> 48:26.240
 He when he when he got to a village, he said, look,

48:26.440 --> 48:29.480
 I'm going to we're going to you have a choice.

48:29.680 --> 48:31.720
 You can come with us or you can run.

48:31.920 --> 48:35.080
 And, you know, he gave them an option to join

48:35.080 --> 48:38.200
 his legion of fighters who he took very good care of.

48:38.400 --> 48:43.880
 You know, he was the first military leader to pay his soldiers

48:44.080 --> 48:45.720
 families when they died.

48:45.920 --> 48:50.960
 And he did that based on the the booty that they got when they raided a village.

48:51.160 --> 48:54.440
 He took that money, he took a share and they divided that up amongst the soldiers

48:54.640 --> 48:55.680
 and then the soldiers families.

48:55.880 --> 48:59.280
 I think he also is credited with

49:00.120 --> 49:03.320
 first like horseback mail routes or something like that.

49:03.320 --> 49:06.360
 Right. Is he the godfather of the modern postal system?

49:06.560 --> 49:07.960
 There's something something like that.

49:08.160 --> 49:12.000
 Yeah, he's the Bernie Sanders of the

49:12.680 --> 49:14.120
 the Mongol Empire.

49:14.320 --> 49:20.800
 I do think the the offering of surrender is an interesting one because.

49:21.760 --> 49:24.560
 It's interesting, like as a thought experiment,

49:24.760 --> 49:29.160
 whether you would sacrifice your way of like the pride of nations or the nationalism,

49:29.160 --> 49:34.000
 pride of your country, whether you're willing to give that up

49:36.160 --> 49:38.520
 for, you know, to survive.

49:38.720 --> 49:40.960
 It depends on who depends on you.

49:41.160 --> 49:44.840
 If you have a if you have a family and like young kids and stuff like that,

49:45.040 --> 49:47.960
 I think your your obligation is primarily to them.

49:48.160 --> 49:50.520
 And therefore surrender has to be something that you can

49:50.720 --> 49:55.280
 consider in that in that moment in time so that you can take care of those people.

49:55.480 --> 49:58.040
 If you're a man alone and you've got like all these principles and all this

49:58.040 --> 50:01.760
 stuff and you just don't you're not down with what Jengaskhan is doing and what

50:01.760 --> 50:05.440
 he's selling, yeah, try and escape, do your thing and just know that, you know,

50:05.440 --> 50:07.840
 what waits on the other side of that for you potentially.

50:08.040 --> 50:10.920
 But I think if there's someone else out there that depends on you,

50:11.120 --> 50:12.840
 your obligation should be to them.

50:13.040 --> 50:20.560
 It feels like historically people valued principles more than life.

50:20.760 --> 50:23.800
 In this weight of like, what do I value more?

50:24.000 --> 50:26.280
 The principles I hold versus survival.

50:26.280 --> 50:29.840
 It seems that now we don't value principles as much.

50:29.840 --> 50:33.360
 Your principles could be also religion, it could be your values, whatever.

50:33.560 --> 50:38.320
 We're OK, sort of sacrificing those for to preserve our survival.

50:38.520 --> 50:44.720
 And that applies in all forms, like actual survival or like on social media,

50:44.920 --> 50:48.360
 like preserving your reputation, all those kinds of things.

50:48.560 --> 50:50.960
 It seems like we,

50:50.960 --> 50:59.600
 especially in America, value individual life, that death is somehow a really bad

50:59.800 --> 51:05.280
 thing, as opposed to saying sacrificing your principles is a very bad thing and

51:05.480 --> 51:11.280
 everybody dies and it's OK to die as what's horrible is to sacrifice your

51:11.480 --> 51:15.600
 principles of who you are just to live another day.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.600
 I think a big problem is people don't really

51:17.600 --> 51:19.400
 even know what their principles are anymore.

51:19.400 --> 51:22.160
 People, you know,

51:22.360 --> 51:27.480
 social media and just the way that we live nowadays, where we're separated

51:27.680 --> 51:31.640
 from the human contact like this, like we're not, you're not contacting

51:31.840 --> 51:33.440
 people in a community anymore.

51:33.640 --> 51:37.640
 You're not whether your religious or not, like you're not congregating at a church.

51:37.640 --> 51:40.880
 You're not part of a parish, like you would be like in, you know, down south.

51:41.080 --> 51:44.000
 You're not part of that community anymore.

51:44.000 --> 51:50.600
 And so it's difficult to figure out what your principles and values are because

51:50.800 --> 51:55.080
 you're constantly jumping from one bucket to the next online.

51:55.280 --> 52:00.920
 And you don't get a lot of like direct, like reasonable feedback from people.

52:01.120 --> 52:04.720
 You just get dipshit feedback like, oh, you don't believe this, well, you're a jerk.

52:04.920 --> 52:06.640
 I think the hard thing

52:06.840 --> 52:10.480
 currently is having the integrity and character to stick by your principles

52:10.480 --> 52:14.840
 when under, I don't want to equate murder of in the jengas,

52:15.040 --> 52:18.760
 con times to social media, cancel culture.

52:18.960 --> 52:22.520
 But it certainly doesn't feel good when people are attacking on social media.

52:22.720 --> 52:26.520
 And it does take a lot of integrity to

52:26.720 --> 52:33.080
 without anger, without emotion, without without being without mocking others or

52:33.280 --> 52:38.600
 attacking others unfairly, standing by the ideas you hold.

52:38.600 --> 52:42.320
 Or in another way,

52:42.520 --> 52:49.920
 standing by your friends, standing by this little group like loyalty of the people

52:50.120 --> 52:51.480
 that, you know, are good people.

52:51.680 --> 52:57.040
 I find that in cancel culture, one of the sad things is whenever somebody gets

52:57.240 --> 53:02.520
 quote unquote canceled, everybody just gets all their friends become really quiet

53:02.720 --> 53:06.040
 and don't defend them or worse.

53:06.040 --> 53:08.680
 I mean, quiet is at least understandable.

53:08.880 --> 53:14.880
 They kind of signal that they throw them out of the bus, I guess, is one way to put it.

53:15.080 --> 53:21.960
 And that's something I think about a lot because from coming for me, it's like.

53:22.160 --> 53:23.880
 I hold an ethic.

53:23.880 --> 53:25.480
 I don't know if others hold this ethic.

53:25.680 --> 53:30.160
 Maybe it's this like Russian mobster ethic of like,

53:30.360 --> 53:34.160
 you should help your friends bury the body.

53:34.160 --> 53:37.280
 You shouldn't criticize your friends for committing the murder.

53:37.480 --> 53:39.840
 Like there's certain levels of like,

53:40.040 --> 53:44.600
 you know, yeah, you have that discussion after you bury the body that like maybe

53:44.800 --> 53:46.920
 you shouldn't have done that murder thing.

53:47.120 --> 53:48.040
 I don't know.

53:48.240 --> 53:51.680
 You know, I understand that that's a problematic

53:51.880 --> 53:58.000
 with the terminology that's a problematic ethical framework within which to operate.

53:58.000 --> 54:02.320
 But at the same time, it feels like what else do we have in this world except

54:02.320 --> 54:06.280
 the brotherhood, the sisterhood, the love we have for a very small community.

54:06.480 --> 54:08.200
 But perhaps that's the wrong way of thinking.

54:08.400 --> 54:09.960
 Perhaps the 21st century would be

54:10.160 --> 54:14.560
 defined by the dissipation of this community of this loyalty concept.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.240
 No, we're all just individuals.

54:16.440 --> 54:17.280
 I think you're right.

54:17.280 --> 54:21.600
 And I think you have to have some sort of core framework of principles and beliefs

54:21.800 --> 54:22.520
 that you operate on.

54:22.720 --> 54:26.680
 And I think what I was what I was referencing is a little bit different.

54:26.880 --> 54:28.600
 But to speak to your point,

54:28.600 --> 54:37.720
 you need a framework of core principles on which you can then base a lot of your

54:37.720 --> 54:41.200
 other decisions, like I believe these three things to be true, whatever they are.

54:41.400 --> 54:45.320
 And that will help inform other decisions you make in your life.

54:45.520 --> 54:48.640
 As far as how you treat your friends,

54:48.840 --> 54:53.800
 I've got I've got probably three friends that if they called me right now and said,

54:54.000 --> 54:55.040
 let's bury the body.

54:55.240 --> 54:57.600
 Sorry, Lex, I got to go.

54:57.600 --> 55:00.360
 There are other people in my life that if they said,

55:00.560 --> 55:05.360
 hey, we've got to go bury the body, I would say, who is this?

55:05.560 --> 55:06.600
 You know, yeah.

55:06.800 --> 55:09.760
 So I think it depends on the relationship.

55:09.960 --> 55:12.040
 I wonder if that's a good it's a really good measure.

55:12.240 --> 55:13.760
 I would love to have.

55:13.960 --> 55:15.920
 I would love that to be in your profile.

55:16.120 --> 55:17.320
 People put like pronouns.

55:17.520 --> 55:19.960
 I would love to put like

55:20.160 --> 55:24.560
 honestly, like objectively, not self report, but objective.

55:24.760 --> 55:26.960
 How many people in your life?

55:26.960 --> 55:30.720
 If they committed murder, you would not ask any questions and you would help them

55:30.920 --> 55:31.640
 hide the body.

55:31.840 --> 55:33.680
 I would love to know that number for people.

55:33.880 --> 55:34.280
 Yeah.

55:34.480 --> 55:37.360
 And I think it's a weird thing too, because you think right away, like, OK,

55:37.560 --> 55:39.880
 it must be the group of people that are the closest to you.

55:39.880 --> 55:41.600
 That's who you're first thinking of, right?

55:41.800 --> 55:44.600
 But obviously, for like my best friend, I would do it.

55:44.600 --> 55:45.560
 No question about it.

55:45.760 --> 55:49.040
 But I've got other people that are close to me that

55:49.240 --> 55:50.560
 are close to me in other ways.

55:50.560 --> 55:53.920
 And I probably wouldn't do that only because I don't think they do it for me.

55:54.120 --> 55:54.560
 Yeah.

55:54.560 --> 55:57.400
 And and that is a consideration.

55:57.600 --> 56:02.360
 So I guess it's the principle there then that you do for your friends what you

56:02.360 --> 56:05.880
 think they would do for you is that the underlying principle or do you just have

56:06.080 --> 56:10.240
 a blind loyalty to, you know, people in your life for different reasons?

56:10.440 --> 56:14.240
 I got people that are not on my inner circle that I probably

56:14.440 --> 56:17.200
 wouldn't help change a tire at two in the morning if they're on the highway.

56:17.200 --> 56:19.400
 But if they called me and said, hey, we got to bury the body,

56:19.600 --> 56:20.720
 I might show up for that.

56:20.720 --> 56:22.280
 It's just these weird different connections.

56:22.280 --> 56:27.320
 Yeah, it's fascinating. Yeah, I have close friends that like I probably be exactly.

56:27.320 --> 56:31.120
 The tires, a good example would be like, can't you find somebody else to do this?

56:31.320 --> 56:38.000
 I think part of that is just this leap of faith into like giving yourself

56:38.200 --> 56:45.520
 to the other person that creates a deep connection that makes life

56:45.720 --> 56:51.560
 fulfilling, like meaningful, that doesn't exist if you don't take that leap.

56:51.560 --> 56:53.640
 I mean, it's not about the murder, we're sort of focusing.

56:53.840 --> 56:58.960
 I think that's a I think you have to what is it across that bridge when you get there?

56:58.960 --> 57:00.000
 I'm not exactly sure.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.480
 Is this just the thought experiment?

57:01.680 --> 57:06.640
 But it's it's I think about that a lot, especially these COVID times.

57:06.840 --> 57:10.680
 And as like people become more and more isolated and separated from each other,

57:10.880 --> 57:16.080
 like how important is it to have those deep, deep connections to other humans?

57:16.280 --> 57:18.480
 I think especially like what you're talking about there.

57:18.480 --> 57:19.880
 Have you ever seen the movie The Town?

57:19.880 --> 57:23.920
 There's a great line in the movie where one of the main characters walks into

57:24.120 --> 57:28.040
 his friend's house and he says, I need your help.

57:28.240 --> 57:31.560
 We're going to go hurt some people and you can never ask me about it again.

57:31.760 --> 57:35.360
 And the friend looks up and he says, who's car we taking?

57:35.560 --> 57:38.160
 Like that that is the type of person you need in your life.

57:38.160 --> 57:41.480
 And the people like there are people that will walk through that door and say that

57:41.480 --> 57:43.200
 to you and you drop everything you're doing.

57:43.200 --> 57:45.640
 And then there's a people that walk to you doing you're like, you know what?

57:45.840 --> 57:48.360
 I got a hot pocket in the microwave.

57:48.360 --> 57:52.040
 I'm a little bit I'm a little bit tied up right now, but I'd love to help you out.

57:52.240 --> 57:54.480
 But, you know, I don't want to do that.

57:54.480 --> 57:56.960
 And you don't have that deep connection with those people.

57:57.160 --> 58:00.800
 You mentioned some principles that you've

58:01.000 --> 58:04.720
 changed your mind on. Is there do you want to go there?

58:04.920 --> 58:11.680
 Is there some interesting principles and the process of changing that is useful to talk about?

58:11.880 --> 58:15.920
 I can't really cite a specific thing, except that

58:15.920 --> 58:20.480
 understanding that the principles that you have at different points in your life

58:20.680 --> 58:23.960
 can change and it's OK to change them without being a total pussy and being

58:23.960 --> 58:26.840
 bullied by other people into thinking what you thought was wrong.

58:27.040 --> 58:31.680
 If you come to these conclusions of your own volition and you decide to change them,

58:31.880 --> 58:36.160
 that's great. And it can be really it can be really liberating.

58:36.360 --> 58:41.520
 It's really liberating to have an idea that you hold so true to your.

58:41.520 --> 58:47.960
 Your core belief system. And then to actually have someone change your mind for you

58:48.160 --> 58:52.160
 and be OK with it, as opposed to being like, no, I got to die with this.

58:52.360 --> 58:53.920
 I got to die with this. It's really liberating.

58:53.920 --> 58:54.880
 There are definitely ideas.

58:54.880 --> 58:58.040
 You want to die on that hill and no one's ever going to change your mind.

58:58.240 --> 59:03.800
 But it's really liberating to be confident enough to say, change my mind.

59:03.800 --> 59:07.880
 I'm lucky enough to have some smart motherfuckers around me who can tell me,

59:07.880 --> 59:12.160
 listen, you're being a total dipshit, like let's let's rethink this.

59:12.360 --> 59:14.520
 Or like I have one friend who does the five

59:14.520 --> 59:17.000
 wise all the time and he loves back in me into a corner.

59:17.200 --> 59:18.800
 And what's the five wise?

59:19.000 --> 59:22.640
 You just like when someone makes a statement about something to really get

59:22.840 --> 59:27.800
 to the core issue, they say, if you ask why five times, make a statement.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.760
 Well, why is that? And you answer that?

59:29.760 --> 59:32.560
 Well, why? And you phrase the wise differently, obviously.

59:32.560 --> 59:33.760
 But then you get to the core.

59:33.760 --> 59:36.360
 They say five times you can get to the core of the issue.

59:36.360 --> 59:38.040
 And that's a challenging thing.

59:38.240 --> 59:42.800
 But I find later in life, it's so liberating for me to be confident enough

59:43.000 --> 59:48.040
 to be like, man, was I fucking way off the mark on this and have my mind changed.

59:48.080 --> 59:50.520
 And be able to say that to others that I was wrong.

59:50.720 --> 59:51.440
 Totally.

59:51.640 --> 59:54.920
 That ability and I never used to have that.

59:55.120 --> 59:58.240
 And it feels real good.

59:58.440 --> 1:00:00.640
 And there's a hunger for that, too.

1:00:00.840 --> 1:00:05.040
 Yeah, you're so right, actually, on a personal level, it feels very good.

1:00:05.040 --> 1:00:10.600
 Exactly, as you said, it's liberating because you're free to then think as opposed to

1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:13.920
 defend, yeah, without thinking.

1:00:13.920 --> 1:00:17.800
 Yeah, you get so sick of defending the same thing over and over and over.

1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:19.640
 And you start to think about it.

1:00:19.840 --> 1:00:25.400
 And it's like, well, I would really like to evolve my thought process here.

1:00:25.600 --> 1:00:31.360
 And when you're constantly defending one point, it's difficult to let other ideas in.

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:36.160
 You discount the possibility that you can have your mind change when you're

1:00:36.360 --> 1:00:40.440
 constantly on the defense, but you have to have a crack in the front line in order

1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:43.200
 to let a new idea come in and possibly flourish.

1:00:43.400 --> 1:00:48.200
 And maybe the new idea doesn't even prove your current belief system to be wrong.

1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:52.920
 But maybe it's like the water to a seed and it grows and now it's something even

1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:56.840
 bigger and better and you can start to work with that instead.

1:00:57.040 --> 1:00:59.760
 And it's a tough thing because I'm a stubborn fuck.

1:00:59.760 --> 1:01:02.000
 And it's very difficult for me.

1:01:02.200 --> 1:01:07.040
 It was historically to say I was wrong about this one or I messed this one up or

1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.480
 I wish I could have that one back.

1:01:09.680 --> 1:01:13.280
 There's a public figure for me thing, too, which

1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.120
 there is there's a difference between changing your mind with the small circle

1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:20.480
 of friends and changing your mind publicly about something.

1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:23.680
 But it has equal one echoes the other.

1:01:23.880 --> 1:01:25.160
 It is equally liberating.

1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:32.280
 But people people will not make that change easy, but it doesn't matter.

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:33.960
 That's that's the point.

1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:39.200
 It doesn't I think it's ultimately liberating as a human being public figure

1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:46.760
 or not to to think deeply about this world and to keep changing, which is like.

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:52.000
 I think there's a deep hunger for that in like political discourse that people

1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:58.080
 are so tribal currently about politics that they want to see somebody who says,

1:01:58.080 --> 1:02:00.040
 you know what, I changed my mind on this.

1:02:00.240 --> 1:02:00.680
 Right.

1:02:00.880 --> 1:02:04.440
 And then keep changing their mind and keep asking questions, keep showing that

1:02:04.440 --> 1:02:06.120
 they're open minded, all that kind of stuff.

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:11.200
 But you want someone in a position of political power to change their mind

1:02:11.200 --> 1:02:14.920
 because they realize that there might be a better way, not because they realize

1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:18.040
 that by changing their mind, they're going to get a new demographic to vote for them.

1:02:18.240 --> 1:02:19.600
 That's transparent as shit.

1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:20.920
 Nobody wants to see that.

1:02:20.920 --> 1:02:22.040
 Like that's right.

1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:26.720
 That's a person who can't separate their their position from their people.

1:02:26.720 --> 1:02:27.600
 They're supposed to be helped.

1:02:27.600 --> 1:02:27.760
 Yeah.

1:02:27.960 --> 1:02:29.080
 And you can usually smell that.

1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:34.000
 That's what we're just talking offline about.

1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:36.160
 There's something about Hillary Clinton,

1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:42.240
 which she talked about changing her mind on gay marriage that it felt

1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:47.720
 like this is a political calculation versus like really deeply thinking about

1:02:47.720 --> 1:02:54.520
 like what, you know, what things do we do in this world that violate basic human

1:02:54.720 --> 1:02:56.960
 rights, like really thinking about deeply?

1:02:56.960 --> 1:03:01.320
 And, you know, of course, politicians are calculating this, but you can see it.

1:03:01.520 --> 1:03:02.480
 This is the thing.

1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:06.200
 That's why like on the human level,

1:03:06.200 --> 1:03:08.800
 there's like political policies, but there's also humans.

1:03:08.800 --> 1:03:11.120
 And I've always liked Bernie Sanders, for example.

1:03:11.320 --> 1:03:13.680
 I don't know, not the later, perhaps Bernie Sanders,

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:15.400
 but I used to listen to him back in the day.

1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:21.240
 And it felt like people might disagree with me, but it felt like there was a real

1:03:21.440 --> 1:03:25.200
 human struggling with ideas, whatever, agree with him or not.

1:03:25.400 --> 1:03:27.880
 It felt like he wasn't doing political calculation.

1:03:27.880 --> 1:03:28.680
 He was just a human.

1:03:28.880 --> 1:03:33.920
 He couldn't be further away from my political ideals, but also like

1:03:34.120 --> 1:03:39.200
 there's an obvious authenticity to his passion for what he's saying that is not

1:03:39.400 --> 1:03:40.680
 present in other candidates.

1:03:40.880 --> 1:03:44.480
 And you could see it all these people that have been in politics forever,

1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:47.600
 like from all the way back when Hillary was a lawyer in the 70s.

1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:50.600
 There's a couple of shots of her in a courtroom in the 70s, though.

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:52.240
 She's looking all right.

1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:53.840
 She's got those big glasses on.

1:03:54.040 --> 1:03:56.960
 Yeah, kind of a little bit of a nerdy babe back in the day.

1:03:57.160 --> 1:03:58.120
 Oh, you mean like?

1:03:58.320 --> 1:04:00.040
 Yeah.

1:04:00.240 --> 1:04:03.960
 Well, John Clark says Hillary Clinton was a babe back in the day.

1:04:04.160 --> 1:04:07.320
 Seventy three hit Clinton, yeah.

1:04:08.160 --> 1:04:12.240
 That's an interesting question about authenticity in politicians.

1:04:12.240 --> 1:04:17.280
 Do you think like Hillary Clinton, just the Clintons are a good example

1:04:17.480 --> 1:04:21.440
 of that, why do you think they become over time so inauthentic?

1:04:21.640 --> 1:04:23.400
 Is it the system that changes them?

1:04:23.600 --> 1:04:25.200
 Is it their own hunger for power?

1:04:25.400 --> 1:04:27.320
 Is it what is it?

1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:29.600
 Or were they always inauthentic?

1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:32.520
 Well, first, I'd like to say that I don't know if you know this, but I come

1:04:32.720 --> 1:04:36.480
 from a bit of a political dynasty myself.

1:04:36.680 --> 1:04:41.240
 I was on the student government several times in high school and my dad won

1:04:41.240 --> 1:04:44.920
 the runoff in a special election in Bradenton Beach, Florida.

1:04:45.120 --> 1:04:47.200
 I think there's like 700 people there.

1:04:47.400 --> 1:04:49.400
 So your dad got you the job?

1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:53.800
 Yeah, we're basically a lot of people come Paris to the Kennedys.

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.200
 My guess with the politicians is that and you can you can see it now as we're

1:04:58.400 --> 1:05:01.800
 becoming more like cognizant as people to the political process.

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:03.960
 I think the process corrupts people.

1:05:04.160 --> 1:05:06.880
 And I think that I don't know the ins and outs of it.

1:05:06.880 --> 1:05:09.840
 I've listened to people who are far more educated on it than me.

1:05:09.840 --> 1:05:14.200
 And I'm unprepared to cite any of their points.

1:05:14.400 --> 1:05:16.800
 I think you can see it a little bit in Dan Crenshaw.

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:17.880
 Can I say this? Yeah.

1:05:18.080 --> 1:05:19.360
 So I like him.

1:05:19.560 --> 1:05:23.480
 I really liked Dan, especially like a year, year and a half ago.

1:05:23.680 --> 1:05:25.680
 He seemed very levelheaded.

1:05:25.880 --> 1:05:29.920
 It's clear to me now that as he panders more and more to the right,

1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:33.760
 it's because he's setting himself for for a presidential run.

1:05:33.960 --> 1:05:35.400
 It's clear that that's happening.

1:05:35.400 --> 1:05:40.640
 And he just doesn't seem like the same authentic, ideals oriented guy that he

1:05:40.840 --> 1:05:42.080
 did a year and a half ago.

1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:44.280
 Now, I could be wrong on that and it could be way off.

1:05:44.480 --> 1:05:48.960
 But I think that you can take someone as honest as you want to.

1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:52.240
 When you start them on that path to the presidency,

1:05:52.440 --> 1:05:59.560
 you become so unbelievably beholden to so many people and entities along the way.

1:05:59.760 --> 1:06:03.640
 But by the time you get to the final destination, the Oval Office,

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:07.560
 all you're doing is paying back the favors that got you there and you never

1:06:07.560 --> 1:06:09.640
 get to serve the people you're supposed to serve.

1:06:09.840 --> 1:06:14.120
 Your primary focus is on your office and not on the people that you're supposed

1:06:14.320 --> 1:06:17.040
 to be helping. I think that that's a humongous problem.

1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:18.960
 And like we could talk all about campaign,

1:06:18.960 --> 1:06:20.840
 finance reform and the two party system.

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:24.840
 But at the end of the day, the people who are running

1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:29.040
 for political posts, they're working to keep a job.

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:33.080
 They're not working to improve the lives of the constituents, which is different.

1:06:33.080 --> 1:06:36.960
 A long, long time ago, like a lot of politicians, like those were like part time

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:40.840
 jobs, and they held other posts out west.

1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:44.600
 They were ranchers by day and sheriff by night, whatever the case might be.

1:06:44.800 --> 1:06:49.520
 But now you have such a cushy path for the rest of your life that the goal is to

1:06:49.720 --> 1:06:54.440
 just be a politician, not do the things that you think a politician is supposed to do.

1:06:54.640 --> 1:06:55.440
 And that's a problem.

1:06:55.640 --> 1:06:57.560
 By the way, I'll talk to Dan on this.

1:06:57.560 --> 1:07:03.120
 It's funny, I like the version of him from a year ago and I haven't been really

1:07:03.320 --> 1:07:08.360
 paying attention, so I'll be, I'll actually pay more attention now and ask him that exact

1:07:08.560 --> 1:07:14.200
 question, like how do you prevent yourself from changing, becoming what the Clintons became?

1:07:14.200 --> 1:07:17.880
 I tend to believe like there's conspiratorial stuff about Clintons and all these politicians.

1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:21.640
 I tend to believe that they were actually good, thoughtful people back in the day.

1:07:21.640 --> 1:07:22.240
 At some point.

1:07:22.440 --> 1:07:24.080
 And the system changes them.

1:07:24.080 --> 1:07:30.360
 On the, it's not even the system, there's something about just the process of campaigning.

1:07:30.560 --> 1:07:35.400
 I just think it wears you down to where if you look at the percentage of time you

1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:41.480
 spend on the kinds of conversations you have, it's like one, you do these speeches,

1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:43.960
 which you repeat the same thing over and over and over.

1:07:44.160 --> 1:07:49.440
 It beats the the process of thinking, you just exhaust your brain to where you're

1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:51.240
 not thinking anymore, you're just repeating.

1:07:51.240 --> 1:07:56.320
 It's very, it's exceptionally difficult to keep making speech after speech after

1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:59.880
 speech, saying the same thing over and over and over again.

1:07:59.880 --> 1:08:03.720
 And at the same time, thinking deeply and changing your mind and learning.

1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:10.160
 And then also the pandering to financial, like having phone calls, like fundraising,

1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:11.200
 all those kinds of things.

1:08:11.400 --> 1:08:12.160
 That's what they do now.

1:08:12.160 --> 1:08:13.760
 They spend most of their time fundraising.

1:08:13.760 --> 1:08:15.400
 They're not worried about anything.

1:08:15.600 --> 1:08:20.400
 Sorry to interrupt you, but I was going to say that you can see there's a fuel like

1:08:20.400 --> 1:08:26.160
 the the more attention and the higher regard you're held in and your community

1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:30.880
 and the more sycophants like continue to blow smoke up your ass, the more it

1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:34.840
 changes the way you present yourself and you can see it in every walk of life.

1:08:35.040 --> 1:08:38.200
 I mean, jujitsu is a tiny, tiny little section of the world,

1:08:38.400 --> 1:08:41.440
 but you see it in the jujitsu community when someone all of a sudden starts

1:08:41.440 --> 1:08:45.520
 a social media page or whatever and they get a bunch of people like basically

1:08:45.520 --> 1:08:51.040
 like, you know, cyber philating them on their Instagram page, they they change.

1:08:51.240 --> 1:08:52.480
 Philating, is that a word?

1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:53.360
 I think so.

1:08:53.560 --> 1:08:54.680
 So giving a show.

1:08:54.880 --> 1:08:55.440
 Yeah.

1:08:55.640 --> 1:08:56.440
 So philating.

1:08:56.640 --> 1:08:57.200
 Yeah.

1:08:57.400 --> 1:08:59.520
 Jamie, look it up.

1:08:59.720 --> 1:09:03.240
 I think, but in those people, it changes their character.

1:09:03.440 --> 1:09:06.840
 Yeah, it changes who they are because they become emboldened.

1:09:07.040 --> 1:09:11.160
 And, you know, now they've got this like mythical cyber mob behind them.

1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:16.320
 There's a sign at the entrance to your gym that reads for every moment of triumph.

1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:18.920
 It's a quote by Hunter S. Thompson.

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:23.120
 It reads, for every moment of triumph, for every instance of beauty,

1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:26.720
 many souls must be trampled.

1:09:26.920 --> 1:09:29.600
 What does this quote mean to you?

1:09:29.800 --> 1:09:34.640
 That quote to me is about mostly about sacrifice.

1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:40.880
 And it's about to achieve anything great or anything beautiful or to triumph.

1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:45.440
 You have to have sacrificed so many things to get there unless you're the most

1:09:45.640 --> 1:09:51.360
 unbelievably genetically gifted person in the world and greatness is just, you know,

1:09:51.560 --> 1:09:53.600
 falls upon you, which is raining from the sky.

1:09:53.800 --> 1:10:00.040
 I think on your path to greatness, on your path to success and triumph,

1:10:00.240 --> 1:10:03.640
 you leave a lot of carnage in your wake, personal relationships,

1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:07.360
 other goals, things that you didn't pursue,

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:10.040
 you know, other unfulfilled dreams.

1:10:10.240 --> 1:10:15.360
 And you kind of have to sell a lot of that out in order to be really the

1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:21.560
 at the peak of your field or or what you want to be.

1:10:21.760 --> 1:10:23.400
 I know that that's happened in my life.

1:10:23.600 --> 1:10:30.520
 I mean, there's tons and tons of relationships that, you know, couldn't survive

1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:33.840
 the way that I was living my life because when I was trying to be a big time

1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:38.760
 fighter or like when I was just training all the time, tons of relationships

1:10:38.960 --> 1:10:42.800
 dissolve themselves naturally, some not so naturally.

1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:43.880
 Some people get it.

1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:44.720
 Some people don't get it.

1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:46.560
 Some people hate you.

1:10:46.760 --> 1:10:48.960
 You miss tons of other opportunities.

1:10:49.160 --> 1:10:51.360
 And I think that's kind of what that quote means to me.

1:10:51.560 --> 1:10:52.760
 It's about sacrifice.

1:10:52.760 --> 1:11:00.800
 It's about you're giving up what you want now for what you want more.

1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.440
 And it's the the trampling of souls.

1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:10.560
 It's messy, too, because it's not clear what what the right path is.

1:11:10.760 --> 1:11:16.640
 Like that sacrifice is not obvious that those are the right sacrifices to make.

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:19.760
 You might be you might be ruining your own life.

1:11:19.760 --> 1:11:24.520
 But the fact that you're willing to take that risk and

1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:32.000
 sort of go all in on whether it's stupid or not to go all in on something.

1:11:32.200 --> 1:11:36.280
 That the possibility of creating something beautiful is there.

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:37.400
 Who says it's stupid?

1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:39.800
 If you're going all in on it, you don't think it's stupid.

1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:41.440
 Someone else might think it's stupid.

1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:43.680
 But I mean, who really cares?

1:11:43.880 --> 1:11:46.400
 Well, I'm of many minds on many things.

1:11:46.400 --> 1:11:51.920
 So I feel like there's certain minds, certain moves of the day where you think it's stupid.

1:11:52.120 --> 1:11:56.360
 Like relationships is a beautiful one, which is you've seen the movie Whiplash

1:11:56.560 --> 1:11:58.960
 by any chance? Yes.

1:11:59.160 --> 1:12:06.600
 It seems like in a man's life, it could be a woman's, but I don't identify as a woman.

1:12:06.800 --> 1:12:07.960
 So I know the man.

1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:10.240
 It's 2020, bro.

1:12:10.440 --> 1:12:14.920
 But my lived experience for now is that of a man we'll see about tomorrow.

1:12:14.920 --> 1:12:24.200
 And there is in the pursuit of excellence, there's often a choice of

1:12:24.400 --> 1:12:29.280
 some of the souls that must be trampled are personal relationships with humans in

1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:30.880
 your life that you might deeply care about.

1:12:30.880 --> 1:12:33.120
 It could be family, it could be friends.

1:12:33.320 --> 1:12:36.480
 It could be loved ones of all different forms.

1:12:36.680 --> 1:12:42.360
 It could be the people that your colleagues that depended on you, people who will lose

1:12:42.360 --> 1:12:45.560
 jobs because of the decisions you make, all this kind of stuff.

1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:48.400
 It seems that that moment happens.

1:12:48.600 --> 1:12:52.080
 And I'm not sure that sacrifice is always the correct one.

1:12:52.280 --> 1:12:56.800
 Like to me, the movie Whiplash for people who haven't seen the spoiler alert maybe.

1:12:57.000 --> 1:13:00.000
 I don't even know if that movie has any spoilers.

1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:02.800
 But there is a relationship with a female.

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.640
 There's a student, there's a drummer that's pursuing excellence of this particular

1:13:07.640 --> 1:13:14.440
 art form of drumming and he has a brief, fleeting relationship with a female.

1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:19.200
 And he also has an instructor that's pushing him to his limits in what appears

1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:22.520
 to be awfully a lot like a toxic relationship.

1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:32.480
 And he chooses, not chooses, he naturally makes the decision to sacrifice

1:13:32.480 --> 1:13:38.120
 the romantic relationship with the woman in further pursuit of this chaos,

1:13:38.320 --> 1:13:41.120
 of this chaotic pursuit of excellence.

1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:45.400
 And it feels, that doesn't feel like a deliberate decision.

1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:51.080
 It feels like a giant mess of like an emotional mess where you're just like

1:13:51.280 --> 1:13:57.200
 kind of like a fish swimming against stream, just like fuck it.

1:13:57.400 --> 1:14:01.920
 You let go of all the things that convention says you should appreciate.

1:14:01.920 --> 1:14:05.640
 You throw away the possibility of a stable life, of a comfortable life,

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:12.440
 of what society says is a meaningful life and just pursue this crazy thing full

1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:16.600
 of seeming toxicity with crazy people surrounding you.

1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:17.400
 I don't know.

1:14:17.400 --> 1:14:19.040
 So I don't know what the right decision is.

1:14:19.240 --> 1:14:22.320
 Part of my brain says you should stay with the girl.

1:14:22.520 --> 1:14:25.680
 Fuck that instructor that's making you,

1:14:25.880 --> 1:14:30.720
 that's pushing you to places where it's like that are destructive, potentially

1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:34.760
 destructive, like could lead to suicide, could lead you to

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:36.960
 completely

1:14:39.760 --> 1:14:45.520
 fail or fail on your pursuit of excellence or destroy the possibility,

1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:49.640
 destroy the dream, the passion, a pursuit of the thing that you've always dreamed

1:14:49.840 --> 1:14:51.160
 for in that case is drumming.

1:14:51.360 --> 1:14:53.160
 I don't know. I'm on many minds there.

1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:54.400
 Like what is the right thing to do?

1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:58.040
 So my first two thoughts are number one, fuck convention.

1:14:58.240 --> 1:14:59.240
 What is convention?

1:14:59.240 --> 1:15:04.080
 It's like some laid out paths, some linear progression of the way your life is supposed

1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:07.360
 to go, like, you know, that someone can draw a picture of at the end.

1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:11.680
 That's just that first of all, it's just boring and whatever.

1:15:11.880 --> 1:15:15.840
 And it's it's I don't want to say that it's cowardly because it isn't cowardly,

1:15:16.040 --> 1:15:21.360
 but for someone who's not conventional to not be nonconventional is cowardly to get

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:23.320
 sucked into the convention. That's first.

1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:29.320
 Second of all, I believe that scene in the diner in that movie where he tells her,

1:15:29.520 --> 1:15:34.480
 yeah, you're in my way because I'm going to want to be with you or you're going to

1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:36.120
 want me to be going out to dinner with you.

1:15:36.120 --> 1:15:38.880
 And I know I should be practicing or I know I should be training.

1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:42.440
 And ultimately, I'm going to make I'm either going to feel bad about not being

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:46.000
 with you by training or I'm going to skip the training to be with you.

1:15:46.200 --> 1:15:47.600
 And neither one is right.

1:15:47.800 --> 1:15:51.720
 The whole thing that they don't mention in that is that that's the wrong girl.

1:15:51.920 --> 1:15:52.920
 That's the wrong girl.

1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:55.520
 The right girl is a gangster.

1:15:55.720 --> 1:15:59.720
 The right girl says, oh, you have you have you have practiced tonight.

1:15:59.920 --> 1:16:04.400
 I'll leave you a sandwich and some milk so that you can, you know, outside the door.

1:16:04.600 --> 1:16:07.280
 Let me know when you're done or you have some like free time.

1:16:07.480 --> 1:16:11.440
 Like the right girl compliments that she's not an impediment in any way,

1:16:11.640 --> 1:16:17.360
 even if what you want to do is be with her so much that you're putting the drums

1:16:17.360 --> 1:16:20.280
 down or you're putting the bass down or you're picking up the pizza or you're not

1:16:20.280 --> 1:16:26.080
 going to training like that girl without even telling you why she's making decisions

1:16:26.280 --> 1:16:29.160
 is making decisions to help you achieve your goal.

1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:33.800
 Now, that might sound like some sort of like chauvinistic king of the castle type

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:35.960
 shit, like where everyone should cater to you.

1:16:36.160 --> 1:16:39.360
 But the fact of the matter is

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:44.480
 that person is a compliment to your life in helping you do your thing.

1:16:44.680 --> 1:16:48.600
 And in your own way, you're helping them to achieve whatever their goals are also.

1:16:48.600 --> 1:16:51.600
 It's uncommon that you have two people under the same roof,

1:16:51.800 --> 1:16:56.320
 striving to be unbelievably excellent in one small area.

1:16:56.520 --> 1:16:58.640
 It's not impossible, but it's uncommon.

1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:02.640
 Like relationships have to be like binary systems, like two stars.

1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:06.840
 Like the gravitational pull is what keeps you together and circling around one

1:17:07.040 --> 1:17:12.200
 another, right? And, you know, one is bigger than the other and they'll fluctuate.

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:16.000
 And, you know, the stars will get bigger and they'll get small in their contract

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:19.200
 based on positioning and, you know, composition.

1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:21.440
 That's the way a relationship should be.

1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:26.800
 Not an asteroid coming in to disrupt, you know, the surface of your planet.

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:28.040
 It's a binary system.

1:17:28.040 --> 1:17:30.480
 It's a compliment. That girl was the wrong girl for him.

1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:35.960
 So you shouldn't like the big unconventional dreams

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:41.000
 should not be adjusted to fit into this world.

1:17:41.200 --> 1:17:43.920
 Because I mean, there is a part of me that's like full of self thought.

1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:48.360
 Well, maybe you're just a dick, maybe, maybe hairs, Lex.

1:17:48.560 --> 1:17:51.240
 So first of all,

1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:56.280
 who chairs this is by the way, by the way, somebody who is

1:17:56.480 --> 1:18:00.840
 you have you have recently gotten well recently in the span of the history

1:18:00.840 --> 1:18:04.480
 of the universe is recently you've gotten to a relationship, but you haven't always

1:18:04.680 --> 1:18:10.440
 you have not felt the need to be in the relationship just because you're supposed

1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:13.520
 to by society's kind of momentum.

1:18:13.520 --> 1:18:16.560
 If you I think that if you really want anything,

1:18:16.760 --> 1:18:20.400
 you've got to be prepared fully to be the exact opposite.

1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:22.480
 If you're a person who's looking for a relationship,

1:18:22.680 --> 1:18:25.120
 the only way you're going to get in an awesome relationship is by being

1:18:25.120 --> 1:18:27.560
 comfortable being alone, because that's the risk.

1:18:27.760 --> 1:18:30.040
 If you're a person who's driven by money, you've got to be comfortable

1:18:30.240 --> 1:18:33.360
 being totally poor because that's the risk, right?

1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:36.880
 And when you're when you're when you're constantly hedging your bets,

1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:41.920
 you're never all in, you're never all in on the thing you're trying to do.

1:18:41.920 --> 1:18:45.480
 A relationship has to compliment your life.

1:18:45.680 --> 1:18:48.160
 You can't say

1:18:48.360 --> 1:18:52.000
 it's OK to want to be in a relationship, but you can't want to be in a relationship

1:18:52.200 --> 1:18:56.000
 so bad that you take someone in who fits the suit.

1:18:56.200 --> 1:18:58.560
 And it's like, oh, our schedules kind of work out.

1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:00.360
 You live near me and this and that and the other thing,

1:19:00.560 --> 1:19:03.880
 because the logistics of a relationship are not always perfect.

1:19:04.080 --> 1:19:07.040
 It's what matters is when the two people are together.

1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:08.360
 That's the perfect part of it.

1:19:08.360 --> 1:19:16.600
 And it's great to want to meet people and say, if we meet and

1:19:16.800 --> 1:19:20.200
 some sort of a relationship develops, I'm willing to run with it.

1:19:20.400 --> 1:19:23.400
 But I'm not meeting you hoping a relationship develops.

1:19:23.600 --> 1:19:27.200
 I think you kind of put the cart before the horse in a lot of those situations.

1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:31.840
 It's like when guys meet, like no guy goes out and is like, I'm looking for a bro.

1:19:32.040 --> 1:19:33.080
 Right. Nobody does that.

1:19:33.080 --> 1:19:35.800
 You go to the gym and you run into a bunch of dudes and the next thing you know,

1:19:35.800 --> 1:19:38.920
 someone's cool and they want to talk about fighting and you're fucking shotgun

1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:41.720
 and beers and all of a sudden you got a bro and that's how it works.

1:19:41.720 --> 1:19:44.920
 It works the same same way with what's the shotgun and beers.

1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:46.120
 I'll show you after this.

1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:48.960
 Poke a hole in the bottom and you open the top.

1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:54.680
 Yeah, yeah, this is the problem with America drink vodka like a man.

1:19:54.880 --> 1:19:56.960
 OK, now don't poke holes in beers.

1:19:57.160 --> 1:19:58.880
 This is the problem with the frat culture.

1:19:58.880 --> 1:20:00.560
 They don't really know how to drink.

1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:01.600
 They think they know how to drink.

1:20:01.600 --> 1:20:02.680
 They don't know how to drink.

1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:07.800
 What do you think makes a successful relationship?

1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:11.800
 If we can linger on that a little longer, like.

1:20:12.440 --> 1:20:16.440
 Let me ask John Clark about love.

1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:21.440
 I didn't ask a question, but let me just say love.

1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:25.120
 About love.

1:20:26.520 --> 1:20:31.480
 Are you one of those people who never says I love you?

1:20:31.480 --> 1:20:37.520
 No, no, I'm an extreme person and like my emotions are also extreme.

1:20:37.720 --> 1:20:43.120
 And one of the things I concern myself with.

1:20:43.320 --> 1:20:47.560
 Maybe this is philosophical and martial arts warrior soldier type related stuff is

1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:52.120
 like I don't want anyone if I die tonight on the drive home.

1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:53.840
 Hopefully that doesn't happen.

1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:58.480
 I hope that no one has left questioning how I felt about them.

1:20:58.480 --> 1:21:02.400
 And people I don't like probably are not questioning that.

1:21:02.600 --> 1:21:06.200
 And so the the thing that I've had to learn how to do later in life is to tell

1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:09.640
 the people that you care about that you care about them.

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:11.640
 And

1:21:12.840 --> 1:21:17.440
 each thing can be equally off putting to the receiver of the message.

1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:19.840
 Each thing can be equal.

1:21:19.840 --> 1:21:22.680
 When you when you're letting someone know how much you dislike them,

1:21:22.680 --> 1:21:25.040
 that can be off putting to the person receiving that message.

1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:27.080
 And we tell someone how much you care about them.

1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:29.640
 It can also be off putting to the person,

1:21:29.840 --> 1:21:32.400
 depending on how they view their relationship with you.

1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:34.400
 But it's still important to get it out there.

1:21:34.600 --> 1:21:37.920
 Like you shouldn't you shouldn't hold those things in because you're worried

1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:41.360
 about how they'll be received or if they'll come back at you.

1:21:41.560 --> 1:21:45.280
 So you're OK going all in on these.

1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:47.480
 Yeah, not afraid of commitment.

1:21:47.680 --> 1:21:48.920
 No, I'm not afraid of commitment.

1:21:48.920 --> 1:21:50.760
 Anyone who says they're afraid of commitment is full of shit.

1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:51.720
 You know what they're afraid of?

1:21:51.720 --> 1:21:54.440
 They're afraid of commitment with that person.

1:21:54.640 --> 1:21:55.840
 That's what they're afraid of.

1:21:55.840 --> 1:21:58.120
 Like you don't know when someone knocks

1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:02.520
 your your knocks you on your ass and they come into your life and you're

1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:06.880
 flush with all these emotions, you're not worried about, oh, I don't really like

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:08.880
 commitment. No, because they've knocked you on your ass.

1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:10.000
 You want to be with them.

1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:13.840
 You want those things that the two most alive points in your life.

1:22:13.840 --> 1:22:17.880
 I think people feel is the euphoria of a new relationship and then and then the

1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:20.720
 loss when that love is gone.

1:22:20.920 --> 1:22:25.720
 You'll never feel more, I don't think, than in those those moments in in your

1:22:25.720 --> 1:22:31.160
 life. See, the nice thing about the loss is it lasts longer.

1:22:31.360 --> 1:22:33.640
 Yeah.

1:22:33.840 --> 1:22:38.520
 That's a Lucy K point that he makes, which is like

1:22:38.720 --> 1:22:42.440
 that like in his show, I think is a

1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:46.120
 conversation with an older gentleman that says, like, that's his favorite part of

1:22:46.320 --> 1:22:53.120
 the relationship is that period between the loss of the relationship and the real

1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:58.040
 death, which is forgetting the person, but that period lasts the longest.

1:22:58.240 --> 1:23:03.800
 And that's the like the most fulfilling, like missing the other person is as

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:09.680
 fulfilling as the actual like love, the the early infatuation, which is interesting.

1:23:09.880 --> 1:23:11.560
 I also think of the Bukowski.

1:23:11.760 --> 1:23:13.400
 I return to that.

1:23:13.600 --> 1:23:16.560
 There's a little clip of him in an interview

1:23:16.560 --> 1:23:25.880
 saying that love is a fog that dissipates with the first light of reality or

1:23:26.080 --> 1:23:29.680
 something like that. So basically emphasizing that it's this very, very,

1:23:29.880 --> 1:23:34.640
 very fleeting thing that it's a it's a it's a moments thing.

1:23:34.840 --> 1:23:38.960
 And then it just fades and everything else is is something else.

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:41.800
 So love is only a temporary thing, which is interesting.

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.560
 I think some people say that cynical.

1:23:44.760 --> 1:23:46.320
 I don't know. I don't know what to think of it.

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:49.040
 I think it's important to understand

1:23:49.240 --> 1:23:53.920
 that everything is fleeting when you don't put effort into it.

1:23:54.120 --> 1:23:55.560
 Almost everything will be fleeting.

1:23:55.760 --> 1:23:58.120
 If you don't put effort into it, most people will get fat and lazy.

1:23:58.120 --> 1:24:02.200
 If you don't put effort into something, you're going to not be good at

1:24:02.400 --> 1:24:04.040
 playing guitar or playing bass.

1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:04.960
 You've got to put effort into it.

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:07.200
 The same thing goes for a relationship

1:24:07.400 --> 1:24:14.240
 that the the awesome part of it, that like love part that dies soon and early on

1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:19.520
 in a relationship, because it's so good that we think we don't have to work at it.

1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:23.040
 But you do, you have to like keep doing the things and you got to keep things new

1:24:23.240 --> 1:24:28.320
 and crisp and fresh. And, you know, when you when you.

1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:32.000
 Different people probably feel differently about this, but like,

1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:35.440
 I don't know, you walk around your girl and you start like farting and stuff like

1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:38.600
 that's when it all dies. Yeah, that's when it dies.

1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:40.360
 You know, we're all human beings.

1:24:40.360 --> 1:24:44.400
 Well, you know, have, you know, we're all here and our bodies work in the same way.

1:24:44.600 --> 1:24:49.320
 But like you start to chip away at this like beautiful thing when you when you

1:24:49.520 --> 1:24:51.840
 stop.

1:24:52.040 --> 1:24:56.720
 When you buck conventional courtesy and and things like that.

1:24:56.720 --> 1:24:58.960
 Well, take it for granted, basically take it for granted.

1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:01.040
 I mean, that's the same thing with life.

1:25:01.240 --> 1:25:03.560
 It's like it's the same.

1:25:03.760 --> 1:25:07.840
 I'm a big fan of meditating on death that you could die today.

1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:11.760
 In the same way you should meditate on like this relationship could end today.

1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:15.560
 This connection with another human could be this is the last time you could

1:25:15.760 --> 1:25:17.000
 you could be interacting.

1:25:17.200 --> 1:25:20.640
 And your chances of that increase when you take it for granted and you should on

1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:23.760
 people, but when you work at it, the chances of that decrease.

1:25:23.960 --> 1:25:26.680
 It's not it's never going to be zero, but it decreases.

1:25:26.880 --> 1:25:32.040
 And when you do that, when you're the person and you're you're trying to maintain

1:25:32.240 --> 1:25:35.960
 and you're trying to, you know, work at the relationship, you got to make sure that

1:25:35.960 --> 1:25:39.440
 both people are working at it. Otherwise, you're just a fucking chump.

1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:43.120
 OK, let's return back to mixed martial arts.

1:25:43.320 --> 1:25:47.600
 Let me ask the ridiculous question of who do you think are the top three,

1:25:47.800 --> 1:25:51.440
 maybe top five greatest fighters of all time?

1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:56.920
 It's so hard to compare fighters across generations.

1:25:57.120 --> 1:26:01.760
 And maybe on one way to say it is which metrics would you put on the table as to

1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:04.960
 measure what a great fighter is?

1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:09.800
 Yeah, there was a guy named Dioxapus

1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:14.000
 in the fourth century.

1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:18.520
 Yeah. And he was such a bad ass that in the Olympics in 336 BC,

1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:21.680
 no one even showed up to fight him in the pancreation event.

1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:24.200
 Nobody even showed up because he was fucking everybody up.

1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:30.040
 Years later, he was retired and this crazy Macedonian dude came there at some dinner

1:26:30.240 --> 1:26:32.160
 for Alexander the Great.

1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:35.080
 Everyone's chilling, drinking, you know, whatever they were drinking out of their

1:26:35.280 --> 1:26:40.520
 chalices and this Macedonian dude threatened him and challenged him.

1:26:40.720 --> 1:26:43.760
 So Dioxapus said, yeah, man, we'll throw it out.

1:26:43.960 --> 1:26:45.520
 And, you know, they set the time and the place.

1:26:45.720 --> 1:26:52.160
 Macedonian dude comes out like body armor, spear, shield, all this other shit.

1:26:52.360 --> 1:26:56.160
 Dioxapus came out absolutely naked with a wooden club

1:26:56.360 --> 1:27:00.240
 and took on this much younger guy, beat the living crap out of him and then put his

1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:07.160
 foot on his throat and then didn't even kill him in the show of ultimate power

1:27:07.360 --> 1:27:08.160
 for the time.

1:27:08.360 --> 1:27:11.280
 So I think there's something about the guy being naked too.

1:27:11.480 --> 1:27:13.000
 It's just extra demeaning.

1:27:13.200 --> 1:27:13.960
 Extra demeaning.

1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.560
 Yeah. OK, can we rephrase the question then?

1:27:18.760 --> 1:27:23.640
 Because those are clearly going to be some probably forgotten warriors in history.

1:27:23.840 --> 1:27:27.320
 Well, it's taken to like modern day mixed martial arts in the UFC.

1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:30.360
 Perhaps, well, just mixed martial arts there.

1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:32.160
 Who do you think are the top fighters of all time?

1:27:32.360 --> 1:27:37.960
 What metrics would you consider in trying to answer this perhaps unanswerable question?

1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:42.480
 I think one of the things you want to think about is a strength of opponent at

1:27:42.680 --> 1:27:43.920
 the time you fought them.

1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:50.320
 So, for example, fighting BJ Penn in his prime and beating him is far different

1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:52.520
 than beating BJ Penn last year, right?

1:27:52.520 --> 1:27:57.960
 So to say you have a victory over BJ Penn is not the same given the time frame

1:27:58.160 --> 1:28:02.720
 of when it happened, not to take anything away from anyone who's beaten BJ Penn.

1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:07.080
 Just use that as an example of someone whose career went into a different direction.

1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:10.160
 Yes, I would say

1:28:11.560 --> 1:28:17.280
 the guy who I think is probably the best that people are the least familiar with

1:28:17.280 --> 1:28:23.360
 would be Marilo Bustamante and I think he was a guy who was one of the guys with

1:28:23.560 --> 1:28:29.240
 the first really good physical build for MMA, which I think is narrow from the chest

1:28:29.440 --> 1:28:34.680
 to the back and long shoulder to shoulder and kind of sinewy made out of steel cable.

1:28:34.880 --> 1:28:36.480
 That was a guy who could box.

1:28:36.680 --> 1:28:39.840
 That was a guy who could wrestle and that was a guy who had great jiu jitsu.

1:28:40.040 --> 1:28:42.960
 It wasn't great kickboxer, but at the time he didn't need it.

1:28:43.160 --> 1:28:46.480
 Fought everybody and gave everybody a run.

1:28:46.480 --> 1:28:52.440
 I think he's probably one of those guys who's got to be considered.

1:28:52.640 --> 1:28:54.880
 Yeah, there's a few killers that never

1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:57.680
 because why is he not in the discussion?

1:28:57.880 --> 1:29:00.760
 Because I think greatness

1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:06.600
 requires both the skill and the opportunity to meet each other.

1:29:06.800 --> 1:29:10.040
 And when you talk about a fighter, the other thing that really a good

1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:12.040
 fighter needs to become great is a foil.

1:29:12.240 --> 1:29:12.600
 Yeah.

1:29:12.800 --> 1:29:15.280
 And so many fighters don't have a foil.

1:29:15.280 --> 1:29:18.960
 That's one of the biggest attractions, I think, of early Mike Tyson's career.

1:29:19.160 --> 1:29:20.200
 He didn't have a foil.

1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:21.960
 He had no one driving him.

1:29:21.960 --> 1:29:24.800
 And by the time he did, by the time he had a foil in Holyfield,

1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:26.520
 his career was in a different place.

1:29:26.720 --> 1:29:30.000
 But he's one of the greats all the time and he never really had a foil.

1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:32.920
 So his greatness was in

1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:41.840
 unparalleled destruction of like nobody's well, you know, of lesser opponents.

1:29:42.040 --> 1:29:42.480
 Right.

1:29:42.480 --> 1:29:47.960
 And so when people debate the, you know, the level of greatness of Mike Tyson,

1:29:47.960 --> 1:29:50.920
 that's one of the things they say, like he didn't fight a lot of killers in their

1:29:51.120 --> 1:29:55.960
 prime, I think you've obviously got to say in that conversation,

1:29:56.160 --> 1:29:59.200
 I have a really difficult time keeping George St.

1:29:59.400 --> 1:30:06.400
 Pierre out of the conversation only because he was able to beat you with anything.

1:30:06.600 --> 1:30:08.640
 He could he could out jab you.

1:30:08.840 --> 1:30:11.720
 He could out wrestle you and he could he could submit you.

1:30:11.720 --> 1:30:14.160
 The problem I have with Fedor is

1:30:14.360 --> 1:30:19.960
 his career also took a drastic turn towards the end.

1:30:20.160 --> 1:30:23.480
 And when he was fighting in pride, he was doing a lot more grappling.

1:30:23.680 --> 1:30:27.360
 And then he just started casting that overhand right at people.

1:30:27.560 --> 1:30:30.280
 And his game kind of changed at that point.

1:30:30.480 --> 1:30:32.120
 You can't take anything away from his greatness.

1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:38.600
 But at that time, the great heavyweights were not really in fighting in pride

1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:39.800
 and they didn't really exist yet.

1:30:39.800 --> 1:30:42.240
 And by the time he fought a really good one, Fabricio Verdun,

1:30:42.440 --> 1:30:43.720
 he did get submitted there.

1:30:43.920 --> 1:30:50.840
 Does his later performance color, are your and our perception of his greatness?

1:30:51.040 --> 1:30:52.760
 Like in general about fighters?

1:30:52.960 --> 1:30:57.080
 Not mine, but I'm someone who's like intimately involved in the sport,

1:30:57.280 --> 1:30:58.560
 but it colors everyone else's.

1:30:58.760 --> 1:30:59.800
 Same with Anderson Silva.

1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:02.280
 Like I don't think Anderson Silva doesn't want to fight in like seven years or

1:31:02.480 --> 1:31:07.600
 something or is like one, like that's a guy who in his prime was one of the best

1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:09.320
 fighters I've seen in the top five for you.

1:31:09.320 --> 1:31:10.720
 I think he's probably in the top five.

1:31:10.920 --> 1:31:12.680
 Yeah, greater striker of all time or no.

1:31:12.880 --> 1:31:18.160
 In MMA and mixed martial arts and mixed martial arts.

1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:19.600
 That's a tough question.

1:31:19.800 --> 1:31:24.440
 The greatest MMA striker because like the timing,

1:31:24.640 --> 1:31:27.280
 the we're talking about foot sweeps, right?

1:31:27.480 --> 1:31:31.280
 Who makes it look easier than Anderson Silva?

1:31:31.480 --> 1:31:36.360
 I think in an incredibly short sample of his prime,

1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:40.520
 it's got to be Anderson Silva and I think you have to consider discussing

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:45.000
 Liotta Machida for his unbelievable manipulation of distance,

1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:48.560
 which is something that people don't really talk too much about in terms of

1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:50.880
 fighting unless you're someone in the sport.

1:31:51.080 --> 1:31:56.520
 His use of distance and the ability to like what we call pop out and make you

1:31:56.720 --> 1:32:01.160
 miss by one inch so that he could follow your fist back in as you retract it and

1:32:01.160 --> 1:32:06.000
 hit you over the top that that's a thing of beauty.

1:32:06.200 --> 1:32:08.400
 Anderson Silva, when he became a counter striker,

1:32:08.600 --> 1:32:11.560
 when he got to his prime in the UFC, that was a thing of beauty.

1:32:11.760 --> 1:32:13.280
 That was a thing of beauty.

1:32:13.480 --> 1:32:15.280
 So I think definitely those two guys and

1:32:15.480 --> 1:32:18.320
 Marilla Bustamante has got to be the third guy.

1:32:18.520 --> 1:32:20.120
 There's just so many good guys now.

1:32:20.320 --> 1:32:22.960
 So where do you put in terms of metrics?

1:32:23.160 --> 1:32:24.960
 You mentioned GSB and Anderson Silva.

1:32:25.160 --> 1:32:28.560
 I think they have a large number of defenses of a title.

1:32:28.760 --> 1:32:29.920
 Is that important to you?

1:32:29.920 --> 1:32:32.680
 Like this kind of consistent domination?

1:32:32.880 --> 1:32:39.160
 No, because it's easily manipulated by the people making money off the fights.

1:32:39.360 --> 1:32:44.360
 So there is a great quote one time when the UFC was coming to prominence and

1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:47.240
 Vince McMahon from the WWE, he said,

1:32:47.440 --> 1:32:53.080
 you know, the difference between what we do and what the UFC does is that

1:32:53.280 --> 1:32:57.040
 when we have a superstar, I can make sure he stays on top until he's no longer

1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:59.560
 a superstar because we have predetermined results.

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:02.080
 The UFC can't do that because they're actually having fights.

1:33:02.280 --> 1:33:03.640
 Well, it's true and false.

1:33:03.840 --> 1:33:07.600
 You can't do that, but you can give your superstars the most favorable

1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:09.880
 matchups to keep them on top for the longest.

1:33:10.080 --> 1:33:13.880
 So people always talk about title defenses as if the guy they're fighting,

1:33:14.080 --> 1:33:17.000
 the challenger, is always the person most deserving of the shot.

1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:18.040
 And it's just not true.

1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:20.040
 So I don't put that much stock in it.

1:33:20.240 --> 1:33:23.240
 Is it possible to put a guy in

1:33:23.240 --> 1:33:31.320
 in consideration of one of the greats if all they had is one or two amazing fights?

1:33:31.520 --> 1:33:33.280
 I'll tell you like

1:33:33.480 --> 1:33:36.360
 and an amazing could be a lot of different definitions.

1:33:36.560 --> 1:33:37.480
 It could be just a war.

1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:41.840
 Like they never really reached the highest of excellences of domination.

1:33:42.040 --> 1:33:43.760
 But they've

1:33:43.960 --> 1:33:47.520
 like this is where this discussion about Kyle Bakniak, right?

1:33:47.720 --> 1:33:49.200
 Yeah.

1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:55.800
 To me, that's a perfect example here, this famous fight against the beat.

1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:59.240
 Mugamat Sharapov, Sharapov.

1:33:59.440 --> 1:34:05.080
 Where on one side you have an Anderson Silva type of fighter and in Zabit,

1:34:05.280 --> 1:34:11.760
 like just a very good striker, like and then there's like the warrior on the

1:34:11.960 --> 1:34:16.360
 on the Kyle side and just the fight, they created something special together.

1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:17.600
 It was a fight at night or whatever.

1:34:17.600 --> 1:34:21.640
 But, you know, that fight was special

1:34:21.840 --> 1:34:25.640
 on that night because because the two dance partners.

1:34:25.840 --> 1:34:28.920
 You can have a great performance without being a great fighter.

1:34:28.920 --> 1:34:30.680
 Not saying neither of those guys is a great fighter.

1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:33.240
 But to answer your first question,

1:34:33.440 --> 1:34:38.160
 I think that having one or two great performances does not necessarily mean that you are great.

1:34:38.360 --> 1:34:39.720
 I need a larger sample size.

1:34:39.920 --> 1:34:41.480
 I have no idea what that is.

1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:42.840
 I don't have an idea what that is.

1:34:42.840 --> 1:34:52.800
 And also where how much weight does toughness have when you're thinking

1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:56.160
 about the criteria when you define a great fighter?

1:34:56.360 --> 1:34:58.720
 That's that's that's a good question.

1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:00.520
 And I don't have the answer to it.

1:35:00.720 --> 1:35:04.200
 I admire the underdog that rises to the occasion through brute force.

1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:08.280
 They didn't have they didn't bring the skill set to the table that perhaps some

1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:12.280
 of the greats have, but they rose to the occasion.

1:35:12.280 --> 1:35:13.600
 I mean, there's something about that.

1:35:13.800 --> 1:35:14.640
 There's something about that.

1:35:14.840 --> 1:35:19.600
 And so now we're more talking about like the internal attributes as opposed to the

1:35:19.800 --> 1:35:21.080
 external physical attributes.

1:35:21.280 --> 1:35:25.120
 And those are the things I think that you cannot teach.

1:35:25.320 --> 1:35:28.840
 Those things you you come in the door and you either have that or you don't.

1:35:28.840 --> 1:35:31.000
 I think we talk about this all the time.

1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:33.960
 And this is one of the things where my mind changes regularly.

1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:35.520
 Like I'm what makes a fighter?

1:35:35.720 --> 1:35:37.600
 Is it is it born or is it bred?

1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:42.440
 And this week, I'm of the opinion that it's in you.

1:35:42.640 --> 1:35:45.880
 And maybe it's in you and you suppress it and people can tease it out of you.

1:35:46.080 --> 1:35:49.680
 But I don't think you can make someone who doesn't have that seed in there.

1:35:49.880 --> 1:35:52.400
 I don't think you can turn them into that great

1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:55.960
 warrior with that level of grit and mental toughness.

1:35:56.160 --> 1:35:58.480
 Now, when that that fight.

1:35:58.680 --> 1:36:01.840
 When Kyle puts a beat, it's a unique situation for both guys.

1:36:02.040 --> 1:36:05.960
 It was kind of a later, later replacement fight for Kyle.

1:36:05.960 --> 1:36:12.120
 So Beats star was on the rise and Kyle put the blueprint out there on how to beat to beat.

1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:16.120
 Which is which is pressure him and try and drag him into the late rounds.

1:36:16.320 --> 1:36:21.440
 You notice that later on when Calvin Kader fought him, they wouldn't give him five rounds.

1:36:21.640 --> 1:36:24.720
 They wanted five rounds and the beats camp from what I understand would not

1:36:24.920 --> 1:36:26.080
 agree to the five round fight.

1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:28.360
 Well, he didn't look right.

1:36:28.560 --> 1:36:33.840
 So with Kyle, it was a three round fight and we did it went to decision.

1:36:33.840 --> 1:36:38.000
 It was a beat, one of the decision clearly, which did Kyle have a shot of winning

1:36:38.200 --> 1:36:39.120
 in third round?

1:36:39.320 --> 1:36:43.120
 I don't remember the exact score, but Kyle could have won the third round.

1:36:43.320 --> 1:36:46.040
 Eddie done a couple of things differently.

1:36:46.240 --> 1:36:50.000
 But I do believe in the fourth round, I think Kyle wouldn't want a fourth round.

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:51.880
 And I think maybe even won the fight.

1:36:51.880 --> 1:36:55.960
 And if there would have been a fifth round and he was pressing forward,

1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:00.440
 like perhaps in a funny way that you could tell me I'm wrong.

1:37:00.440 --> 1:37:04.640
 But it felt like he wasn't emphasizing like head movement at that point.

1:37:04.640 --> 1:37:05.840
 He went full Mike Tyson.

1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:08.960
 There was a there was a point at which so it's funny that you say that.

1:37:09.160 --> 1:37:12.000
 Which is a contradiction, actually, because Mike Tyson agree.

1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:15.800
 I mean, I actually don't know exactly what I mean.

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.760
 Because he was in the pocket.

1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:19.160
 I think he was trying to do the movement.

1:37:19.160 --> 1:37:21.000
 He was just in the pocket and pressing forward.

1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:24.680
 And like the the fuck you attitude of just like that was a little bit later.

1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:26.480
 When the beats back was towards the cage.

1:37:26.480 --> 1:37:32.800
 But so the we we get that fight and I said to Kyle, I was like, look,

1:37:32.800 --> 1:37:35.920
 this kid has been training martial arts since he was three years old.

1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:38.800
 There's not an area where you're going to out technique him.

1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:42.280
 And so we've got to now channel some of that grit that we know you have.

1:37:42.280 --> 1:37:44.120
 This is an opportunity to showcase it.

1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:46.120
 And I don't know how long I did it for.

1:37:46.320 --> 1:37:49.000
 But because Kyle's much shorter than the beat.

1:37:49.200 --> 1:37:52.560
 So for a good long while while we were training for the beat, I didn't even say

1:37:52.560 --> 1:37:56.920
 anything and I just had clips of Mike Tyson training on the TV in the gym

1:37:57.120 --> 1:37:59.200
 and the head movement and I didn't even mention it.

1:37:59.400 --> 1:38:02.680
 And then we started to like get into it and talk about, you know,

1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:06.520
 getting inside the length of the longer fighter and things like that.

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:10.680
 And we we kind of which when some people train them and may they say, OK,

1:38:10.880 --> 1:38:12.480
 this guy's a really good wrestler.

1:38:12.680 --> 1:38:16.880
 Let's think about avoiding the wrestling or being a better wrestler.

1:38:17.080 --> 1:38:20.920
 And I think that when the difference in skill is so great,

1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:23.720
 those are both the wrong answer.

1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:26.760
 If a guy is a really good wrestler wants to take you down and you don't have a lot

1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:29.200
 of wrestling experience, he's probably going to get you down if he's got a good

1:38:29.400 --> 1:38:32.320
 coach, right? So you have to deal with that.

1:38:32.520 --> 1:38:36.480
 To then say, I'm going to then learn in eight weeks how to wrestle better than a

1:38:36.480 --> 1:38:38.240
 guy who's been wrestling since he was eight years old.

1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:39.240
 There's also a bad idea.

1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:43.680
 So what we concentrated on for that camp and it worked beautifully was not

1:38:43.880 --> 1:38:45.680
 getting caught in chain wrestling.

1:38:45.880 --> 1:38:47.880
 These are the takedowns you're going to get caught with.

1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:51.480
 This is how to not get caught with the next step while you're defending

1:38:51.680 --> 1:38:55.320
 takedown one, because it's the chain of techniques that are going to get fucked.

1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:56.880
 Right. So we talked.

1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:00.840
 We did a ton of work on get ups and breaking the hands from the various

1:39:00.840 --> 1:39:02.520
 takedowns like it was a while ago now.

1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:06.320
 So I don't remember exactly the techniques we worked on, but we concentrated

1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:10.040
 on defend the first takedown and stay out of the chain.

1:39:10.240 --> 1:39:13.320
 Don't get chained into a bunch of wrestling techniques because you will be

1:39:13.520 --> 1:39:16.120
 outwrestled and that was really successful.

1:39:16.120 --> 1:39:20.600
 And then in the third round, it's a beat was tired and he was tired.

1:39:20.800 --> 1:39:21.600
 He's a beat got tired.

1:39:21.600 --> 1:39:23.240
 He cuts a tremendous amount of weight.

1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:28.160
 Like I can't see him staying at 145 forever when they start giving him five round fights.

1:39:28.160 --> 1:39:29.520
 I don't even know if he's on a five round fight.

1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:32.920
 And he may have, but I can't see him staying down there.

1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:34.520
 He's guys like six one.

1:39:34.720 --> 1:39:36.680
 Yeah, guys, he's a giant of a guy.

1:39:36.880 --> 1:39:42.400
 So Kyle pressed forward there and he said he felt that there was no power left

1:39:42.400 --> 1:39:44.600
 in Zabit's hands and so he felt fine.

1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:49.480
 And I think part of it was he fed off the crowd as he moved forward and,

1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:52.320
 you know, saw that.

1:39:52.520 --> 1:39:55.960
 He wasn't taking a lot of damage like the punches weren't staying him.

1:39:56.160 --> 1:39:58.360
 He started walking right through him.

1:39:58.560 --> 1:40:00.800
 It goes to your question of what makes a fighter.

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:06.000
 Was the him walking forward like that?

1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:09.440
 Something that you're born with or is that something you were training?

1:40:09.440 --> 1:40:12.360
 Is that is that the Mike Tyson on TV born with that?

1:40:12.360 --> 1:40:14.960
 Kyle is born with that and the crowd.

1:40:15.160 --> 1:40:17.160
 I've been in Boston.

1:40:17.360 --> 1:40:18.160
 No, it was in New York.

1:40:18.160 --> 1:40:18.760
 It's in Brooklyn.

1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:21.360
 I've been in a lot of arenas for a lot of different sporting events.

1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:24.360
 That's one of the loudest things I've ever heard when he did that.

1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:25.760
 I was going crazy.

1:40:25.960 --> 1:40:29.360
 And you ask about that being like taught or not?

1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:33.560
 Kyle is so much like that that I have to try and tease some of that out of him.

1:40:33.760 --> 1:40:40.360
 Pull it back because he's also so very technical when he wants to be that the

1:40:40.360 --> 1:40:45.000
 emotion and the fun of it gets in the way of his technique and probably has

1:40:45.200 --> 1:40:47.560
 cost him a couple of a couple of wins.

1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:49.800
 And so that's one of the things we work on with him right now is like staying

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:54.120
 within yourself, being a professional, taking your time to download the information

1:40:54.320 --> 1:40:56.680
 in round one and then starting your fight in round two.

1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:00.080
 But the tension between those two things, what makes

1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:06.120
 what on that day created one of the, in my opinion, one of the greatest fights I've

1:41:06.320 --> 1:41:07.840
 ever seen, Joe Rogan agrees.

1:41:07.840 --> 1:41:10.400
 Yeah, it's one of the greatest fights I've certainly ever seen.

1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:13.680
 So like, it's funny that you as a coach,

1:41:13.880 --> 1:41:19.720
 I can see the frustration of like, like throwing away some of the strategy kind

1:41:19.920 --> 1:41:24.600
 of thing, like you seeing like being not happy that there could be things that he

1:41:24.600 --> 1:41:25.880
 could have done to win the fight.

1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:26.920
 It's in retrospect.

1:41:27.120 --> 1:41:30.520
 I think that at that time we were playing with incredible house money.

1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:32.960
 Like Kyle was a gigantic underdog in that fight.

1:41:33.160 --> 1:41:34.360
 The beat was unstoppable.

1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:37.040
 I think people were probably picking him to finish the fight in round one.

1:41:37.040 --> 1:41:40.800
 I think at that point, no one had ever gone the distance with the beat and no one

1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:43.600
 certainly had, you know, put that kind of performance together.

1:41:43.800 --> 1:41:49.240
 And I think Kyle, Kyle put the blueprint out there and in retrospect,

1:41:49.240 --> 1:41:52.680
 when I look at the last round, yeah, there were things that could have been done

1:41:52.680 --> 1:41:55.120
 differently, but we're playing with the house money at that point.

1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:56.880
 Like, I mean, let it fly.

1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.080
 You get to a point where you've got it.

1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:01.400
 You're down three rounds and there's 20 seconds left.

1:42:01.400 --> 1:42:04.440
 You got to move all your chips to the center of the table and, you know,

1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:05.480
 see what happens.

1:42:05.480 --> 1:42:07.280
 Do you remember what Joe Rogan said about it?

1:42:07.480 --> 1:42:09.440
 I remember like he got one over.

1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:13.520
 I think I have trouble remembering because offline we talked about that fight

1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:17.280
 and he's exceptionally impressed by, I mean, Joe's from Boston.

1:42:17.480 --> 1:42:20.320
 So it's like, yeah, I mean, there's a story there.

1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:22.280
 OK, it sucks.

1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:28.320
 Not you naturally want to romanticize like there's a Rocky versus like

1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:35.160
 there's a Rocky for you, I mean, similar, I suppose, kind of chemistry.

1:42:35.160 --> 1:42:40.600
 Kyle's style represents the American ideal, right?

1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:41.360
 The spirit.

1:42:41.360 --> 1:42:42.560
 Yeah. I mean, he's from Gloucester.

1:42:42.560 --> 1:42:46.000
 It's like you could have, you could have dragged him off the docks like three

1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.440
 hours before the fight and said, hey, you want to go fight?

1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:49.280
 And he would have said yes.

1:42:49.480 --> 1:42:51.960
 Yeah. Oh, man, that was a special fight.

1:42:52.160 --> 1:42:55.400
 But that's as per discussion of like greatest fighters of all time.

1:42:55.600 --> 1:43:01.200
 I tend to believe that that fight is more special than the

1:43:01.400 --> 1:43:04.480
 the championship belt defenses by George St. Pierre.

1:43:04.480 --> 1:43:06.320
 Like, you know, there's something to that.

1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:14.680
 Like Rocky, Rocky one is more special than like Rocky three.

1:43:14.880 --> 1:43:15.320
 Right.

1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:20.440
 So it's that the underdog or whatever, like the dance

1:43:20.440 --> 1:43:23.520
 partners, like going to war and like that moment.

1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:24.520
 I mean, it's bigger.

1:43:24.720 --> 1:43:26.640
 It's bigger than any individual fighter.

1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:32.000
 They create that and that I know it's not perhaps good for a career.

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:35.120
 It's not good for like in terms of money, in terms of longevity,

1:43:35.120 --> 1:43:36.280
 in terms of all those kinds of things.

1:43:36.280 --> 1:43:40.000
 But that's a special moment in the history of fighting that you both created.

1:43:40.200 --> 1:43:45.040
 I can remember like right after like there was so much excitement in the air

1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:46.000
 during the third round.

1:43:46.200 --> 1:43:50.640
 And I remember being in the corner and like I was so excited at the end of it

1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:53.040
 that I had forgotten what happened in the other two rounds.

1:43:53.040 --> 1:43:53.680
 I didn't even know.

1:43:53.880 --> 1:43:56.600
 And I looked to to Sean when he the other corner man.

1:43:56.600 --> 1:44:00.160
 And I think I said to him, did we win when you rewatch the fight?

1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:01.360
 Clearly we didn't win the fight.

1:44:01.360 --> 1:44:04.960
 I mean, we lost the other rounds, but I got so caught up in that moment.

1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:11.320
 And then I just remember like I was so in awe of his performance that like I

1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:12.320
 forgot what was going on.

1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:17.080
 And I and it's so hard to not be a fan at that moment and to stay within yourself

1:44:17.080 --> 1:44:20.400
 and try and like coach, but then what the fuck you even coaching at that point?

1:44:20.640 --> 1:44:21.800
 It's like we're rumbling.

1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:22.640
 We got 30 seconds.

1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:23.280
 We're trying to win here.

1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:28.000
 And I remember like the performance itself, I'm not a fan of moral victories,

1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000
 but if ever there was going to be one, that was one.

1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:34.240
 And when the fight was over and I grabbed Kyle, like they hadn't even been to the

1:44:34.240 --> 1:44:35.160
 center of the cage yet.

1:44:35.440 --> 1:44:37.960
 And I just hugged him and I said, you're my fucking hero.

1:44:38.320 --> 1:44:42.840
 And I remember being very emotional about that, that I was able to be a part of that.

1:44:43.120 --> 1:44:46.720
 It feels wrong to say, but I was I kind of avoided saying it.

1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:51.000
 But I think if I'm being honest with my feelings, this is a safe space for feeling.

1:44:51.000 --> 1:44:51.320
 Yeah.

1:44:52.240 --> 1:44:58.160
 Is I think it was the greatest mixed martial arts fight I've ever seen.

1:44:58.160 --> 1:44:59.600
 And I don't think I'm being biased.

1:44:59.600 --> 1:45:01.920
 I was honestly thinking like, am I being biased?

1:45:01.920 --> 1:45:03.960
 I honestly don't think so.

1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:05.360
 I think that was the greatest fight.

1:45:05.360 --> 1:45:08.840
 Like if you want to rank fights I've ever seen, I think to me that was the greatest

1:45:08.840 --> 1:45:09.680
 fight I've ever seen.

1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:16.080
 It certainly was a, uh, one of the greatest displays of like just dogged effort

1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:21.320
 from an underdog who was outexperienced and improbably outsized.

1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:26.160
 But I mean, like you just, Kyle's one of those kids, you're never going to tell

1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:31.160
 him he's out of a fight. He has something you can't teach and I've seen tons

1:45:31.160 --> 1:45:36.160
 of people with more physical attributes and they're just mental midgets.

1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:40.880
 And they got a million dollar body and a 50 cent heart and, and, and Kyle is not

1:45:40.880 --> 1:45:43.440
 that and you can't teach it no matter what you do.

1:45:43.680 --> 1:45:49.680
 But that was, I would say like my career in combat sports, which spans, you know,

1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:53.040
 if you want to go all the way back to like wrestling, like that was one of

1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:58.040
 probably the greatest experiences I've, I've been a part of, it's a bittersweet

1:45:58.040 --> 1:45:59.520
 sport. She's a fickle mistress.

1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:09.360
 Yeah. I mean, the, the tragic aspect of that is, um, like, I guess Kyle lost,

1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:13.360
 right? So like, if you look at the record and all the kind of things,

1:46:13.600 --> 1:46:22.320
 perhaps, um, like you look at the career, maybe like as a financial, from a financial

1:46:22.320 --> 1:46:28.080
 perspective that perhaps is not, uh, the, the greatest thing for Kyle's career or

1:46:28.080 --> 1:46:34.600
 that, or in, in, in the history of the UFC, perhaps it's not, it's not, um, you

1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:38.720
 know, like maybe many people didn't even watch that fight, but it was a special

1:46:38.720 --> 1:46:43.000
 moment that stands in the history. There's not many of these in, uh, in the

1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:44.320
 history of fighting. So.

1:46:44.360 --> 1:46:47.320
 But at the end of the day, when you look at someone's career in the UFC, like

1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:51.840
 financially, there's a, you know, a handful of people that make real money.

1:46:52.200 --> 1:46:56.000
 Everybody else makes nothing. There's a handful of people that make real money.

1:46:56.280 --> 1:47:00.920
 So did that loss cost him in the, in the near term? Sure. But when you look back

1:47:00.920 --> 1:47:03.480
 on your life, you're not going to look back on that loss as something that

1:47:03.480 --> 1:47:06.680
 derailed my life financially and I never recovered from it. That's not going to

1:47:06.680 --> 1:47:11.640
 happen. Like the sad thing is, unless you were a champion and, you know, most,

1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:13.840
 most people are going to be forgotten right after they're gone.

1:47:13.840 --> 1:47:17.440
 Most people will be forgotten. And if you're not forgotten, certainly your,

1:47:17.440 --> 1:47:19.960
 your accolades are going to be misrepresented. Either they're going to

1:47:19.960 --> 1:47:23.600
 be inflated or diminished one way or the other. So looking back on it,

1:47:24.280 --> 1:47:30.240
 it's just so hard to, to quantify that, but it's an experience in like when

1:47:30.240 --> 1:47:34.320
 you're in that moment and you're one of the people like intimately involved

1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:39.280
 in it, like the value of that experience supersedes any financial gain.

1:47:39.280 --> 1:47:43.280
 Where would you put Khabib in the discussion of the greatest of all time?

1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:50.400
 So he recently, we worked together, we watched the fight of him and Justin

1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:56.080
 Gagey and Khabib retired. Would you put him up there as some of the, as one of

1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:01.360
 the greatest or did he never truly find his foil that like the great warrior

1:48:01.360 --> 1:48:06.040
 that challenged him and, um, he never really found his foil.

1:48:06.040 --> 1:48:11.000
 The great warrior that challenged him. And, um, and maybe do you want to,

1:48:11.200 --> 1:48:15.080
 do you think he's fully retired now to answer the question about being fully

1:48:15.080 --> 1:48:19.440
 retired? I don't have any idea. I can't for a second, pretend to, um,

1:48:21.720 --> 1:48:24.360
 think that I understand the way that people from that part of the world

1:48:24.360 --> 1:48:28.000
 think and respect their family and things like that to an American who says,

1:48:28.000 --> 1:48:30.720
 Oh, I promised my mom, I wouldn't do it. I mean, I promised my mom,

1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:33.320
 I wouldn't do a lot of things. I went right out and fucking back door and did

1:48:33.320 --> 1:48:36.640
 them. But I think that that means something different to people in

1:48:36.640 --> 1:48:40.160
 different parts of the world. So I have no idea what kind of weight that

1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:45.960
 carries. So I can't answer that. I can say a lot of times when people think

1:48:45.960 --> 1:48:50.360
 about great fighters, they think about the aspects that make up MMA,

1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:54.080
 like they think of MMA as a pie and they're all these different pieces

1:48:54.080 --> 1:48:57.360
 that make up for, make up the pie. And how good is this piece?

1:48:57.360 --> 1:48:59.120
 And how good is this piece? And how good is this piece?

1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:04.120
 When the fact of the matter is, is you only need one really,

1:49:04.120 --> 1:49:07.760
 really, really good piece. And the other pieces are complimentary pieces to get

1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:13.160
 you to where you're the strongest. And if you want to tell me that Khabib is

1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:17.280
 not the greatest MMA fighter because he doesn't have really slick striking,

1:49:17.800 --> 1:49:21.400
 you can make that argument. But what I can tell you is Khabib has good enough

1:49:21.400 --> 1:49:25.480
 striking to get him to his grappling where he is clearly the best guy at

1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:29.760
 155 they've ever seen. So does that make him the greatest fighter in that

1:49:29.760 --> 1:49:34.680
 division or not? To your point about the foil, they wanted Conor to be his

1:49:34.680 --> 1:49:38.680
 foil and he just manhandled them. I mean, they wanted that to happen,

1:49:39.320 --> 1:49:40.760
 did not happen. So...

1:49:40.880 --> 1:49:45.960
 Well, there's a kind of argument to be made, which we kind of, you get

1:49:45.960 --> 1:49:50.480
 haters in this argument. And you're going to be one of the haters because I

1:49:50.480 --> 1:49:57.160
 know you're, how should I put it, lack of admiration for Conor McGregor.

1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:03.040
 But, you know, what is it? Football is the game of inches.

1:50:03.120 --> 1:50:09.200
 Yeah, there's, there's a sense where, you know, that Conor, there's an

1:50:09.200 --> 1:50:13.680
 argument to be made that Conor wasn't exactly dominated, that he ended up

1:50:13.680 --> 1:50:18.160
 being dominant. Meaning, let me phrase it differently, is there's a lot of

1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:24.000
 points in the fight that it could have, a different trajectory could have

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:28.320
 happened. So he wasn't so far from having a chance at winning that fight.

1:50:28.560 --> 1:50:30.960
 It's just the end, you can focus...

1:50:30.960 --> 1:50:34.760
 Those are the most important moments at the end. You've lost the most

1:50:34.760 --> 1:50:35.640
 important moments.

1:50:35.680 --> 1:50:40.920
 Right. But the road less taken, it could have been, if he didn't lose those

1:50:40.920 --> 1:50:45.240
 very important moments, he had a chance. So I'm saying out of all the people

1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:49.600
 that Khabib fought, it's arguable that Conor was up there, of the people

1:50:49.600 --> 1:50:50.520
 that had a chance.

1:50:51.000 --> 1:50:52.440
 Let me say this first.

1:50:54.920 --> 1:50:55.360
 I love...

1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:56.400
 I'm going to get so much heat for this.

1:50:56.400 --> 1:51:00.720
 I do love Khabib. I'm a huge Khabib fan because I'm a grappler, first and

1:51:00.720 --> 1:51:01.160
 foremost.

1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:04.480
 Me too, because I'm also Russian. I love Khabib, calm down.

1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:05.560
 Okay.

1:51:05.720 --> 1:51:09.960
 But when, when, when Conor came on the scene, I loved Conor because I'm an

1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:12.720
 Irish American and, you know, I want to support him and things like that.

1:51:12.720 --> 1:51:18.120
 And he was, he was good fun. He, he got to be, for my personal taste, he got

1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:21.600
 to be too much of all the people Khabib has fought.

1:51:22.160 --> 1:51:25.360
 I would never fight Conor again if I were him.

1:51:25.400 --> 1:51:30.840
 And here's why. And I said this about the Diaz fight, Nate Diaz, who was

1:51:30.840 --> 1:51:34.440
 one of my favorite fighters has fought the exact same fight for 12 years.

1:51:34.640 --> 1:51:37.360
 Conor will switch something up to give himself an edge.

1:51:37.360 --> 1:51:41.960
 And I believe that Conor would figure something out in fight number two, I

1:51:41.960 --> 1:51:46.040
 think, but I also thought that Gagey would give Khabib problems where it

1:51:46.040 --> 1:51:50.800
 wouldn't be a matter of, I'm going to out wrestle Khabib or become better at

1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:52.560
 defending his wrestling takedowns.

1:51:52.760 --> 1:51:55.040
 Conor would have figured out a way to not get wrestled.

1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:57.440
 I feel like he's constantly changing.

1:51:57.440 --> 1:51:58.640
 He's constantly evolving.

1:51:59.000 --> 1:52:02.480
 And whether or not people realize it or not, I think Conor is one of the

1:52:02.480 --> 1:52:06.320
 better overall athletes in MMA just from looking at his body and his movement.

1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:08.920
 And the way he's shaped, he's got a very tiny waist.

1:52:08.920 --> 1:52:11.480
 He's got really pronounced glutes and shoulders.

1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:15.400
 And I think he's for real athlete, whereas a lot of guys in MMA are not

1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:16.240
 for real athletes.

1:52:16.240 --> 1:52:18.920
 They're just good at one of the things that makes up MMA.

1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:24.080
 I understand what you're saying about if this happened, if that happened.

1:52:24.280 --> 1:52:28.080
 But I mean, you could say that about every single combat sports event ever.

1:52:28.280 --> 1:52:33.120
 If Spinks's hook landed on Tyson, maybe that fight didn't end the way that it did.

1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:34.320
 But you know what?

1:52:34.520 --> 1:52:35.240
 It didn't.

1:52:35.240 --> 1:52:36.480
 You're absolutely right.

1:52:36.680 --> 1:52:40.920
 But if we could talk about just Conor McGregor for a second,

1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:45.160
 I can't wait to get your fan mail or hate mail.

1:52:46.360 --> 1:52:48.760
 Speak to the innovation of Conor.

1:52:48.960 --> 1:52:51.920
 I don't hear very many people making this argument,

1:52:52.760 --> 1:52:56.960
 but is it possible to make an argument that Conor McGregor is one of the greatest

1:52:56.960 --> 1:52:58.040
 fighters of all time?

1:52:59.040 --> 1:53:00.200
 It's an interesting argument.

1:53:00.200 --> 1:53:03.280
 And the problem, the only problem with the argument is there's so much

1:53:03.280 --> 1:53:05.280
 emotion on either side.

1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:11.640
 Yeah. I had a conversation, sorry, to interrupt with Yaron Brooke, who is a

1:53:11.840 --> 1:53:18.600
 philosopher, objectivist, and which is the philosophy of Iron Rand and the

1:53:18.600 --> 1:53:23.040
 amount of emotion around that particular human is fascinating to me.

1:53:23.040 --> 1:53:26.600
 It's similar to the amount of emotion around Donald Trump.

1:53:26.800 --> 1:53:29.440
 You can think of different personalities, maybe Elon Musk.

1:53:29.440 --> 1:53:31.560
 Those are the people that aren't willing to have their mind changed.

1:53:31.560 --> 1:53:33.760
 They're too emotionally attached to the argument.

1:53:33.960 --> 1:53:40.440
 Yeah, but it's weird that why do we, why, why some people inspire so much emotion

1:53:40.640 --> 1:53:41.440
 and others don't?

1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:49.840
 Conor McGregor, I feel like nobody's able to have a calm, like, fight analysis

1:53:49.840 --> 1:53:58.200
 of the guy, like, look to me as just a fan of martial arts, like, I studied judo.

1:53:58.200 --> 1:54:03.760
 I love watching just hours of Olympic judo and appreciating the art from it.

1:54:03.960 --> 1:54:06.040
 Like, I forget the humans involved.

1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:10.640
 Teddy Rene, who's a heavy weight, the most probably the most dominant heavy

1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:15.240
 weight in the history of judo, just studying his gripping, just the art of it.

1:54:15.440 --> 1:54:17.600
 And who cares if there's shit talking?

1:54:17.800 --> 1:54:22.680
 Like, to me, I put all of that aside and just look at the art.

1:54:22.680 --> 1:54:30.000
 And, like, what I really appreciate about Conor McGregor is his innovation,

1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:36.160
 like, of movement, of maybe it's romanticized, maybe you can correct me.

1:54:36.360 --> 1:54:40.600
 I'm just a Cheeto eating fan of mixed martial arts.

1:54:40.800 --> 1:54:46.600
 But, like, I seem to detect more innovation than almost any other fighter

1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:50.720
 that I've paid attention to in Conor McGregor.

1:54:50.720 --> 1:54:56.040
 I think first to I'll answer in two parts, I think, well, I'm not going to answer

1:54:56.040 --> 1:54:58.520
 the first part is just a comment because you didn't ask the question.

1:54:58.720 --> 1:54:59.440
 What was the question?

1:54:59.440 --> 1:55:00.480
 I don't even remember.

1:55:00.680 --> 1:55:06.120
 It's about how Conor McGregor fans are very emotional and Conor McGregor detractors

1:55:06.120 --> 1:55:07.080
 are very emotional.

1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:09.040
 I think fans become very emotional.

1:55:09.040 --> 1:55:12.560
 They become cheerleaders of someone like Conor McGregor or Donald Trump because

1:55:12.760 --> 1:55:16.520
 they see that person exhibiting the qualities that they themselves lack.

1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:18.480
 And so they become cheerleaders for that, right?

1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:23.120
 And I think that for the most part, people who are detractors of Conor McGregor's,

1:55:23.320 --> 1:55:25.400
 they're not really Conor McGregor detractors.

1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:28.040
 They're detractors of Conor's supporters.

1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:31.280
 There's a beef that they have with the people in that bucket, right?

1:55:31.480 --> 1:55:33.520
 Like, it's not really a problem.

1:55:33.720 --> 1:55:36.720
 And that applies probably in our current political climate.

1:55:36.920 --> 1:55:37.280
 Right.

1:55:37.480 --> 1:55:39.160
 Donald Trump with the left and the right.

1:55:39.360 --> 1:55:44.960
 It's more about like they they actually don't like on the others.

1:55:44.960 --> 1:55:49.600
 The caricature, the most extreme versions of what they see in the supporters of the

1:55:49.600 --> 1:55:51.000
 other side. Yeah, that's a good point.

1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.480
 But I think the more interesting thing is the fighter himself.

1:55:53.480 --> 1:55:55.000
 So let's put the supporters aside.

1:55:55.200 --> 1:56:00.120
 I would I would say that, you know, what some people know and some people don't

1:56:00.320 --> 1:56:06.480
 know is that Conor's base is in karate and the karate style of Conor McGregor,

1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:12.400
 Steven Thompson of Lyoto Machida, that type of distance management.

1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:14.480
 A lot of times we think as martial artists,

1:56:14.480 --> 1:56:19.560
 we think that the sport version of the art we've chosen to pursue somehow

1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:23.760
 taints the authenticity and the effectiveness of it.

1:56:23.960 --> 1:56:28.720
 But point karate is what led to that in and out distance management style of Conor,

1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:30.840
 of Lyoto and of Steven Thompson.

1:56:31.040 --> 1:56:33.120
 They all kind of use it a little bit differently,

1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:36.160
 but they use it very effectively, all three of them.

1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:43.200
 And that comes from a world of trying to kind of like step in, land contact on you

1:56:43.200 --> 1:56:46.760
 from my point and then get back out before you can counter strike me.

1:56:46.960 --> 1:56:48.760
 Right. And that's where that comes from.

1:56:48.960 --> 1:56:52.160
 Conor is blessed to have a longer arms

1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:54.640
 than someone his height probably normally has.

1:56:54.840 --> 1:56:57.680
 And his movement is just so fluid.

1:56:57.880 --> 1:57:00.080
 He's so athletic with

1:57:00.280 --> 1:57:04.800
 the hinges of his body, the knees and the hips and the swivel of his body,

1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.560
 which is also the hips and the shoulders.

1:57:07.760 --> 1:57:12.560
 His movement, his distance and the way he sets people up for the straight left hand

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:15.120
 while you're circling away from it and he can still land it,

1:57:15.120 --> 1:57:18.320
 which is what he did to Chad Mendes hit him with a straight left while he was

1:57:18.520 --> 1:57:19.880
 circling away from it.

1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:23.760
 That is something that is very beautiful to watch.

1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:30.480
 And sometimes people see the kicks and they see all the flashy snap kicks and the side kicks.

1:57:30.680 --> 1:57:33.880
 All that stuff is doing is setting people up for the left hand.

1:57:34.080 --> 1:57:35.000
 It's all it's doing.

1:57:35.000 --> 1:57:38.280
 It's you're corralling people, you're funneling people or you're leading the dance

1:57:38.480 --> 1:57:41.480
 and you're bringing them to a spot where you know you can land that left hand.

1:57:41.480 --> 1:57:45.560
 And his ability to do that is masterful.

1:57:45.760 --> 1:57:48.840
 People constantly shit on his ability to grapple and, you know,

1:57:48.840 --> 1:57:52.800
 because a couple of his losses have been to Jiu Jitsu guys or grapplers,

1:57:53.000 --> 1:57:56.640
 but they've been to really good guys like anyone who's going to sit here and tell

1:57:56.640 --> 1:57:59.560
 me Conor McGregor is not a good grappler, go grapple him.

1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:01.800
 Yeah, let me see you grapple him.

1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:06.280
 To that point, I'll also say a lot of people will use Conor

1:58:06.480 --> 1:58:10.720
 McGregor's X guard sweep on Nate Diaz as evidence to his high level grappling in

1:58:10.720 --> 1:58:14.800
 that fight, to which I would also counter Nate Diaz didn't fight that off

1:58:14.800 --> 1:58:18.040
 because he knew he was so much better at Jiu Jitsu off the bottom that he didn't

1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:19.440
 even care if he got swept.

1:58:19.640 --> 1:58:21.680
 So is Conor McGregor innovative?

1:58:21.880 --> 1:58:23.560
 Absolutely.

1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:25.320
 Is he one of the best fighters ever?

1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:28.920
 It's tough to say because he's such a cash cow that he was fed people.

1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:34.320
 I firmly believe no one who who put that Conor McGregor Khabib fight together

1:58:34.520 --> 1:58:36.400
 thought Khabib would win.

1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:37.920
 Wow.

1:58:37.920 --> 1:58:42.640
 I remember so at that time, it was not completely clear.

1:58:42.840 --> 1:58:44.880
 There was a myth of the great Khabib.

1:58:45.080 --> 1:58:48.160
 It wasn't completely clear how good is he really.

1:58:48.360 --> 1:58:49.800
 So that's interesting.

1:58:50.000 --> 1:58:52.960
 And it was unclear how good is Conor also.

1:58:53.160 --> 1:58:53.480
 Right.

1:58:53.680 --> 1:58:57.520
 Like what, because I think to me,

1:58:57.720 --> 1:59:02.080
 maybe part of my admiration for Conor McGregor is rooted in the fact that I

1:59:02.280 --> 1:59:06.520
 thought there's no way he beats Jose Aldo and I thought there's no,

1:59:06.520 --> 1:59:08.960
 definitely no way he beats Eddie Alvarez.

1:59:09.160 --> 1:59:11.960
 And so like when he did,

1:59:12.280 --> 1:59:18.040
 I was like, I had to like my brain was like, like there's something broken.

1:59:18.040 --> 1:59:20.200
 It was like shut down, like I'm windows like froze.

1:59:20.400 --> 1:59:21.480
 We have to rethink this.

1:59:21.680 --> 1:59:25.760
 Like this is a special human that people who argue he's not even in the running

1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:30.360
 of like top 20 is, you know, if you look at the number of defenses, for example,

1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:32.400
 of his belt that he had very, very little.

1:59:32.600 --> 1:59:36.280
 But like to me, I'm one of those people is back to our discussion of like,

1:59:36.280 --> 1:59:38.360
 do moments make great fighters?

1:59:38.560 --> 1:59:43.240
 I think just being able to beat Jose Aldo and I would argue in his prime,

1:59:43.440 --> 1:59:47.120
 some people might disagree in this

1:59:48.960 --> 1:59:53.240
 in a way where he like figures out the puzzle, gets in his head, the entirety of

1:59:53.440 --> 1:59:57.400
 the picture, and then to be, I mean, Eddie Alvarez,

1:59:57.600 --> 2:00:00.360
 would he be considered a really strong wrestler?

2:00:00.560 --> 2:00:05.440
 Like, like, or not, not strong wrestler, strong striker and wrestlers.

2:00:05.440 --> 2:00:06.600
 The whole combination of it.

2:00:06.800 --> 2:00:09.240
 And also, what's the other wrestler he fought?

2:00:09.440 --> 2:00:10.680
 Chad Mendes, Chad Mendes.

2:00:10.880 --> 2:00:13.240
 So let me comment on all those, if I may.

2:00:13.440 --> 2:00:15.160
 So I was at the Chad Mendes fight live.

2:00:15.360 --> 2:00:15.560
 Yeah.

2:00:15.760 --> 2:00:18.160
 And there was a Jiu Jitsu tournament.

2:00:18.160 --> 2:00:18.840
 We're out in Vegas.

2:00:18.840 --> 2:00:21.200
 And so me and my best friend came out and we got some tickets.

2:00:21.400 --> 2:00:24.080
 That night was supposed to be the first Aldo fight.

2:00:24.280 --> 2:00:27.080
 Aldo got hurt like right after I bought the tickets.

2:00:27.280 --> 2:00:28.680
 They pulled Chad Mendes in.

2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:30.400
 He was a little bit out of shape, whatever.

2:00:30.600 --> 2:00:32.120
 You still got to fight the fight.

2:00:32.120 --> 2:00:37.760
 But I don't, I don't want to use that fight as evidence to Conor's greatness

2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:40.400
 because, you know, they pulled Chad Mendes and he was like hunting

2:00:40.400 --> 2:00:42.840
 and drinking beers in the woods and was a little out of shape.

2:00:43.040 --> 2:00:43.240
 Yeah.

2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:48.840
 But if you want to talk about greatness, like that surpasses your in ring

2:00:49.040 --> 2:00:54.480
 accomplishments, I was in the stands that night and

2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:59.680
 the people that came from Ireland to see Conor fight that night single handedly

2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:04.880
 set the market for hotel room prices and airline tickets to Vegas that weekend.

2:01:05.080 --> 2:01:08.680
 These motherfuckers were all dressed like Conor in the stands.

2:01:08.880 --> 2:01:12.160
 They had wool suits on and big beards and the whole thing.

2:01:12.160 --> 2:01:13.960
 I mean, I'm probably wearing pocket watches.

2:01:14.160 --> 2:01:18.760
 Like I never saw more people trying to be someone else.

2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:21.240
 Never saw more people try to be someone else.

2:01:21.440 --> 2:01:24.480
 I mean, there's a level of is there a level of greatness in that?

2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:26.640
 I mean, I don't know how to like part all that out.

2:01:26.640 --> 2:01:28.320
 You're somebody who doesn't admire that.

2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:31.400
 I love that in the sense, the following sense, I think

2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:34.240
 that people don't seem to hold this belief at all.

2:01:34.440 --> 2:01:37.600
 But to me, fighting is not just

2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:42.520
 this isn't like a quiet street fight that nobody watches.

2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:43.760
 This is also a spectacle.

2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:44.920
 This is also a story.

2:01:45.120 --> 2:01:45.320
 Right.

2:01:45.520 --> 2:01:48.800
 There's like there's a professional wrestling element to this.

2:01:49.000 --> 2:01:51.480
 This is not like you think it's just about fighting.

2:01:51.680 --> 2:01:53.880
 If it was just about fighting, you wouldn't.

2:01:54.080 --> 2:01:56.720
 I mean, there's a story to it, I guess.

2:01:56.720 --> 2:02:00.640
 You're right trying to get to it and like greatness has to incorporate that.

2:02:00.840 --> 2:02:05.480
 Like people that criticize again, I might be wrong on this, but I honestly think

2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:13.240
 that Conor McGregor, not nearly as much as Khabib, but he is a true martial artist.

2:02:13.440 --> 2:02:16.840
 I think he respects his opponents despite the talk.

2:02:17.040 --> 2:02:22.880
 I if maybe I'm misreading it, but it feels like he is a storyteller like

2:02:22.880 --> 2:02:28.840
 a jail son and type of like he's constructed this image to play the story.

2:02:28.840 --> 2:02:33.080
 Like just the way he acts after the fight, the honor he shows his opponents.

2:02:33.280 --> 2:02:39.240
 Yeah, there's a real martial artist in there and to dismiss the fact that

2:02:39.440 --> 2:02:44.360
 the story of the fight is part of it because he doesn't just shit talk.

2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:46.440
 This is what people don't seem to understand.

2:02:46.640 --> 2:02:48.240
 He's good at shit talking.

2:02:48.440 --> 2:02:48.840
 Very good.

2:02:48.840 --> 2:02:53.160
 And I'm with you on basically everything you said.

2:02:53.360 --> 2:02:55.080
 I think that there's greatness to that.

2:02:55.280 --> 2:02:57.680
 And I think that he understands how to sell a fight.

2:02:57.880 --> 2:03:01.240
 And I think.

2:03:02.520 --> 2:03:08.400
 What he did to Jose Aldo by getting in his head helped him win that fight.

2:03:08.600 --> 2:03:13.880
 He insulted Jose Aldo and his country so much that he knew Aldo was going to come

2:03:14.080 --> 2:03:15.480
 forward right into that left hook.

2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:17.240
 Was that fighting Brazil, by the way?

2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:17.960
 Do you remember?

2:03:17.960 --> 2:03:21.440
 I don't recall because I know he insulted all of Brazil, but I'm not sure.

2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:22.320
 Yeah, Brazil.

2:03:22.480 --> 2:03:25.240
 But when he tried to do that to Khabib, you could tell that he just was not going

2:03:25.440 --> 2:03:26.080
 to get in Khabib's head.

2:03:26.280 --> 2:03:27.680
 Khabib was unflappable.

2:03:27.880 --> 2:03:32.840
 But there is there is definitely something great about how he moves people.

2:03:33.040 --> 2:03:37.160
 You know, the Irish are like, I mean, Conor's walk out music.

2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:43.400
 Like for people from Ireland of Irish descent, like that shit is like very deep.

2:03:43.600 --> 2:03:43.800
 Yeah.

2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:47.520
 You know, that it's very emotional song.

2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:53.880
 I was, to be honest, a little bit upset with Khabib that he didn't rise.

2:03:54.080 --> 2:03:56.440
 I admire all that entire culture.

2:03:56.640 --> 2:04:01.080
 But there's an aspect to where he could have risen to the occasion of

2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:09.120
 there's the same kind of depth of love of country that Russia has.

2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:11.440
 And is there in Dagestan?

2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:16.200
 Dagestan is a little weird in terms of like, but he could have,

2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:22.680
 especially with Putin's support, where for a bit the full Russian hat of like,

2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:28.200
 this is the great nation, like rise above the culture of Dagestan,

2:04:28.200 --> 2:04:32.800
 which is a small town boy with a small town values of family and all those kinds of things.

2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:40.040
 There's a moment where you inspire entire nations, like the step up and be the foil

2:04:40.040 --> 2:04:47.320
 to the to the great Conor McGregor, where also Khabib becomes the foil to like,

2:04:47.520 --> 2:04:51.080
 like both of them are the foil to each other and become like,

2:04:51.280 --> 2:04:54.320
 that fight was already a great fight, right?

2:04:54.520 --> 2:04:56.800
 But it could have been something historic.

2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:00.160
 Oli versus Fred, I mean, it could have been really historic.

2:05:00.360 --> 2:05:02.840
 And I would argue

2:05:03.040 --> 2:05:07.480
 I guess the biggest disappointment I have and I understand it and I also honor it

2:05:07.480 --> 2:05:14.080
 as a martial artist, but to I'm disappointed that Khabib doesn't seem to

2:05:14.280 --> 2:05:20.040
 even consider the possibility of doing in Moscow, fight number two.

2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:24.800
 So and because that could be narrative wise, if they do it right,

2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:29.120
 that's one of the could be one of the greatest fights in history.

2:05:29.320 --> 2:05:35.760
 Yeah, I think in terms of Khabib and inspiring a country,

2:05:35.760 --> 2:05:41.240
 is it possible that by staying true to the values that he had his entire career

2:05:41.440 --> 2:05:49.120
 and getting to the the zenith of of his art form and still doing it in that humble way?

2:05:49.120 --> 2:05:50.920
 Isn't it possible that that inspires?

2:05:51.120 --> 2:05:51.880
 100 percent.

2:05:52.080 --> 2:05:53.920
 So I should I should clarify that.

2:05:54.120 --> 2:05:59.200
 I think they're just hearing from people from my fellow comrades.

2:05:59.400 --> 2:06:03.480
 No, is they love that they love they love that.

2:06:03.480 --> 2:06:10.000
 But they there's also a brash, beer chugging, shit talking thing that people

2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:12.280
 really like about Connor and I do love that.

2:06:12.480 --> 2:06:17.200
 But the beautiful narrative would have been the clash, the real clash of those cultures.

2:06:17.400 --> 2:06:23.240
 So Khabib chooses to live the culture by walking away.

2:06:23.440 --> 2:06:29.120
 There's also like a clash of them sort of walking, not walking away from the fire,

2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:33.720
 but walking into the fire of this of this brashness.

2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:36.400
 It's the sort of

2:06:36.600 --> 2:06:41.560
 the cool, collected like calmness of the Dagestan people.

2:06:41.560 --> 2:06:43.520
 It's like you were talking about the Saitia brothers.

2:06:43.720 --> 2:06:46.320
 So they just view it totally differently.

2:06:46.520 --> 2:06:51.080
 And, you know, there are stereotypes about the Irish where they're

2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:54.800
 maybe potentially a louder, more boisterous culture.

2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:56.320
 And I haven't heard of that.

2:06:56.320 --> 2:07:01.440
 Yeah. And I mean, I thought they each played their part perfectly.

2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:05.360
 And all those things that you're describing could have happened,

2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:08.800
 maybe Khabib steps up and he carries the proverbial flag, so to speak,

2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:10.680
 for a nation of people and they go to battle.

2:07:10.880 --> 2:07:13.560
 But the fight, if it plays out the same way, is still the fight.

2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:16.240
 And it was it was an OK fight.

2:07:16.440 --> 2:07:17.640
 It wasn't a great fight.

2:07:17.840 --> 2:07:20.880
 It was, you know, the fight was OK.

2:07:20.880 --> 2:07:27.720
 And I think that, again, I don't have any idea what Khabib's obligations to his

2:07:27.920 --> 2:07:32.960
 family are. I don't I don't think either of those guys, you know, is want for more

2:07:33.160 --> 2:07:38.000
 money to do another fight is just a legacy thing.

2:07:38.200 --> 2:07:40.600
 It's just about,

2:07:40.800 --> 2:07:43.880
 you know, fulfilling some some part of a legacy.

2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:50.640
 And I just I admire the possibility of a great legacy of that is bigger

2:07:50.640 --> 2:07:53.400
 than either of the fighters, I think, with Khabib.

2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:57.440
 He kind of he's not as concerned about legacy, I think.

2:07:57.640 --> 2:08:00.080
 Right. There's your promoter's dream

2:08:00.280 --> 2:08:03.440
 because you want the rematch and the only thing that makes more money than the

2:08:03.640 --> 2:08:05.280
 rematch is the trilogy.

2:08:05.480 --> 2:08:08.040
 You got to split the split the rematch.

2:08:08.040 --> 2:08:10.240
 You hope Connor wins and then you have the trilogy fight.

2:08:10.440 --> 2:08:11.600
 And now you're all in.

2:08:11.800 --> 2:08:12.720
 Yeah.

2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:18.000
 Yeah, I can't get into Khabib's head, but I know Putin just the game,

2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:21.640
 the entirety of it, especially at the time, especially if it was Trump as

2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:30.040
 president, if he was as president at the time and and Putin and in Russia.

2:08:30.240 --> 2:08:35.280
 And just knowing how masterful Connor is at like

2:08:35.480 --> 2:08:37.440
 because Connor would would be a different Connor.

2:08:37.440 --> 2:08:41.400
 I think he would be a calmer Connor, like there would be a different

2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:44.720
 like because you don't want to be over the top Connor with the Russian people.

2:08:44.720 --> 2:08:48.960
 Right. No, that's it's like dangerous ground beat.

2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:54.480
 That's that was the episode in the hotel in Brooklyn when

2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:57.320
 some of the Russian guys confronted

2:08:57.520 --> 2:08:59.800
 Artem and then Connor came over.

2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.400
 It's not but the danger of that.

2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:08.200
 I mean, there is the element of just like real danger and the real almost of war.

2:09:08.400 --> 2:09:09.680
 It's I don't know.

2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:15.240
 It was like when when when Chail Sonnen was talking so much smack at maybe it was

2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:17.800
 against Vanderlei Silva, I don't know.

2:09:17.800 --> 2:09:20.160
 And there's one of those fights where they just didn't think he was going to make

2:09:20.360 --> 2:09:22.560
 it out of Brazil. Yeah.

2:09:22.760 --> 2:09:24.240
 Americans don't get it.

2:09:24.440 --> 2:09:27.720
 Yeah, people take some of that shit in different parts of the world very,

2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:28.840
 very seriously.

2:09:29.040 --> 2:09:30.320
 But that's what makes it beautiful.

2:09:30.520 --> 2:09:32.720
 That's that's what makes a great story.

2:09:32.920 --> 2:09:35.320
 And I think fighting is very much about the stories,

2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:40.480
 not just about the the the particular outcomes of a fight or the skill set

2:09:40.680 --> 2:09:43.800
 matching or like the chess of the of the fight.

2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:47.280
 It's also about the story of the greater

2:09:47.480 --> 2:09:51.720
 like context of societies of warring.

2:09:51.920 --> 2:09:53.120
 We're like warring cultures.

2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:55.760
 We're still we still go to war.

2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:02.160
 We're no longer can have great big hot wars between nations because of nuclear

2:10:02.160 --> 2:10:05.280
 weapons. This is our wars that we can have.

2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:10.760
 And, you know, in some sense, I feel robbed of the great war that could have happened.

2:10:10.960 --> 2:10:13.760
 It doesn't mean there aren't lots of wars going on.

2:10:13.760 --> 2:10:16.080
 But yeah, the big one is not going to happen.

2:10:16.080 --> 2:10:19.000
 There's too much of a balance of power with, you know, nuclear weapons and

2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:22.960
 technology and stuff, but it's not the end of war.

2:10:23.160 --> 2:10:26.760
 No. Do you think there's always going to be war?

2:10:26.960 --> 2:10:31.520
 I think there'll always be war, especially in underdeveloped parts of the world.

2:10:31.520 --> 2:10:35.200
 Isn't there always underdeveloped relatively parts of the world?

2:10:35.400 --> 2:10:39.200
 Yeah, I mean, at some point, though, you'd think, I mean, the way that, you know,

2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:43.560
 technologies expanding and we're bringing technology to weird parts of the world that

2:10:43.760 --> 2:10:50.160
 you wouldn't think of as technologically advanced the way that the Chinese are

2:10:50.360 --> 2:10:54.040
 inhabiting certain areas for mining purposes and things like that.

2:10:54.240 --> 2:10:59.240
 I think underdeveloped parts of the world will get developed quickly.

2:10:59.240 --> 2:11:02.040
 I just wonder like what the nature of that war might be.

2:11:02.040 --> 2:11:03.000
 It could be cyber.

2:11:03.000 --> 2:11:04.280
 It could be all those kinds of things.

2:11:04.280 --> 2:11:06.360
 I think in developed nations, it's going to be cyber.

2:11:06.360 --> 2:11:08.120
 I think that's probably the next phase of war.

2:11:08.120 --> 2:11:10.760
 But I mean, I think you talk about parts of the world like the Middle East,

2:11:10.760 --> 2:11:13.320
 and it's just still going to be warring tribal factions.

2:11:13.520 --> 2:11:17.600
 We can't even begin to understand what those people are fighting about over there.

2:11:17.800 --> 2:11:21.040
 Yet, yet everyone sitting in America on their couch has an opinion.

2:11:21.240 --> 2:11:24.240
 Like you can't even begin to understand it.

2:11:24.440 --> 2:11:25.280
 I sure can't.

2:11:25.480 --> 2:11:27.800
 Yeah, it's back to the principal's discussion.

2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:33.920
 When when when what's violated is much deeper than just kind of anything we can

2:11:34.120 --> 2:11:38.200
 even in a middle class existence can even comprehend.

2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:41.320
 A lot of times American soldiers will go to war because that's what they're told

2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:44.600
 to do, and maybe they disagree with the orders and maybe they agree with the orders.

2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:49.120
 But I get a sense that people in the Middle East fighting all believe in what they're

2:11:49.320 --> 2:11:53.040
 fighting for. It's not it's not a thing where they're told to go do it.

2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:57.440
 I believe they're they really believe that what they're doing is the right thing

2:11:57.440 --> 2:11:59.680
 and they're defending some sort of principle.

2:11:59.880 --> 2:12:02.560
 Are you generally optimistic about

2:12:02.760 --> 2:12:05.640
 the future, speaking of war, of human civilization?

2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:10.600
 Do you think we'll like.

2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:15.600
 You know, people talk about the Fermi Paradox and asking, you know, why haven't

2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:20.360
 aliens visited us if you believe they haven't visited us?

2:12:20.560 --> 2:12:26.280
 You know, one of the thoughts is that there's a kind of a great filter that

2:12:26.280 --> 2:12:31.200
 intelligence civilization reach a point where it destroys itself naturally.

2:12:31.200 --> 2:12:32.400
 So that's why we haven't seen them.

2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:34.040
 They don't last very long.

2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:37.320
 There does seem to be a kind of.

2:12:37.520 --> 2:12:39.720
 We seem to be advancing faster and faster and faster.

2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:43.120
 We keep developing more and more powerful ways of destroying ourselves in all kinds

2:12:43.320 --> 2:12:48.520
 of ways, not even, you know, just even to say nuclear weapons alone.

2:12:48.720 --> 2:12:50.920
 But there's all kinds of new ways.

2:12:50.920 --> 2:12:59.760
 Engineer, pandemics, nanotechnology, AGI, all those kinds of things.

2:12:59.960 --> 2:13:05.840
 It seems to be that the argument that we

2:13:06.040 --> 2:13:11.840
 are going to destroy ourselves in some kind of creative way very shortly is not

2:13:12.040 --> 2:13:13.600
 too crazy of an argument to make.

2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:18.920
 Are you more optimistic or pessimistic about the prospects of human civilization

2:13:18.920 --> 2:13:21.080
 in maybe the 22nd century?

2:13:21.280 --> 2:13:26.160
 Like, is it possible that your generation is the last generation to be alive on Earth?

2:13:26.360 --> 2:13:31.840
 No, but I wouldn't say that five generations from now, that won't be that that could be true.

2:13:32.040 --> 2:13:34.160
 I guess I think of it really selfishly.

2:13:34.360 --> 2:13:39.120
 I'm a big believer that when your time here on Earth is over,

2:13:39.320 --> 2:13:44.680
 the overwhelmingly vast majority of people will be forgotten within 12 calendar months.

2:13:44.880 --> 2:13:47.600
 People with no family will be forgotten sooner.

2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:51.280
 And so I don't give a lot of thought to what will happen to Earth or mankind when

2:13:51.480 --> 2:13:55.640
 I'm gone, I give more thought to maximizing my time here now.

2:13:55.840 --> 2:14:01.440
 And I want to do it in a way where I don't

2:14:01.640 --> 2:14:05.560
 I'm not overtly hindering the future of civilization or humankind.

2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:10.520
 But I'm definitely taking a me first approach to how I live on Earth.

2:14:10.720 --> 2:14:15.280
 Do you have a philosophy behind why you have or don't have kids

2:14:15.280 --> 2:14:19.880
 on this topic? Because for many people when they have kids,

2:14:20.080 --> 2:14:24.720
 there's a sense it's almost like a genetic sense or something like that,

2:14:24.920 --> 2:14:30.520
 where all of a sudden you do start caring about what happens five generations from now.

2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:33.800
 I mean, I think I'm just too selfish.

2:14:34.000 --> 2:14:37.280
 I mean, I'm that's I think that's the easy answer.

2:14:37.480 --> 2:14:40.400
 Like, I know that your whole life has to change.

2:14:40.400 --> 2:14:45.920
 You know, your your focus, everything shifts and just don't want to do that.

2:14:46.120 --> 2:14:51.280
 Also, like, I think that there's a level of I guess if I have to like really unpack it,

2:14:51.480 --> 2:14:54.520
 there's probably a level of

2:14:54.720 --> 2:14:56.400
 lack of hope in the future.

2:14:56.600 --> 2:15:02.160
 Like, I don't think it's I don't think the world and humanity is going in the right direction.

2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:04.480
 What does the right direction look like?

2:15:04.680 --> 2:15:08.240
 I think the right direction looks like people

2:15:08.240 --> 2:15:12.040
 coming back together in in a more

2:15:12.240 --> 2:15:18.800
 impactful human way, in person, touching, feeling,

2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:20.320
 talking face to face.

2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:22.760
 So all the things you're describing is what we had,

2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:25.160
 as you mentioned before, when you were like a teenager.

2:15:25.360 --> 2:15:26.800
 Yeah, so the state of the world.

2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:28.920
 But that's because your mind was formed then.

2:15:29.120 --> 2:15:31.760
 It very well could be, it very well could be.

2:15:31.960 --> 2:15:33.720
 It's very possible that the virtual reality

2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:37.600
 worlds that will create will be actually a much higher level of existence.

2:15:37.600 --> 2:15:43.000
 In fact, like now we're getting, we're moving slowly away from tribalism.

2:15:43.200 --> 2:15:47.040
 Perhaps you could argue the ideas of nations and we're going,

2:15:47.240 --> 2:15:51.480
 we're moving into the realm of ideas and it could be a higher form of existence

2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:57.520
 where we're sort of moving past the constraints of our meat vehicles

2:15:57.720 --> 2:15:59.360
 into the space of our minds.

2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:02.080
 It depends what you value because when you sit here and you talk about it,

2:16:02.280 --> 2:16:05.920
 you know, and you're talking about these things and these humongous levels on these

2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:08.800
 macro levels. And I don't think a lot of people view it that way.

2:16:09.000 --> 2:16:12.040
 I think a lot of people view it as like, what kind of pizza am I getting tonight?

2:16:12.240 --> 2:16:14.560
 Like it's a much different outlook.

2:16:14.760 --> 2:16:19.680
 And sure, the virtual world that's on the horizon,

2:16:19.880 --> 2:16:22.520
 I'm sure it's got benefits and will help people.

2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:25.000
 But is it going to help the things that you find valuable?

2:16:25.200 --> 2:16:26.600
 Like, is it going to help commerce?

2:16:26.800 --> 2:16:29.080
 OK, sure. Is that the thing you find the most valuable?

2:16:29.280 --> 2:16:30.960
 Is it going to help communication?

2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:33.240
 Well, it'll help disseminating information.

2:16:33.240 --> 2:16:35.960
 Is it going to help explain the information you're disseminating?

2:16:35.960 --> 2:16:37.040
 Probably not.

2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:39.480
 Is it going to hinder interpersonal communication?

2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:41.880
 Absolutely. And those are things I find valuable.

2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:46.520
 Interpersonal communication, talking to people like the like,

2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:50.520
 it saddens me when I go into a restaurant and there's five year old kids who like,

2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:53.720
 you know, slamming away on an iPad and can't make eye contact with anybody

2:16:53.920 --> 2:16:57.360
 or teenagers who don't say please and thank you when they order from the waitress.

2:16:57.560 --> 2:16:59.320
 Like that to me is wrong.

2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:00.360
 That shit's wrong.

2:17:00.360 --> 2:17:04.600
 And I don't know this for a fact, but I do attribute that to, you know,

2:17:04.800 --> 2:17:08.080
 using technology as a crutch when we're raising raising kids.

2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:09.080
 Yeah.

2:17:09.280 --> 2:17:13.240
 You know, I think those are those are things that I find valuable.

2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:14.440
 I tried to empathize.

2:17:14.440 --> 2:17:17.040
 I mean, I agree with you as a person who grew up in a certain age,

2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:20.680
 but like prior to the internet, I suppose,

2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:25.840
 but or at least solidified the early philosophies of the way I see the world

2:17:25.840 --> 2:17:31.760
 prior to the intro, uh, during the time of AOL, let's put it this way.

2:17:34.960 --> 2:17:36.400
 What was your aims screen name?

2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:37.120
 I never had one.

2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:37.680
 OK.

2:17:37.880 --> 2:17:40.480
 Dude, I was the last person I knew to get a cell phone.

2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:46.240
 I was so anti all that stuff because I just felt like I didn't want to be a part of it.

2:17:46.440 --> 2:17:47.520
 I did not want to be a part of it.

2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:54.280
 I joined the underground forum about MMA in 2000 or 2001 when I first started training.

2:17:54.280 --> 2:17:58.120
 Um, I think right at the tail end, I got a MySpace, but I didn't have any of that

2:17:58.320 --> 2:17:59.720
 stuff and I didn't want any of it.

2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:00.600
 I don't know why.

2:18:00.800 --> 2:18:03.040
 I just was I was not into it.

2:18:03.240 --> 2:18:07.680
 I felt like, like, what are the good things that are going to come out of it?

2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:10.960
 Oh, I'm going to I'm going to get my package in two days instead of four days.

2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:12.600
 Does that make my life better?

2:18:12.800 --> 2:18:16.960
 I try to I try to deeply empathize with a lot of experiences of other people.

2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:21.920
 And like one of the things I love, like the smell of paper books and books in general.

2:18:21.920 --> 2:18:27.440
 And early on, this is like five years ago, I just gave away all my books and I said,

2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:32.400
 you know, I'm really going to try to fall in love with the books in the same way I

2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:37.200
 did before, but now with a Kindle or not a Kindle, like Paperwhite, whatever,

2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:40.000
 the e book reader, e reader.

2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:45.920
 And I'm still not there, but I've been kind of trying to fall in love with that

2:18:45.920 --> 2:18:49.680
 experience and the same way I try to think like teenagers are really into

2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:52.920
 TikTok now, like making these short videos.

2:18:53.120 --> 2:18:56.920
 I try to consider the possibility that their existence will be a much happier

2:18:57.120 --> 2:19:00.320
 one than I've had because of this kind of interaction.

2:19:00.520 --> 2:19:05.160
 It's for my sort of skeptical perspective, it's like the attention span is so short

2:19:05.360 --> 2:19:08.560
 they don't really deeply think or deeply experience things.

2:19:08.760 --> 2:19:14.160
 They construct a social layer that they present to the world and they work on

2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:18.680
 creating this social layer, like the presentation to the world much more than

2:19:18.680 --> 2:19:22.120
 really sitting alone with their thoughts and the sadnesses and their hopes and

2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:28.120
 dreams and fears and like working on the project that is their their own

2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:31.800
 like actual person that exists in this physical world as opposed to working on

2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:35.440
 the project of a particular social platform that they show.

2:19:35.640 --> 2:19:38.800
 But like perhaps that project,

2:19:39.000 --> 2:19:41.640
 like who cares who you are in the physical space?

2:19:41.840 --> 2:19:45.640
 Maybe what you are is what your Instagram shows.

2:19:45.840 --> 2:19:47.680
 That's the more important project to work on.

2:19:47.680 --> 2:19:51.160
 Well, what's reality is it was reality perception is reality, right?

2:19:51.360 --> 2:19:56.280
 So how other people perceive this constructed thing, that's their reality of you.

2:19:56.480 --> 2:19:57.960
 But is it your reality like that?

2:19:58.160 --> 2:20:01.400
 I mean, like we said earlier, it's what what you want.

2:20:01.600 --> 2:20:06.600
 How you want people to see you is very rarely in line with how you really are

2:20:06.800 --> 2:20:08.320
 or how you see yourself.

2:20:08.520 --> 2:20:12.280
 And I mean, I can remember being like a 13 year old kid and like when you go

2:20:12.280 --> 2:20:16.800
 through a bunch of weird 13 year old kid shit, like sitting in my room,

2:20:16.800 --> 2:20:20.600
 like turning a red light on and listening to like a sad record and like,

2:20:20.800 --> 2:20:23.120
 you know, trying to figure out what's going on inside.

2:20:23.320 --> 2:20:25.160
 Sometimes you like it, sometimes you don't like it.

2:20:25.360 --> 2:20:29.840
 But I feel like those experiences are lost on kids constantly connected to a phone

2:20:29.840 --> 2:20:33.200
 and like, you know, I don't know what the remedy for those situations is.

2:20:33.200 --> 2:20:35.440
 Nowadays, like, I don't know, do they make a TikTok video?

2:20:35.640 --> 2:20:37.120
 Do they they blog about it?

2:20:37.320 --> 2:20:40.640
 Do they, you know, make a video or nobody blogs anymore, bro?

2:20:40.840 --> 2:20:43.240
 Whatever, man, or

2:20:43.240 --> 2:20:48.360
 or a video, a story about, oh, this is what happened to me and blah, blah, blah, blah.

2:20:48.360 --> 2:20:51.880
 Like, does that actually help them work it out or does it just create more noise

2:20:51.880 --> 2:20:55.520
 and more static on how to get to the root of the problem and learn about themselves?

2:20:55.720 --> 2:20:58.480
 I don't know what future social networks are exactly.

2:20:58.680 --> 2:21:02.840
 I do know on a shallow level, this feel good when somebody clicks like on something.

2:21:03.040 --> 2:21:08.120
 I think that is more of a drug than an actual deep, long lasting fulfilling

2:21:08.120 --> 2:21:12.680
 happiness, but perhaps there is a way to make a social network that does lead to

2:21:12.680 --> 2:21:17.920
 a long lasting happiness that's somehow detached from the physical meat space.

2:21:18.120 --> 2:21:21.400
 I don't know, but it feels like you want to give that a chance.

2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:25.520
 Do you think when people are liking things on social media,

2:21:25.720 --> 2:21:29.080
 do you think there's just a group of people, an overwhelming majority of people

2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:31.680
 that are going to like whatever you put out there, they're clicking like.

2:21:31.880 --> 2:21:35.240
 And then there's another section of people that just constantly scroll and like,

2:21:35.440 --> 2:21:39.480
 scroll and like and scroll and like, like, do you think

2:21:39.480 --> 2:21:44.920
 when you get a like on content, you put out that that like perhaps came from someone

2:21:45.120 --> 2:21:49.800
 who normally doesn't like your content, but like you've just changed their mind

2:21:50.000 --> 2:21:52.480
 on something or you've turned them around on it.

2:21:52.680 --> 2:21:55.080
 I tend to think that when I get likes on social media,

2:21:55.280 --> 2:21:57.720
 those are just the people that like all my shit, no matter what I say.

2:21:57.920 --> 2:21:59.120
 Like they probably don't even read it.

2:21:59.120 --> 2:22:02.560
 Like I could put the most preposterous thing up there and you're still going

2:22:02.560 --> 2:22:04.160
 to get a handful of the same exact likes.

2:22:04.360 --> 2:22:08.200
 That's interesting, but I tend to, the way I see likes, you're kind

2:22:08.200 --> 2:22:13.760
 of, you said multiple things, I think in one sense, you see social media as

2:22:13.960 --> 2:22:18.360
 like a battleground of ideas and like is it kind of indicated like the best possible

2:22:18.560 --> 2:22:24.960
 like is an indicator of like, of the of you winning over somebody on an idea.

2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:26.320
 And they really appreciate that idea.

2:22:26.320 --> 2:22:27.240
 That's the best possible.

2:22:27.440 --> 2:22:31.600
 Like to me, a like is just two strangers smiling at each other.

2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:36.080
 Like like a moment of like, like I got you, bro.

2:22:36.280 --> 2:22:37.000
 Yeah, I got you, bro.

2:22:37.200 --> 2:22:37.560
 Yeah.

2:22:37.560 --> 2:22:41.840
 Yeah, like fist bump, like, yeah, we're in this fucking thing together.

2:22:42.040 --> 2:22:44.720
 This whole thing doesn't make any sense, but we're in this together.

2:22:44.920 --> 2:22:48.360
 And I think it's possible for likes to be that.

2:22:48.560 --> 2:22:53.520
 I don't think the actual clicking of a like, I think social media at its best

2:22:53.720 --> 2:22:56.760
 might be that where it's like, I got you, bro.

2:22:56.960 --> 2:23:06.000
 And it's a large scale as opposed to kind of this weird like crazy pool of dopamine

2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:10.360
 where everyone's just obsessed with this likes and likes and and then the vision

2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:15.920
 drives like more of this like weird, anxious engagement.

2:23:16.120 --> 2:23:19.720
 I think that's just the dark version of it in the early days of social media.

2:23:19.920 --> 2:23:22.720
 I think you called it a battleground of ideas,

2:23:22.720 --> 2:23:26.800
 but I think social media is nothing but a battleground of fragile egos.

2:23:27.000 --> 2:23:29.400
 Well, but humans are fragile egos.

2:23:29.600 --> 2:23:34.920
 I mean, maybe, but I think the people, I think, particularly on social media,

2:23:34.920 --> 2:23:37.040
 they're the most fragile.

2:23:37.240 --> 2:23:39.080
 Like,

2:23:39.280 --> 2:23:41.560
 would you be doing all the things you're doing?

2:23:41.760 --> 2:23:44.440
 What would you be doing if you weren't?

2:23:46.560 --> 2:23:51.160
 If you weren't podcasting and posting the things you do on social media,

2:23:51.360 --> 2:23:52.440
 what would you be doing?

2:23:52.640 --> 2:23:55.680
 You'd probably be much the same guy, right?

2:23:55.880 --> 2:23:59.640
 But I think that on social media, the fragile ego people,

2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:03.360
 what you see on social media is not what they'd be doing without social media.

2:24:03.560 --> 2:24:04.440
 Does that make any sense?

2:24:04.440 --> 2:24:08.240
 Like, you're probably your mission is probably somewhat congruent.

2:24:08.440 --> 2:24:10.960
 Your path, you're just utilizing social media.

2:24:10.960 --> 2:24:14.480
 But I think a lot of people, social media has changed their path.

2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:18.040
 And now they're doing something totally

2:24:18.240 --> 2:24:23.520
 foreign to them and they're only able to do it maybe because of social media.

2:24:23.720 --> 2:24:25.800
 I think you're focusing on a particular

2:24:26.000 --> 2:24:33.040
 moment in time of people in their less great moments, like in their less great

2:24:33.040 --> 2:24:36.480
 version of themselves, I think you're just focusing on the masses,

2:24:36.680 --> 2:24:39.880
 struggling to to become the best version of themselves.

2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:43.280
 And then you, yeah, sure, for stretches of time,

2:24:43.480 --> 2:24:47.400
 whether it's days, weeks or months, you could be a shady person on the Internet.

2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:50.360
 I think you're

2:24:50.560 --> 2:24:51.520
 focusing on that.

2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:57.560
 And unfortunately, social media platforms emphasize they love it when you're like

2:24:57.760 --> 2:25:01.360
 that, when you're not doing great in your own in your own life,

2:25:01.360 --> 2:25:06.200
 because it increases anxiety, increased engagement, makes you more susceptible to

2:25:06.400 --> 2:25:11.040
 an argument and then really get pulled into like conspiracy theories, all that kind of stuff.

2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:12.640
 But the other side works, too.

2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:15.120
 I think there's also the people who are on social media like

2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:19.280
 fronting like they're these positive figures and like, you know,

2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:23.240
 go into the gym, like whatever it is, the positivity that they spew out.

2:25:23.240 --> 2:25:26.000
 But in real life, they're the most negative fucks you've ever met in your life.

2:25:26.000 --> 2:25:27.520
 And they're just so full of crap.

2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:30.200
 And it's just people playing to an audience.

2:25:30.200 --> 2:25:33.840
 It's like you said, like it's like a politician sometimes.

2:25:33.840 --> 2:25:37.280
 Like a politician wakes up one day and they decide, who's the group I can pander

2:25:37.480 --> 2:25:40.320
 to the best to get the most likes equals votes?

2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:41.840
 And it's the same thing on social media.

2:25:42.040 --> 2:25:44.880
 People wake up and whether it's conscious or not,

2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:48.600
 what's the group I can pander to the best to get the most likes?

2:25:48.800 --> 2:25:50.680
 Is it the positivity motivated crowd?

2:25:50.880 --> 2:25:52.280
 Is it the woe was me crowd?

2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:53.200
 Like, what is it?

2:25:53.200 --> 2:25:54.720
 Who's going to give me the most likes?

2:25:54.920 --> 2:25:56.720
 That's what I'll do.

2:25:56.920 --> 2:25:58.640
 I don't know how to argue against that.

2:25:58.640 --> 2:26:00.920
 I guess it's it's

2:26:01.120 --> 2:26:05.360
 it rings true what you're saying, but I just kind of refuse to believe it.

2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:08.280
 I guess I'm pandering to the optimistic crowd.

2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:13.160
 Like I met with my marketing team and I just feel that

2:26:13.360 --> 2:26:17.360
 love has the the best what do you call it?

2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:18.040
 No, I don't know.

2:26:18.040 --> 2:26:21.120
 There's a lot of people that accuse me of being like exactly that,

2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:22.800
 which is like, why are you always being positive?

2:26:23.000 --> 2:26:26.360
 It's like, well, because I'd like to be that.

2:26:26.360 --> 2:26:29.800
 Yeah, but I don't I wouldn't consider you someone who panders.

2:26:30.000 --> 2:26:34.600
 No, but, you know, I guess what I'm saying is like,

2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:42.280
 it's easy to say that everyone is pandering, but like maybe they're just trying.

2:26:42.480 --> 2:26:45.960
 I do believe that social media platforms could encourage people when they're

2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:48.280
 trying to be the best version of themselves, whatever that is.

2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:50.560
 It could be like Conor McGregor talking shit.

2:26:50.560 --> 2:26:51.880
 It could be just being positive.

2:26:52.080 --> 2:26:55.080
 It could be actually creating cool things in this world,

2:26:55.080 --> 2:26:58.960
 putting out instructional videos for Jiu Jitsu or like inspiring students

2:26:58.960 --> 2:27:03.000
 through competition, I don't know, all those kinds of things, educational content.

2:27:03.200 --> 2:27:05.000
 I think that people are trying.

2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:08.520
 I tend to believe that people want to be

2:27:08.840 --> 2:27:14.280
 good, like like they want to be successful, whatever that definition of success is.

2:27:14.280 --> 2:27:15.880
 And they're kind of struggling to do that.

2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:18.000
 And they're just awkward at it at first.

2:27:18.200 --> 2:27:23.200
 And like it's easy to focus on the awkwardness and the the stumbling around us.

2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:25.240
 People have that and they start shitting on each other.

2:27:25.440 --> 2:27:27.160
 It's easy to kind of focus in on that.

2:27:27.360 --> 2:27:30.520
 But I think that's just like people, you know, white belts.

2:27:30.720 --> 2:27:32.880
 There's more white belts in the world than there are black belts.

2:27:32.880 --> 2:27:34.680
 But you got to give them a chance to kind of grow.

2:27:34.880 --> 2:27:38.000
 I think on social media, if you put your stuff out there, whatever your stuff is,

2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:41.560
 your content, your views or whatever, you let the chips fall where they may.

2:27:41.760 --> 2:27:45.520
 Like that's a different thing than being like, I'm going to I'm going to tweak

2:27:45.520 --> 2:27:50.040
 what I normally might say and put it up this way because I want these people to like it.

2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:54.760
 And in terms, I also think I have a different viewpoint than you do

2:27:54.760 --> 2:27:56.480
 on people wanting to be successful.

2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:59.520
 I actually don't think that many people want to be successful.

2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:03.640
 I think people want to have the appearance of wanting to be successful.

2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:06.480
 But to be successful takes a shitload of work.

2:28:06.480 --> 2:28:08.240
 And most people don't want to put that work in.

2:28:08.440 --> 2:28:12.760
 So they craft this persona of a person who's trying really hard, but just can't

2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:18.080
 catch the break or, you know, these motherfuckers with getting back on my grind.

2:28:18.280 --> 2:28:19.400
 You've never been on a grind.

2:28:19.400 --> 2:28:20.560
 You've been on the couch.

2:28:20.760 --> 2:28:21.840
 I still disagree with you.

2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:23.200
 I get it. I get it.

2:28:23.400 --> 2:28:24.960
 You that's your foil.

2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:27.120
 You enjoyed that guy in the couch with the cheetos.

2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:29.440
 That's your motivation.

2:28:29.640 --> 2:28:30.200
 But just own it.

2:28:30.400 --> 2:28:33.480
 Be like, don't be like back on a grind, be back on the couch.

2:28:33.680 --> 2:28:34.040
 Yeah.

2:28:34.240 --> 2:28:37.960
 Well, you're like David Goggins, who was like talking shit to the one guy

2:28:37.960 --> 2:28:43.400
 with the eating cheetos and in so doing inspires millions to like to actually

2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:44.400
 pursue their success.

2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:44.880
 I get it.

2:28:44.880 --> 2:28:48.560
 But I just think that most people really do want to be successful.

2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:52.600
 And are like, are trying to work hard and they keep failing.

2:28:52.800 --> 2:28:55.600
 So I mean, but why is it, why is it continue?

2:28:55.600 --> 2:28:58.600
 I'm sorry to interrupt you, but like, let's take a person who's overweight.

2:28:58.800 --> 2:28:59.000
 Yeah.

2:28:59.200 --> 2:29:01.120
 Do you not think that person wants to be skinny?

2:29:01.120 --> 2:29:02.600
 Of course they want to be skinny.

2:29:02.800 --> 2:29:07.280
 They just don't want it enough to put the pizza or the pie down and go to the gym.

2:29:07.480 --> 2:29:09.840
 They want it, but they want it to be easy.

2:29:10.040 --> 2:29:11.400
 Of course they want to be skinny.

2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:12.880
 Well, everyone wants it to be easy.

2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:16.720
 Right. And of course people, people want to be successful, but do they want it

2:29:16.720 --> 2:29:18.360
 enough to do the work?

2:29:18.560 --> 2:29:19.560
 I don't think they do.

2:29:19.760 --> 2:29:26.960
 I think the easy thing to do is to create an outward facing persona of the person

2:29:27.160 --> 2:29:33.200
 who really wants it and you get the same reward from a lot of people as the person

2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:34.640
 who actually is successful.

2:29:34.840 --> 2:29:39.080
 Very few people differentiate from the person who's found success and the person

2:29:39.280 --> 2:29:42.520
 who's showing you how they're trying to get success on social media.

2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:44.080
 People see that as the same.

2:29:44.080 --> 2:29:49.800
 I see you're going after the marketing dollar that represents the people that want

2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:53.760
 to work hard. Yeah, I like it.

2:29:53.960 --> 2:30:02.400
 You started a podcast recently called which people probably from this conversation

2:30:02.400 --> 2:30:05.840
 can I guess we didn't really talk about politics much or the fact that you're a

2:30:05.840 --> 2:30:11.160
 business owner or the fact that you're a red blooded American and love this country

2:30:11.160 --> 2:30:15.600
 America, we didn't really talk about that, but from the name of the podcast,

2:30:15.800 --> 2:30:20.320
 they can probably infer it and the name is please allow me.

2:30:20.520 --> 2:30:22.880
 Good name.

2:30:24.160 --> 2:30:27.600
 What have you learned from doing this podcast?

2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:29.920
 What's your hope of doing this podcast?

2:30:29.920 --> 2:30:31.720
 For people should definitely listen to it.

2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:32.880
 You have a few episodes out.

2:30:33.080 --> 2:30:36.280
 You're damn good at it, which is very interesting.

2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:40.200
 I'm sure you'll evolve and change, but so this is like the early days.

2:30:40.200 --> 2:30:41.720
 I'm curious to see where it goes.

2:30:41.920 --> 2:30:47.880
 But what's your thinking around it as an intellectual, putting your thoughts out

2:30:48.080 --> 2:30:52.840
 into the world? I think that one of the things that COVID did when we were all

2:30:53.040 --> 2:30:57.480
 kind of in lockdown was as a business owner, it made me take stock of what's

2:30:57.680 --> 2:30:59.000
 the future of brick and mortar businesses.

2:30:59.200 --> 2:31:04.840
 And I've always been reluctant to be an online presence in any way just because

2:31:04.840 --> 2:31:07.760
 it's not my thing because I believe that I'm a force of nature and people need to

2:31:07.760 --> 2:31:10.080
 experience me, right?

2:31:10.280 --> 2:31:13.080
 And the few characters that Twitter has

2:31:13.280 --> 2:31:16.000
 are not enough to experience the force of nature.

2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:17.040
 There's John Clark, right?

2:31:17.040 --> 2:31:19.400
 I want you to feel physically uncomfortable around me.

2:31:19.600 --> 2:31:23.160
 I've been three hours of me being physically uncomfortable.

2:31:23.360 --> 2:31:24.920
 I'm scared for my life.

2:31:25.120 --> 2:31:28.440
 And so I thought that that would be one of the ways in which I could increase.

2:31:28.640 --> 2:31:31.720
 Like I came to the conclusion that

2:31:31.920 --> 2:31:35.920
 with the lockdown and potential future lockdowns, you know,

2:31:35.920 --> 2:31:41.920
 in order to pay my mortgage and, you know, my bar tab and my Grubhub's out of control,

2:31:42.120 --> 2:31:45.320
 that I would need to find ancillary ways to

2:31:45.520 --> 2:31:48.760
 DoorDash slash Lex, you don't want to use Grubhub.

2:31:48.960 --> 2:31:50.160
 Grubhub sucks. DoorDash.

2:31:50.360 --> 2:31:50.880
 They actually do.

2:31:51.080 --> 2:31:52.480
 DoorDash. No, I'm just kidding.

2:31:52.680 --> 2:31:57.400
 Just walk to your local food area and get the food.

2:31:57.600 --> 2:32:02.400
 You can order 711 from DoorDash or from Postmates Code Lex.

2:32:02.600 --> 2:32:04.320
 OK, I'm sorry.

2:32:04.320 --> 2:32:07.400
 But anyway, I thought it was like, oh, I should probably increase a little bit

2:32:07.600 --> 2:32:13.720
 my online presence and what would be a way to do that that would be fun for me

2:32:13.920 --> 2:32:14.720
 and entertaining.

2:32:14.920 --> 2:32:19.800
 And I thought, well, a lot of people yourself included that I know have done

2:32:20.000 --> 2:32:24.880
 some podcasts and I find that inspiring and I'm fortunate enough to know a bunch

2:32:25.080 --> 2:32:30.920
 of cool motherfuckers that, you know, I can talk to about a lot of a wide range of topics.

2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:35.560
 Then there is an aspect to which podcasting does capture the force of nature,

2:32:35.760 --> 2:32:40.480
 but in the digital form, podcasting captures the force of nature of a human

2:32:40.480 --> 2:32:42.280
 being better than other mediums, perhaps.

2:32:42.480 --> 2:32:43.240
 Yeah, definitely.

2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:43.760
 There's that.

2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:46.320
 I just felt like,

2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:51.680
 you know, you know, when it's midnight and you're in the bar and you get the sense

2:32:51.680 --> 2:32:54.920
 that, you know, the bar is going to close in 90 minutes and you think, you know,

2:32:54.920 --> 2:32:56.680
 not enough people have seen me yet.

2:32:56.880 --> 2:32:59.400
 And maybe we should go to another bar so more people can see me.

2:32:59.400 --> 2:33:03.640
 Yeah, I feel like podcasting is like, is like that for me.

2:33:03.840 --> 2:33:05.560
 Not enough people have heard my thoughts.

2:33:05.760 --> 2:33:08.680
 And I feel like my mom raised me to be a giver.

2:33:08.880 --> 2:33:14.880
 She didn't want me to be selfish and I have these thoughts that I think that I think

2:33:15.080 --> 2:33:16.920
 it'd be a waste if you didn't give it to the world.

2:33:17.120 --> 2:33:18.320
 People seem to really enjoy them.

2:33:18.520 --> 2:33:18.840
 Yeah.

2:33:19.040 --> 2:33:25.480
 No, I enjoy while I've probably been on my best behavior today on this episode of the podcast.

2:33:25.480 --> 2:33:29.520
 So if you want the uncensored, unfiltered,

2:33:29.720 --> 2:33:35.120
 the full spectrum that the force of nature is John Clark, you go to the podcast.

2:33:35.320 --> 2:33:39.120
 You funny enough, I think they're drinking throughout most of the podcast.

2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:40.160
 Yeah, yeah.

2:33:40.360 --> 2:33:40.920
 Tequila.

2:33:41.120 --> 2:33:44.120
 So they only last like an hour because you seem to like,

2:33:44.320 --> 2:33:47.040
 I'm guessing that you just lose it one hour.

2:33:47.240 --> 2:33:50.240
 Like it's like Cinderella turns into a frog or whatever.

2:33:50.440 --> 2:33:54.600
 One of the things I'm learning is

2:33:54.600 --> 2:33:58.600
 sometimes you have great conversations when you're drunk and sometimes you don't.

2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:03.480
 Like I was I went into it with the right drunk edit sober mentality.

2:34:03.680 --> 2:34:05.000
 Yes, Hemingway.

2:34:05.200 --> 2:34:06.080
 Hemingway, yes.

2:34:06.280 --> 2:34:09.520
 But turns out that

2:34:09.720 --> 2:34:12.880
 sometimes you don't have that much to edit when you're super shitfaced.

2:34:13.080 --> 2:34:17.080
 And so I've been scaling that back a little bit.

2:34:17.280 --> 2:34:18.480
 What do you mean exactly by that?

2:34:18.680 --> 2:34:20.480
 Like where does it go wrong when you're drunk?

2:34:20.680 --> 2:34:22.600
 I'm curious about that because.

2:34:22.600 --> 2:34:25.600
 It gets you, especially when you have a personal

2:34:25.600 --> 2:34:28.960
 relationship with the person that you're talking to, rather than trying to put some

2:34:28.960 --> 2:34:32.720
 ideas on display for other people to hear and maybe talk about, you wind up just

2:34:32.720 --> 2:34:36.080
 having like a conversation with your bro about inside jokes and things like that.

2:34:36.080 --> 2:34:37.840
 And it's like, it's not that interesting.

2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:42.240
 No one wants to like watch, you know, go to a bar and watch two people at the

2:34:42.440 --> 2:34:45.720
 sitting there getting drunk and talking to each other is different than listening

2:34:45.920 --> 2:34:48.440
 to like strong discourse.

2:34:48.640 --> 2:34:51.440
 Yes, one interesting thing as a fan of Joe Rogan.

2:34:51.440 --> 2:34:55.760
 I've been a fan of Joe Rogan for a long time and he has his friends over a lot,

2:34:55.960 --> 2:35:00.040
 right? And there there is a aspect to those three, four, five hour conversations

2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:02.080
 that I really enjoy. There's a magic to those.

2:35:02.280 --> 2:35:06.080
 I think he taught the world that those kinds of long form conversations can work.

2:35:06.280 --> 2:35:10.560
 The what you forget is Joe Rogan is a comedian.

2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:12.400
 His friends are also celebrities.

2:35:12.600 --> 2:35:14.800
 Like they know what it's like to be on the mic.

2:35:15.000 --> 2:35:20.000
 They know there is a challenge to actually having your friends on a microphone.

2:35:20.000 --> 2:35:23.720
 Totally. Like they've never, this is the first time they've been on a microphone.

2:35:23.920 --> 2:35:27.680
 And that's actually what you've been doing, which is a very interesting experiment.

2:35:27.880 --> 2:35:31.840
 And you find that some are more awkward than others.

2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:35.000
 They're trying to find like, what do I do with this kind of thing?

2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:37.680
 Why? Why do you not talk to strangers?

2:35:37.880 --> 2:35:41.240
 Why did you go with people that you're actually no?

2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:45.320
 So the simple answer is the people that I selected are both interesting and I thought

2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:46.360
 would be good at talking.

2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:48.520
 But then I noticed the thing you just mentioned.

2:35:48.520 --> 2:35:51.200
 My buddy Paul did the first one and Paul's a wild man.

2:35:51.400 --> 2:35:56.560
 And if you went out with Paul, he can talk about a bazillion topics to a certain

2:35:56.760 --> 2:36:00.120
 to a to a significant level of depth, right?

2:36:00.120 --> 2:36:04.760
 And he's got a good understanding and he's got a unique perspective on a lot of things.

2:36:04.960 --> 2:36:10.600
 And I think he was the first guy invited on my podcast.

2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:13.720
 And it was almost like

2:36:13.920 --> 2:36:16.840
 he was on a little bit less than natural about it.

2:36:16.840 --> 2:36:21.280
 And then by the time he loosened up with some drinks, he was it just we were all

2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:25.240
 shitfaced. There's a there's a face shift that totally, totally.

2:36:25.440 --> 2:36:29.160
 And so he's going to come back on and he'll be more comfortable with it.

2:36:29.360 --> 2:36:33.280
 And and it'll probably be awesome because he's a great person to talk to.

2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:36.880
 I had my friend Dave on who's a restaurateur and a musician.

2:36:37.080 --> 2:36:39.040
 That that one will be released pretty soon.

2:36:39.240 --> 2:36:42.880
 But yesterday I had a guy on who you might really enjoy listening to who's a friend

2:36:43.080 --> 2:36:44.480
 of mine, his name is Mark Clem.

2:36:44.480 --> 2:36:48.240
 He's an endurance athlete and he's been compared.

2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:50.720
 He's been called the White Dave Goggins.

2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:55.960
 And he talks about like those comparisons and what he hates about it and the various

2:36:55.960 --> 2:36:59.480
 events and stuff. And he's just a guy who's just always kind of like natural.

2:36:59.680 --> 2:37:01.800
 And like, I knew he'd be great to get on the podcast.

2:37:02.000 --> 2:37:03.800
 And

2:37:04.000 --> 2:37:08.720
 so I started with friends who I thought could handle it and who also are just

2:37:08.920 --> 2:37:10.160
 really interesting people.

2:37:10.160 --> 2:37:15.320
 And and I did it so that I could also establish a level of comfort because it was

2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:18.400
 a new thing for me and they I knew that they wouldn't really give a shit what I

2:37:18.400 --> 2:37:20.040
 was doing and be like, Hey, this is cool.

2:37:20.040 --> 2:37:21.080
 I'm going over J.C.'s house.

2:37:21.080 --> 2:37:22.640
 We're going to drink some tequila and talk shit.

2:37:22.680 --> 2:37:24.440
 There's just going to be a microphone there this time.

2:37:24.640 --> 2:37:26.480
 I mean, it's amazing what you're doing, the freedom of it.

2:37:26.480 --> 2:37:29.400
 I mean, you're not currently doing any advertisements or any of that kind of stuff.

2:37:29.400 --> 2:37:30.640
 You're just exploring your voices.

2:37:30.640 --> 2:37:32.800
 One of the mediums that you're just trying it out.

2:37:33.000 --> 2:37:34.720
 My 11 subscribers know what I'm about.

2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:37.880
 Your 11 subscribers is in the double digits.

2:37:37.880 --> 2:37:43.720
 Yeah, for both you and I, do you have advice for me as a

2:37:43.920 --> 2:37:46.560
 podcaster and for yourself as a podcast?

2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:50.480
 Like, if if you were to think like you're going to do, say, I mean, who knows?

2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:53.480
 But say you do a thousand more episodes, right?

2:37:53.680 --> 2:37:59.120
 I can imagine a world where that that your life continues in that direction.

2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:02.760
 That this is like a little parallel to like for me, this thing is like a little

2:38:02.960 --> 2:38:06.840
 side hobby, but it's also one that's deeply fulfilling.

2:38:06.840 --> 2:38:10.480
 So not just from a business perspective, which is not the way I think about it.

2:38:10.680 --> 2:38:15.520
 I just think from a life human perspective, it's I probably wouldn't have this kind

2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:20.600
 of conversation with you off mic, like this long, this deep, this attentive.

2:38:20.800 --> 2:38:23.360
 There's something really fulfilling about these conversations.

2:38:23.560 --> 2:38:26.080
 So what advice would you have for me?

2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:27.760
 What advice do you have for yourself?

2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:30.720
 Or have you not introspected this that deeply?

2:38:30.920 --> 2:38:31.840
 I have a lot.

2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:32.480
 I have advice.

2:38:32.480 --> 2:38:36.640
 I think the first advice I would give to you is I think you should have me on more

2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:39.520
 often. Yeah.

2:38:39.720 --> 2:38:46.560
 That's first and second is go on your podcast and I would say I would say you

2:38:46.760 --> 2:38:52.120
 come on my podcast when you're ready, when you feel like the product that I'm

2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:56.920
 putting out would benefit from your presence in vice versa.

2:38:57.120 --> 2:39:01.680
 Not not as a not as a favor to a bro, but at the right time.

2:39:01.880 --> 2:39:05.200
 I do sense that she's it's an interesting there's a dance to it,

2:39:05.200 --> 2:39:07.640
 which is like Joe.

2:39:07.840 --> 2:39:13.440
 I recently did like Joe Rogan had a conversation with me on this podcast.

2:39:13.640 --> 2:39:19.280
 There's a very specific kind of thing where you you're helping each other out.

2:39:19.480 --> 2:39:19.840
 Yeah.

2:39:20.040 --> 2:39:22.080
 But the timing on that has to be right.

2:39:22.280 --> 2:39:22.520
 Right.

2:39:22.720 --> 2:39:26.160
 You know, like if that makes any sense, you're like supporting each other.

2:39:26.360 --> 2:39:27.520
 It doesn't make sense.

2:39:27.720 --> 2:39:29.280
 It doesn't it doesn't make a difference.

2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:32.760
 You would think that because it's it's just people talking.

2:39:32.760 --> 2:39:35.280
 It doesn't matter what microphones, but it changes things.

2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:35.640
 It does.

2:39:35.640 --> 2:39:39.080
 And there's an order to the guests that I've had on and the next guest that I'll

2:39:39.280 --> 2:39:44.200
 have on will be a friend we have in common and we'll be talking about teaching

2:39:44.200 --> 2:39:46.640
 and how to teach different styles of teaching and what you're teaching.

2:39:46.640 --> 2:39:47.480
 All these other things.

2:39:47.680 --> 2:39:48.640
 You mind saying who?

2:39:48.840 --> 2:39:55.160
 Sean Fisher and I think there's an order to it's not scientific,

2:39:55.360 --> 2:39:56.560
 but it's based on my gut.

2:39:56.760 --> 2:40:00.440
 Is it astrologically based?

2:40:00.440 --> 2:40:02.680
 What do you mean it's not scientific?

2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:07.080
 You're you've got so you have a sense like Joe Rogan, for example,

2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:09.520
 tries to do left, right?

2:40:09.720 --> 2:40:14.200
 He tries to alternate like this this gut feeling of like these bins of people.

2:40:14.400 --> 2:40:17.040
 And he tries to alternate worldviews.

2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:17.960
 That's interesting.

2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:23.080
 Like he kind of so that he doesn't feel like it like it shake.

2:40:23.280 --> 2:40:24.960
 It constantly shakes him.

2:40:25.160 --> 2:40:29.480
 It's more about him like constantly pulls him in multiple directions about like

2:40:29.480 --> 2:40:32.520
 how he sees the world and that keeps him balanced.

2:40:32.720 --> 2:40:34.520
 That keeps the conversation kind of exciting.

2:40:34.720 --> 2:40:35.280
 That's interesting.

2:40:35.480 --> 2:40:39.920
 I did it in a way where I knew Paul was going to be wild and we might get a little

2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:43.360
 out of control and like have some technical hiccups along the way.

2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:46.800
 And then my friend Jake, who's a CEO of a pharmaceutical company,

2:40:47.000 --> 2:40:50.680
 that was very timely because, you know, he was able to speak to vaccines.

2:40:50.680 --> 2:40:52.560
 And that was kind of scientific flavored.

2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:53.040
 Yeah.

2:40:53.240 --> 2:40:58.560
 And what I learned listening back on that is like I learned for myself about

2:40:58.560 --> 2:41:01.840
 I wasn't asking the next level questions

2:41:02.040 --> 2:41:04.000
 to really draw out great answers.

2:41:04.200 --> 2:41:07.440
 And part of it is

2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:10.960
 you're simultaneously hanging out with a bro, but also I was trying to learn

2:41:10.960 --> 2:41:12.680
 something and I didn't learn what I wanted to learn.

2:41:12.880 --> 2:41:15.560
 And that's my fault because I didn't ask the questions.

2:41:15.760 --> 2:41:17.280
 He's an expert in that field.

2:41:17.480 --> 2:41:20.720
 He doesn't know that I'm an absolute dipshit when it comes to that stuff.

2:41:20.920 --> 2:41:22.080
 And so I didn't do a good job.

2:41:22.080 --> 2:41:25.040
 And if I don't know what that means, the thing I was trying to tease out of him,

2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:27.560
 no one who was going to listen is going to learn that either.

2:41:27.560 --> 2:41:30.080
 Yeah. So I learned that.

2:41:30.280 --> 2:41:34.520
 And then I had the one with soap on, which I thought was was pretty good.

2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:36.520
 There's the rest. There's also a farmer.

2:41:36.720 --> 2:41:38.400
 Right. And a social worker.

2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:40.600
 And kind of humble and thoughtful.

2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:43.200
 Yeah, thoughtful, thoughtful guy, like slower.

2:41:43.400 --> 2:41:45.120
 It's not a wild man, that kind of thing.

2:41:45.120 --> 2:41:48.080
 Not a wild man in the sense that I'm wild, but he does preach this

2:41:48.280 --> 2:41:52.800
 this philosophy of being more wild, like being in touch with nature.

2:41:53.000 --> 2:41:54.600
 Nature, that that that kind of.

2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:55.600
 Right, right, right.

2:41:55.600 --> 2:41:59.160
 And then my buddy Dave, he came on,

2:41:59.360 --> 2:42:03.240
 you know, because I love music and I wanted to talk a lot about music.

2:42:03.240 --> 2:42:06.400
 And he's one of the most knowledgeable people about music that I know.

2:42:06.400 --> 2:42:07.560
 And he's got a restaurant coming up.

2:42:07.760 --> 2:42:12.920
 And I thought my buddy Mark Clem, being an endurance athlete, like when you hear

2:42:12.920 --> 2:42:16.040
 some of the, I didn't even know these things existed that this fucking kid did.

2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:17.360
 He's out of his mind.

2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:21.120
 And, you know, I think Sean and I will have probably the most intellectual

2:42:21.320 --> 2:42:23.840
 conversation that I'll have had on my podcast to date.

2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:26.240
 And so there's a little bit of alternating there.

2:42:26.440 --> 2:42:30.920
 But, you know, I did it that way.

2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:33.520
 So that there's a gut feeling behind.

2:42:33.720 --> 2:42:35.240
 Oh, so that what is there?

2:42:35.440 --> 2:42:36.320
 Where are you going?

2:42:36.520 --> 2:42:38.400
 Do you know where you're going?

2:42:38.600 --> 2:42:43.560
 I don't have a destination, but I want to.

2:42:45.040 --> 2:42:48.360
 I want to see it to its end, whether that's

2:42:48.560 --> 2:42:53.520
 it gets somewhere of its own volition or it takes on a new life at some point.

2:42:53.520 --> 2:42:57.440
 And then I know how to drive it where it needs to go.

2:42:57.640 --> 2:42:59.760
 I think

2:42:59.960 --> 2:43:04.600
 the advice I have for both of us is

2:43:04.800 --> 2:43:08.040
 I think I need to.

2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:09.760
 No, I don't think so.

2:43:09.960 --> 2:43:12.800
 I think for you, I see an inner turmoil.

2:43:13.000 --> 2:43:18.240
 I see a storm that bruising you because I feel like there's a concern for what

2:43:18.240 --> 2:43:23.160
 you're saying and is it going to get is it going to is it going to.

2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:29.320
 Lead to negative feelings towards you or the thing that you're doing.

2:43:29.520 --> 2:43:32.440
 And I feel like

2:43:32.640 --> 2:43:37.240
 we're different people and I have such an easier time saying fuck off to everybody.

2:43:37.440 --> 2:43:39.920
 And that's a liberating thing.

2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:44.880
 But it also can keep can keep me from achieving the thing that I want to achieve

2:43:44.880 --> 2:43:50.000
 because I'm so flippant with opinions that I don't listen to them and let them

2:43:50.200 --> 2:43:53.280
 direct me when they should. There's a balance.

2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:54.760
 Let me push back on that.

2:43:54.960 --> 2:43:57.760
 I think you believe that about yourself.

2:43:57.760 --> 2:44:01.120
 And nevertheless, your social media presence indicates otherwise.

2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:05.760
 If I were to be very harsh, you're like one of the mentally strongest,

2:44:05.960 --> 2:44:07.360
 characterized people I know.

2:44:07.560 --> 2:44:11.560
 And yet on social media, you don't put your face to the world.

2:44:11.560 --> 2:44:16.760
 No, like one of the reasons you sense the fear in me, which exists,

2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:23.280
 I of course, want to let go of it is because I put my face on like my name on things.

2:44:23.480 --> 2:44:26.080
 And so when I say something stupid,

2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:31.960
 it it hurts when people did say like, look, that guy said something stupid.

2:44:32.160 --> 2:44:36.400
 And so there's a fear of saying something stupid in all of his different forms,

2:44:36.600 --> 2:44:38.440
 like of being my lesser self.

2:44:38.440 --> 2:44:41.840
 It's the same feeling I have in competition of like of losing,

2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:43.720
 not just losing, losing doesn't matter.

2:44:43.920 --> 2:44:45.880
 It's embarrassing myself.

2:44:46.080 --> 2:44:49.000
 I like losing, being the lesser version of myself.

2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:52.560
 And when you put yourself out there in a full way, I think you

2:44:52.760 --> 2:44:57.040
 I would venture to say you're also because you like said you don't you wouldn't

2:44:57.040 --> 2:44:58.200
 give yourself that advice.

2:44:58.400 --> 2:45:01.480
 I feel like you're also afraid of standing behind some of the ideas

2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:03.560
 because right now you're doing guerrilla warfare.

2:45:03.560 --> 2:45:11.560
 You're you're free to to to be to say things, to speak your mind from the sidelines.

2:45:11.760 --> 2:45:16.080
 But the moment you're standing and like when people can throw shit at you,

2:45:16.280 --> 2:45:19.760
 I feel like you haven't faced that fire yet.

2:45:19.760 --> 2:45:21.080
 You've been like avoiding that fire.

2:45:21.080 --> 2:45:22.800
 I'm not sure. Maybe I'm projecting.

2:45:23.000 --> 2:45:24.520
 No, to a degree, you're right.

2:45:24.720 --> 2:45:29.160
 I think like a big thing for me was putting like ads on for like our

2:45:29.160 --> 2:45:35.680
 Jiu Jitsu online like curriculum. That was a big thing for me because

2:45:35.880 --> 2:45:40.760
 for several reasons, like in the climate of everyone under the sun having,

2:45:40.960 --> 2:45:45.000
 you know, a Jiu Jitsu tutorial online and social media, not social media

2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:49.480
 necessarily, but forums specifically that critique and shit the bed.

2:45:49.680 --> 2:45:52.640
 One thing I have not done that I've thought about doing and probably

2:45:52.840 --> 2:45:56.960
 you're right in your analysis of it is I've not gone the way that I do see you

2:45:56.960 --> 2:46:00.080
 on things like Reddit and say, hey, Reddit, I'm doing this.

2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:04.440
 Like I could easily go to Reddit and say, hey Reddit, I got this website up.

2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:06.800
 Here's a here's a sample video, whatever the fuck people do on there.

2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:07.640
 But yeah, you're right.

2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:08.440
 I haven't done that.

2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:15.480
 And part of it might be because I I I know also.

2:46:15.680 --> 2:46:18.600
 If I get suckered in for one second into the negativity,

2:46:18.800 --> 2:46:22.160
 I'm going to become an online warrior and I don't want to be that person.

2:46:22.360 --> 2:46:24.960
 So yeah, you're self aware about that.

2:46:24.960 --> 2:46:30.800
 I mean, one of the things I've early on decided is like, I'm just going to be,

2:46:31.000 --> 2:46:32.640
 I've always really enjoyed being positive.

2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:35.440
 So I'm going to make sure I stay that way.

2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:38.400
 And when there's negativity, it's like

2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:40.000
 I'm not just ignoring it.

2:46:40.200 --> 2:46:42.720
 I'm literally just returning it with positivity.

2:46:42.920 --> 2:46:45.560
 I like I probably am the same way as you.

2:46:45.760 --> 2:46:48.240
 Most people are with with egos.

2:46:48.440 --> 2:46:51.000
 You get you want to become the warrior against the negativity.

2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:55.440
 And like like many wars, there's no winning.

2:46:55.640 --> 2:46:59.040
 There's no winning that war online, especially on the Internet.

2:46:59.240 --> 2:47:04.040
 And so in that sense, that's that's been a journey to try to

2:47:04.240 --> 2:47:07.360
 to face the fire of the negativity.

2:47:07.560 --> 2:47:08.720
 And it's not actually that bad.

2:47:08.720 --> 2:47:09.920
 It sounds like very dramatic.

2:47:09.920 --> 2:47:13.280
 There's not many people that are negative, but it's like when you put

2:47:13.280 --> 2:47:16.680
 advertisements or you put your face on an instructional or something like that.

2:47:16.880 --> 2:47:17.280
 Right.

2:47:17.480 --> 2:47:20.680
 It just there's an aspect to it, which you're being a salesman.

2:47:20.680 --> 2:47:22.720
 You're being a gimmicky thing.

2:47:22.920 --> 2:47:23.240
 Right.

2:47:23.440 --> 2:47:27.360
 It just feels wrong and people will point out, look that guy is a fraud.

2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:29.040
 It's fake. Look, he's trying.

2:47:29.240 --> 2:47:31.160
 But those people are going to be out there.

2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:35.840
 And if you're like trying to do your best, trying to be authentic and not trying to

2:47:36.040 --> 2:47:44.640
 like be a snake oil salesman and being like the shady kind of salesman.

2:47:44.840 --> 2:47:46.240
 I think they keep you honest.

2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:49.080
 They keep you honest and being the most authentic self.

2:47:49.080 --> 2:47:53.320
 And podcasting is like the best medium because you're being real.

2:47:53.520 --> 2:47:58.520
 Those one hour plus that you put out there, that's like real, John.

2:47:58.720 --> 2:48:04.000
 That's not like people, people fall in love with that.

2:48:04.200 --> 2:48:08.800
 And then that's the beautiful aspect of podcasting is there's no

2:48:09.000 --> 2:48:13.880
 long form, doesn't give any possibility for you not to be authentic.

2:48:14.080 --> 2:48:14.600
 Right.

2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:16.400
 And that's why it's a magical medium.

2:48:16.400 --> 2:48:24.760
 And the tough thing is you're not, you know, popularity takes time, popularity.

2:48:24.960 --> 2:48:27.480
 And so like you shouldn't be doing it for that reason.

2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:33.320
 And I don't, it's not the thing that really drives me.

2:48:33.520 --> 2:48:34.280
 Yeah.

2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:38.400
 Is there three books, Technical Fiction or Philosophical that had an impact on you?

2:48:38.400 --> 2:48:42.840
 Like, is there books that you kind of return to that you enjoy and they had, you know,

2:48:42.840 --> 2:48:44.560
 that you find profound in some way?

2:48:44.560 --> 2:48:49.080
 I would say like probably the thing I read is in one of Emerson's essays that I read

2:48:49.280 --> 2:48:52.560
 at a, you know, point in my life where I needed that type of thing.

2:48:52.760 --> 2:48:56.320
 And I read Self Reliance and, you know, he's got a ton of good essays,

2:48:56.520 --> 2:49:01.160
 but I thought Self Reliance was probably the most impactful to me.

2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:07.000
 You know, I've read later in life like a handful of, you know, existential authors.

2:49:07.200 --> 2:49:08.760
 And they're all great.

2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:11.800
 But at the time, a lot of it has to do with timing.

2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:16.800
 And when I read Self Reliance and it was about the individual that was really good

2:49:17.000 --> 2:49:19.240
 and made it was impactful.

2:49:19.440 --> 2:49:24.640
 There's also a book called Jonathan Livingston's Seagull by Richard Bach, I think.

2:49:24.840 --> 2:49:27.440
 And it's kind of along the same lines.

2:49:27.440 --> 2:49:31.800
 It's about this seagull who, you know, wants to break conformity and learn to fly

2:49:31.800 --> 2:49:33.160
 and do all these other great things.

2:49:33.160 --> 2:49:34.960
 And so it's a very short read.

2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:37.720
 So if people are interested in that, that's good.

2:49:37.720 --> 2:49:43.960
 The book, which I was lucky enough to read before the movie ever even came out,

2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:45.920
 which is just a pleasure of mine.

2:49:46.120 --> 2:49:47.720
 It was American Psycho.

2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:52.520
 Just from a writing standpoint, I found that the writing was awesome.

2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:55.640
 Brett Easton Ellis is the author of that and several other books who have like

2:49:55.840 --> 2:49:57.320
 intertwining characters.

2:49:57.520 --> 2:49:58.960
 He's a New England prep school guy.

2:49:59.160 --> 2:50:03.800
 And so a lot of like the stories and a lot of the visuals

2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:08.400
 rang true for me and anyone who can write four pages of prose on like a Huey

2:50:08.600 --> 2:50:11.320
 Lewis album and kudos to you.

2:50:11.520 --> 2:50:14.440
 And I also would say no one will do this.

2:50:14.640 --> 2:50:16.280
 But.

2:50:16.480 --> 2:50:23.840
 I would at some point read as much of one of the big three religious texts as possible.

2:50:24.040 --> 2:50:25.480
 It really gives you perspective.

2:50:25.680 --> 2:50:29.960
 There are so many overlapping stories and in of religious texts.

2:50:29.960 --> 2:50:34.760
 And then the way that they're written gives you a unique perspective on different

2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:37.520
 people throughout the world.

2:50:37.720 --> 2:50:42.480
 And, you know, if you're a Roman Catholic, maybe don't read the Bible.

2:50:42.480 --> 2:50:45.280
 Read one of the other texts and that would be an interesting take.

2:50:45.480 --> 2:50:48.440
 But I'm embarrassed to say that first of all, I've never read the Bible,

2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:50.320
 which is embarrassing to say.

2:50:50.520 --> 2:50:53.160
 It's like I read a bunch of stuff about the Bible and not the Bible itself.

2:50:53.360 --> 2:50:58.320
 And the same, not equating them, but I haven't read Marx directly.

2:50:58.320 --> 2:51:00.800
 I haven't read Mein Kampf by Hitler directly.

2:51:01.000 --> 2:51:05.280
 And it feels like sometimes because you think like it's better to read stuff about

2:51:05.480 --> 2:51:11.240
 the books, but ultimately you want because like the analysis will be better in texts

2:51:11.440 --> 2:51:20.280
 that followed it, but there's value to actually reading like the actual words.

2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:25.560
 Yeah, there's this power in the words that there's a reason why like the Bible

2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:32.080
 is one of the most impactful books ever, you know, and it's in it's in those words

2:51:32.280 --> 2:51:34.600
 and it's a value to return to those words.

2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:41.520
 The Communist Manifesto is truly frightening if you read it in in like modern context.

2:51:41.720 --> 2:51:42.680
 It's worth reading.

2:51:42.880 --> 2:51:43.880
 Yeah, worth reading.

2:51:44.080 --> 2:51:50.440
 So is Mein Kampf not obviously, well, it's not obvious, but it is not very well written.

2:51:50.640 --> 2:51:54.600
 But all the ideas that led to the evil that is Hitler are all in there,

2:51:54.600 --> 2:51:59.480
 which is fascinating to think about because probably some of the world leaders

2:51:59.480 --> 2:52:01.040
 at the time should have probably read the books.

2:52:01.240 --> 2:52:04.400
 He outlined everything he's going to do.

2:52:04.600 --> 2:52:06.840
 You've mentioned offline.

2:52:06.840 --> 2:52:08.560
 You mentioned an Emerson quote that I really like.

2:52:08.760 --> 2:52:12.160
 So let's try to end on this powerful quote.

2:52:12.360 --> 2:52:14.840
 It's easy in the world to live after the world's opinion.

2:52:15.040 --> 2:52:17.120
 It's easy in solitude to live after your own.

2:52:17.320 --> 2:52:20.840
 The great man is who in the midst of the world keeps with perfect sweetness,

2:52:21.040 --> 2:52:24.040
 the independence of solitude.

2:52:24.040 --> 2:52:26.160
 What does this quote mean to you?

2:52:26.360 --> 2:52:34.200
 It's kind of reinforces the idea that you're here to live your life and that

2:52:34.400 --> 2:52:37.960
 even when people are trying to

2:52:39.240 --> 2:52:44.760
 influence you or comment on the decisions that you make for your life,

2:52:44.960 --> 2:52:50.160
 you should have the strength to stick by living your life the way you want to live it.

2:52:50.160 --> 2:52:55.000
 That there's one immutable truth for you and it doesn't apply to everyone.

2:52:55.200 --> 2:52:58.320
 And so people who

2:52:59.040 --> 2:53:03.600
 people who frown upon

2:53:03.800 --> 2:53:09.840
 or judge the way that you live, because it's not air quotes, conventional,

2:53:10.040 --> 2:53:14.360
 their opinion should not be something that

2:53:14.560 --> 2:53:16.760
 impacts the choices that you make.

2:53:16.960 --> 2:53:18.320
 You're in a relationship now.

2:53:18.320 --> 2:53:20.280
 Yes, is that deeply meaningful?

2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:22.480
 Or are you ultimately still alone?

2:53:22.680 --> 2:53:27.240
 Is this you're still just a man in the cold of the of the life that is suffering?

2:53:27.440 --> 2:53:31.000
 No, I'm a man who's warm, nustled in a bosom.

2:53:31.200 --> 2:53:36.360
 I don't think there's a better way to end, John.

2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:39.080
 You're a friend, you're my coach.

2:53:39.280 --> 2:53:41.440
 I'm sure we'll talk many more times in the future.

2:53:41.640 --> 2:53:44.280
 Thanks for wasting all your time with me today.

2:53:44.480 --> 2:53:45.160
 Thanks, brother.

2:53:45.360 --> 2:53:46.720
