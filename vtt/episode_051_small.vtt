00:00.000 --> 00:03.400
 The following is a conversation with David Newman.

00:03.400 --> 00:06.120
 She's the Apollo program professor at MIT

00:06.120 --> 00:08.960
 and the former deputy administrator of NASA

00:08.960 --> 00:10.720
 and has been a principal investigator

00:10.720 --> 00:13.160
 on four space flight missions.

00:13.160 --> 00:15.080
 Her research interests are in aerospace,

00:15.080 --> 00:18.240
 biomedical engineering, investigating human performance

00:18.240 --> 00:20.400
 in varying gravity environments.

00:20.400 --> 00:23.360
 She has designed and engineered and built

00:23.360 --> 00:25.680
 some incredible space suit technology,

00:25.680 --> 00:29.600
 namely the biosuit that we talk about in this conversation.

00:29.600 --> 00:32.640
 Due to some scheduling challenges on both our parts,

00:32.640 --> 00:34.920
 we only had about 40 minutes together.

00:34.920 --> 00:37.160
 And in true engineering style, she said,

00:37.160 --> 00:41.320
 I talk fast, you pick the best questions, let's get it done.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.400
 And we did.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.480
 It was a fascinating conversation about space exploration

00:45.480 --> 00:47.360
 and the future of space suits.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.520
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.800
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

00:52.800 --> 00:54.760

00:56.200 --> 00:58.240
 or simply connect with me on Twitter.

00:58.240 --> 01:02.280
 Alex Friedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:02.280 --> 01:05.600
 For the first time, this show is presented by Cash App,

01:05.600 --> 01:08.080
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:08.080 --> 01:11.120
 Cash App is the easiest way to send money to your friends.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.680
 And it is also the easiest way to buy, sell,

01:13.680 --> 01:15.200
 and deposit Bitcoin.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.160
 Most Bitcoin exchanges take days

01:17.160 --> 01:19.560
 for a bank transfer to become investable.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.800
 Through Cash App, it takes seconds.

01:21.800 --> 01:25.400
 Invest as little as $1 and now you own Bitcoin.

01:25.400 --> 01:27.320
 I have several conversations about Bitcoin

01:27.320 --> 01:29.120
 coming up on this podcast.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.680
 Decentralized digital currency

01:30.680 --> 01:33.480
 is a fascinating technology in general to explore,

01:33.480 --> 01:37.720
 both at the technical and the philosophical level.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.600
 Cash App is also the easiest way

01:39.600 --> 01:43.160
 to try and grow your money with their new investing feature.

01:43.160 --> 01:45.120
 Unlike investing tools that force you to buy

01:45.120 --> 01:46.680
 entire shares of stock,

01:46.680 --> 01:48.840
 Cash App, amazingly,

01:48.840 --> 01:52.280
 lets you instantly invest as little or as much as you want.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.360
 Some stocks in the market are hundreds,

01:54.360 --> 01:56.400
 not thousands of dollars per share.

01:56.400 --> 01:58.320
 And now you can still own a piece

01:58.320 --> 02:01.200
 with as little as $1.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.360
 Brokerage services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:04.360 --> 02:08.240
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

02:08.240 --> 02:11.040
 I'm also excited to be working with Cash App

02:11.040 --> 02:14.200
 to support one of my favorite organizations called FIRST,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.320
 which is best known for their FIRST robotics

02:16.320 --> 02:17.920
 and Lego competitions

02:17.920 --> 02:19.840
 that seeks to inspire young students

02:19.840 --> 02:23.640
 in engineering and technology fields all over the world.

02:23.640 --> 02:27.880
 That's over 110 countries, 660,000 students,

02:27.880 --> 02:30.400
 300,000 mentors and volunteers,

02:30.400 --> 02:33.440
 and a perfect rating on Charity Navigator,

02:33.440 --> 02:35.680
 which means the donated money is used

02:35.680 --> 02:38.000
 to maximum effectiveness.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.200
 to learn, to explore,

02:55.200 --> 02:58.040
 and to dream of engineering a better world.

02:58.040 --> 03:02.080

03:07.040 --> 03:10.880
 And now here's my conversation with Deva Newman.

03:11.880 --> 03:16.080
 You circumnavigated the globe on boat.

03:16.080 --> 03:17.760
 So let's look back in history.

03:17.760 --> 03:21.280
 500 years ago, Ferdinand Magellan's crew

03:21.280 --> 03:23.480
 was first to circumnavigate the globe,

03:24.520 --> 03:26.640
 but he died.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.680
 I think people don't know, like halfway through,

03:28.680 --> 03:32.920
 and so did 242 of the 260 sailors

03:32.920 --> 03:35.320
 that took that three year journey.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.680
 What do you think it was like for that crew

03:37.680 --> 03:39.760
 at that time heading out into the unknown

03:39.760 --> 03:43.200
 to face probably likely death?

03:43.200 --> 03:47.000
 Do you think they were filled with fear, with excitement?

03:47.000 --> 03:48.120
 Probably not fear.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.080
 I think in all of exploration,

03:50.080 --> 03:53.600
 the challenge and the unknown, so probably wonderment.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.200
 And then just when you really are sailing the world's oceans,

03:59.200 --> 04:01.600
 you have extreme weather of all kinds.

04:01.600 --> 04:04.120
 When we were circumnavigating, it was challenging,

04:04.120 --> 04:07.360
 new dynamic, you really appreciate Mother Earth,

04:07.360 --> 04:08.720
 you appreciate the winds and the waves.

04:08.720 --> 04:11.000
 So back to Magellan and his crew,

04:11.000 --> 04:15.280
 since they really didn't have a three dimensional map

04:15.280 --> 04:18.760
 of the globe, of the Earth when they went out,

04:18.760 --> 04:20.360
 just probably looking over the horizon thinking,

04:20.360 --> 04:21.400
 what's there, what's there?

04:21.400 --> 04:24.760
 So I would say the challenge had to be really important

04:24.760 --> 04:26.800
 in terms of the team dynamics on that leadership,

04:26.800 --> 04:28.920
 had to be incredibly important.

04:28.920 --> 04:32.520
 Team dynamics, how do you keep people focused on the mission?

04:32.520 --> 04:34.080
 So you think the psychology, that's interesting,

04:34.080 --> 04:35.240
 that's probably echoes of that

04:35.240 --> 04:37.680
 in the space exploration stuff we'll talk about.

04:37.680 --> 04:40.120
 So the psychology of the dynamics

04:40.120 --> 04:43.400
 between the human beings on the mission is important?

04:43.400 --> 04:44.240
 Absolutely.

04:44.240 --> 04:47.640
 For Amaris mission, there's lots of challenges, technology,

04:47.640 --> 04:50.440
 but since I specialize in keeping my astronauts alive,

04:50.440 --> 04:52.600
 the psychosocial issues,

04:52.600 --> 04:55.800
 the psychology of a psychosocial team dynamics leadership,

04:55.800 --> 04:57.120
 that's world people.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.320
 So that's gonna be, that's always a huge impact.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.520
 One of the top three, I think of any isolated,

05:03.520 --> 05:05.240
 confined environment and any mission

05:05.240 --> 05:07.920
 that is really pretty extreme.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.160
 So your Twitter handle is DavidExplorer.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.280
 So when did you first fall in love

05:13.280 --> 05:14.800
 with the idea of exploration?

05:14.800 --> 05:16.480
 Ah, that's a great question.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.520
 Maybe as long as I can remember,

05:18.520 --> 05:21.040
 as I grew up in Montana in the Rocky Mountains

05:21.040 --> 05:22.080
 in Helena in the capital.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.680
 And so literally in Mount Helena,

05:23.680 --> 05:26.480
 it was my backyard was right up there.

05:26.480 --> 05:30.080
 So exploring, being in the mountains, looking at caves,

05:30.080 --> 05:32.720
 just running around, but always being in nature.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.480
 So since my earliest memories,

05:36.480 --> 05:40.040
 I think of myself as kind of exploring

05:40.040 --> 05:43.960
 the natural beauty of the Rocky Mountains where I grew up.

05:43.960 --> 05:46.160
 So exploration is not limited to any domain,

05:46.160 --> 05:47.200
 it's just anything.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.120
 So the natural domain of any kind,

05:49.120 --> 05:51.680
 all going out to the woods into the place you haven't been.

05:51.680 --> 05:52.880
 It's all exploration.

05:52.880 --> 05:53.720
 I think so.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.320
 Yeah, I have a pretty all encompassing

05:55.320 --> 05:56.760
 definition of exploration.

05:56.760 --> 05:58.160
 So what about space exploration?

05:58.160 --> 06:00.840
 When were you first captivated by the idea

06:00.840 --> 06:05.120
 that we little humans could venture out into the space,

06:05.120 --> 06:06.680
 into the great unknown of space?

06:06.680 --> 06:08.400
 So it's a great year to talk about that.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.640
 The 50th anniversary of Apollo 11,

06:10.640 --> 06:12.680
 as I was alive during Apollo

06:12.680 --> 06:14.800
 and specifically Apollo 11, I was five years old

06:14.800 --> 06:16.920
 and I distinctly remember that.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.240
 I remember that humanity.

06:19.240 --> 06:21.760
 I'm sure I probably didn't know their names at the time.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.520
 There's Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin

06:23.520 --> 06:25.800
 and never forget Michael Collins in orbit.

06:27.400 --> 06:32.400
 Those three men doing something that just seemed impossible.

06:32.760 --> 06:36.880
 Seemed impossible a decade earlier, even a year earlier,

06:36.880 --> 06:39.520
 but the Apollo program really inspired me.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.600
 And then I think it actually just taught me to dream,

06:42.600 --> 06:46.440
 to any impossible mission could be possible

06:46.440 --> 06:48.000
 with enough focus.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.160
 Yeah, I'm sure you need some luck,

06:49.160 --> 06:50.760
 but you definitely need the leadership,

06:50.760 --> 06:53.160
 you need the focus of the mission.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.280
 So since an early age, I thought,

06:55.280 --> 06:57.160
 of course people should be interplanetary.

06:57.160 --> 06:58.520
 Of course people, we need people on earth

06:58.520 --> 07:00.960
 and we're gonna have people exploring space as well.

07:00.960 --> 07:04.120
 So that seemed obvious, even at that age, of course.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.240
 It opened it up.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.080
 Before we saw a man on the moon,

07:07.080 --> 07:08.120
 it wasn't obvious to me at all,

07:08.120 --> 07:11.600
 but once we understood that, yes, absolutely,

07:11.600 --> 07:12.680
 astronauts, that's what they do.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.040
 They explore, they go into space

07:14.040 --> 07:16.480
 and they land on other planets or moons.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.640
 So again, maybe a romanticized philosophical question,

07:20.640 --> 07:22.640
 but when you look up at the stars,

07:23.840 --> 07:28.840
 knowing that there's at least 100 billion of them

07:28.840 --> 07:30.400
 in the Milky Way galaxy, right?

07:30.400 --> 07:34.720
 So we're really a small speck in this giant thing

07:34.720 --> 07:36.560
 that's the visible universe.

07:36.560 --> 07:40.240
 How does that make you feel about our efforts here?

07:40.240 --> 07:41.440
 I love the perspective.

07:41.440 --> 07:42.760
 I love that perspective.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.640
 I always open my public talks

07:44.640 --> 07:46.280
 with the big Hubble Space Telescope.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.960
 I mentioned looking out until you'd mentioned

07:47.960 --> 07:49.800
 just now the solar system in the Milky Way,

07:49.800 --> 07:51.680
 because I really think it's really important

07:51.680 --> 07:53.840
 to know that we're just a small pale blue dot.

07:53.840 --> 07:54.760
 We're really fortunate.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.640
 We're on the best planet by far.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.400
 Life is fantastic here.

07:58.400 --> 07:59.240
 That we know of.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.040
 You're confident this is the best planet?

08:01.040 --> 08:02.400
 I'm pretty sure it's the best planet,

08:02.400 --> 08:03.760
 the best planet that we know of.

08:03.760 --> 08:05.600
 I mean, I searched my research, as you know,

08:05.600 --> 08:08.000
 in mission worlds and when will we find life?

08:08.000 --> 08:10.200
 I think actually in probably the next decade,

08:10.200 --> 08:11.760
 we find probably past life,

08:11.760 --> 08:14.560
 probably the evidence of past life on Mars, let's say.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.320
 You think there was once life on Mars,

08:17.320 --> 08:19.640
 or do you think there's currently?

08:19.640 --> 08:23.160
 I'm more comfortable saying probably 3.5 billion years ago.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.880
 I feel pretty confident there was life on Mars

08:24.880 --> 08:27.520
 just because then it had an electromagnetic shield.

08:27.520 --> 08:29.600
 It had an atmosphere,

08:29.600 --> 08:30.800
 has a wonderful gravity level,

08:30.800 --> 08:32.520
 three HGs, fantastic.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.360
 You know, you're all super human.

08:34.360 --> 08:35.720
 We can all slam dunk a basketball.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.200
 I mean, it's gonna be fun to play sports on Mars.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.800
 But so I think we'll find past, no, fossilized,

08:40.800 --> 08:43.400
 probably the evidence of past life on Mars.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.480
 Currently, that's again, we need the next decade,

08:45.480 --> 08:47.600
 but the evidence is mounting for sure.

08:47.600 --> 08:48.960
 We do have the organics.

08:48.960 --> 08:49.880
 We're finding organics.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.400
 We have water, seasonal water on Mars.

08:52.400 --> 08:54.680
 We used to just know about the ice caps,

08:54.680 --> 08:55.600
 you know, north and south pole.

08:55.600 --> 08:57.200
 Now we have seasonal water.

08:57.200 --> 09:00.320
 We do have the building blocks for life on Mars.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.560
 We really need to dig down into the soil

09:02.560 --> 09:04.520
 because everything on the top surface is radiated.

09:04.520 --> 09:08.040
 But once we find down, will we see any life forms?

09:08.040 --> 09:08.880
 Will we see any bugs?

09:08.880 --> 09:11.200
 I leave it open as a possibility,

09:11.200 --> 09:13.400
 but I feel pretty certain that past life

09:13.400 --> 09:16.000
 or fossilized life forms we'll find.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.360
 And then we have to get to all these ocean worlds,

09:18.360 --> 09:21.400
 these beautiful moons of other planets

09:21.400 --> 09:22.640
 since we know they have water

09:22.640 --> 09:26.520
 and we're looking for some simple search for life

09:26.520 --> 09:28.680
 for follow the water, you know, carbon based life.

09:28.680 --> 09:30.000
 That's the only life we know.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.720
 There could be other life forms that we don't know about,

09:31.720 --> 09:33.120
 but it was hard to search for them

09:33.120 --> 09:33.960
 because we don't know.

09:33.960 --> 09:36.200
 So in our search for life in the solar system,

09:36.200 --> 09:38.080
 it's definitely, you know, search, you know,

09:38.080 --> 09:41.240
 let's follow the water and look for the building blocks of life.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.480
 So you think in the next decade,

09:42.480 --> 09:45.400
 we might see hints of past life or even current life?

09:45.400 --> 09:46.240
 I think so.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.080
 That's a pretty optimistic.

09:47.080 --> 09:47.920
 I love the optimism.

09:47.920 --> 09:48.760
 I'm pretty optimistic.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.080
 Do humans have to be involved

09:50.080 --> 09:52.680
 or can this be robots and rovers and?

09:52.680 --> 09:53.520
 Probably teams.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.880
 I mean, we've been at it on Mars in particular, 50 years.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.760
 We've been exploring Mars for 50 years.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.720
 Great data, right?

09:58.720 --> 10:01.000
 Our images of Mars today are phenomenal.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.280
 Now we know how Mars lost its atmosphere.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.320
 You know, we're starting to know

10:04.320 --> 10:07.120
 because of the lack of the electromagnetic shield.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.120
 We know about the water and Mars.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.680
 So we've been studying 50 years with our robots.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.640
 We still haven't found it.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.880
 So I think once we have a human mission there,

10:13.880 --> 10:15.000
 we just accelerate things.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.520
 But it's always humans and our rovers and robots together.

10:18.520 --> 10:19.920
 But we just have to think that 50 years,

10:19.920 --> 10:23.000
 we've been looking at Mars and taking images

10:23.000 --> 10:25.080
 and doing the best science that we can.

10:25.080 --> 10:27.480
 People need to realize Mars is really far away.

10:27.480 --> 10:28.720
 It's really hard to get to.

10:28.720 --> 10:31.120
 You know, this is extreme, extreme exploration.

10:31.120 --> 10:32.440
 We mentioned Magellan first

10:32.440 --> 10:35.480
 where all of the wonderful explorers and sailors of the past,

10:35.480 --> 10:39.160
 which kind of are lots of my inspiration for exploration.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.600
 Mars is a different ball game.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.680
 I mean, it's eight months to get there,

10:42.680 --> 10:44.240
 year and a half to get home.

10:44.240 --> 10:45.680
 I mean, it's really extreme.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.800
 Harsh environment in all kinds of ways.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.920
 But the kind of organism we might be able to see

10:50.920 --> 10:54.880
 hints of on Mars are kind of microorganisms, perhaps.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.080
 Yeah, I remember that humans, we're kind of,

10:57.080 --> 10:57.920
 you know, we're hosts, right?

10:57.920 --> 11:00.880
 We're hosts to all of our bacteria and viruses, right?

11:00.880 --> 11:03.960
 Do you think it's a big leap from the viruses

11:03.960 --> 11:07.080
 and the bacteria to us humans?

11:07.080 --> 11:10.480
 Put another way, do you think on all those moons,

11:10.480 --> 11:13.280
 beautiful, wet moons that you mentioned,

11:13.280 --> 11:15.880
 you think there's intelligent life out there?

11:15.880 --> 11:17.680
 I hope so. I mean, that's the hope.

11:17.680 --> 11:20.080
 But, you know, we don't have the scientific evidence

11:20.080 --> 11:21.040
 for that now.

11:21.040 --> 11:24.480
 I think all the evidence we have in terms of life existing

11:24.480 --> 11:26.000
 is much more compelling, again,

11:26.000 --> 11:27.520
 because we have the building blocks of life.

11:27.520 --> 11:31.240
 And now when that life turns into intelligence,

11:31.240 --> 11:32.960
 that's a big unknown.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.880
 If we ever meet, do you think we would be able

11:34.880 --> 11:37.200
 to find a common language?

11:37.200 --> 11:39.120
 I hope so. We haven't met yet.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.040
 It's just so far.

11:40.040 --> 11:42.040
 I mean, do physics display a role here?

11:42.040 --> 11:44.480
 Look at all these exoplanets, 6,000 exoplanets.

11:44.480 --> 11:46.880
 I mean, even the couple dozen Earthlike planets

11:46.880 --> 11:50.520
 that are exoplanets that really look like habitable planets.

11:50.520 --> 11:51.480
 These are very Earthlike.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.960
 They look like they have all the building blocks.

11:53.960 --> 11:54.800
 I can't wait to get there.

11:54.800 --> 11:57.840
 The only thing is they're 10 to 100 light years away.

11:57.840 --> 12:00.240
 So scientifically, we know they're there.

12:00.240 --> 12:01.560
 We know that they're habitable.

12:01.560 --> 12:04.000
 They have, you know, everything going from, right?

12:04.000 --> 12:05.880
 Like, you know, we call them the Goldilocks Zone,

12:05.880 --> 12:07.960
 not too hot, not too cold, just perfect

12:07.960 --> 12:10.640
 for habitability for life.

12:10.640 --> 12:13.320
 But now the reality is if they're 10 at the best,

12:13.320 --> 12:15.720
 100 to thousands of light years away.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.640
 So what's out there?

12:18.640 --> 12:21.000
 But I just can't think that we're not the only ones.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.280
 So absolutely life, life in the universe,

12:23.280 --> 12:24.920
 probably intelligent life as well.

12:25.840 --> 12:28.000
 Do you think there needs to be fundamental revolutions

12:28.000 --> 12:32.000
 in how we, the tools we use to travel through space

12:32.000 --> 12:35.040
 in order for us to venture outside of our solar system?

12:35.040 --> 12:38.800
 Or do you think the ways, the rockets,

12:38.800 --> 12:41.680
 the ideas we have now, the engineering ideas we have now

12:41.680 --> 12:43.120
 will be enough to venture out?

12:43.120 --> 12:43.960
 Well, that's a good question.

12:43.960 --> 12:46.040
 Right now, you know, because getting speed of light

12:46.040 --> 12:47.120
 is a limit.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.960
 We don't have a warp speed warp drive

12:48.960 --> 12:51.880
 to explore our solar system, to get to Mars,

12:51.880 --> 12:53.600
 to explore all the planets.

12:53.600 --> 12:55.760
 Then we need a technology push,

12:55.760 --> 12:57.720
 but technology push here is just advanced propulsion.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.200
 It'd be great if I could get humans to Mars

13:00.200 --> 13:02.480
 and say, you know, three to four months, not eight months.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.600
 I mean, have the time, 50% reduction.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.560
 That's great in terms of safety and wellness

13:06.560 --> 13:08.880
 of the crew and orbital mechanics.

13:08.880 --> 13:10.480
 But physics rules, you know, orbital mechanics

13:10.480 --> 13:12.280
 is still there, physics rules.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.280
 We can't defy physics.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.120
 I love that.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.240
 So invent a new physics.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.280
 I mean, look at quantum, you know, look at quantum theory.

13:18.280 --> 13:19.120
 So, you never know.

13:19.120 --> 13:19.960
 Exactly.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.320
 I mean, we are always learning.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.960
 So we definitely don't know all the physics that exist too,

13:23.960 --> 13:27.040
 but we're, we still have to, it's not science fiction.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.240
 You know, we still have to pay attention to physics

13:29.240 --> 13:32.440
 in terms of our speed of travel for our space flight.

13:32.440 --> 13:34.960
 So you were the deputy administrator of NASA

13:34.960 --> 13:37.280
 and during the Obama administration,

13:37.280 --> 13:39.600
 there's a current Artemis program

13:39.600 --> 13:41.360
 that's working on a crewed mission to the moon

13:41.360 --> 13:43.480
 and then perhaps to Mars.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.560
 What are you excited about there?

13:46.560 --> 13:48.160
 What are your thoughts on this program?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.520
 What are the biggest challenges do you think of

13:50.520 --> 13:53.680
 getting to the moon of landing to the moon once again

13:53.680 --> 13:57.440
 and then the big step to Mars?

13:57.440 --> 14:00.240
 Well, I love, you know, the moon program now, Artemis.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.560
 We, it is definitely, we've been in low Earth orbit.

14:02.560 --> 14:03.640
 I love low Earth orbit too,

14:03.640 --> 14:05.920
 but I just always look at it as three phases.

14:05.920 --> 14:08.000
 So low Earth orbit where we've been 40 years.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.120
 So definitely time to get back to deep space,

14:10.120 --> 14:11.040
 time to get to the moon.

14:11.040 --> 14:13.720
 There's so much to do on the moon.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.120
 I hope we don't get stuck on the moon for 50 years.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.240
 I really want to get to the moon,

14:17.240 --> 14:19.880
 spend the next decade first with the lander,

14:19.880 --> 14:21.960
 then humans, there's just a lot to explore.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.440
 But to me, it's a big technology push.

14:24.440 --> 14:25.360
 It's only three days away.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.680
 So the moon is definitely the right place.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.600
 So we kind of buy down our technology.

14:29.600 --> 14:33.840
 We invest in specifically habitats, life support systems.

14:33.840 --> 14:34.720
 So we need suits.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.800
 We really need to understand really how to live off planet.

14:37.800 --> 14:39.480
 We've been off planet and low Earth orbit,

14:39.480 --> 14:41.960
 but still that's only, you know, 400 kilometers up,

14:41.960 --> 14:42.800
 250 miles, right?

14:42.800 --> 14:43.840
 So we get to the moon.

14:43.840 --> 14:47.320
 It really is a great proving ground for the technologies.

14:47.320 --> 14:48.440
 And now we're in deep space.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.000
 Radiation becomes a huge issue again

14:51.000 --> 14:52.360
 to keep our astronauts well alive.

14:52.360 --> 14:55.840
 And I look at all of that investment for moon,

14:55.840 --> 14:59.160
 moon exploration to the ultimate goal,

14:59.160 --> 15:00.640
 you know, the horizon goals we call it

15:00.640 --> 15:01.840
 to get people to Mars.

15:01.840 --> 15:03.680
 But we just don't go to Mars tomorrow, right?

15:03.680 --> 15:05.720
 We really need a decade on the moon, I think,

15:05.720 --> 15:07.640
 investing in the technologies, learning,

15:07.640 --> 15:09.760
 making sure the astronauts are their health,

15:09.760 --> 15:11.560
 you know, they're safe and well.

15:11.560 --> 15:15.240
 And also learning so much about in situ research,

15:15.240 --> 15:16.920
 utilization ISRU, you know,

15:16.920 --> 15:19.080
 in situ resource utilization is huge

15:19.080 --> 15:21.160
 when it comes to exploration for the moon and Mars.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.160
 So we need a test bed.

15:23.160 --> 15:26.880
 And to me, it really is a lunar test bed.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.320
 And then we use those same investments

15:29.320 --> 15:32.520
 to think about getting people to Mars in the 2030s.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.040
 So developing sort of a platform

15:34.040 --> 15:36.200
 of all the kind of research tools of all the,

15:36.200 --> 15:39.040
 what's the resource, can you speak to that?

15:39.040 --> 15:42.000
 Yeah, so ISRU for the moon, it's,

15:42.000 --> 15:45.200
 we'll go to the South Pole and it's fascinating.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.720
 We have images of it.

15:46.720 --> 15:49.040
 Of course, we know there's permanently shaded areas

15:49.040 --> 15:50.880
 and like by Shackleton crater,

15:50.880 --> 15:53.320
 and there's areas that are permanently in the sun.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.200
 Well, it seems that there's a lot of water ice,

15:56.200 --> 16:00.000
 you know, water that's trapped in ice and the lunar craters.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.640
 That's the first place you go, why?

16:01.640 --> 16:03.840
 Because it's water and when you want to try to,

16:03.840 --> 16:06.160
 it could be fuel, you know, life support systems.

16:06.160 --> 16:08.800
 So you kind of, you get in, you go where the water is.

16:08.800 --> 16:12.680
 And so when the moon is kind of for resources utilization,

16:12.680 --> 16:15.080
 but to learn how to, can we make the fuels

16:15.080 --> 16:16.920
 out of the resources that are on the moon?

16:16.920 --> 16:18.240
 We have to think about 3D printing, right?

16:18.240 --> 16:20.120
 You don't get to bring all this mass with you.

16:20.120 --> 16:22.800
 You have to learn how to literally live off the land.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.240
 We need a pressure shell,

16:24.240 --> 16:28.320
 we need to have an atmosphere for people to live in.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.040
 So all of that is kind of buying down the technology,

16:31.040 --> 16:32.960
 doing the investigation, doing the science,

16:32.960 --> 16:35.360
 what are the basically the lunar volatiles?

16:35.360 --> 16:38.120
 You know, what is that ice on the moon?

16:38.120 --> 16:39.880
 How much of it is there?

16:39.880 --> 16:42.120
 How, what are the resources look like?

16:42.120 --> 16:44.320
 To me, that helps us, that's just the next step

16:44.320 --> 16:46.480
 in getting humans to Mars.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.800
 You know, it's cheaper and more effective

16:47.800 --> 16:50.160
 to sort of develop some of these difficult challenges,

16:50.160 --> 16:51.640
 like solve some of these challenges,

16:51.640 --> 16:53.960
 practice, develop, test, and so on on the moon.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.000
 Absolutely. There's on Mars.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.400
 Absolutely. And people are going to love to,

16:56.400 --> 16:57.480
 you know, you get to the moon, you get to,

16:57.480 --> 16:58.880
 you have a beautiful earth rise.

16:58.880 --> 17:01.160
 I mean, you have the most magnificent view of earth

17:01.160 --> 17:02.520
 being off planet.

17:02.520 --> 17:03.520
 So it just makes sense.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.320
 I think we're going to have thousands, lots of people,

17:05.320 --> 17:06.840
 hopefully tens of thousands in low earth orbit,

17:06.840 --> 17:08.960
 because low earth orbit is a beautiful place to go

17:08.960 --> 17:09.800
 and look down on the earth,

17:09.800 --> 17:11.080
 but people want to return home.

17:11.080 --> 17:14.000
 I think the lunar explorers will also want to do

17:14.000 --> 17:16.760
 round trips and, you know, be on the moon,

17:16.760 --> 17:18.840
 three day trip, explore, do science,

17:18.840 --> 17:21.000
 also because the lunar day is, you know,

17:21.000 --> 17:23.560
 14 days and lunar nights, also 14 days.

17:23.560 --> 17:27.200
 So in that 28 day cycle, you know, half of it is in light,

17:27.200 --> 17:29.240
 half of it's in dark.

17:29.240 --> 17:31.800
 So people would probably want to do, you know,

17:31.800 --> 17:33.720
 couple of week trips, month long trips,

17:33.720 --> 17:34.720
 not longer than that.

17:34.720 --> 17:36.080
 What do you mean by people?

17:36.080 --> 17:37.400
 What do you mean? People, explorers.

17:37.400 --> 17:40.960
 I mean, yeah, astronauts are going to be civilians

17:40.960 --> 17:41.800
 in the future too.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.880
 Not all astronauts are going to be government,

17:43.880 --> 17:45.200
 astronauts actually when I was at NASA,

17:45.200 --> 17:46.760
 we changed, we actually got the law changed

17:46.760 --> 17:50.360
 to recognize astronauts that are not only government employees,

17:50.360 --> 17:52.400
 you know, NASA astronauts or European space agency,

17:52.400 --> 17:54.960
 astronauts or Russian space agency that astronauts,

17:54.960 --> 17:58.320
 because of the big push we put in the private sector,

17:58.320 --> 17:59.920
 that astronauts essentially, you're going to be astronauts

17:59.920 --> 18:02.800
 to get over a hundred kilometers up

18:02.800 --> 18:06.520
 and think once you've done orbital flight,

18:06.520 --> 18:07.600
 then you're an astronaut.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.400
 So a lot of private citizens are going to become astronauts.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.360
 Do you think one day you might step foot on the moon?

18:13.360 --> 18:14.520
 I think it'd be good to go to the moon.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.200
 I'd give that a shot.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.080
 Mars, I'm going to, that's my life's work

18:18.080 --> 18:20.280
 to get the next generation to Mars.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.160
 That's you or even younger than you, you know,

18:23.160 --> 18:26.640
 my students generation will be the Martian explorers.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.880
 I'm just working to facilitate that,

18:28.880 --> 18:30.200
 but that's not going to be me.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.160
 Hey, the moon's pretty good.

18:31.160 --> 18:32.840
 And it's a lot tough.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.800
 I mean, it's still a really tough mission.

18:35.800 --> 18:36.920
 It's an extreme mission.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.920
 Exactly, it's great for exploration, but doable.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.160
 But again, before Apollo,

18:41.160 --> 18:44.000
 we didn't think getting humans to the moon was even possible.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.480
 So we kind of made that possible, but we need to go back.

18:46.480 --> 18:47.960
 We absolutely need to go back.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.400
 We're investing in the heavy lift launch capabilities

18:50.400 --> 18:51.240
 that we need to get there.

18:51.240 --> 18:52.920
 We haven't had that since the Apollo days,

18:52.920 --> 18:53.960
 since Saturn 5.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.480
 So now we have three options on the board.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.480
 That's what's so fantastic.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.760
 NASA has its space launch system.

18:59.760 --> 19:02.720
 SpaceX is going to have its heavy capability.

19:02.720 --> 19:05.320
 And Blue Origin is coming along too with heavy lifts.

19:05.320 --> 19:07.840
 So that's pretty fantastic from where I sit.

19:07.840 --> 19:09.880
 I'm the Apollo program professor.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.040
 Today I have zero heavy lift launch capability.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.640
 I can't wait just in a few years,

19:13.640 --> 19:16.000
 we'll have three different heavy lift launch capabilities.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.080
 So that's pretty exciting.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.560
 You know, your heart is perhaps with NASA.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.480
 But you mentioned SpaceX and Blue Origin.

19:23.480 --> 19:26.880
 What are your thoughts of SpaceX

19:26.880 --> 19:28.680
 and the innovative efforts there

19:28.680 --> 19:31.320
 from the sort of private company aspect?

19:31.320 --> 19:32.160
 Oh, they're great.

19:32.160 --> 19:35.320
 They remind, remember that the investments in SpaceX

19:35.320 --> 19:36.400
 is government funding.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.200
 It's NASA funding, it's US Air Force funding.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.440
 Just as it should be,

19:40.440 --> 19:44.120
 because you're betting on a company who is moving fast,

19:44.120 --> 19:46.320
 has some new technology development.

19:46.320 --> 19:47.160
 So I love it.

19:47.160 --> 19:48.000
 So when I was at NASA,

19:48.000 --> 19:50.280
 it really was under our public private partnerships.

19:50.280 --> 19:54.480
 So necessarily the government needs to fund these startups.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.200
 Now SpaceX is no longer a startup,

19:56.200 --> 19:58.200
 but it's been at it for 10 years.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.600
 It's had some accidents, learned a lot of lessons,

20:00.600 --> 20:03.760
 but it's great because it's the way you move faster.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.200
 And also some private industry folks,

20:06.200 --> 20:08.720
 some private businesses will take a lot more risk.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.360
 That's also really important for the government.

20:11.360 --> 20:12.960
 What do you think about that culture of risk?

20:12.960 --> 20:15.320
 I mean, sort of NASA and the government

20:15.320 --> 20:18.160
 are exceptionally good at delivering sort of safe.

20:18.160 --> 20:20.960
 Like there's a little bit more of a culture of caution

20:20.960 --> 20:23.400
 and safety and sort of this kind of solid engineering.

20:23.400 --> 20:26.080
 And I think SpaceX as well has the same kind of stuff.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.120
 It has a little bit more of that startup feel

20:28.120 --> 20:29.840
 where they take the bigger risks.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.680
 Is that exciting for you to see,

20:31.680 --> 20:33.800
 seeing bigger risks in this kind of space?

20:33.800 --> 20:34.960
 Absolutely.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.520
 And the best scenario is both of working together.

20:38.520 --> 20:40.120
 Because there's really important lessons learned,

20:40.120 --> 20:41.880
 especially when you talk about human space flight,

20:41.880 --> 20:43.760
 safety, quality assurance,

20:43.760 --> 20:46.000
 these things are the utmost importance,

20:46.000 --> 20:49.240
 both aviation and space, when human lives are at stake.

20:49.240 --> 20:51.800
 On the other hand, government agencies,

20:51.800 --> 20:53.840
 NASA can be European space agency, you name it.

20:53.840 --> 20:56.800
 They become very bureaucratic, pretty risk averse,

20:56.800 --> 20:58.120
 move pretty slowly.

20:58.120 --> 21:01.400
 So I think the best is when you combine the partnerships

21:01.400 --> 21:04.880
 from both sides, industry necessarily has to push

21:04.880 --> 21:06.240
 the government, take some more risks.

21:06.240 --> 21:08.840
 Like they're smart risk or actually gave an award at NASA

21:08.840 --> 21:10.040
 for failing smart.

21:11.040 --> 21:11.880
 Failing smart.

21:11.880 --> 21:12.720
 I love that.

21:12.720 --> 21:14.160
 So you can kind of break open the culture, say,

21:14.160 --> 21:16.400
 no, look, Apollo, that was a huge risk.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.680
 It was done well.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.760
 So there's always a culture of safety, quality assurance,

21:20.760 --> 21:23.360
 engineering, at its best.

21:23.360 --> 21:26.120
 But on the other hand, you want to get things done.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.600
 And you have to also get them,

21:27.600 --> 21:30.000
 you have to bring the cost down for when it comes to launch,

21:30.000 --> 21:31.080
 we really have to bring the cost down

21:31.080 --> 21:32.360
 and get the frequency up.

21:32.360 --> 21:34.160
 And so that's what the newcomers are doing.

21:34.160 --> 21:35.560
 They're really pushing that.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.880
 So it's about the most exciting time

21:37.880 --> 21:39.760
 that I can imagine for spaceflight.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.840
 Again, a little bit, it really is the democratization

21:41.840 --> 21:43.360
 of spaceflight, opening it up,

21:43.360 --> 21:45.240
 not just because the launch capability,

21:45.240 --> 21:47.600
 but the science we can do on a CubeSat.

21:47.600 --> 21:49.600
 What you can do now for very,

21:49.600 --> 21:51.960
 those used to be student projects

21:51.960 --> 21:54.120
 that we would go through, conceive, design, implement,

21:54.120 --> 21:56.400
 and think about what a small satellite would be.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.840
 Now they're the most, these are really advanced instruments,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.560
 science instruments that are flying on little teeny CubeSats

22:02.560 --> 22:04.640
 that pretty much anyone can afford.

22:04.640 --> 22:07.280
 So there's not a, there's every nation,

22:07.280 --> 22:10.360
 every place in the world can fly a CubeSat.

22:10.360 --> 22:11.200
 And so that's...

22:11.200 --> 22:12.040
 What's a CubeSat?

22:12.040 --> 22:15.160
 Oh, CubeSat is a, this is called 1U.

22:15.160 --> 22:17.040
 CubeSats we measure in terms of units.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.040
 So, just in terms of, I put both my hands together,

22:20.040 --> 22:21.600
 that's one unit, two unit streets.

22:21.600 --> 22:22.760
 So little small satellites.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.520
 So CubeSats are for small satellites.

22:25.520 --> 22:27.160
 And we actually go by mass as well.

22:27.160 --> 22:30.280
 Small satellite might be 100 kilos, 200 kilos,

22:30.280 --> 22:32.440
 all well under 1,000 kilos.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.080
 CubeSats then are the next thing down from small satellites.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.360
 You know, basically, you know,

22:37.360 --> 22:39.520
 kilos, tens of kilos, things like that.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.240
 But kind of the building blocks,

22:41.240 --> 22:42.600
 CubeSats are fantastic design,

22:42.600 --> 22:44.120
 it's kind of modular design.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.920
 So I can take a 1U, one unit of CubeSat.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.840
 And, you know, but what if I have a little bit more money

22:49.840 --> 22:51.560
 and payload, I can fly three of them

22:51.560 --> 22:54.120
 and just basically put a lot more instruments on it.

22:54.120 --> 22:55.920
 But essentially think about something the size

22:55.920 --> 22:57.760
 of a shoebox, if you will.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.600
 You know, that would be a CubeSat.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.960
 And those, how do those help empower you

23:01.960 --> 23:04.080
 in terms of doing size, in terms of doing experiments?

23:04.080 --> 23:05.760
 Oh, right now there's, again,

23:05.760 --> 23:06.680
 back to private industry,

23:06.680 --> 23:08.960
 Planet, the company is, you know, flying CubeSats

23:08.960 --> 23:10.960
 and literally looking down on Earth

23:10.960 --> 23:13.680
 and orbiting Earth, taking a picture, if you will,

23:13.680 --> 23:16.640
 of Earth every day, every 24 hours covering the entire Earth.

23:16.640 --> 23:19.240
 So in terms of Earth observations,

23:19.240 --> 23:20.360
 in terms of climate change,

23:20.360 --> 23:22.240
 in terms of our changing Earth,

23:22.240 --> 23:25.000
 it's revolutionizing because they're affordable.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.400
 We can put a whole bunch of them up.

23:26.400 --> 23:28.680
 The telecoms, we're all, you know, on our cell phones

23:28.680 --> 23:30.800
 and we have GPS, we have our telecoms.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.840
 But those used to be very expensive satellites

23:33.840 --> 23:35.000
 providing that service.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.600
 Now we can fly a whole bunch of modular CubeSats.

23:38.600 --> 23:42.480
 So it really is breakthrough in terms of modularity

23:42.480 --> 23:44.320
 as well as cost reduction.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.400
 So that's one exciting set of developments.

23:47.400 --> 23:51.080
 Is there something else that you've been excited about

23:51.080 --> 23:52.640
 and like reusable rockets, perhaps,

23:52.640 --> 23:54.120
 that you've seen in the last few years?

23:54.120 --> 23:55.240
 Yeah, well, the reusability,

23:55.240 --> 23:57.560
 you had other reusability is awesome.

23:57.560 --> 23:59.240
 I mean, it's just the best.

23:59.240 --> 24:00.080
 Now we have to remember,

24:00.080 --> 24:01.640
 the shuttle was a reusable vehicle.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.480
 Yes.

24:02.480 --> 24:05.560
 And the shuttle is an amazing, it's narrow space engineer.

24:05.560 --> 24:06.520
 You know, I mean, the shuttle is still

24:06.520 --> 24:09.240
 this the most gorgeous, elegant,

24:09.240 --> 24:12.440
 extraordinary design of a space vehicle.

24:12.440 --> 24:13.640
 It was reusable.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.360
 It just wasn't affordable.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.120
 But the reusability of it was really critical

24:18.120 --> 24:19.680
 because we flew it up, it did come back.

24:19.680 --> 24:22.120
 So the notion of reusability,

24:22.120 --> 24:25.760
 I think absolutely now what we're doing with,

24:25.760 --> 24:27.880
 we, you know, the global we, but with SpaceX,

24:27.880 --> 24:30.600
 the board said, and the rockets have recovering

24:30.600 --> 24:34.400
 the first stages where if they can regain 70% cost savings,

24:34.400 --> 24:35.360
 that's huge.

24:35.360 --> 24:37.960
 And just seeing the control, you know,

24:37.960 --> 24:39.960
 the control and dynamics personas,

24:39.960 --> 24:41.680
 just seeing that rocket come back and land.

24:41.680 --> 24:42.600
 Oh yeah, that's.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.440
 It never gets old.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.600
 It's exciting every single time you look at it

24:45.600 --> 24:46.720
 and say, that's magic.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.120
 So it's so cool.

24:48.120 --> 24:49.480
 To me, the landing is when I stand up

24:49.480 --> 24:51.320
 and start clapping, just the control.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.800
 Yeah, just the algorithms, just the control algorithms

24:53.800 --> 24:54.800
 and hitting that landing.

24:54.800 --> 24:58.320
 It's, you know, it's gymnastics for rocket ships.

24:58.320 --> 25:01.080
 But to see these guys stick a landing,

25:01.080 --> 25:01.920
 it's just wonderful.

25:01.920 --> 25:06.280
 So every time, like I said, every time I see the reusability

25:06.280 --> 25:08.760
 and the rockets coming back and landing so precisely,

25:08.760 --> 25:09.800
 it's really exciting.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.320
 So it is actually, that's a game changer.

25:12.320 --> 25:15.120
 We are in a new era of lower costs

25:15.120 --> 25:17.520
 and the higher frequency.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.200
 And it's the world, not just NASA.

25:19.200 --> 25:22.440
 It's many nations are really upping their frequency

25:22.440 --> 25:23.880
 of launches.

25:23.880 --> 25:26.120
 You've done a lot of exciting research, design,

25:26.120 --> 25:28.960
 engineering on spacesuits.

25:28.960 --> 25:33.120
 What is the spacesuit of the future look like?

25:33.120 --> 25:34.520
 Well, if I have anything to say about it,

25:34.520 --> 25:37.280
 it'll be a very tight fitting suit.

25:37.280 --> 25:38.880
 We use mechanical counter pressure

25:38.880 --> 25:41.080
 to pressurize right directly on the skin.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.880
 Seems that it's technically feasible.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.400
 We're still at the research and development stage.

25:44.400 --> 25:47.000
 We don't have a flight system, but technically it's feasible.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.720
 So we do a lot of work in the materials.

25:48.720 --> 25:51.400
 You know, what materials do we need to pressurize someone?

25:51.400 --> 25:52.720
 What's the patterning we need?

25:52.720 --> 25:54.760
 That's what our patents are in, the patterning,

25:54.760 --> 25:55.880
 kind of how we apply this.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.480
 It's a third of an atmosphere.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.240
 Just to sort of take a little step back,

25:59.240 --> 26:02.280
 you have this incredible biosuit where it's tight fitting,

26:02.280 --> 26:04.440
 so it allows more mobility and so on.

26:04.440 --> 26:06.280
 So maybe even to take a bigger step back,

26:06.280 --> 26:09.480
 like what are the functions that a spacesuit should perform?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.640
 Sure, so start from the beginning.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.320
 A spacesuit is the world's smallest spacecraft.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.480
 So I really, that's the best definition I can give you.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.240
 Right now we fly gas pressurized suits,

26:18.240 --> 26:22.280
 but think of developing and designing an entire spacecraft.

26:22.280 --> 26:23.800
 So then you take all those systems

26:23.800 --> 26:25.640
 and you shrink them around a person,

26:25.640 --> 26:27.040
 provide them with oxygen debris,

26:27.040 --> 26:29.280
 scrub out their carbon dioxide,

26:29.280 --> 26:30.120
 make sure they have pressure,

26:30.120 --> 26:31.720
 they need a pressure environment to live in.

26:31.720 --> 26:36.080
 So really a spacesuit is a shrunken spacecraft

26:36.080 --> 26:37.880
 in its entirety, has all the same systems.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.160
 Communication as well, probably.

26:39.160 --> 26:41.440
 Yeah, communications, exactly.

26:41.440 --> 26:44.880
 So you really thermal control, a little bit of radiation,

26:44.880 --> 26:45.960
 not so much radiation protection,

26:45.960 --> 26:48.040
 but thermal control, humidity, oxygen debris.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.720
 So all those life support systems,

26:49.720 --> 26:51.640
 as well as the pressure production.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.560
 So it's an engineering marvel,

26:53.560 --> 26:54.560
 the spacesuits that have flown

26:54.560 --> 26:56.440
 because they really are entire spacecraft,

26:56.440 --> 26:59.080
 they're the small spacecraft that we have around a person,

26:59.080 --> 27:00.760
 but they're very massive,

27:00.760 --> 27:03.000
 but 140 kilos is the current suit,

27:03.000 --> 27:04.360
 and they're not mobility suits.

27:04.360 --> 27:06.040
 So since we're going back to the moon and Mars,

27:06.040 --> 27:08.520
 we need a planetary suit, we need a mobility suit.

27:08.520 --> 27:11.680
 So that's where we've kind of flipped the design paradigm.

27:11.680 --> 27:14.640
 I study astronauts, I study humans in motion,

27:14.640 --> 27:16.240
 and if we can map that motion,

27:16.240 --> 27:17.760
 I wanna give you full flexibility,

27:17.760 --> 27:19.160
 move your arms and legs.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.680
 I really want you to be like an Olympic athlete,

27:21.680 --> 27:23.520
 an extreme explorer.

27:23.520 --> 27:25.280
 I don't wanna waste any of your energy,

27:25.280 --> 27:27.160
 so we take it from the human design.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.560
 So I take a look at humans,

27:28.560 --> 27:30.040
 we measure them, we model them,

27:30.040 --> 27:33.040
 and then I say, okay, can I put a space suit on them

27:33.040 --> 27:34.200
 that goes from the skin out?

27:34.200 --> 27:36.440
 So rather than a gas pressurized shrinking

27:36.440 --> 27:38.800
 that spacecraft around the person,

27:38.800 --> 27:40.440
 say, here's how humans perform,

27:40.440 --> 27:43.040
 can I design a space suit literally from the skin out?

27:43.040 --> 27:44.640
 And that's what we've come up with,

27:44.640 --> 27:46.520
 mechanical counter pressure, some patterning,

27:46.520 --> 27:49.280
 and that way it could be order of magnitude less

27:49.280 --> 27:51.000
 in terms of the mass,

27:51.000 --> 27:54.520
 and it should provide maximum mobility for moon or Mars.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.040
 What's mechanical counter pressure?

27:56.040 --> 27:58.880
 Like, how the heck can you even begin

27:58.880 --> 28:02.440
 to create something that's tight fitting

28:02.440 --> 28:05.000
 and still doesn't protect you from the elements and so on

28:05.000 --> 28:06.880
 and the whole, the pressure thing?

28:06.880 --> 28:08.600
 That's a challenge, it's a big design challenge,

28:08.600 --> 28:09.720
 we've been working on it for a while.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.280
 So you can either put someone in a balloon,

28:11.280 --> 28:12.800
 that's one way to do it, that's conventional,

28:12.800 --> 28:13.640
 that's the only thing you ever want.

28:13.640 --> 28:14.480
 What's that mean?

28:14.480 --> 28:15.320
 That means the balloon that you throw a gas.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.160
 That's a gas pressurized suit.

28:16.160 --> 28:17.000
 You can put someone in a balloon.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.640
 It's only a third of an atmosphere to keep someone alive.

28:19.640 --> 28:20.800
 So that's what the current system is.

28:20.800 --> 28:24.000
 So depending on what units you think in 30 kilopascals,

28:24.000 --> 28:25.280
 4.3 pounds per square inch.

28:25.280 --> 28:28.200
 So much less than the pressure that's on earth.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.760
 You can still keep a human alive with 0.3

28:31.760 --> 28:33.560
 and it's alive and happy.

28:33.560 --> 28:35.800
 Alive and happy, and you know, you mix the gases.

28:35.800 --> 28:39.440
 Here, we're having this chat and we're at one sea level

28:39.440 --> 28:41.520
 in Boston at one atmosphere.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.440
 But a suit. Oxygen and nitrogen.

28:43.440 --> 28:45.320
 Oxygen and nitrogen, you put a suit,

28:45.320 --> 28:47.840
 if we put someone to a third of an atmosphere.

28:47.840 --> 28:49.480
 So for mechanical counter pressure now,

28:49.480 --> 28:51.400
 so one way is to do it with a balloon.

28:51.400 --> 28:52.840
 And that's what we currently have.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.080
 Or you can apply the pressure directly to the skin.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.640
 I only have to give you a third of an atmosphere.

28:58.640 --> 29:00.520
 Right now, you and I are very happy in one atmosphere.

29:00.520 --> 29:04.480
 So if I put that pressure a third of an atmosphere on you,

29:04.480 --> 29:06.520
 I just have to do it consistently, you know,

29:06.520 --> 29:08.560
 across all of your body and your limbs.

29:08.560 --> 29:10.760
 And it'll be a gas pressurized helmet.

29:10.760 --> 29:13.160
 Doesn't make sense to shrink, wrap the head,

29:13.160 --> 29:14.000
 see the blue man group.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.800
 That's a great, it's a great act.

29:15.800 --> 29:16.920
 But we don't need to, you know,

29:16.920 --> 29:18.840
 there's no benefits of like shrink wrapping.

29:18.840 --> 29:21.120
 They had you put, you know, a gas pressurized helmet,

29:21.120 --> 29:23.680
 because the helmet then the future of suits you asked me

29:23.680 --> 29:26.680
 about the helmet just becomes your information portal.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.440
 So it will have augmented reality.

29:28.440 --> 29:30.360
 It'll have all the information you need.

29:30.360 --> 29:32.080
 Should have, you know, the maps that I need.

29:32.080 --> 29:33.000
 I'm on the moon.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.760
 Okay, well, hey, smart helmet.

29:34.760 --> 29:36.920
 Then show me the map, show me the topography.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.600
 Hopefully it has the lab embedded too.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.200
 If it has really great cameras,

29:40.200 --> 29:41.600
 maybe I can see with that regolith.

29:41.600 --> 29:43.080
 That's just lunar dust and dirt.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.160
 What's that made of?

29:44.160 --> 29:45.480
 We talked about the water.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.520
 So the helmet then really becomes this information portal

29:48.520 --> 29:50.960
 is how I see kind of the IT architecture,

29:50.960 --> 29:54.680
 the helmet is really allowing me to, you know,

29:54.680 --> 29:58.520
 use all of my modalities of an explorer that I'd like to.

29:58.520 --> 30:01.800
 So cameras, voiceover images, if it were really good,

30:01.800 --> 30:05.240
 it would kind of be, would have lab capabilities as well.

30:05.240 --> 30:07.200
 Okay, so the pressure comes from the body,

30:07.200 --> 30:09.240
 comes from the mechanical pressure.

30:09.240 --> 30:10.480
 Which is fascinating.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.880
 Now what aspect, when I look at biosuit,

30:12.880 --> 30:14.480
 just the suits you're working on,

30:14.480 --> 30:17.640
 sort of from a fashion perspective, they look awesome.

30:17.640 --> 30:20.720
 Is that a small part of it too?

30:20.720 --> 30:21.560
 Oh, absolutely.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.680
 Because the teams that we work with, of course,

30:23.680 --> 30:25.480
 I'm an engineer, there's engineering students,

30:25.480 --> 30:27.280
 there's design students, there's architects.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.800
 So it really is a very much a multidisciplinary team.

30:29.800 --> 30:33.440
 So sure, colors, aesthetics, materials,

30:33.440 --> 30:34.920
 all those things we pay attention to.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.920
 So it's not just an engineering solution.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.080
 It really is a, you know, much more holistic.

30:39.080 --> 30:39.920
 It's a suit.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.440
 It's a suit you're, you know, you're dressed in a suit now.

30:42.440 --> 30:43.720
 It's a form fitting.

30:43.720 --> 30:46.280
 So we really have to pay attention to all those things.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.480
 And so that's the design team that we work with,

30:49.480 --> 30:50.760
 and my partner, Geetraati, you know,

30:50.760 --> 30:52.680
 we're partners in this in terms of,

30:52.680 --> 30:54.440
 if he comes from an architecture,

30:54.440 --> 30:56.080
 industrial design background.

30:56.080 --> 30:58.120
 So bringing those skills to bear as well.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.840
 We team up with industry folks who are in,

31:00.840 --> 31:03.000
 you know, athletic performance and designers.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.280
 So it really is a team that brings all those skills together.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.960
 So what role does the space suit play

31:08.960 --> 31:11.320
 in our long term staying in Mars,

31:11.320 --> 31:13.240
 sort of exploring the,

31:13.240 --> 31:14.640
 doing all the work that astronauts do,

31:14.640 --> 31:17.440
 but also perhaps civilians one day,

31:17.440 --> 31:20.120
 almost like taking steps towards colonization of Mars?

31:20.120 --> 31:21.720
 What role does a space suit play there?

31:21.720 --> 31:24.360
 So you always need a life support system,

31:24.360 --> 31:25.440
 pressurized habitat.

31:25.440 --> 31:28.440
 And I like to say, we're not going to Mars to sit around.

31:28.440 --> 31:29.520
 So you need a suit.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.160
 You're, you know, even if you land and have the lander,

31:32.160 --> 31:33.720
 you're not going there to stay inside.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.560
 That's her darn share.

31:34.560 --> 31:36.200
 We're going there to search for the evidence of life.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.400
 That's why we're going to Mars.

31:37.400 --> 31:39.040
 So you need a lot of mobility.

31:39.040 --> 31:41.400
 So for me, the suit is the best way

31:41.400 --> 31:42.880
 to give the human mobility.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.560
 We're always still going to need rovers.

31:44.560 --> 31:45.680
 We're going to need robots.

31:45.680 --> 31:49.440
 So for me, exploration is always a suite of explorers.

31:49.440 --> 31:50.280
 Some people are going to,

31:50.280 --> 31:51.840
 some of the suite of explorers are humans,

31:51.840 --> 31:55.040
 but many are going to be robots, smart systems,

31:55.040 --> 31:55.880
 things like that.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.480
 But I look at it as kind of all those capabilities together,

31:58.480 --> 32:00.160
 make the best exploration team.

32:01.080 --> 32:03.800
 So let me ask, I love artificial intelligence.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.640
 And you've, I've also saw that you've enjoyed the movie

32:07.640 --> 32:10.120
 Space Odyssey, 2001, Space Odyssey.

32:10.120 --> 32:12.520
 Let me ask the question about how 9,000,

32:12.520 --> 32:14.080
 that makes a few decisions there

32:14.080 --> 32:17.440
 that prioritizes the mission over the astronauts.

32:17.440 --> 32:20.360
 Do you think from a high philosophical question,

32:20.360 --> 32:22.760
 do you think how did the right thing

32:22.760 --> 32:24.720
 of prioritizing the mission?

32:24.720 --> 32:26.840
 I think our artificial intelligence

32:26.840 --> 32:29.560
 will be smarter in the future for a Mars mission.

32:29.560 --> 32:31.640
 It's a great question of his that the reality is

32:31.640 --> 32:34.400
 for a Mars mission, we need fully autonomous systems.

32:34.400 --> 32:35.240
 We will get humans,

32:35.240 --> 32:37.680
 but they have to be fully autonomous.

32:37.680 --> 32:38.720
 And that's a really important,

32:38.720 --> 32:41.000
 that's the most important concept

32:41.000 --> 32:41.840
 because, you know,

32:41.840 --> 32:43.760
 there's not going to be a mission control on Earth,

32:43.760 --> 32:47.640
 you know, you know, 20 minute time lag.

32:47.640 --> 32:48.840
 There's just no way you're going to control

32:48.840 --> 32:49.920
 so fully autonomous.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.640
 So people have to be fully autonomous as well,

32:51.640 --> 32:53.200
 but all of our systems as well.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.360
 And so that's, that's the big design challenge.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.280
 So that's why we test them out on the moon as well.

32:57.280 --> 32:58.920
 When we have a, okay, a few second, you know,

32:58.920 --> 33:00.800
 a three second time lag, you can test them out.

33:00.800 --> 33:05.320
 We have to really get autonomous exploration down.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.320
 You asked me earlier about Magellan and Magellan

33:07.320 --> 33:09.080
 and his crew, they, they left, right?

33:09.080 --> 33:12.160
 They were autonomous, you know, they were autonomous.

33:12.160 --> 33:13.960
 They left and they were on their own

33:13.960 --> 33:15.040
 to figure out that mission.

33:15.040 --> 33:16.840
 Then when they hit land, they have resources,

33:16.840 --> 33:18.960
 that's in situ resource utilization

33:18.960 --> 33:21.000
 and everything else they brought with them.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.240
 So we have to, I think, have that mindset for exploration.

33:23.240 --> 33:24.080
 Again, back to the moon,

33:24.080 --> 33:25.240
 it's more the testing ground,

33:25.240 --> 33:27.160
 the proving ground with technologies.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.560
 But when we get to Mars, it's so far away

33:29.560 --> 33:31.560
 that we need fully autonomous systems.

33:31.560 --> 33:34.480
 So I think that's, that's where, again, AI and autonomy

33:34.480 --> 33:36.640
 come in really robust autonomy,

33:36.640 --> 33:38.440
 things that we don't have today yet.

33:38.440 --> 33:39.840
 So they're on the drawing boards,

33:39.840 --> 33:41.280
 but we really need to test them out

33:41.280 --> 33:43.240
 because that's, that's what we're up against.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.680
 So fully autonomous meaning like self sufficient.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.280
 There's still a role for the human in that picture.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.720
 Do you think there'll be a time when AI systems

33:51.720 --> 33:55.320
 just beyond doing fully autonomous flight control

33:55.320 --> 33:58.800
 will also help or even take mission decisions

33:58.800 --> 33:59.840
 like how did?

33:59.840 --> 34:00.680
 That's interesting.

34:00.680 --> 34:01.520
 It depends.

34:01.520 --> 34:02.680
 I mean, they're gonna be designed by humans.

34:02.680 --> 34:04.560
 I think as you mentioned, humans are always in the loop.

34:04.560 --> 34:05.560
 I mean, we might be on Earth,

34:05.560 --> 34:06.880
 we might be in orbit on Mars,

34:06.880 --> 34:10.040
 maybe the systems that land us down on the surface of Mars.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.360
 But I think we're gonna get,

34:12.360 --> 34:14.840
 we are right now just on Earth based systems,

34:14.840 --> 34:18.520
 AI systems that are incredibly capable

34:18.520 --> 34:22.280
 and training them with all the data that we have.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.720
 Now, I don't petabytes the data from Earth.

34:24.720 --> 34:27.240
 What I care about for the autonomy and AI right now,

34:27.240 --> 34:28.720
 how we're applying it in research

34:28.720 --> 34:31.160
 is to look at Earth and look at climate systems.

34:31.160 --> 34:33.480
 I mean, that's the, it's not for Mars to me today.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.480
 Right now AI is to eyes on Earth,

34:35.480 --> 34:37.160
 all of our space data,

34:37.160 --> 34:39.600
 compiling that using supercomputers

34:39.600 --> 34:41.880
 because we have so much information and knowledge

34:41.880 --> 34:43.360
 and we need to get that into people's hands.

34:43.360 --> 34:45.240
 We need, first there's an educational issue

34:45.240 --> 34:47.480
 with climate and our changing climate.

34:47.480 --> 34:49.840
 Then we need to change human behavior.

34:49.840 --> 34:50.680
 That's the biggie.

34:50.680 --> 34:52.960
 So this next decade, it's urgent.

34:52.960 --> 34:54.400
 We take care of our own spaceship

34:54.400 --> 34:55.600
 which is spaceship Earth.

34:55.600 --> 35:00.360
 So that's to me where my focus has been for AI systems

35:00.360 --> 35:02.160
 using whatever's out there,

35:02.160 --> 35:05.400
 kind of imagining also what the future situation is.

35:05.400 --> 35:07.840
 It's the satellite imagery of Earth of the future.

35:07.840 --> 35:09.520
 If you can hold that in your hands,

35:09.520 --> 35:10.720
 that's gonna be really powerful.

35:10.720 --> 35:14.160
 Will that help people accelerate positive change for Earth

35:14.160 --> 35:15.640
 and for us to live in balance with Earth?

35:15.640 --> 35:17.960
 I hope so and kind of start with the ocean systems.

35:17.960 --> 35:19.800
 So oceans to land to air

35:19.800 --> 35:21.320
 and kind of using all the space data.

35:21.320 --> 35:24.120
 So it's a huge role for artificial intelligence

35:24.120 --> 35:27.200
 to help us analyze, I call it curating the data,

35:27.200 --> 35:28.440
 using the data.

35:28.440 --> 35:31.040
 It has a lot to do with visualizations as well.

35:31.040 --> 35:34.240
 Do you think in a weird, dark question,

35:34.240 --> 35:36.920
 do you think human species can survive

35:36.920 --> 35:39.200
 if we don't become interplanetary

35:39.200 --> 35:43.440
 in the next century or a couple of centuries?

35:44.440 --> 35:45.880
 Absolutely we can survive.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.440
 I don't think Mars is option B actually.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.200
 So I think it's all about saving spaceship Earth

35:51.200 --> 35:52.280
 and humanity.

35:52.280 --> 35:55.240
 I simply put, Earth doesn't need us,

35:55.240 --> 35:57.040
 but we really need Earth.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.040
 All of humanity needs to live in balance with Earth

36:00.040 --> 36:01.520
 because Earth has been here a long time before

36:01.520 --> 36:03.960
 we ever showed up and it'll be here a long time after.

36:03.960 --> 36:06.080
 It's just a matter of how do we wanna live

36:06.080 --> 36:09.280
 with all living beings, much more in balance

36:09.280 --> 36:11.280
 because we need to take care of the Earth

36:11.280 --> 36:12.800
 and right now we're not.

36:12.800 --> 36:15.800
 So that's the urgency and I think it is the next decade

36:15.800 --> 36:18.680
 to try to live much more sustainably,

36:18.680 --> 36:19.960
 live more in balance with Earth.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.280
 I think the human species has a great long optimistic future,

36:23.280 --> 36:25.400
 but we have to act, it's urgent,

36:25.400 --> 36:27.240
 we have to change behavior,

36:27.240 --> 36:30.280
 we have to realize that we're all in this together.

36:30.280 --> 36:31.840
 It's just one blue bubble.

36:31.840 --> 36:33.200
 It's for humanity.

36:33.200 --> 36:35.960
 So when I think people realize that we're all astronauts,

36:35.960 --> 36:37.960
 that's the great news is everyone's been an astronaut.

36:37.960 --> 36:41.200
 We're all astronauts on spaceship Earth,

36:41.200 --> 36:42.520
 and this is our mission.

36:42.520 --> 36:45.120
 This is our mission to take care of the planet.

36:45.120 --> 36:50.120
 And yet as we explore out from our spaceship Earth here

36:50.160 --> 36:52.320
 out into the space,

36:52.320 --> 36:55.240
 what do you think the next 50, 100, 200 years

36:55.240 --> 36:56.920
 look like for space exploration?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.680
 I'm optimistic.

36:58.680 --> 37:01.920
 So I think that we'll have lots of people,

37:01.920 --> 37:03.480
 thousands of people, tens of thousands of people,

37:03.480 --> 37:05.200
 who knows, maybe millions in low Earth orbit.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.960
 That's just a place that we're gonna have people

37:06.960 --> 37:10.360
 and actually some industry, manufacturing,

37:10.360 --> 37:12.600
 things like that, that dream I hope we realize,

37:12.600 --> 37:14.400
 getting people to the moon so I can envision

37:14.400 --> 37:15.880
 a lot of people on the moon.

37:15.880 --> 37:17.120
 Again, it's a great place to go.

37:17.120 --> 37:18.960
 Living or visiting?

37:18.960 --> 37:21.160
 Probably visiting and living.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.960
 If you want to, most people are gonna wanna come back

37:22.960 --> 37:24.920
 to Earth, I think, but there'll be some people

37:24.920 --> 37:26.840
 and it's not such a long, it's a good view.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.040
 It's a beautiful view.

37:28.040 --> 37:31.560
 So I think that we will have many people on the moon as well.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.880
 I think there'll be some people, you told me, wow,

37:33.880 --> 37:34.880
 hundreds of years out.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.360
 So we'll have people who will be interplanetary for sure

37:37.360 --> 37:38.720
 as a species.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.840
 So I think we'll be on the moon.

37:39.840 --> 37:41.480
 I think we'll be on Mars.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.760
 No, Venus, no, it's already a runaway greenhouse gas.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.120
 So not a great place for science.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.880
 Jupiter all within the solar system,

37:47.880 --> 37:50.080
 great place for all of our scientific probes.

37:50.080 --> 37:53.280
 I don't see so much in terms of human physical presence.

37:53.280 --> 37:54.200
 We'll be exploring them.

37:54.200 --> 37:57.520
 So we live in our minds there because we're exploring them

37:57.520 --> 38:02.360
 and going on those journeys, but it's really our choice

38:02.360 --> 38:05.240
 in terms of our decisions of how in balance

38:05.240 --> 38:07.280
 we're gonna be living here on the Earth.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.400
 When do you think the first woman,

38:09.400 --> 38:11.760
 first person will step on Mars?

38:11.760 --> 38:14.520
 Step on Mars, well, I'm gonna do everything I can

38:14.520 --> 38:16.360
 to make sure it happens in the 2030s.

38:16.360 --> 38:17.200
 2030?

38:17.200 --> 38:22.200
 Say mid, 20, 25, 2035, we'll be on the moon.

38:22.840 --> 38:24.280
 And hopefully with more people than us.

38:24.280 --> 38:25.760
 But first with a few astronauts,

38:25.760 --> 38:27.640
 it'll be global, international folks,

38:27.640 --> 38:29.920
 but we really need those 10 years, I think, on the moon.

38:29.920 --> 38:33.520
 And then so by later in the decade in the 2030s,

38:33.520 --> 38:35.400
 we'll have all the technology and know how

38:35.400 --> 38:38.400
 and we need to get that human mission to Mars then.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.760
 We'll live in exciting times.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.800
