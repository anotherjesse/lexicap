00:00.000 --> 00:03.160
 The following is a conversation with Scott Aaronson,

00:03.160 --> 00:04.920
 a professor at UT Austin,

00:04.920 --> 00:07.200
 director of its Quantum Information Center,

00:07.200 --> 00:10.000
 and previously a professor at MIT.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.800
 His research interest center around the capabilities

00:12.800 --> 00:14.560
 and limits of quantum computers

00:14.560 --> 00:17.680
 and computational complexity theory more generally.

00:17.680 --> 00:19.440
 He is an excellent writer

00:19.440 --> 00:21.080
 and one of my favorite communicators

00:21.080 --> 00:23.280
 of computer science in the world.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.480
 We only had about an hour and a half for this conversation,

00:26.480 --> 00:29.160
 so I decided to focus on quantum computing,

00:29.160 --> 00:30.920
 but I can see us talking again in the future

00:30.920 --> 00:33.240
 on this podcast at some point

00:33.240 --> 00:35.640
 about computational complexity theory

00:35.640 --> 00:38.480
 and all the complexity classes that Scott catalogs

00:38.480 --> 00:41.120
 in his amazing complexity zoo wiki.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.640
 As a quick aside,

00:43.640 --> 00:46.000
 based on questions and comments I've received,

00:46.000 --> 00:48.200
 my goal with these conversations

00:48.200 --> 00:51.560
 is to try to be in the background without ego

00:51.560 --> 00:53.400
 and do three things.

00:53.400 --> 00:55.240
 One, let the guests shine

00:55.240 --> 00:56.960
 and try to discover together

00:56.960 --> 00:59.120
 the most beautiful insights in their work

00:59.120 --> 01:00.760
 and in their mind.

01:00.760 --> 01:02.960
 Two, try to play devil's advocate

01:02.960 --> 01:05.560
 just enough to provide a creative tension

01:05.560 --> 01:08.040
 in exploring ideas through conversation.

01:08.040 --> 01:11.760
 And three, to ask very basic questions

01:11.760 --> 01:15.300
 about terminology, about concepts, about ideas.

01:16.360 --> 01:18.760
 Many of the topics we talk about in the podcast,

01:18.760 --> 01:20.600
 I've been studying for years

01:20.600 --> 01:22.800
 as a grad student, as a researcher,

01:22.800 --> 01:26.200
 and generally as a curious human who loves to read.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.200
 But frankly, I see myself in these conversations

01:29.200 --> 01:30.360
 as the main character

01:30.360 --> 01:31.680
 for one of my favorite novels,

01:31.680 --> 01:35.160
 Bedestah Yovsky called The Idiot.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.920
 I enjoy playing dumb.

01:36.920 --> 01:39.080
 Clearly, it comes naturally.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.600
 But the basic questions don't come

01:40.600 --> 01:42.440
 from my ignorance of the subject,

01:42.440 --> 01:45.800
 but from an instinct that the fundamentals are simple.

01:45.800 --> 01:49.000
 And if we linger on them from almost a naive perspective,

01:49.000 --> 01:50.920
 we can draw an insightful thread

01:50.920 --> 01:54.120
 from computer science to neuroscience to physics

01:54.120 --> 01:57.920
 to philosophy and to artificial intelligence.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.480
 This is The Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.680
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

02:03.680 --> 02:05.680
 give it to five stars on Apple Podcasts,

02:05.680 --> 02:07.000
 support it on Patreon,

02:07.000 --> 02:10.240
 or simply connect with me on Twitter at Lex Freedman,

02:10.240 --> 02:13.520
 spelled F R I D M A N.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.440
 As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now

02:16.440 --> 02:17.880
 and never any ads in the middle

02:17.880 --> 02:20.120
 that can break the flow of the conversation.

02:20.120 --> 02:21.520
 I hope that works for you

02:21.520 --> 02:24.080
 and doesn't hurt the listening experience.

02:24.080 --> 02:27.080
 Quick summary of the ads, two supporters today.

02:27.080 --> 02:31.640
 First, get Cash App and use the code Lex Podcast.

02:31.640 --> 02:35.040
 Second, listen to the Tech Meme Ride Home Podcast

02:35.040 --> 02:39.200
 for tech news, search Ride Home Two Words

02:39.200 --> 02:41.280
 in your podcast app.

02:41.280 --> 02:43.440
 This show is presented by Cash App,

02:43.440 --> 02:45.880
 the number one finance app in the app store.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.320
 When you get it, use code Lex Podcast.

02:49.320 --> 02:52.680
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

02:52.680 --> 02:56.000
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.040
 Broker services are provided by Cash App Investing,

02:59.040 --> 03:03.040
 a subsidiary of Square and member SIPC.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.360
 Since Cash App does fractional share trading,

03:05.360 --> 03:08.200
 let me mention that the order execution algorithm

03:08.200 --> 03:09.760
 that works behind the scenes

03:09.760 --> 03:12.520
 to create the abstraction of fractional orders

03:12.520 --> 03:14.640
 is an algorithmic marvel.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.960
 So big props to the Cash App engineers

03:16.960 --> 03:19.480
 for solving a hard problem that in the end

03:19.480 --> 03:22.280
 provides an easy interface that takes a step up

03:22.280 --> 03:25.160
 to the next layer of abstraction over the stock market,

03:25.160 --> 03:28.480
 making trading more accessible for new investors

03:28.480 --> 03:31.720
 and diversification much easier.

03:31.720 --> 03:34.400
 So again, if you get Cash App from the app store

03:34.400 --> 03:37.880
 or Google Play and use the code Lex Podcast,

03:37.880 --> 03:42.080
 you'll get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to first.

03:42.080 --> 03:44.120
 One of my favorite organizations

03:44.120 --> 03:47.360
 that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education

03:47.360 --> 03:49.600
 for young people around the world.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.200
 This episode is also supported

03:52.200 --> 03:55.720
 by the Tech Meme Right Home Podcast.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.600
 It's a technology podcast I've been listening to for a while

03:58.600 --> 04:00.280
 and really enjoying.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.720
 It goes straight to the point,

04:01.720 --> 04:03.680
 gives you the tech news you need to know

04:03.680 --> 04:07.080
 and provides minimal but essential context.

04:07.080 --> 04:10.000
 It's released every day by 5 p.m. Eastern

04:10.000 --> 04:12.600
 and is only about 15 to 20 minutes long.

04:12.600 --> 04:15.520
 For fun, I like building apps on smartphones,

04:15.520 --> 04:18.200
 most on Android, so I'm always a little curious

04:18.200 --> 04:20.360
 about new flagship phones that come out.

04:20.360 --> 04:24.840
 I saw that Samsung announced the new Galaxy S20.

04:24.840 --> 04:28.720
 And of course, right away, Tech Meme Right Home

04:28.720 --> 04:32.480
 has a new episode that summarizes all that I needed to know

04:32.480 --> 04:34.840
 about this new device.

04:34.840 --> 04:37.920
 They've also started to do weekend bonus episodes

04:37.920 --> 04:41.400
 with interviews of people like A. Well Founder Steve Case,

04:41.400 --> 04:45.640
 an investing and Gary Marcus on AI,

04:45.640 --> 04:48.720
 who I've also interviewed on this podcast.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.640
 You can find the Tech Meme Right Home Podcast

04:51.640 --> 04:56.720
 if you search your podcast app for Ride Home Two Words.

04:56.720 --> 05:00.160
 Then subscribe, enjoy and keep up to date

05:00.160 --> 05:02.600
 with the latest tech news.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.720
 And now here's my conversation with Scott Aronson.

05:06.720 --> 05:11.640
 I sometimes get criticism from a listener here and there

05:11.640 --> 05:13.400
 that while having a conversation

05:13.400 --> 05:14.960
 with a world class mathematician,

05:14.960 --> 05:18.200
 physicist, neurobiologist, aerospace engineer

05:18.200 --> 05:21.760
 or a theoretical computer scientist like yourself,

05:21.760 --> 05:24.680
 I waste time by asking philosophical questions

05:24.680 --> 05:28.320
 about free will, consciousness, mortality,

05:28.320 --> 05:31.920
 love, nature of truth, super intelligence,

05:31.920 --> 05:33.480
 whether time travel is possible,

05:33.480 --> 05:36.800
 whether space time is emerging fundamental,

05:36.800 --> 05:39.400
 even the crazier questions like whether aliens exist,

05:39.400 --> 05:40.840
 what their language might look like,

05:40.840 --> 05:43.000
 what their math might look like,

05:43.000 --> 05:44.680
 whether math is invented or discovered

05:44.680 --> 05:47.960
 and of course, whether we live in a simulation or not.

05:47.960 --> 05:52.960
 So I try out with it, I try to dance back and forth

05:53.320 --> 05:56.600
 from the deep technical to the philosophical.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.080
 So I've done that quite a bit.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.680
 So you're a world class computer scientist

06:01.680 --> 06:04.120
 and yet you've written about this very point.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.720
 The philosophy is important for experts

06:06.720 --> 06:09.040
 in any technical discipline,

06:09.040 --> 06:11.160
 though they somehow seem to avoid this.

06:12.040 --> 06:13.480
 So I thought it'd be really interesting

06:13.480 --> 06:15.080
 to talk to you about this point.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.760
 Why should we computer scientists, mathematicians,

06:17.760 --> 06:20.760
 physicists care about philosophy, do you think?

06:20.760 --> 06:23.040
 Well, I would reframe the question a little bit.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.760
 I mean, philosophy almost by definition

06:26.760 --> 06:30.920
 is the subject that's concerned with the biggest questions

06:30.920 --> 06:33.120
 that you could possibly ask, right?

06:33.120 --> 06:35.720
 So the ones you mentioned, right?

06:35.720 --> 06:38.400
 Are we living in a simulation?

06:39.640 --> 06:41.680
 Are we alone in the universe?

06:41.680 --> 06:44.280
 How should we even think about such questions?

06:44.280 --> 06:47.280
 Is the future determined and what do we even mean

06:47.280 --> 06:49.520
 by it being determined?

06:49.520 --> 06:51.720
 Why are we alive at the time we are

06:51.720 --> 06:53.520
 and not at some other time?

06:53.520 --> 06:57.960
 And when you sort of contemplate

06:57.960 --> 06:59.480
 the enormity of those questions,

06:59.480 --> 07:01.000
 I think you could ask,

07:01.000 --> 07:04.480
 well, then why be concerned with anything else, right?

07:04.480 --> 07:08.760
 Why not spend your whole life on those questions?

07:08.760 --> 07:12.240
 I think in some sense that is the right way

07:12.240 --> 07:13.720
 to phrase the question.

07:13.720 --> 07:18.720
 And actually what we learned throughout history,

07:19.160 --> 07:21.840
 but really starting with the scientific revolution

07:21.840 --> 07:23.920
 with Galileo and so on,

07:23.920 --> 07:28.920
 is that there is a good reason to focus on narrower questions,

07:29.480 --> 07:33.520
 more technical, mathematical or empirical questions.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.440
 And that is that you can actually make progress on them, right?

07:36.440 --> 07:39.200
 And you can actually often answer them

07:39.200 --> 07:41.680
 and sometimes they actually tell you something

07:41.680 --> 07:43.760
 about the philosophical questions

07:43.760 --> 07:48.440
 that sort of maybe motivated your curiosity as a child, right?

07:48.440 --> 07:51.680
 They don't necessarily resolve the philosophical questions,

07:51.680 --> 07:55.040
 but sometimes they reframe your whole understanding of them, right?

07:55.040 --> 07:58.080
 And so for me, philosophy is just the thing

07:58.080 --> 08:00.840
 that you have in the background from the very beginning

08:00.840 --> 08:05.400
 that you want to, these are sort of the reasons

08:05.400 --> 08:08.560
 why you went into intellectual life in the first place,

08:08.560 --> 08:10.480
 at least the reasons why I did, right?

08:11.640 --> 08:15.120
 But math and science are tools that we have

08:15.120 --> 08:17.480
 for actually making progress.

08:17.480 --> 08:21.400
 And hopefully even changing our understanding

08:21.400 --> 08:23.200
 of these philosophical questions,

08:23.200 --> 08:26.320
 sometimes even more than philosophy itself does.

08:26.320 --> 08:30.480
 What do you think computer scientists avoid these questions?

08:30.480 --> 08:31.840
 We'll run away from them a little bit,

08:31.840 --> 08:34.520
 at least in the technical scientific discourse.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.960
 Well, I'm not sure if they do so

08:36.960 --> 08:39.160
 more than any other scientists do.

08:39.160 --> 08:44.320
 I mean, Alan Turing was famously interested

08:44.320 --> 08:49.720
 and one of his two most famous papers

08:49.720 --> 08:51.960
 was in a philosophy journal, Mind.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.600
 It was the one where he proposed the Turing test.

08:55.600 --> 08:59.880
 He took a Wittgenstein's course at Cambridge,

08:59.880 --> 09:01.400
 argued with him.

09:01.400 --> 09:03.800
 I just recently learned that a little bit

09:03.800 --> 09:05.240
 and it's actually fascinating.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.400
 I was trying to look for resources

09:08.400 --> 09:12.360
 in trying to understand where the sources of disagreement

09:12.360 --> 09:15.680
 and debates between Wittgenstein and Turing were.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.360
 That's interesting that these two minds have somehow met

09:18.360 --> 09:20.160
 in the arc of history.

09:20.160 --> 09:25.120
 Yeah, well, the transcript of their course,

09:25.120 --> 09:26.840
 which was in 1939,

09:26.840 --> 09:28.960
 is one of the more fascinating documents

09:28.960 --> 09:33.480
 that I've ever read because Wittgenstein is trying to say,

09:33.480 --> 09:36.120
 well, all of these formal systems

09:36.120 --> 09:41.120
 are just complete irrelevancies.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.520
 If a formal system is irrelevant, who cares?

09:44.520 --> 09:46.840
 Why does that matter in real life?

09:46.840 --> 09:49.000
 And Turing is saying, well, look,

09:49.000 --> 09:52.640
 if you use an inconsistent formal system to design a bridge,

09:52.640 --> 09:54.480
 the bridge may collapse.

09:55.480 --> 09:58.880
 So Turing, in some sense, is thinking decades ahead.

09:58.880 --> 10:01.600
 I think of where Wittgenstein is,

10:01.600 --> 10:05.040
 to where the formal systems are actually going to be used

10:05.040 --> 10:08.920
 in computers to actually do things in the world.

10:08.920 --> 10:12.160
 And it's interesting that Turing actually dropped the course

10:12.160 --> 10:13.120
 halfway through.

10:13.120 --> 10:13.960
 Why?

10:13.960 --> 10:15.280
 Because he had to go to Bletchley Park

10:15.280 --> 10:18.240
 and work on something of more immediate importance.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.880
 That's fascinating.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.160
 Take a step from philosophy to actual,

10:22.160 --> 10:25.000
 like the biggest possible step to actual engineering

10:25.000 --> 10:26.360
 with actual real impact.

10:26.360 --> 10:29.160
 Yeah, and I would say more generally, right?

10:30.320 --> 10:35.080
 A lot of scientists are interested in philosophy,

10:35.080 --> 10:36.680
 but they're also busy, right?

10:36.680 --> 10:39.440
 And they have a lot on their plate,

10:39.440 --> 10:42.720
 and there are a lot of sort of very concrete questions

10:42.720 --> 10:44.840
 that are already not answered,

10:44.840 --> 10:47.920
 but look like they might be answerable, right?

10:47.920 --> 10:52.880
 And so then you could say, well, then why break your brain

10:52.880 --> 10:55.920
 over these metaphysically unanswerable questions

10:55.920 --> 10:59.320
 when there were all of these answerable ones instead?

10:59.320 --> 11:04.320
 So I think, for me, I enjoy talking about philosophy.

11:06.240 --> 11:09.840
 I even go to philosophy conferences sometimes,

11:09.840 --> 11:12.040
 such as the FQXI conferences.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.960
 I enjoy interacting with philosophers.

11:14.960 --> 11:17.760
 I would not want to be a professional philosopher

11:17.760 --> 11:20.960
 because I like being in a field where I feel like,

11:22.960 --> 11:27.120
 if I get too confused about the sort of eternal questions,

11:27.120 --> 11:30.080
 then I can actually make progress on something.

11:30.080 --> 11:32.880
 Can you maybe link that for just a little longer?

11:32.880 --> 11:34.640
 What do you think is the difference?

11:34.640 --> 11:37.680
 So like the corollary of the criticism

11:37.680 --> 11:40.200
 that I mentioned previously,

11:40.200 --> 11:42.520
 that why I ask the philosophical questions

11:42.520 --> 11:44.400
 of the mathematician is,

11:44.400 --> 11:46.240
 if you want to ask philosophical questions,

11:46.240 --> 11:49.040
 then invite a real philosopher on and ask them.

11:49.040 --> 11:51.200
 So what's the difference between the way

11:51.200 --> 11:53.360
 a computer scientist or mathematician ponders

11:53.360 --> 11:56.040
 a philosophical question and a philosopher ponders

11:56.040 --> 11:57.280
 a philosophical question?

11:57.280 --> 12:01.000
 Well, I mean, a lot of it just depends on the individual, right?

12:01.000 --> 12:04.760
 It's hard to make generalizations about entire fields,

12:04.760 --> 12:09.600
 but I think if we tried to,

12:09.600 --> 12:11.480
 if we tried to stereotype,

12:11.480 --> 12:16.480
 we would say that scientists very often

12:18.160 --> 12:22.120
 will be less careful in their use of words.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.200
 I mean, philosophers are really experts

12:24.200 --> 12:27.160
 in sort of, like when I talk to them,

12:27.160 --> 12:30.080
 they will just pounce if I use the wrong phrase

12:30.080 --> 12:30.920
 for something.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.600
 Experts is a very nice word.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.680
 You could say sticklers or...

12:34.680 --> 12:37.960
 Yeah, or they will sort of interrogate

12:37.960 --> 12:39.920
 my word choices, let's say,

12:39.920 --> 12:42.920
 to a much greater extent than scientists would, right?

12:42.920 --> 12:46.320
 And scientists will often,

12:46.320 --> 12:48.920
 if you ask them about a philosophical problem,

12:48.920 --> 12:51.880
 like the hard problem of consciousness

12:51.880 --> 12:53.560
 or free will or whatever,

12:53.560 --> 12:57.520
 they will try to relate it back to recent research,

12:57.520 --> 13:01.200
 research about neurobiology

13:01.200 --> 13:03.880
 or the best of all is research

13:03.880 --> 13:06.480
 that they personally are involved with, right?

13:06.480 --> 13:10.400
 And of course, they will want to talk about that

13:10.400 --> 13:12.280
 and it is what they will think of.

13:12.280 --> 13:14.160
 And of course, you could have an argument

13:14.160 --> 13:17.320
 that maybe it's all interesting as it goes,

13:17.320 --> 13:20.680
 but maybe none of it touches the philosophical question, right?

13:20.680 --> 13:25.680
 But maybe a science, at least it,

13:26.040 --> 13:29.040
 as I said, it does tell us concrete things.

13:29.040 --> 13:33.520
 And even if like a deep dive into neurobiology

13:33.520 --> 13:36.800
 will not answer the hard problem of consciousness,

13:36.800 --> 13:40.480
 maybe it can take us about as far as we can get

13:40.480 --> 13:44.680
 toward expanding our minds about it,

13:44.680 --> 13:47.000
 toward thinking about it in a different way.

13:48.720 --> 13:51.040
 Well, I mean, I think neurobiology can do that,

13:51.040 --> 13:53.800
 but with these profound philosophical questions,

13:53.800 --> 13:56.880
 I mean, also art and literature do that, right?

13:56.880 --> 13:58.400
 They're all different ways of trying

13:58.400 --> 14:00.840
 to approach these questions that we don't,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.200
 for which we don't even know really

14:02.200 --> 14:03.680
 what an answer would look like,

14:03.680 --> 14:06.160
 but and yet somehow we can't help

14:06.160 --> 14:07.760
 but keep returning to the questions.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.200
 And you have a kind of mathematical,

14:09.200 --> 14:11.240
 a beautiful mathematical way of discussing this

14:11.240 --> 14:12.760
 with the idea of Q prime.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.600
 Oh, right.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.960
 You write that usually the only way

14:15.960 --> 14:17.760
 to make progress on the big questions,

14:17.760 --> 14:21.440
 like the philosophical questions we're talking about now,

14:21.440 --> 14:24.360
 is to pick off smaller sub questions.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.360
 Ideally, the sub questions that you can attack

14:26.360 --> 14:29.120
 using math empirical observation are both.

14:29.120 --> 14:31.400
 You define the idea of a Q prime.

14:31.400 --> 14:36.160
 So given an unanswerable philosophical riddle, Q,

14:36.160 --> 14:38.480
 replace it with a mirrorly,

14:38.480 --> 14:40.960
 in quotes, scientific or mathematical question,

14:40.960 --> 14:43.560
 Q prime, which captures part of what people

14:43.560 --> 14:46.880
 have wanted to know when they first asked Q.

14:46.880 --> 14:47.720
 Yes.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.920
 Then with luck, one solves Q prime.

14:49.920 --> 14:54.920
 So you describe some examples of such Q prime sub questions

14:55.480 --> 14:59.280
 in your long essay titled,

14:59.280 --> 15:02.480
 Why Philosophers Should Care About Computational Complexity.

15:02.480 --> 15:04.600
 So you catalog the various Q primes

15:04.600 --> 15:07.200
 on which you think theoretical computer science

15:07.200 --> 15:08.080
 has made progress.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.960
 Can you mention a few favorites?

15:09.960 --> 15:12.320
 If any popped, if any popped to mind,

15:12.320 --> 15:13.160
 or that you're...

15:13.160 --> 15:14.000
 Well, yeah.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.960
 So, I mean, I would say some of the most famous examples

15:16.960 --> 15:20.800
 in history of that sort of replacement were,

15:20.800 --> 15:23.280
 I mean, to go back to Alan Turing, right?

15:23.280 --> 15:26.480
 What he did in his computing machinery

15:26.480 --> 15:29.360
 and intelligence paper was exactly,

15:29.360 --> 15:32.160
 he explicitly started with the question,

15:32.160 --> 15:33.880
 can machines think?

15:33.880 --> 15:35.800
 And then he said, sorry,

15:35.800 --> 15:38.040
 I think that question is too meaningless,

15:38.040 --> 15:40.400
 but here's a different question.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.160
 Could you program a computer

15:42.160 --> 15:43.640
 so that you couldn't tell the difference

15:43.640 --> 15:45.280
 between it and a human, right?

15:45.280 --> 15:46.120
 And yeah.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.960
 So in the very first few sentences,

15:47.960 --> 15:50.920
 he in fact just formates the Q prime question.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.640
 He does precisely that.

15:52.640 --> 15:56.200
 Or we could look at Gertle, right?

15:56.200 --> 16:00.480
 Where you had these philosophers arguing for centuries

16:00.480 --> 16:03.120
 about the limits of mathematical reasoning, right?

16:03.120 --> 16:04.680
 The limits of formal systems.

16:04.680 --> 16:08.760
 And then by the early 20th century,

16:08.760 --> 16:12.360
 logicians starting with Frague, Russell,

16:12.360 --> 16:15.480
 and then most spectacularly Gertle

16:15.480 --> 16:17.880
 managed to reframe those questions.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.840
 As look, we have these formal systems,

16:19.840 --> 16:21.520
 they have these definite rules.

16:21.520 --> 16:23.480
 Are there questions that we can phrase

16:23.480 --> 16:25.760
 within the rules of these systems

16:25.760 --> 16:28.240
 that are not provable within the rules of the systems?

16:28.240 --> 16:30.520
 And can we prove that fact, right?

16:30.520 --> 16:34.080
 And so that would be another example.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.600
 I had this essay called

16:36.600 --> 16:38.920
 The Ghost in the Quantum Touring Machine.

16:38.920 --> 16:41.880
 That was one of the crazier things I've written,

16:41.880 --> 16:44.720
 but I tried to do something,

16:44.720 --> 16:48.760
 or to advocate doing something similar there for free will,

16:48.760 --> 16:53.240
 where instead of talking about is free will real

16:53.240 --> 16:56.160
 or we get hung up on the meaning of what exactly

16:56.160 --> 16:57.520
 do we mean by freedom?

16:57.520 --> 16:59.800
 And can you have, can you be,

16:59.800 --> 17:02.200
 do we mean compatibilist free will,

17:02.200 --> 17:05.360
 libertarian free will, what do these things mean?

17:05.360 --> 17:08.200
 I suggested just asking the question,

17:08.200 --> 17:12.320
 how well in principle, consistently with the laws of physics,

17:12.320 --> 17:16.080
 could a person's behavior be predicted without,

17:16.080 --> 17:18.800
 so let's say destroying the person's brain,

17:18.800 --> 17:22.120
 taking it apart in the process of trying to predict them?

17:22.120 --> 17:25.680
 And that actually asking that question

17:25.680 --> 17:29.480
 gets you into all sorts of meaty and interesting issues,

17:29.480 --> 17:33.980
 issues of what is the computational substrate of the brain?

17:35.320 --> 17:38.320
 Can you understand the brain just at the level

17:38.320 --> 17:42.360
 of the neurons at the abstraction of a neural network?

17:42.360 --> 17:46.040
 Or do you need to go deeper to the molecular level

17:46.040 --> 17:48.320
 and ultimately even to the quantum level, right?

17:48.320 --> 17:51.320
 And of course that would put limits on predictability

17:51.320 --> 17:52.680
 if you did.

17:52.680 --> 17:53.920
 So you need to reduce,

17:53.920 --> 17:58.600
 you need to reduce the mind to a computational device,

17:58.600 --> 18:01.200
 like formalize it so that you can make predictions

18:01.200 --> 18:03.880
 about whether you could predict the behavior of the system.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.840
 Well, if you were trying to predict a person,

18:05.840 --> 18:08.080
 yeah, then presumably you would need some model

18:08.080 --> 18:09.200
 of their brain, right?

18:09.200 --> 18:11.240
 And now the question becomes one of,

18:11.240 --> 18:13.800
 how accurate can such a model become?

18:13.800 --> 18:16.800
 Can you make a model that will be accurate enough

18:16.800 --> 18:21.280
 to really seriously threaten people's sense of free will?

18:21.280 --> 18:22.640
 Not just metaphysically,

18:22.640 --> 18:25.120
 but like really I've written in this envelope

18:25.120 --> 18:26.800
 what you were going to say next.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.920
 Is accuracy the right term here?

18:28.920 --> 18:32.600
 So it's also a level of abstraction has to be right.

18:32.600 --> 18:37.600
 So if you're accurate at the somehow at the quantum level,

18:39.040 --> 18:43.000
 that may not be convincing to us at the human level.

18:43.000 --> 18:46.120
 Well, right, but the question is what accuracy

18:46.120 --> 18:49.000
 at the sort of level of the underlying mechanisms

18:49.000 --> 18:52.200
 do you need in order to predict the behavior, right?

18:52.200 --> 18:54.280
 At the end of the day, the test is just,

18:54.280 --> 18:58.160
 can you foresee what the person is going to do, right?

18:58.160 --> 19:03.160
 I am, and in discussions of free will,

19:03.600 --> 19:07.200
 it seems like both sides wanna very quickly

19:07.200 --> 19:09.400
 dismiss that question as irrelevant.

19:09.400 --> 19:11.680
 Well, to me, it's totally relevant, okay?

19:11.680 --> 19:14.280
 Because if someone says,

19:14.280 --> 19:16.840
 oh, well, a Laplace demon

19:16.840 --> 19:20.120
 that knew the complete state of the universe,

19:20.120 --> 19:22.080
 could predict everything you're going to do.

19:22.080 --> 19:24.040
 Therefore, you don't have free will.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.440
 You know, it doesn't trouble me that much

19:26.440 --> 19:29.240
 because, well, I've never met such a demon, right?

19:29.240 --> 19:34.240
 I, you know, and we even have some reasons to think,

19:34.480 --> 19:37.240
 maybe it could not exist as part of our world.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.720
 It was only an abstraction, a thought experiment.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.480
 On the other hand, if someone said,

19:42.480 --> 19:45.160
 well, I have this brain scanning machine,

19:45.160 --> 19:47.160
 you step into it, and then, you know,

19:47.160 --> 19:49.120
 every paper that you will ever write,

19:49.120 --> 19:52.120
 it will write, you know, every thought that you will have,

19:52.120 --> 19:54.480
 you know, even right now about the machine itself,

19:54.480 --> 19:56.040
 it will foresee, you know,

19:56.040 --> 19:58.560
 well, if you can actually demonstrate that,

19:58.560 --> 20:00.280
 then I think, you know, that, you know,

20:00.280 --> 20:03.000
 that sort of threatens my internal sense

20:03.000 --> 20:06.320
 of having free will in a much more visceral way.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.720
 You know, but now you notice

20:07.720 --> 20:11.560
 that we're asking a much more empirical question.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.680
 We're asking, is such a machine possible or isn't it?

20:14.680 --> 20:16.240
 We're asking, if it's not possible,

20:16.240 --> 20:18.360
 then what in the laws of physics,

20:18.360 --> 20:21.200
 or what about the behavior of the brain,

20:21.200 --> 20:23.000
 you know, prevents it from existing?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.280
 So if you could philosophize a little bit

20:25.280 --> 20:27.360
 within this empirical question,

20:27.360 --> 20:31.440
 at where do you think would enter the,

20:31.440 --> 20:33.840
 by which mechanism would enter the possibility

20:33.840 --> 20:35.600
 that we can't predict the outcome?

20:35.600 --> 20:38.840
 So there would be something that would be akin to a free will.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.440
 Yeah, well, you could say the sort of obvious possibility,

20:42.440 --> 20:45.640
 which was, you know, recognized by Eddington

20:45.640 --> 20:48.040
 and many others about as soon as quantum mechanics

20:48.040 --> 20:50.600
 was discovered in the 1920s,

20:50.600 --> 20:55.600
 was that if, you know, let's say a sodium ion channel,

20:56.200 --> 21:00.520
 you know, in the brain, right?

21:00.520 --> 21:04.000
 You know, it's behavior is chaotic, right?

21:04.000 --> 21:07.960
 It's sort of, it's governed by these Hodgley,

21:07.960 --> 21:10.960
 Hawkskin equations in neuroscience, right?

21:10.960 --> 21:12.520
 Which are differential equations

21:12.520 --> 21:14.800
 that have a stochastic component, right?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.120
 Now, where does, you know, and this ultimately governs,

21:17.120 --> 21:19.680
 let's say, whether a neuron will fire or not fire, right?

21:19.680 --> 21:21.720
 So that's the basic chemical process

21:21.720 --> 21:23.880
 or electrical process by which signals

21:23.880 --> 21:24.800
 are sent in the brain.

21:24.800 --> 21:26.040
 Exactly, exactly.

21:26.040 --> 21:28.800
 And, you know, and so you could ask,

21:28.800 --> 21:31.400
 well, where does the randomness in the process,

21:31.400 --> 21:34.120
 you know, that neuroscientists,

21:34.120 --> 21:38.040
 or what neuroscientists would treat as randomness,

21:38.040 --> 21:39.400
 where does it come from?

21:39.400 --> 21:41.760
 You know, ultimately it's thermal noise, right?

21:41.760 --> 21:43.640
 Where does thermal noise come from?

21:43.640 --> 21:44.920
 Well, ultimately, you know,

21:44.920 --> 21:46.800
 there were some quantum mechanical events

21:46.800 --> 21:49.440
 at the molecular level that are getting sort of

21:49.440 --> 21:51.480
 chaotically amplified by, you know,

21:51.480 --> 21:53.720
 a sort of butterfly effect.

21:53.720 --> 21:57.280
 And so, you know, even if you knew

21:57.280 --> 22:00.600
 the complete quantum state of someone's brain, you know,

22:00.600 --> 22:02.840
 at best you could predict the probabilities

22:02.840 --> 22:05.480
 that they would do one thing or do another thing, right?

22:05.480 --> 22:06.800
 I think that part is actually

22:06.800 --> 22:09.080
 relatively uncontroversial, right?

22:09.080 --> 22:13.360
 The controversial question is whether any of it matters

22:13.360 --> 22:16.120
 for the sort of philosophical questions that we care about,

22:16.120 --> 22:18.360
 because you could say, if all it's doing

22:18.360 --> 22:20.360
 is just injecting some randomness

22:20.360 --> 22:23.720
 into an otherwise completely mechanistic process,

22:23.720 --> 22:25.160
 well, then who cares, right?

22:25.160 --> 22:28.480
 And more concretely, if you could build a machine

22:28.480 --> 22:30.680
 that, you know, could just calculate

22:30.680 --> 22:33.560
 the even just the probabilities

22:33.560 --> 22:36.000
 of all of the possible things that you would do, right?

22:36.000 --> 22:39.960
 And, you know, you know, of all the things that said

22:39.960 --> 22:41.880
 you had a 10% chance of doing,

22:41.880 --> 22:45.640
 you did exactly a 10th of them, you know, and so on and so on.

22:45.640 --> 22:47.360
 Yeah, that somehow also takes away

22:47.360 --> 22:48.200
 the feeling of free will.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.840
 Exactly, I mean, I mean, to me,

22:49.840 --> 22:51.880
 it seems essentially just as bad

22:51.880 --> 22:54.840
 as if the machine deterministically predicted you.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.360
 It seems, you know, hardly different from that.

22:57.360 --> 23:02.360
 So then, but a more subtle question is could you even learn

23:02.360 --> 23:06.360
 enough about someone's brain to do that, okay?

23:06.360 --> 23:09.520
 Because, you know, another central fact

23:09.520 --> 23:14.160
 about quantum mechanics is that making a measurement

23:14.160 --> 23:18.080
 on a quantum state is an inherently destructive operation.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.680
 Okay, so, you know, if I want to measure the, you know,

23:21.680 --> 23:23.480
 position of a particle, right?

23:23.480 --> 23:25.360
 It was, well, before I measured it,

23:25.360 --> 23:28.400
 it had a superposition over many different positions.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.000
 As soon as I measure, I localized it, right?

23:31.000 --> 23:32.360
 So now I know the position,

23:32.360 --> 23:35.240
 but I've also fundamentally changed the state.

23:35.240 --> 23:39.920
 And so you could say, well, maybe in trying to build

23:39.920 --> 23:42.800
 a model of someone's brain that was accurate enough

23:42.800 --> 23:44.720
 to actually, you know, make, let's say,

23:44.720 --> 23:48.360
 even well calibrated probabilistic predictions

23:48.360 --> 23:49.960
 of their future behavior,

23:49.960 --> 23:51.760
 maybe you would have to make measurements

23:51.760 --> 23:53.160
 that were just so accurate

23:53.160 --> 23:56.160
 that you would just fundamentally alter their brain, okay?

23:56.160 --> 23:59.560
 Or maybe not, maybe you only, you know,

23:59.560 --> 24:02.400
 it would suffice to just make some nano robots

24:02.400 --> 24:05.680
 that just measured some sort of much larger scale,

24:05.680 --> 24:08.760
 you know, macroscopic behavior, like, you know,

24:08.760 --> 24:10.760
 is, you know, what is this neuron doing?

24:10.760 --> 24:12.240
 What is that neuron doing?

24:12.240 --> 24:13.880
 Maybe that would be enough.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.960
 See, but now, you know, what I claim is that

24:16.960 --> 24:19.200
 we're now asking a question, you know,

24:19.200 --> 24:22.640
 in which, you know, it is possible to envision

24:22.640 --> 24:24.600
 what progress on it would look like.

24:24.600 --> 24:25.920
 Yeah, but just as you said,

24:25.920 --> 24:28.920
 that question may be slightly detached

24:28.920 --> 24:31.760
 from the philosophical question in the sense

24:31.760 --> 24:33.880
 if consciousness somehow has a role

24:33.880 --> 24:36.080
 to the experience of free will.

24:36.080 --> 24:38.400
 Because ultimately, when we're talking about free will,

24:38.400 --> 24:42.320
 we're also talking about not just the predictability

24:42.320 --> 24:44.920
 of our actions, but somehow the experience

24:44.920 --> 24:46.480
 of that predictability.

24:46.480 --> 24:49.440
 Yeah, well, I mean, a lot of philosophical questions,

24:49.440 --> 24:52.320
 ultimately, like feedback to the hard problem

24:52.320 --> 24:55.280
 of consciousness, you know, and as much as you can try

24:55.280 --> 24:57.200
 to sort of talk around it or not, right?

24:57.200 --> 24:59.960
 And, you know, and then there is a reason

24:59.960 --> 25:01.800
 why people try to talk around it,

25:01.800 --> 25:05.000
 which is that, you know, a Democratist

25:05.000 --> 25:07.760
 talked about the hard problem of consciousness,

25:07.760 --> 25:11.640
 you know, in 400 BC in terms that would be totally

25:11.640 --> 25:13.880
 recognizable to us today, right?

25:13.880 --> 25:16.960
 And it's really not clear if there's been progress since

25:16.960 --> 25:19.520
 or what progress could possibly consist of.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.440
 Is there a Q prime type of sub question

25:22.440 --> 25:24.400
 that could help us get at consciousness?

25:24.400 --> 25:25.680
 It's something about consciousness.

25:25.680 --> 25:27.760
 Well, I mean, well, I mean, there is the whole question

25:27.760 --> 25:29.640
 of, you know, of AI, right?

25:29.640 --> 25:33.720
 Of, you know, can you build a human level

25:33.720 --> 25:36.000
 or super human level AI?

25:36.000 --> 25:39.160
 And, you know, can it work in a completely different

25:39.160 --> 25:40.400
 substrate from the brain?

25:40.400 --> 25:43.480
 I mean, you know, and of course that was Alan Turing's point.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.520
 And, you know, and even if that was done,

25:45.520 --> 25:47.680
 it's, you know, maybe people would still argue

25:47.680 --> 25:49.960
 about the hard problem of consciousness, right?

25:49.960 --> 25:53.120
 And yet, you know, my claim is a little different.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.880
 My claim is that in a world where, you know,

25:55.880 --> 25:59.040
 there were, you know, human level AI's

25:59.040 --> 26:02.000
 where we'd been even overtaken by such AI's,

26:02.000 --> 26:05.960
 the entire discussion of the hard problem of consciousness

26:05.960 --> 26:07.680
 would have a different character, right?

26:07.680 --> 26:10.480
 It would take place in different terms in such a world,

26:10.480 --> 26:12.760
 even if we hadn't answered the question.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.640
 And my claim about free will would be similar, right?

26:15.640 --> 26:18.240
 That if there, if this prediction machine

26:18.240 --> 26:20.400
 that I was talking about could actually be built,

26:20.400 --> 26:23.600
 well, now the entire discussion of the, you know, a free will

26:23.600 --> 26:26.000
 is sort of transformed by that.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.200
 You know, even if in some sense the metaphysical question

26:29.200 --> 26:30.240
 hasn't been answered.

26:31.840 --> 26:32.960
 Yeah, exactly.

26:32.960 --> 26:34.200
 It transforms it fundamentally

26:34.200 --> 26:35.920
 because say that machine does tell you

26:35.920 --> 26:37.640
 that it can predict perfectly

26:37.640 --> 26:40.120
 and yet there is this deep experience of free will

26:40.120 --> 26:42.680
 and then that changes the question completely.

26:42.680 --> 26:43.520
 Yeah.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.240
 And it starts actually getting to the question

26:46.240 --> 26:51.240
 of the AGI, the Turing questions

26:51.600 --> 26:54.960
 of the demonstration of free will,

26:54.960 --> 26:56.600
 the demonstration of intelligence,

26:56.600 --> 26:58.520
 the demonstration of consciousness,

26:58.520 --> 27:02.320
 does that equal consciousness, intelligence and free will?

27:02.320 --> 27:07.320
 But see, Alex, if every time I was contemplating a decision,

27:07.600 --> 27:10.240
 you know, this machine had printed out an envelope,

27:10.240 --> 27:11.560
 you know, where I could open it

27:11.560 --> 27:13.240
 and see that it knew my decision,

27:13.240 --> 27:16.480
 I think that actually would change my subjective experience

27:16.480 --> 27:17.880
 of making decisions.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.840
 You mean does knowledge change your subjective experience?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.680
 Well, you know, I mean, the knowledge

27:22.680 --> 27:25.040
 that this machine had predicted everything I would do,

27:25.040 --> 27:27.760
 I mean, it might drive me completely insane, right?

27:27.760 --> 27:30.440
 But at any rate, it would change my experience

27:30.440 --> 27:33.800
 to act, you know, to not just discuss such a machine

27:33.800 --> 27:36.200
 as a thought experiment, but to actually see it.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.120
 Yeah, there you go.

27:39.120 --> 27:41.720
 I mean, you know, you could say at that point,

27:41.720 --> 27:43.960
 you know, you could say, you know,

27:43.960 --> 27:47.280
 why not simply call this machine a second instantiation

27:47.280 --> 27:49.160
 of me and be done with it, right?

27:49.160 --> 27:53.400
 What, you know, why even privilege the original me

27:53.400 --> 27:56.880
 over this perfect duplicate that exists in the machine?

27:56.880 --> 27:57.720
 Yeah.

27:57.720 --> 28:00.080
 Or there could be a religious experience with it too.

28:00.080 --> 28:02.440
 It's kind of what God throughout the generations

28:02.440 --> 28:05.400
 is supposed to have, that God kind of represents

28:05.400 --> 28:09.800
 that perfect machine is able to, I guess, actually,

28:09.800 --> 28:14.800
 I don't even know what are the religious interpretations

28:15.280 --> 28:20.280
 of free will, so if God knows perfectly everything

28:21.400 --> 28:24.720
 in religion, in the various religions,

28:24.720 --> 28:26.640
 where does free will fit into that?

28:26.640 --> 28:27.480
 Do you know that?

28:27.480 --> 28:29.320
 That has been one of the big things

28:29.320 --> 28:32.120
 that theologians have argued about for thousands of years.

28:32.120 --> 28:35.240
 You know, I am not a theologian,

28:35.240 --> 28:36.440
 so maybe I shouldn't go there.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.920
 So there's not a clear answer in a book like,

28:38.920 --> 28:41.960
 I mean, this is, you know, the Calvinists debated this,

28:41.960 --> 28:43.840
 that, you know, this has been, you know,

28:43.840 --> 28:46.160
 I mean, different religious movements

28:46.160 --> 28:48.160
 have taken different positions on that question,

28:48.160 --> 28:50.160
 but that is how they think about it.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.720
 You know, meanwhile, you know, a large part

28:52.720 --> 28:54.960
 of sort of what animates, you know,

28:54.960 --> 28:57.320
 theoretical computer science, you could say is, you know,

28:57.320 --> 29:00.520
 we're asking sort of what are the ultimate limits

29:00.520 --> 29:04.320
 of what you can know or, you know, calculate

29:04.320 --> 29:06.840
 or figure out by, you know, entities

29:06.840 --> 29:09.720
 that you can actually build in the physical world, right?

29:09.720 --> 29:12.840
 And if I were trying to explain it to a theologian,

29:12.840 --> 29:15.280
 maybe I would say, you know, we are studying, you know,

29:15.280 --> 29:18.160
 to what extent, you know, gods can be made manifest

29:18.160 --> 29:19.840
 in the physical world.

29:19.840 --> 29:21.720
 I'm not sure my colleagues would like that.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.640
 So let's talk about quantum computers.

29:25.640 --> 29:27.360
 Yeah, sure, sure.

29:27.360 --> 29:30.880
 As you've said, quantum computing, at least in the 1990s,

29:30.880 --> 29:33.120
 was a profound story at the intersection

29:33.120 --> 29:34.920
 of computer science, physics, engineering,

29:34.920 --> 29:36.360
 math and philosophy.

29:36.360 --> 29:40.320
 So there's this broad and deep aspect to quantum computing

29:40.320 --> 29:42.880
 that represents more than just the quantum computer.

29:42.880 --> 29:45.200
 But can we start at the very basics?

29:45.200 --> 29:47.720
 What is quantum computing?

29:47.720 --> 29:52.720
 Yeah, so it's a proposal for a new type of computation,

29:53.200 --> 29:57.120
 let's say a new way to harness nature to do computation

29:57.120 --> 30:00.200
 that is based on the principles of quantum mechanics.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.520
 Okay, now the principles of quantum mechanics

30:02.520 --> 30:06.040
 have been in place since 1926.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.080
 You know, they haven't changed.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.120
 You know, what's new is, you know, how we want to use them.

30:11.120 --> 30:15.680
 Okay, so what does quantum mechanics say about the world?

30:15.680 --> 30:18.560
 You know, the physicists, I think over the generations,

30:18.560 --> 30:21.200
 you know, convinced people that that is an unbelievably

30:21.200 --> 30:23.920
 complicated question and, you know, just give up

30:23.920 --> 30:25.680
 on trying to understand it.

30:25.680 --> 30:28.520
 I can let you in, not being a physicist,

30:28.520 --> 30:29.920
 I can let you in on a secret,

30:29.920 --> 30:32.480
 which is that it becomes a lot simpler

30:32.480 --> 30:35.760
 if you do what we do in quantum information theory

30:35.760 --> 30:37.880
 and sort of take the physics out of it.

30:37.880 --> 30:41.200
 So the way that we think about quantum mechanics

30:41.200 --> 30:43.240
 is sort of as a generalization

30:43.240 --> 30:45.720
 of the rules of probability themselves.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.920
 So, you know, you might say there's a, you know,

30:48.920 --> 30:52.320
 there was a 30% chance that it was going to snow today

30:52.320 --> 30:53.160
 or something.

30:53.160 --> 30:55.920
 You would never say that there was a negative 30% chance,

30:55.920 --> 30:57.880
 right, that would be nonsense.

30:57.880 --> 30:59.720
 Much less would you say that there was a, you know,

30:59.720 --> 31:04.200
 an I% chance, you know, a square root of minus 1% chance.

31:04.200 --> 31:09.200
 Now, the central discovery that sort of quantum mechanics

31:09.400 --> 31:14.400
 made is that fundamentally the world is described by,

31:16.880 --> 31:19.240
 you know, the sort of, let's say the possibilities

31:19.240 --> 31:22.240
 for, you know, what a system could be doing

31:22.240 --> 31:25.920
 are described using numbers called amplitudes, okay,

31:25.920 --> 31:29.440
 which are like probabilities in some ways,

31:29.440 --> 31:31.200
 but they are not probabilities.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.840
 They can be positive, for one thing,

31:32.840 --> 31:34.920
 they can be positive or negative.

31:34.920 --> 31:37.520
 In fact, they can even be complex numbers.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.360
 Okay, and if you've heard of a quantum superposition,

31:40.360 --> 31:43.560
 this just means that some state of affairs

31:43.560 --> 31:45.760
 where you assign an amplitude,

31:45.760 --> 31:47.480
 one of these complex numbers,

31:47.480 --> 31:51.440
 to every possible configuration

31:51.440 --> 31:53.680
 that you could see a system in on measuring it.

31:53.680 --> 31:57.040
 So for example, you might say that an electron

31:57.040 --> 31:59.760
 has some amplitude for being here

31:59.760 --> 32:02.600
 and some other amplitude for being there, right?

32:02.600 --> 32:05.080
 Now, if you look to see where it is,

32:05.080 --> 32:06.800
 you will localize it, right?

32:06.800 --> 32:09.480
 You will sort of force the amplitudes

32:09.480 --> 32:12.560
 to be converted into probabilities.

32:12.560 --> 32:15.360
 That happens by taking their squared absolute value.

32:15.360 --> 32:19.840
 Okay, and then, you know, you can say

32:19.840 --> 32:22.960
 either the electron will be here or it will be there.

32:22.960 --> 32:24.560
 You know, knowing the amplitudes,

32:24.560 --> 32:26.920
 you can predict at least the probabilities

32:26.920 --> 32:30.240
 that you'll see each possible outcome, okay?

32:30.240 --> 32:32.880
 But while a system is isolated

32:32.880 --> 32:35.000
 from the whole rest of the universe,

32:35.000 --> 32:36.680
 the rest of its environment,

32:36.680 --> 32:39.160
 the amplitudes can change in time

32:39.160 --> 32:41.720
 by rules that are different

32:41.720 --> 32:44.760
 from the normal rules of probability

32:44.760 --> 32:47.840
 and that are, you know, alien to our everyday experience.

32:47.840 --> 32:50.680
 So anytime anyone ever tells you anything

32:50.680 --> 32:53.280
 about the weirdness of the quantum world, you know,

32:53.280 --> 32:56.240
 or assuming that they're not lying to you, right?

32:56.240 --> 32:58.000
 They are telling you, you know,

32:58.000 --> 33:00.440
 yet another consequence of nature

33:00.440 --> 33:03.360
 being described by these amplitudes.

33:03.360 --> 33:06.120
 So most famously, what amplitudes can do

33:06.120 --> 33:08.360
 is that they can interfere with each other, okay?

33:08.360 --> 33:11.560
 So in the famous double slit experiment,

33:11.560 --> 33:13.840
 what happens is that you shoot a particle,

33:13.840 --> 33:15.520
 like an electron, let's say,

33:15.520 --> 33:17.800
 at a screen with two slits in it,

33:17.800 --> 33:21.240
 and you find that they're, you know, on a second screen,

33:21.240 --> 33:22.920
 now there are certain places

33:22.920 --> 33:25.600
 where that electron will never end up, you know,

33:25.600 --> 33:29.640
 after it passes through the first screen.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.680
 And yet, if I close off one of the slits,

33:32.680 --> 33:35.560
 then the electron can appear in that place, okay?

33:35.560 --> 33:38.280
 So by decreasing the number of paths

33:38.280 --> 33:40.800
 that the electron could take to get somewhere,

33:40.800 --> 33:43.520
 you can increase the chance that it gets there, okay?

33:43.520 --> 33:45.400
 Now, how is that possible?

33:45.400 --> 33:48.840
 Well, it's because, you know, as we would say now,

33:48.840 --> 33:51.880
 the electron has a superposition state, okay?

33:51.880 --> 33:55.120
 It has some amplitude for reaching this point

33:55.120 --> 33:57.880
 by going through the first slit.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.960
 It has some other amplitude for reaching it

33:59.960 --> 34:01.800
 by going through the second slit.

34:01.800 --> 34:04.080
 But now if one amplitude is positive

34:04.080 --> 34:05.800
 and the other one is negative,

34:05.800 --> 34:08.160
 then I have to add them all up, right?

34:08.160 --> 34:10.880
 I have to add the amplitudes for every path

34:10.880 --> 34:13.880
 that the electron could have taken to reach this point.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.800
 And those amplitudes,

34:15.800 --> 34:17.920
 if they're pointing in different directions,

34:17.920 --> 34:19.840
 they can cancel each other out.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.200
 That would mean the total amplitude is zero,

34:22.200 --> 34:24.360
 and the thing never happens at all.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.480
 I close off one of the possibilities,

34:26.480 --> 34:28.960
 then the amplitude is positive or it's negative,

34:28.960 --> 34:30.600
 and now the thing can happen.

34:30.600 --> 34:34.200
 Okay, so that is sort of the one trick of quantum mechanics.

34:34.200 --> 34:37.200
 And now I can tell you what a quantum computer is, okay?

34:37.200 --> 34:41.360
 A quantum computer is a computer

34:41.360 --> 34:43.480
 that tries to exploit, you know,

34:43.480 --> 34:45.760
 these exactly these phenomena,

34:45.760 --> 34:49.240
 superposition, amplitudes and interference

34:49.240 --> 34:52.360
 in order to solve certain problems much faster

34:52.360 --> 34:54.560
 than we know how to solve them otherwise.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.040
 So it's the basic building block of a quantum computer

34:57.040 --> 35:00.240
 is what we call a quantum bit or a qubit.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.640
 That just means a bit that has some amplitude

35:02.640 --> 35:06.160
 for being zero and some other amplitude for being one.

35:06.160 --> 35:09.520
 So it's a superposition of zero and one states, right?

35:09.520 --> 35:12.600
 But now the key point is that if I've got,

35:12.600 --> 35:15.040
 let's say a thousand qubits,

35:15.040 --> 35:18.360
 the rules of quantum mechanics are completely unequivocal

35:18.360 --> 35:20.560
 that I do not just need one amplitude,

35:20.560 --> 35:22.880
 you know, I don't just need amplitudes for each qubit

35:22.880 --> 35:24.000
 separately, okay?

35:24.000 --> 35:28.480
 In general, I need an amplitude for every possible setting

35:28.480 --> 35:31.040
 of all thousand of those bits, okay?

35:31.040 --> 35:35.160
 So that what that means is two to the 1000 power amplitudes.

35:35.160 --> 35:37.880
 Okay, if I had to write those down,

35:37.880 --> 35:40.720
 let's say in the memory of a conventional computer,

35:40.720 --> 35:44.040
 if I had to write down two to the 1000 complex numbers,

35:44.040 --> 35:47.680
 that would not fit within the entire observable universe.

35:47.680 --> 35:51.160
 Okay, and yet, you know, quantum mechanics is unequivocal

35:51.160 --> 35:54.160
 that if these qubits can all interact with each other,

35:54.160 --> 35:58.320
 and in some sense, I need two to the 1000 parameters,

35:58.320 --> 36:01.480
 you know, amplitudes to describe what is going on.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.920
 Now, you know, now I can tell, you know,

36:03.920 --> 36:06.480
 where all the popular articles, you know,

36:06.480 --> 36:09.760
 about quantum computing go off the rails is that they say,

36:09.760 --> 36:12.240
 you know, they sort of say what I just said,

36:12.240 --> 36:14.960
 then they say, oh, so the way a quantum computer works

36:14.960 --> 36:18.200
 is just by trying every possible answer in parallel.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.360
 So, you know, that sounds too good to be true.

36:21.360 --> 36:24.960
 And unfortunately, it kind of is too good to be true.

36:24.960 --> 36:28.320
 The problem is I could make a superposition

36:28.320 --> 36:31.600
 over every possible answer to my problem, you know,

36:31.600 --> 36:34.320
 even if there are two to the 1000 of them, right?

36:34.320 --> 36:36.120
 I can easily do that.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.520
 The trouble is for a computer to be useful,

36:38.520 --> 36:40.640
 you've got, at some point, you've got to look at it

36:40.640 --> 36:42.720
 and see an output, right?

36:42.720 --> 36:45.040
 And if I just measure a superposition

36:45.040 --> 36:47.080
 over every possible answer,

36:47.080 --> 36:49.000
 then the rules of quantum mechanics tell me

36:49.000 --> 36:51.680
 that all I'll see will be a random answer.

36:51.680 --> 36:53.360
 You know, if I just wanted a random answer,

36:53.360 --> 36:54.800
 well, I could have picked one myself

36:54.800 --> 36:56.640
 with a lot less trouble, right?

36:56.640 --> 37:00.280
 So the entire trick with quantum computing,

37:00.280 --> 37:03.000
 with every algorithm for a quantum computer,

37:03.000 --> 37:06.000
 is that you try to choreograph a pattern

37:06.000 --> 37:08.600
 of interference of amplitudes.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.680
 And you try to do it so that for each wrong answer,

37:11.680 --> 37:14.280
 some of the paths leading to that wrong answer

37:14.280 --> 37:18.120
 have positive amplitudes and others have negative amplitudes.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.760
 So on the whole, they cancel each other out, okay?

37:20.760 --> 37:23.600
 Whereas all the paths leading to the right answer

37:23.600 --> 37:25.800
 should reinforce each other, you know,

37:25.800 --> 37:28.240
 should have amplitudes pointing the same direction.

37:28.240 --> 37:30.800
 So the design of algorithms in this space

37:30.800 --> 37:33.280
 is the choreography of the interferences.

37:33.280 --> 37:35.280
 Precisely, that's precisely what it is.

37:35.280 --> 37:39.960
 Can we take a brief step back and you mentioned information.

37:39.960 --> 37:40.800
 Yes.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.360
 So in which part of this beautiful picture

37:43.360 --> 37:46.800
 that you've painted is information contained?

37:46.800 --> 37:49.000
 Oh, well, information is at the core

37:49.000 --> 37:51.160
 of everything that we've been talking about, right?

37:51.160 --> 37:53.120
 I mean, the bit is, you know,

37:53.120 --> 37:55.440
 the basic unit of information,

37:55.440 --> 37:59.120
 since, you know, Colad Shannon's paper in 1948.

37:59.120 --> 38:00.120
 You know, and, you know, of course,

38:00.120 --> 38:02.360
 you know, people had the concept even before that.

38:02.360 --> 38:05.320
 You know, he popularized the name, right?

38:05.320 --> 38:06.160
 But I mean.

38:06.160 --> 38:07.920
 But a bit is zero or one.

38:07.920 --> 38:08.760
 That's right.

38:08.760 --> 38:09.600
 So that's the basic answer.

38:09.600 --> 38:11.880
 And what we would say is that the basic unit

38:11.880 --> 38:14.680
 of quantum information is the qubit,

38:14.680 --> 38:17.120
 is, you know, the object, any object

38:17.120 --> 38:21.000
 that can be maintained and manipulated

38:21.000 --> 38:24.160
 in a superposition of zero and one states.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.160
 Now, you know, sometimes people ask,

38:26.160 --> 38:29.160
 well, but what is a qubit physically, right?

38:29.160 --> 38:32.400
 And there are all these different, you know,

38:32.400 --> 38:34.840
 proposals that are being pursued in parallel

38:34.840 --> 38:37.040
 for how you implement qubits.

38:37.040 --> 38:39.800
 There is, you know, superconducting quantum computing

38:39.800 --> 38:41.560
 that was in the news recently

38:41.560 --> 38:45.080
 because of Google's quantum supremacy experiment, right?

38:45.080 --> 38:49.600
 Where you would have some little coils

38:49.600 --> 38:52.360
 where a current can flow through them

38:52.360 --> 38:54.440
 in two different energy states.

38:54.440 --> 38:57.680
 One representing a zero, another representing a one.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.360
 And if you cool these coils

38:59.360 --> 39:02.320
 to just slightly above absolute zero,

39:02.320 --> 39:05.600
 like a hundredth of a degree, then they superconduct.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.440
 And then the current can actually be

39:07.440 --> 39:10.760
 in a superposition of the two different states.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.440
 So that's one kind of qubit.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.600
 Another kind would be, you know,

39:14.600 --> 39:17.840
 just an individual atomic nucleus, right?

39:17.840 --> 39:19.080
 It has a spin.

39:19.080 --> 39:21.160
 It could be spinning clockwise.

39:21.160 --> 39:23.240
 It could be spinning counterclockwise.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.120
 Or it could be in a superposition of the two spin states.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.680
 That is another qubit.

39:27.680 --> 39:30.360
 But so just like in the classical world, right?

39:30.360 --> 39:32.920
 You could be a virtuoso programmer

39:32.920 --> 39:36.480
 without having any idea of what a transistor is, right?

39:36.480 --> 39:39.080
 Or how the bits are physically represented

39:39.080 --> 39:40.440
 inside the machine,

39:40.440 --> 39:43.320
 even that the machine uses electricity, right?

39:43.320 --> 39:45.080
 You just care about the logic.

39:45.080 --> 39:47.320
 It's sort of the same with quantum computing, right?

39:47.320 --> 39:49.000
 Cubits could be realized

39:49.000 --> 39:51.440
 by many, many different quantum systems.

39:51.440 --> 39:54.520
 And yet all of those systems will lead to the same logic,

39:54.520 --> 39:58.680
 you know, the logic of qubits and how, you know,

39:58.680 --> 40:01.560
 how you measure them, how you change them over time.

40:01.560 --> 40:04.040
 And so, you know, the subject of, you know,

40:04.040 --> 40:07.520
 how qubits behave and what you can do with qubits,

40:07.520 --> 40:09.320
 that is quantum information.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.000
 So just to linger on that.

40:11.000 --> 40:11.840
 Sure.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.640
 So the physical design implementation of a qubit

40:15.600 --> 40:20.600
 does not interfere with that next level of abstraction

40:20.880 --> 40:22.520
 that you can program over it.

40:22.520 --> 40:27.120
 So it truly is, the idea of it is, is it okay?

40:27.120 --> 40:28.840
 Well, to be honest with you,

40:28.840 --> 40:30.840
 today they do interfere with each other.

40:30.840 --> 40:33.880
 That's because all the quantum computers we can build today

40:33.880 --> 40:35.480
 are very noisy, right?

40:35.480 --> 40:37.920
 And so sort of the, you know,

40:37.920 --> 40:41.040
 the qubits are very far from perfect.

40:41.040 --> 40:44.080
 And so the lower level sort of does affect the higher levels

40:44.080 --> 40:46.640
 and we sort of have to think about all of them at once.

40:46.640 --> 40:49.320
 Okay, but eventually where we hope to get

40:49.320 --> 40:52.640
 is to what are called error corrected quantum computers

40:52.640 --> 40:54.680
 where the qubits really do behave

40:54.680 --> 40:58.920
 like perfect abstract qubits for as long as we want them to.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.680
 And in that future, you know, the, you know,

41:01.680 --> 41:05.080
 a future that we can already sort of prove theorems about

41:05.080 --> 41:08.440
 or think about today, but in that future,

41:08.440 --> 41:11.280
 the logic of it really does become decoupled

41:11.280 --> 41:12.120
 from the hardware.

41:12.120 --> 41:16.360
 So if noise is currently like the biggest problem

41:16.360 --> 41:18.360
 for quantum computing,

41:18.360 --> 41:23.160
 and then the dream is error correcting quantum computers,

41:23.160 --> 41:26.760
 can you just maybe describe what does it mean

41:26.760 --> 41:28.880
 for there to be noise in the system?

41:28.880 --> 41:29.840
 Absolutely.

41:29.840 --> 41:32.680
 So yeah, so the problem is even a little more specific

41:32.680 --> 41:35.400
 than noise, so that the fundamental problem,

41:35.400 --> 41:38.480
 if you're trying to actually build a quantum computer,

41:38.480 --> 41:41.320
 you know, of any appreciable size

41:41.320 --> 41:43.840
 is something called decoherence.

41:43.840 --> 41:46.400
 Okay, and this was recognized from the very beginning,

41:46.400 --> 41:48.600
 you know, when people first started thinking about this

41:48.600 --> 41:50.080
 in the 1990s.

41:50.080 --> 41:54.040
 Now, what decoherence means is sort of the unwanted

41:54.040 --> 41:57.280
 interaction between, you know, your qubits, you know,

41:57.280 --> 41:59.360
 the state of your quantum computer

41:59.360 --> 42:01.240
 and the external environment.

42:01.240 --> 42:03.240
 Okay, and why is that such a problem?

42:03.240 --> 42:05.360
 Well, I talked before about how, you know,

42:05.360 --> 42:07.840
 when you measure a quantum system,

42:07.840 --> 42:11.200
 so let's say if I measure a qubit that's in a superposition

42:11.200 --> 42:13.160
 of zero and one states to ask it, you know,

42:13.160 --> 42:14.880
 are you zero or are you one?

42:14.880 --> 42:17.240
 Well, now I force it to make up its mind, right?

42:17.240 --> 42:21.000
 And now, probabilistically, it chooses one or the other.

42:21.000 --> 42:23.480
 And now, you know, it's no longer a superposition,

42:23.480 --> 42:25.240
 there's no longer amplitudes.

42:25.240 --> 42:27.720
 There's just, there's some probability that I get a zero

42:27.720 --> 42:29.320
 and there's some that I get a one.

42:30.320 --> 42:35.400
 And now, the trouble is that it doesn't have to be me

42:35.400 --> 42:36.240
 who's looking.

42:36.240 --> 42:39.240
 Okay, or in fact, it doesn't have to be any conscious entity.

42:40.480 --> 42:44.360
 Any kind of interaction with the external world

42:44.360 --> 42:48.360
 that leaks out the information about whether this qubit

42:48.360 --> 42:52.560
 was a zero or a one, sort of that causes the zeroness

42:52.560 --> 42:56.360
 or the oneness of the qubit to be recorded in, you know,

42:56.360 --> 43:00.600
 the radiation in the room, in the molecules of the air,

43:00.600 --> 43:04.920
 in the wires that are connected to my device, any of that.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.160
 As soon as the information leaks out,

43:08.160 --> 43:11.160
 it is as if that qubit has been measured, okay?

43:11.160 --> 43:15.280
 It is, you know, the state has now collapsed.

43:15.280 --> 43:17.800
 You know, another way to say it is that it's become entangled

43:17.800 --> 43:19.480
 with its environment, okay?

43:19.480 --> 43:21.960
 But, you know, from the perspective of someone

43:21.960 --> 43:23.600
 who's just looking at this qubit,

43:23.600 --> 43:26.880
 it is as though it has lost its quantum state.

43:26.880 --> 43:29.880
 And so what this means is that if I want to do

43:29.880 --> 43:33.680
 a quantum computation, I have to keep the qubits

43:33.680 --> 43:37.600
 sort of fanatically well isolated from their environment.

43:37.600 --> 43:40.480
 But then at the same time, they can't be perfectly isolated

43:40.480 --> 43:42.680
 because I need to tell them what to do.

43:42.680 --> 43:45.960
 I need to make them interact with each other for one thing.

43:45.960 --> 43:49.840
 And not only that, but in a precisely choreographed way.

43:49.840 --> 43:53.520
 Okay, and, you know, that is such a staggering problem, right?

43:53.520 --> 43:56.440
 How do I isolate these qubits from the whole universe,

43:56.440 --> 43:58.880
 but then also tell them exactly what to do?

43:58.880 --> 44:01.520
 I mean, you know, there were distinguished physicists

44:01.520 --> 44:04.360
 and computer scientists in the 90s

44:04.360 --> 44:07.160
 who said this is fundamentally impossible, you know?

44:07.160 --> 44:10.680
 The laws of physics will just never let you control qubits

44:10.680 --> 44:14.240
 to the degree of accuracy that you're talking about.

44:14.240 --> 44:17.680
 Now, what changed the views of most of us

44:17.680 --> 44:22.280
 was a profound discovery in the mid to late 90s,

44:22.280 --> 44:25.440
 which was called the theory of quantum error correction

44:25.440 --> 44:27.400
 and quantum fault tolerance.

44:27.400 --> 44:29.760
 Okay, and the upshot of that theory

44:29.760 --> 44:33.560
 is that if I want to build a reliable quantum computer

44:33.560 --> 44:36.480
 and scale it up to, you know, an arbitrary number

44:36.480 --> 44:38.680
 of as many qubits as I want, you know,

44:38.680 --> 44:41.280
 and doing as much on them as I want,

44:41.280 --> 44:43.600
 I do not actually have to get the qubits

44:43.600 --> 44:46.160
 perfectly isolated from their environment.

44:46.160 --> 44:49.720
 It is enough to get them really, really, really well isolated.

44:49.720 --> 44:54.720
 Okay, and even if every qubit is sort of leaking,

44:54.720 --> 44:57.920
 you know, its state into the environment at some rate,

44:57.920 --> 45:00.280
 as long as that rate is low enough,

45:00.280 --> 45:03.680
 okay, I can sort of encode the information

45:03.680 --> 45:06.720
 that I care about in very clever ways

45:06.720 --> 45:10.040
 across the collective states of multiple qubits.

45:10.040 --> 45:12.480
 Okay, in such a way that even if, you know,

45:12.480 --> 45:15.120
 a small percentage of my qubits leak,

45:15.120 --> 45:17.000
 well, I'm constantly monitoring them

45:17.000 --> 45:18.520
 to see if that leak happened.

45:18.520 --> 45:21.080
 I can detect it and I can correct it.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.440
 I can recover the information I care about

45:23.440 --> 45:25.520
 from the remaining qubits, okay?

45:25.520 --> 45:30.360
 And so, you know, you can build a reliable quantum computer

45:30.360 --> 45:32.840
 even out of unreliable parts, right?

45:32.840 --> 45:35.840
 Now the, in some sense, you know,

45:35.840 --> 45:39.160
 that discovery is what set the engineering agenda

45:39.160 --> 45:41.120
 for quantum computing research

45:41.120 --> 45:43.760
 from the 1990s until the present, okay?

45:43.760 --> 45:46.760
 The goal has been, you know, engineer qubits

45:46.760 --> 45:49.080
 that are not perfectly reliable,

45:49.080 --> 45:52.000
 but reliable enough that you can then use

45:52.000 --> 45:56.280
 these error correcting codes to have them simulate qubits

45:56.280 --> 45:59.120
 that are even more reliable than they are, right?

45:59.120 --> 46:01.120
 The error correction becomes a net win

46:01.120 --> 46:02.960
 rather than a net loss, right?

46:02.960 --> 46:05.960
 And then once you reach that sort of crossover point,

46:05.960 --> 46:09.120
 then, you know, your simulated qubits could in turn

46:09.120 --> 46:11.640
 simulate qubits that are even more reliable

46:11.640 --> 46:13.760
 and so on until you've just, you know,

46:13.760 --> 46:17.160
 effectively you have arbitrarily reliable qubits.

46:17.160 --> 46:20.840
 So long story short, we are not at that break even point yet.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.720
 We're a hell of a lot closer than we were

46:22.720 --> 46:24.840
 when people started doing this in the 90s,

46:24.840 --> 46:26.480
 like orders of magnitude closer.

46:26.480 --> 46:30.160
 But the key ingredient there is the more qubits, the better.

46:30.160 --> 46:31.120
 Because...

46:31.120 --> 46:32.240
 Well, the more qubits,

46:32.240 --> 46:35.200
 the larger the computation you can do, right?

46:35.200 --> 46:38.240
 I mean, I mean, a qubits are what constitute

46:38.240 --> 46:40.480
 the memory of your quantum computer, right?

46:40.480 --> 46:43.480
 But also for the error correcting mechanism.

46:43.480 --> 46:44.320
 Yes.

46:44.320 --> 46:47.400
 So the way I would say it is that error correction

46:47.400 --> 46:50.400
 imposes an overhead in the number of qubits.

46:50.400 --> 46:53.520
 And that is actually one of the biggest practical problems

46:53.520 --> 46:55.720
 with building a scalable quantum computer.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.200
 If you look at the error correcting codes,

46:58.200 --> 47:00.560
 at least the ones that we know about today,

47:00.560 --> 47:02.760
 and you look at, you know, what would it take

47:02.760 --> 47:04.640
 to actually use a quantum computer

47:04.640 --> 47:09.320
 to, you know, hack your credit card number,

47:09.320 --> 47:10.680
 which is, you know, maybe, you know,

47:10.680 --> 47:13.360
 the most famous application people talk about, right?

47:13.360 --> 47:15.360
 Let's say to factor huge numbers

47:15.360 --> 47:18.040
 and thereby break the RSA cryptosystem.

47:18.040 --> 47:21.600
 Well, what that would take would be thousands of,

47:21.600 --> 47:24.200
 several thousand logical qubits.

47:24.200 --> 47:26.640
 But now with the known error correcting codes,

47:26.640 --> 47:30.160
 each of those logical qubits would need to be encoded itself

47:30.160 --> 47:32.440
 using thousands of physical qubits.

47:32.440 --> 47:33.280
 So at that point,

47:33.280 --> 47:35.960
 you're talking about millions of physical qubits.

47:35.960 --> 47:36.800
 And in some sense,

47:36.800 --> 47:39.720
 that is the reason why quantum computers are not breaking

47:39.720 --> 47:40.960
 cryptography already.

47:40.960 --> 47:43.920
 It's because of these immense overheads involved.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.480
 So that overhead is additive or multiplicative?

47:46.480 --> 47:47.600
 Well, it's multiplicative.

47:47.600 --> 47:51.960
 I mean, it's like you take the number of logical qubits

47:51.960 --> 47:54.520
 that you need in your abstract quantum circuit,

47:54.520 --> 47:56.840
 you multiply it by a thousand or so.

47:56.840 --> 47:58.960
 So, you know, there's a lot of work on, you know,

47:58.960 --> 48:02.520
 inventing better, trying to invent better error correcting codes.

48:02.520 --> 48:04.320
 Okay, that is the situation right now.

48:04.320 --> 48:09.320
 In the meantime, we are now in what the physicist John Preskell

48:09.520 --> 48:13.680
 called the noisy intermediate scale quantum or NISC era.

48:13.680 --> 48:16.320
 And this is the era, you can think of it as sort of like

48:16.320 --> 48:17.160
 the vacuum, you know,

48:17.160 --> 48:20.440
 we're now entering the very early vacuum tube era

48:20.440 --> 48:21.880
 of quantum computers.

48:21.880 --> 48:24.800
 The quantum computer analog of the transistor

48:24.800 --> 48:26.600
 has not been invented yet, right?

48:26.600 --> 48:29.200
 That would be like true error correction, right?

48:29.200 --> 48:31.600
 Where, you know, we are not or something else

48:31.600 --> 48:33.560
 that would achieve the same effect, right?

48:33.560 --> 48:35.480
 We are not there yet.

48:35.480 --> 48:38.760
 And, but where we are now, let's say,

48:38.760 --> 48:40.560
 as of a few months ago, you know,

48:40.560 --> 48:43.720
 as of Google's announcement of quantum supremacy,

48:43.720 --> 48:45.800
 you know, we are now finally at the point

48:45.800 --> 48:49.360
 where even with a non error corrected quantum computer

48:49.360 --> 48:51.400
 with, you know, these noisy devices,

48:51.400 --> 48:53.880
 we can do something that is hard

48:53.880 --> 48:56.520
 for classical computers to simulate, okay?

48:56.520 --> 48:58.720
 So we can eke out some advantage.

48:58.720 --> 49:02.280
 Now, will we in this noisy era be able to do something

49:02.280 --> 49:04.320
 beyond what a classical computer can do

49:04.320 --> 49:06.520
 that is also useful to someone?

49:06.520 --> 49:07.800
 That we still don't know.

49:07.800 --> 49:10.560
 People are going to be racing over the next decade

49:10.560 --> 49:12.120
 to try to do that by people.

49:12.120 --> 49:14.960
 I mean, Google, IBM, you know,

49:14.960 --> 49:17.600
 a bunch of startup companies and, you know,

49:17.600 --> 49:18.640
 and research labs.

49:18.640 --> 49:22.640
 Yeah, and research labs and governments and, yeah.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.120
 You just mentioned a million things.

49:24.120 --> 49:25.720
 Well, I'll backtrack for a second.

49:25.720 --> 49:27.240
 Yeah, sure, sure.

49:27.240 --> 49:29.640
 So we're in these vacuum tube days.

49:29.640 --> 49:30.480
 Yeah.

49:30.480 --> 49:31.320
 Just entering them.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.640
 And just entering.

49:32.640 --> 49:33.480
 Wow, okay.

49:33.480 --> 49:36.440
 So how do we escape the vacuum?

49:36.440 --> 49:41.120
 So how do we get to, how do we get to where we are now

49:41.120 --> 49:42.320
 with the CPU?

49:42.320 --> 49:44.800
 Is this a fundamental engineering challenge?

49:44.800 --> 49:49.240
 Is there breakthroughs on the physics side

49:49.240 --> 49:53.160
 that are needed on the computer science side?

49:53.160 --> 49:56.200
 What's, is there, is it a financial issue

49:56.200 --> 49:59.600
 where much larger just sheer investment

49:59.600 --> 50:01.200
 and excitement is needed?

50:01.200 --> 50:03.840
 So, you know, those are excellent questions.

50:03.840 --> 50:08.840
 My guess, my guess would be all of the above.

50:09.400 --> 50:12.440
 I mean, my guess, you know, I mean, you know,

50:12.440 --> 50:14.960
 you could say fundamentally it is an engineering issue,

50:14.960 --> 50:15.800
 right?

50:15.800 --> 50:18.160
 The theory has been in place since the 90s.

50:18.160 --> 50:20.480
 You know, at least, you know, you know,

50:20.480 --> 50:23.480
 this is what, you know, error correction would look like,

50:23.480 --> 50:25.560
 you know, we do not have the hardware

50:25.560 --> 50:28.520
 that is at that level, but at the same time, you know,

50:28.520 --> 50:32.400
 so you could just, you know, try to power through,

50:32.400 --> 50:34.360
 you know, maybe even like, you know,

50:34.360 --> 50:36.640
 if someone spent a trillion dollars

50:36.640 --> 50:39.560
 on some quantum computing Manhattan project, right?

50:39.560 --> 50:43.080
 Then conceivably, they could just, you know,

50:43.080 --> 50:46.600
 build an error corrected quantum computer

50:46.600 --> 50:49.680
 as it was envisioned back in the 90s, right?

50:49.680 --> 50:52.560
 I think the more plausible thing to happen

50:52.560 --> 50:55.600
 is that there will be further theoretical breakthroughs

50:55.600 --> 50:57.480
 and there will be further insights

50:57.480 --> 51:00.080
 that will cut down the cost of doing this.

51:00.080 --> 51:03.080
 So let's take a brief step to the philosophical.

51:03.080 --> 51:05.520
 I just recently talked to Jim Keller,

51:05.520 --> 51:09.760
 who's sort of like the famed architect

51:09.760 --> 51:12.280
 in the microprocessor world.

51:12.280 --> 51:17.200
 And he's been told for decades every year

51:17.200 --> 51:20.560
 that the Moore's law is going to die this year.

51:20.560 --> 51:25.200
 And he tries to argue that the Moore's law is still alive

51:25.200 --> 51:28.480
 and well, and it'll be alive for quite a long time to come.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.320
 How long?

51:29.320 --> 51:30.160
 How long did he say?

51:30.160 --> 51:33.840
 Well, he's, the main point is it's still alive,

51:33.840 --> 51:38.160
 but he thinks there's still a thousand X improvement

51:38.160 --> 51:41.080
 just on shrinking the transition, that's possible.

51:41.080 --> 51:44.520
 Whatever, the point is that the exponential growth

51:44.520 --> 51:49.520
 we see it is actually a huge number of these S curves,

51:49.840 --> 51:53.840
 just constant breakthroughs at the philosophical level.

51:53.840 --> 51:58.160
 Why do you think we as a descendants of apes

51:58.160 --> 52:00.680
 were able to just keep coming up

52:00.680 --> 52:03.640
 with these new breakthroughs on the CPU side?

52:03.640 --> 52:07.160
 Is this something unique to this particular endeavor

52:07.160 --> 52:09.840
 or will it be possible to replicate

52:09.840 --> 52:11.840
 in the quantum computer space?

52:11.840 --> 52:13.920
 Okay, all right, there was a lot there

52:13.920 --> 52:17.840
 to break off something.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.120
 I mean, I think we are in an extremely special period

52:21.120 --> 52:22.640
 of human history, right?

52:22.640 --> 52:26.560
 I mean, it is, you could say obviously special,

52:26.560 --> 52:28.400
 in many ways, right?

52:28.400 --> 52:33.400
 There are way more people alive than there have been

52:33.600 --> 52:38.600
 and the whole future of the planet is in question

52:41.840 --> 52:46.840
 in a way that it hasn't been for the rest of human history.

52:47.360 --> 52:51.240
 But in particular, we are in the era

52:51.240 --> 52:55.160
 where we finally figured out how to build

52:55.160 --> 52:58.880
 universal machines, you could say,

52:58.880 --> 53:00.680
 the things that we call computers,

53:00.680 --> 53:04.960
 machines that you program to simulate the behavior

53:04.960 --> 53:06.880
 of whatever machine you want.

53:10.960 --> 53:13.640
 And once you've sort of crossed this threshold

53:13.640 --> 53:16.800
 of universality, you could say,

53:16.800 --> 53:21.000
 you've instantiated touring machines in the physical world,

53:21.000 --> 53:24.120
 well, then the main questions are ones of numbers.

53:24.120 --> 53:29.120
 They are ones of how much memory can you access,

53:29.680 --> 53:33.520
 how fast does it run, how many parallel processors,

53:33.520 --> 53:35.000
 at least until quantum computing.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.480
 Quantum computing is the one thing

53:36.480 --> 53:38.760
 that changes what I just said, right?

53:38.760 --> 53:42.560
 But as long as it's classical computing,

53:42.560 --> 53:44.800
 then it's all questions of numbers.

53:44.800 --> 53:48.880
 And you could say at a theoretical level,

53:48.880 --> 53:51.440
 the computers that we have today are the same

53:51.440 --> 53:52.840
 as the ones in the 50s.

53:52.840 --> 53:55.720
 They're just millions of times faster

53:55.720 --> 53:57.360
 with millions of times more memory.

53:57.360 --> 54:01.600
 And I think there's been an immense economic pressure

54:01.600 --> 54:04.920
 to get more and more transistors,

54:04.920 --> 54:06.760
 get them smaller and smaller,

54:06.760 --> 54:09.080
 get you add more and more cores.

54:09.080 --> 54:14.080
 And in some sense, a huge fraction of sort of

54:14.880 --> 54:18.000
 all of the technological progress that there is

54:18.000 --> 54:20.760
 in all of civilization has gotten concentrated

54:20.760 --> 54:24.920
 just more narrowly into just those problems, right?

54:24.920 --> 54:29.560
 And so, it has been one of the biggest success stories

54:29.560 --> 54:31.440
 in the history of technology, right?

54:31.440 --> 54:34.800
 There's, I mean, it is, I am as amazed by it

54:34.800 --> 54:36.760
 as anyone else is, right?

54:36.760 --> 54:40.880
 But at the same time, we also know that it,

54:40.880 --> 54:45.480
 and I really do mean we know

54:45.480 --> 54:48.520
 that it cannot continue indefinitely, okay?

54:48.520 --> 54:52.280
 Because you will reach fundamental limits

54:52.280 --> 54:56.840
 on how small you can possibly make a processor.

54:56.840 --> 54:59.080
 And if you want a real proof,

54:59.080 --> 55:01.400
 that would justify my use of the word,

55:01.400 --> 55:04.240
 we know that Moore's law has to end.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.360
 I mean, ultimately, you will reach the limits

55:06.360 --> 55:08.120
 imposed by quantum gravity.

55:09.160 --> 55:12.680
 If you were doing, if you tried to build a computer

55:12.680 --> 55:15.760
 that operated at 10 to the 43 Hertz,

55:15.760 --> 55:18.720
 so did 10 to the 43 operations per second,

55:18.720 --> 55:20.920
 that computer would use so much energy

55:20.920 --> 55:24.400
 that it would simply collapse to a black hole, okay?

55:24.400 --> 55:28.640
 So, in reality, we're going to reach the limits

55:28.640 --> 55:32.000
 long before that, but that is a sufficient proof.

55:32.000 --> 55:33.440
 That there's a limit.

55:33.440 --> 55:34.680
 Yes, yes.

55:35.920 --> 55:38.320
 But it would be interesting to try to understand

55:38.320 --> 55:40.920
 the mechanism, the economic pressure that you said,

55:40.920 --> 55:43.920
 just like the Cold War was a pressure

55:43.920 --> 55:46.960
 on getting us, getting us,

55:46.960 --> 55:49.760
 because my us is both the Soviet Union

55:49.760 --> 55:52.760
 and the United States, but getting us,

55:52.760 --> 55:55.880
 the two countries to hurry up, to get the space,

55:55.880 --> 55:58.200
 to the moon, there seems to be that same kind

55:58.200 --> 56:01.080
 of economic pressure that somehow created

56:01.080 --> 56:03.760
 a chain of engineering breakthroughs

56:03.760 --> 56:06.200
 that resulted in the Moore's law.

56:06.200 --> 56:07.560
 And it'd be nice to replicate.

56:07.560 --> 56:11.520
 Yeah, I mean, some people are sort of get depressed

56:11.520 --> 56:15.000
 about the fact that technological progress

56:15.000 --> 56:18.160
 may seem to have slowed down in many, many realms

56:18.160 --> 56:20.240
 outside of computing, right?

56:20.240 --> 56:21.440
 And there was this whole thing of,

56:21.440 --> 56:25.400
 we wanted flying cars and we only got Twitter instead, right?

56:25.400 --> 56:27.560
 Yeah, good old Peter Teal, yeah.

56:27.560 --> 56:28.960
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

56:28.960 --> 56:32.200
 So, then jumping to another really interesting topic

56:32.200 --> 56:36.520
 that you mentioned, so Google announced

56:36.520 --> 56:39.320
 with their work in the paper in nature

56:39.320 --> 56:42.920
 with Quantum Supremacy, can you describe again,

56:42.920 --> 56:46.360
 back to the basic, what is, perhaps not so basic,

56:46.360 --> 56:48.040
 what is Quantum Supremacy?

56:48.040 --> 56:49.120
 Absolutely.

56:49.120 --> 56:53.160
 So, Quantum Supremacy is a term that was coined by,

56:53.160 --> 56:56.720
 again, by John Preskell in 2012.

56:57.640 --> 56:59.960
 Not everyone likes the name, you know,

56:59.960 --> 57:04.360
 but it's sort of stuck, you know,

57:04.360 --> 57:08.320
 we sort of haven't found a better alternative.

57:08.320 --> 57:10.560
 It's technically Quantum Computational Supremacy.

57:10.560 --> 57:12.560
 Yeah, yeah, Supremacy, that's right, that's right.

57:12.560 --> 57:16.360
 But the basic idea is actually one that goes all the way back

57:16.360 --> 57:18.600
 to the beginnings of Quantum Computing

57:18.600 --> 57:21.560
 when Richard Feynman and David Deutsch, people like that,

57:21.560 --> 57:23.800
 were talking about it in the early 80s.

57:23.800 --> 57:27.600
 And Quantum Supremacy just refers to

57:27.600 --> 57:29.760
 sort of the point in history

57:29.760 --> 57:32.520
 when you can first use a Quantum computer

57:32.520 --> 57:36.520
 to do some well defined task much faster

57:36.520 --> 57:39.320
 than any known algorithm running on any

57:39.320 --> 57:42.240
 of the classical computers that are available, okay?

57:42.240 --> 57:46.320
 So, you know, notice that I did not say a useful task, okay?

57:46.320 --> 57:49.080
 You know, it could be something completely artificial,

57:49.080 --> 57:51.880
 but it's important that the task be well defined.

57:51.880 --> 57:54.400
 So in other words, you know, it is something

57:54.400 --> 57:56.840
 that has right and wrong answers, you know,

57:56.840 --> 58:00.560
 and that are knowable independently of this device, right?

58:00.560 --> 58:02.520
 And we can then, you know, run the device,

58:02.520 --> 58:04.480
 see if it gets the right answer or not.

58:04.480 --> 58:06.080
 Can you clarify a small point?

58:06.080 --> 58:09.560
 You said much faster than a classical implementation.

58:09.560 --> 58:12.840
 What about, sort of, what about the space

58:12.840 --> 58:14.680
 with where the class, there's no,

58:14.680 --> 58:17.600
 there's not, it doesn't even exist a classical algorithm

58:17.600 --> 58:19.000
 to solve the problem.

58:19.000 --> 58:21.320
 So maybe I should clarify everything

58:21.320 --> 58:23.080
 that a Quantum computer can do,

58:23.080 --> 58:26.760
 a classical computer can also eventually do, okay?

58:26.760 --> 58:30.120
 And the reason why we know that is that

58:30.120 --> 58:32.360
 a classical computer could always, you know,

58:32.360 --> 58:35.640
 if it had no limits of time and memory,

58:35.640 --> 58:39.320
 it could always just store the entire quantum state,

58:39.320 --> 58:41.560
 you know, of your, you know, of the quantum,

58:41.560 --> 58:45.320
 store a list of all the amplitudes, you know,

58:45.320 --> 58:47.360
 in the state of the quantum computer,

58:47.360 --> 58:50.200
 and then just, you know, do some linear algebra

58:50.200 --> 58:52.280
 to just update that state, right?

58:52.280 --> 58:55.520
 And so anything that quantum computers can do

58:55.520 --> 58:58.440
 can also be done by classical computers,

58:58.440 --> 59:00.880
 albeit exponentially slower in some cases.

59:00.880 --> 59:03.880
 So quantum computers don't go into some magical place

59:03.880 --> 59:06.800
 outside of Alan Turing's definition of computation.

59:06.800 --> 59:07.640
 Precisely.

59:07.640 --> 59:10.080
 They do not solve the halting problem.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.840
 They cannot solve anything that is uncomputable

59:12.840 --> 59:14.520
 in Alan Turing's sense.

59:14.520 --> 59:16.760
 What they, what we think they do change

59:16.760 --> 59:19.400
 is what is efficiently computable, okay?

59:19.400 --> 59:22.440
 And, you know, since the 1960s, you know,

59:22.440 --> 59:24.200
 the word efficiently, you know,

59:24.200 --> 59:27.040
 as well as being a central word in computer science,

59:27.040 --> 59:30.120
 but it's sort of a code word for something technical,

59:30.120 --> 59:33.920
 which is basically with polynomial scaling, you know,

59:33.920 --> 59:36.880
 that as you get to larger and larger inputs,

59:36.880 --> 59:39.840
 you would like an algorithm that uses an amount of time

59:39.840 --> 59:42.440
 that scales only like the size of the input

59:42.440 --> 59:43.960
 raised to some power,

59:43.960 --> 59:47.400
 and not exponentially with the size of the input, right?

59:47.400 --> 59:49.920
 Yeah, so I do hope we get to talk again

59:49.920 --> 59:52.760
 because one of the many topics

59:52.760 --> 59:54.160
 that there's probably several hours

59:54.160 --> 59:56.820
 worth of conversation on is complexity,

59:56.820 --> 1:00:00.420
 which we probably won't even get a chance to touch today,

1:00:00.420 --> 1:00:02.760
 but you briefly mentioned it,

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:05.400
 but let's maybe try to continue.

1:00:05.400 --> 1:00:08.720
 So you said the definition of quantum supremacy

1:00:08.720 --> 1:00:12.520
 is basically design is achieving a place

1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:15.200
 where much faster on a formal,

1:00:15.200 --> 1:00:16.600
 that quantum computer is much faster

1:00:16.600 --> 1:00:19.480
 on a formal, well defined problem

1:00:19.480 --> 1:00:21.240
 that is or isn't useful.

1:00:21.240 --> 1:00:22.440
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:25.400
 And I would say that we really want three things, right?

1:00:25.400 --> 1:00:28.080
 We want, first of all, the quantum computer

1:00:28.080 --> 1:00:30.680
 to be much faster just in the literal sense

1:00:30.680 --> 1:00:33.360
 of like number of seconds, you know,

1:00:33.360 --> 1:00:36.960
 it's a solving this, you know, well defined, you know, problem.

1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:40.660
 Secondly, we want it to be sort of, you know,

1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:42.920
 for a problem where we really believe

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:46.120
 that a quantum computer has better scaling behavior, right?

1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:48.840
 So it's not just an incidental, you know,

1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:51.280
 matter of hardware, but it's that, you know,

1:00:51.280 --> 1:00:54.040
 as you went to larger and larger inputs,

1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:57.400
 you know, the classical scaling would be exponential

1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:59.840
 and the scaling for the quantum algorithm

1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:01.680
 would only be polynomial.

1:01:01.680 --> 1:01:04.240
 And then thirdly, we want the first thing,

1:01:04.240 --> 1:01:08.200
 the actual observed speedup to only be explainable

1:01:08.200 --> 1:01:10.760
 in terms of the scaling behavior, right?

1:01:10.760 --> 1:01:14.000
 So, you know, I want, you know, a real world,

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.640
 you know, a real problem to get solved,

1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:20.640
 let's say by a quantum computer with 50 qubits or so,

1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:23.680
 and for no one to be able to explain that in any way

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:28.680
 other than, well, you know, to this computer

1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:32.040
 involved a quantum state with two to the 50th power

1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:35.280
 amplitudes and, you know, a classical simulation,

1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:37.960
 at least any that we know today would require

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:40.520
 keeping track of two to the 50th numbers.

1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:42.520
 And this is the reason why it was faster.

1:01:42.520 --> 1:01:45.200
 So the intuition is that then if you demonstrate

1:01:45.200 --> 1:01:48.440
 on 50 qubits, then once you get to 100 qubits,

1:01:48.440 --> 1:01:50.840
 then it'll be even much more faster.

1:01:50.840 --> 1:01:52.520
 Precisely, precisely.

1:01:52.520 --> 1:01:55.080
 Yeah, and, you know, and quantum supremacy

1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:57.280
 does not require error correction, right?

1:01:57.280 --> 1:01:58.560
 We don't, you know, we don't have,

1:01:58.560 --> 1:02:00.760
 you could say true scalability yet,

1:02:00.760 --> 1:02:04.680
 or true, you know, error correction yet,

1:02:04.680 --> 1:02:07.880
 but you could say quantum supremacy is already enough

1:02:07.880 --> 1:02:12.240
 by itself to refute the skeptics who said a quantum computer

1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:15.280
 will never outperform a classical computer for anything.

1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.280
 But one, how do you demonstrate quantum supremacy?

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:21.800
 Yeah, supremacy and two,

1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:23.960
 what's up with these new news articles

1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:25.960
 I'm reading that Google did so?

1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:29.080
 Yeah, all right, well, great questions,

1:02:29.080 --> 1:02:32.040
 because now you get into actually, you know,

1:02:32.040 --> 1:02:34.360
 a lot of the work that I've, you know,

1:02:34.360 --> 1:02:37.160
 I and my students have been doing for the last decade,

1:02:37.160 --> 1:02:41.240
 which was precisely about how do you demonstrate

1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:44.360
 quantum supremacy using technologies that, you know,

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:47.240
 we thought would be available in the near future.

1:02:47.240 --> 1:02:52.240
 And so one of the main things that we realized around 2011,

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:58.840
 and this was me and my student, Alex Arkapov at MIT

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:03.280
 at the time, and independently of some others,

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:06.320
 including a Bremner, Joseph and Shepard, okay?

1:03:06.320 --> 1:03:11.080
 And the realization that we came to was that

1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:15.000
 if you just want to prove that a quantum computer is faster,

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.320
 you know, and not do something useful with it,

1:03:17.320 --> 1:03:20.440
 then there are huge advantages to sort of switching

1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:24.080
 your attention from problems like factoring numbers

1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:26.160
 that have a single right answer

1:03:26.160 --> 1:03:28.720
 to what we call sampling problems.

1:03:28.720 --> 1:03:32.080
 So these are problems where the goal is just to output

1:03:32.080 --> 1:03:35.520
 a sample from some probability distribution,

1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:38.200
 let's say over strings of 50 bits, right?

1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:40.520
 So there are, you know, many, many, many

1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:42.440
 possible valid outputs, you know,

1:03:42.440 --> 1:03:45.080
 your computer will probably never even produce the same

1:03:45.080 --> 1:03:46.680
 output twice, you know,

1:03:46.680 --> 1:03:50.640
 if it's running as even, you know,

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:52.920
 assuming it's running perfectly, okay?

1:03:52.920 --> 1:03:56.040
 But the key is that some outputs are supposed to be

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:57.800
 likelier than other ones.

1:03:57.800 --> 1:04:02.120
 So sorry, to clarify, is there a set of outputs

1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:03.880
 that are valid and set there or not?

1:04:03.880 --> 1:04:08.040
 Or is it more that the distribution

1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:11.280
 of a particular kind of output is more,

1:04:11.280 --> 1:04:13.400
 like there's a specific distribution

1:04:13.400 --> 1:04:14.240
 of a particular kind of output?

1:04:14.240 --> 1:04:16.720
 Yeah, there's a specific distribution

1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:18.120
 that you're trying to hit, right?

1:04:18.120 --> 1:04:20.120
 Or, you know, that you're trying to sample from.

1:04:20.120 --> 1:04:22.640
 Now, there are a lot of questions about this,

1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:24.640
 you know, how do you do that, right?

1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:27.800
 Now, how you do it, you know,

1:04:27.800 --> 1:04:30.320
 it turns out that with a quantum computer,

1:04:30.320 --> 1:04:32.360
 even with the noisy quantum computers

1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:34.920
 that we have now, that we have today,

1:04:34.920 --> 1:04:37.080
 what you can do is basically just apply

1:04:37.080 --> 1:04:40.400
 a randomly chosen sequence of operations, right?

1:04:40.400 --> 1:04:42.520
 So we, you know, in some ways, you know,

1:04:42.520 --> 1:04:44.720
 that part is almost trivial, right?

1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:47.440
 We just sort of get the qubits to interact

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:49.640
 in some random way, although a sort of

1:04:49.640 --> 1:04:51.760
 precisely specified random way.

1:04:51.760 --> 1:04:55.120
 So we can repeat the exact same random sequence

1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:57.800
 of interactions again and get another sample

1:04:57.800 --> 1:04:59.680
 from that same distribution.

1:04:59.680 --> 1:05:02.000
 And what this does is it basically,

1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:04.280
 well, it creates a lot of garbage,

1:05:04.280 --> 1:05:06.720
 but you know, very specific garbage, right?

1:05:06.720 --> 1:05:09.280
 So, you know, of all of the,

1:05:09.280 --> 1:05:11.520
 so if we're gonna talk about Google's device,

1:05:11.520 --> 1:05:14.200
 there were 53 qubits there, okay?

1:05:14.200 --> 1:05:18.160
 And so there are two to the 53 power possible outputs.

1:05:18.160 --> 1:05:20.480
 Now, for some of those outputs, you know,

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:24.400
 there was a little bit more destructive interference

1:05:24.400 --> 1:05:25.800
 in their amplitude, okay?

1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:28.200
 So their amplitudes were a little bit smaller.

1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:29.600
 And for others, there was a little more

1:05:29.600 --> 1:05:31.560
 constructive interference, you know,

1:05:31.560 --> 1:05:33.640
 the amplitudes were a little bit more aligned

1:05:33.640 --> 1:05:35.240
 with each other, you know,

1:05:35.240 --> 1:05:38.960
 and so those that were a little bit likelier, okay?

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:42.320
 All of the outputs are exponentially unlikely,

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:45.520
 but some are, let's say, two times or three times,

1:05:45.520 --> 1:05:47.840
 you know, unlikelier than others, okay?

1:05:47.840 --> 1:05:50.880
 And so you can define, you know,

1:05:50.880 --> 1:05:53.680
 the sequence of operations that gives rise

1:05:53.680 --> 1:05:56.040
 to this probability distribution, okay?

1:05:56.040 --> 1:05:59.560
 Now, the next question would be, well, how do you,

1:05:59.560 --> 1:06:01.160
 you know, even if you're sampling from it,

1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:02.400
 how do you verify that?

1:06:02.400 --> 1:06:03.240
 Right, exactly.

1:06:03.240 --> 1:06:04.200
 How do you know?

1:06:04.200 --> 1:06:09.200
 And so my students and I, and also the people at Google

1:06:09.480 --> 1:06:10.480
 who were doing the experiment,

1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:13.160
 came up with statistical tests

1:06:13.160 --> 1:06:16.040
 that you can apply to the outputs

1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:20.760
 in order to try to verify, you know,

1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:22.800
 what is, you know, that at least

1:06:22.800 --> 1:06:25.960
 that some hard problem is being solved.

1:06:25.960 --> 1:06:28.760
 The test that Google ended up using

1:06:28.760 --> 1:06:29.960
 was something that they called

1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:32.960
 the Linear Cross Entropy Benchmark, okay?

1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:34.360
 And it's basically, you know,

1:06:34.360 --> 1:06:37.840
 so the drawback of this test is that it requires,

1:06:37.840 --> 1:06:39.880
 like, it requires you to do

1:06:39.880 --> 1:06:43.200
 a two to the 53 time calculation

1:06:43.200 --> 1:06:45.040
 with your classical computer, okay?

1:06:45.040 --> 1:06:47.880
 So it's very expensive to do the test

1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:49.400
 on a classical computer.

1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:50.240
 The good news is.

1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:51.760
 How big of a number is two to the 50?

1:06:51.760 --> 1:06:53.760
 It's about nine quadrillion.

1:06:53.760 --> 1:06:55.280
 Okay. That doesn't help.

1:06:55.280 --> 1:06:58.520
 Well, you know, it's, you want it in like scientific notation.

1:06:58.520 --> 1:07:00.360
 No, no, no, what I mean is,

1:07:00.360 --> 1:07:02.960
 it is impossible to run on a specific computer.

1:07:02.960 --> 1:07:04.920
 Yeah, so we will come back to that.

1:07:04.920 --> 1:07:07.600
 It is just barely possible to run,

1:07:07.600 --> 1:07:09.440
 we think on the largest supercomputer

1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:11.200
 that currently exists on Earth,

1:07:11.200 --> 1:07:14.120
 which is called Summit at Oak Ridge National Lab.

1:07:14.120 --> 1:07:15.480
 Okay.

1:07:15.480 --> 1:07:16.960
 Great, this is exciting.

1:07:16.960 --> 1:07:18.320
 That's the short answer.

1:07:18.320 --> 1:07:22.040
 So ironically for this type of experiment,

1:07:22.040 --> 1:07:24.440
 we don't want a hundred qubits, okay?

1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:26.120
 Because with a hundred qubits,

1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:27.480
 even if it works, we don't know

1:07:27.480 --> 1:07:29.680
 how to verify the results, okay?

1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:32.240
 So we want, you know, a number of qubits

1:07:32.240 --> 1:07:34.080
 that is enough that, you know,

1:07:34.080 --> 1:07:36.440
 the biggest classical computers on Earth

1:07:36.440 --> 1:07:38.280
 will have to sweat, you know,

1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:40.120
 and we'll just barely, you know,

1:07:40.120 --> 1:07:42.880
 be able to keep up with the quantum computer,

1:07:42.880 --> 1:07:44.600
 you know, using much more time,

1:07:44.600 --> 1:07:46.680
 but they will still be able to do it

1:07:46.680 --> 1:07:48.520
 in order that we can verify the results.

1:07:48.520 --> 1:07:50.680
 Which is where the 53 comes from for the qubits.

1:07:50.680 --> 1:07:51.520
 Right, basically.

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:53.360
 Well, I mean, I mean, I mean, that's also,

1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:56.480
 that's sort of, you know, the, I mean,

1:07:56.480 --> 1:07:58.920
 that's sort of where they are now

1:07:58.920 --> 1:08:00.480
 in terms of scaling, you know,

1:08:00.480 --> 1:08:01.800
 and then, you know, soon, you know,

1:08:01.800 --> 1:08:03.680
 that point will be passed.

1:08:03.680 --> 1:08:06.880
 And then when you get to larger numbers of qubits,

1:08:06.880 --> 1:08:10.200
 then, you know, these types of sampling experiments

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:12.200
 will no longer be so interesting

1:08:12.200 --> 1:08:14.960
 because we won't even be able to verify the results

1:08:14.960 --> 1:08:17.800
 and we'll have to switch to other types of computation.

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:20.120
 So with the sampling thing, you know,

1:08:20.120 --> 1:08:22.560
 so the tests that Google applied

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:24.760
 with this linear cross entropy benchmark

1:08:24.760 --> 1:08:27.080
 was basically just take the samples

1:08:27.080 --> 1:08:29.160
 that were generated, which are, you know,

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:32.320
 a very small subset of all the possible samples

1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:33.160
 that there are.

1:08:33.160 --> 1:08:36.720
 But for those, you calculate with your classical computer

1:08:36.720 --> 1:08:39.680
 the probabilities that they should have been output.

1:08:39.680 --> 1:08:41.640
 And you see, are those probabilities

1:08:41.640 --> 1:08:43.200
 like larger than the mean?

1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:44.760
 You know, so is the quantum computer

1:08:44.760 --> 1:08:47.240
 biased toward outputting the strings

1:08:47.240 --> 1:08:50.400
 that it's, you know, that you want it to be biased toward?

1:08:50.400 --> 1:08:52.120
 Okay, and then finally,

1:08:52.120 --> 1:08:54.400
 we come to a very crucial question,

1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:56.360
 which is supposing that it does that.

1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:58.520
 Well, how do we know that a classical computer

1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:01.400
 could not have quickly done the same thing, right?

1:09:01.400 --> 1:09:02.520
 How do we know that, you know,

1:09:02.520 --> 1:09:05.640
 this couldn't have been spoofed by a classical computer, right?

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:09.960
 And so, well, the first answer is we don't know for sure

1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:12.120
 because, you know, this takes us into questions

1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:15.320
 of complexity theory, you know, you know, the, I mean,

1:09:15.320 --> 1:09:19.560
 questions of the magnitude of the P versus NP question

1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:20.400
 and things like that, right?

1:09:20.400 --> 1:09:23.640
 You know, we don't know how to rule out definitively

1:09:23.640 --> 1:09:26.680
 that there could be fast classical algorithms

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:29.080
 for, you know, even simulating quantum mechanics

1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:32.480
 and for, you know, simulating experiments like these,

1:09:32.480 --> 1:09:36.280
 but we can give some evidence against that possibility.

1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:39.240
 And that was sort of the, you know, the main thrust

1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:42.400
 of a lot of the work that my colleagues and I did,

1:09:42.400 --> 1:09:43.840
 you know, over the last decade,

1:09:43.840 --> 1:09:46.880
 which is then sort of in around 2015 or so,

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:50.040
 what led to Google deciding to do this experiment.

1:09:50.040 --> 1:09:54.040
 So is the kind of evidence, first of all, the hard P

1:09:54.040 --> 1:09:55.960
 equals NP problem that you mentioned

1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:00.960
 and the kind of evidence that you're looking at,

1:10:00.960 --> 1:10:03.920
 is that something you come to on a sheet of paper

1:10:03.920 --> 1:10:07.520
 or is this something, are these empirical experiments?

1:10:07.520 --> 1:10:09.680
 It's math for the most part.

1:10:09.680 --> 1:10:14.520
 I mean, you know, it's also, you know, we have a bunch

1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:19.520
 of methods that are known for simulating quantum circuits

1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:22.000
 or, you know, quantum computations

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:23.680
 with classical computers.

1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:26.240
 And so we have to try them all out and make sure

1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:28.200
 that, you know, they don't work, you know,

1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:30.400
 make sure that they have exponential scaling

1:10:30.400 --> 1:10:34.320
 on, you know, these problems and not just theoretically,

1:10:34.320 --> 1:10:36.520
 but with the actual range of parameters

1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:40.440
 that are actually, you know, arising in Google's experiment.

1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:43.520
 Okay, so there is an empirical component to it, right?

1:10:43.520 --> 1:10:47.760
 But now on the theoretical side, you know,

1:10:47.760 --> 1:10:49.840
 basically what we know how to do

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:51.760
 in theoretical computer science

1:10:51.760 --> 1:10:54.240
 and computational complexity is, you know,

1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:57.320
 we don't know how to prove that most of the problems

1:10:57.320 --> 1:11:00.640
 we care about are hard, but we know how to pass the blame

1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:02.080
 to someone else, okay?

1:11:02.080 --> 1:11:04.080
 We know how to say, well, look, you know,

1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:06.480
 I can't prove that this problem is hard,

1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:09.240
 but if it is easy, then all these other things that,

1:11:09.240 --> 1:11:13.160
 you know, for sure, you probably were much more confident

1:11:13.160 --> 1:11:16.840
 or we're hard, then those would be easy as well, okay?

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:19.800
 So we can give what are called reductions.

1:11:19.800 --> 1:11:22.760
 This has been the basic strategy in, you know,

1:11:22.760 --> 1:11:24.640
 and NP completeness, right?

1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:27.560
 And in all of theoretical computer science

1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:31.080
 and cryptography since the 1970s, really.

1:11:31.080 --> 1:11:34.280
 And so we were able to give some reduction evidence

1:11:34.280 --> 1:11:39.280
 for the hardness of simulating these sampling experiments,

1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:42.360
 these sampling based quantum supremacy experiments.

1:11:42.360 --> 1:11:46.480
 So reduction evidence is not as satisfactory as it should be.

1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:49.120
 One of the biggest open problems in this area

1:11:49.120 --> 1:11:52.480
 is to make it better, but, you know, we can do something.

1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:56.000
 You know, certainly we can say that, you know,

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.520
 if there is a fast classical algorithm

1:11:58.520 --> 1:12:00.360
 to spoof these experiments,

1:12:00.360 --> 1:12:03.480
 then it has to be very, very unlike any of the algorithms

1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:04.320
 that we know.

1:12:04.320 --> 1:12:07.720
 Which is kind of in the same kind of space of reasoning

1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:10.640
 that people say P equal, not equals NP.

1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.880
 Yeah, it's in the same spirit.

1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:14.200
 Yeah, in the same spirit.

1:12:14.200 --> 1:12:19.200
 Okay, so Andrew Yang, a very intelligent

1:12:20.240 --> 1:12:25.240
 and a presidential candidate with a lot of interesting ideas

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:27.240
 in all kinds of technological fields,

1:12:28.520 --> 1:12:30.960
 tweeted that because of quantum computing,

1:12:30.960 --> 1:12:34.480
 no code is uncrackable.

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:36.520
 Is he wrong or right?

1:12:36.520 --> 1:12:39.000
 He was premature, let's say.

1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.040
 So, well, okay, wrong.

1:12:41.040 --> 1:12:44.040
 Look, you know, I'm actually, I'm a fan of Andrew Yang.

1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:46.240
 I like his, you know, I like his ideas.

1:12:46.240 --> 1:12:47.960
 I like his candidacy.

1:12:47.960 --> 1:12:52.960
 I think that, you know, he may be ahead of his time

1:12:52.960 --> 1:12:55.280
 with, you know, the universal basic income

1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:58.160
 and you know, the universal basic income

1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:01.080
 and so forth, and he may also be ahead of his time

1:13:01.080 --> 1:13:03.080
 in that tweet that you referenced.

1:13:03.080 --> 1:13:08.080
 So, regarding using quantum computers to break cryptography,

1:13:08.080 --> 1:13:10.320
 so the situation is this, okay?

1:13:10.320 --> 1:13:14.400
 So, the famous discovery of Peter Shore,

1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:16.080
 you know, 26 years ago,

1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:18.240
 that really started quantum computing,

1:13:18.240 --> 1:13:20.160
 you know, as an autonomous field,

1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:25.160
 was that if you built a full scalable quantum computer,

1:13:25.160 --> 1:13:28.160
 then you could use it to efficiently find

1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:32.160
 the prime factors of huge numbers

1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:35.160
 and calculate discrete logarithms

1:13:35.160 --> 1:13:37.160
 and solve a few other problems

1:13:37.160 --> 1:13:40.160
 that are very, very special in character, right?

1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:42.160
 They're not NP complete problems.

1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:44.160
 We're pretty sure they're not, okay?

1:13:44.160 --> 1:13:49.160
 But it so happens that most of the public key cryptography

1:13:49.160 --> 1:13:51.160
 that we currently use to protect the internet

1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:55.160
 is based on the belief that these problems are hard.

1:13:55.160 --> 1:13:57.160
 Okay, what Shore showed is that

1:13:57.160 --> 1:13:59.160
 once you get scalable quantum computers,

1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:01.160
 then that's no longer true, okay?

1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:05.160
 But now, you know, before people panic,

1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:08.160
 there are two important points to understand here.

1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:11.160
 Okay, the first is that quantum supremacy,

1:14:11.160 --> 1:14:14.160
 the milestone that Google just achieved,

1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:18.160
 is very, very far from the kind of scalable quantum computer

1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:22.160
 that would be needed to actually threaten public key cryptography.

1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:24.160
 Okay, so, you know, we touched on this earlier, right?

1:14:24.160 --> 1:14:28.160
 But Google's device has 53 physical qubits, right?

1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:31.160
 To threaten cryptography, you're talking, you know,

1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:33.160
 with any of the known error correction methods,

1:14:33.160 --> 1:14:36.160
 you're talking millions of physical qubits.

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:39.160
 Because error correction would be required to send cryptography.

1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:45.160
 Yes, yes, yes, yes, it certainly would, right?

1:14:45.160 --> 1:14:51.160
 And, you know, how much, you know, how great will the overhead be

1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:54.160
 from the error correction that we don't know yet?

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:59.160
 But with the known codes, you're talking millions of physical qubits

1:14:59.160 --> 1:15:02.160
 and of a much higher quality than any that we have now.

1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:08.160
 Okay, so, you know, I don't think that that is, you know, coming soon,

1:15:08.160 --> 1:15:12.160
 although people who have secrets that, you know,

1:15:12.160 --> 1:15:17.160
 need to stay secret for 20 years, you know, are already worried about this,

1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:22.160
 you know, for the good reason that, you know, we presume that intelligence agencies

1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:26.160
 are already scooping up data, you know, in the hope that eventually

1:15:26.160 --> 1:15:30.160
 they'll be able to decode it once quantum computers become available.

1:15:30.160 --> 1:15:35.160
 Okay, so there is, so this brings me to the second point I wanted to make,

1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:40.160
 which is that there are other public key crypto systems that are known

1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:45.160
 that we don't know how to break even with quantum computers.

1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:48.160
 Okay, and so there's a whole field devoted to this now,

1:15:48.160 --> 1:15:51.160
 which is called post quantum cryptography.

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:56.160
 Okay, and so there is already, so we have some good candidates now,

1:15:56.160 --> 1:16:00.160
 the best known being what are called lattice based crypto systems,

1:16:00.160 --> 1:16:05.160
 and there is already some push to try to migrate to these crypto systems.

1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:11.160
 NIST in the US is holding a competition to create standards

1:16:11.160 --> 1:16:15.160
 for post quantum cryptography, which will be the first step

1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:20.160
 in trying to get every web browser and every router to upgrade,

1:16:20.160 --> 1:16:25.160
 you know, and use, you know, some like SSL that would be based

1:16:25.160 --> 1:16:29.160
 on what we think is quantum secure cryptography.

1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:32.160
 But, you know, this will be a long process,

1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:37.160
 but, you know, it is something that people are already starting to do.

1:16:37.160 --> 1:16:43.160
 And so, you know, I'm sure as algorithm is sort of a dramatic discovery,

1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:46.160
 you know, it could be a big deal for whatever intelligence agency

1:16:46.160 --> 1:16:49.160
 first gets a scalable quantum computer,

1:16:49.160 --> 1:16:53.160
 at least certainly if no one else knows that they have it, right?

1:16:53.160 --> 1:16:58.160
 But eventually we think that we could migrate the internet

1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:03.160
 to the post quantum cryptography and then we'd be more or less back where we started.

1:17:03.160 --> 1:17:07.160
 Okay, so this is sort of not the application of quantum computing,

1:17:07.160 --> 1:17:11.160
 I think that's really going to change the world in a sustainable way, right?

1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:15.160
 The, by the way, the biggest practical application of quantum computing

1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:21.160
 that we know about by far, I think is simply the simulation of quantum mechanics itself.

1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:25.160
 In order to, you know, learn about chemical reactions, you know,

1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:31.160
 design maybe new chemical processes, new materials, new drugs,

1:17:31.160 --> 1:17:36.160
 new solar cells, new superconductors, all kinds of things like that.

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:42.160
 What's the size of a quantum computer that would be able to simulate the, you know,

1:17:42.160 --> 1:17:47.160
 quantum mechanical systems themselves that would be impactful for the real world

1:17:47.160 --> 1:17:50.160
 for the kind of chemical reactions and that kind of work?

1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:52.160
 What scale are we talking about?

1:17:52.160 --> 1:17:57.160
 Now you're asking a very, very current question, a very big question.

1:17:57.160 --> 1:18:04.160
 People are going to be racing over the next decade to try to do useful quantum simulations

1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:09.160
 even with, you know, 100 or 200 qubit quantum computers

1:18:09.160 --> 1:18:13.160
 of the sort that we expect to be able to build over the next decade.

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:18.160
 Okay, so that might be, you know, the first application of quantum computing

1:18:18.160 --> 1:18:22.160
 that we're able to realize, you know, or maybe it will prove to be too difficult

1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:28.160
 and maybe even that will require fault tolerance or, you know, will require error correction.

1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:32.160
 So that's an aggressive race to come up with the one case study,

1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:38.160
 kind of like with Peter Shor with the idea that would just capture the world's imagination

1:18:38.160 --> 1:18:41.160
 of like, look, we can actually do something very useful here.

1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:45.160
 Yeah, but I think, you know, within the next decade, the best shot we have

1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:50.160
 is certainly not, you know, using Shor's algorithm to break cryptography,

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:55.160
 you know, just because it requires, you know, too much in the way of error correction.

1:18:55.160 --> 1:19:02.160
 The best shot we have is to do some quantum simulation that tells the material scientists

1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:07.160
 or chemists or nuclear physicists, you know, something that is useful to them

1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:11.160
 and that they didn't already know, you know, and you might only need one or two successes

1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:14.160
 in order to change some, you know, billion dollar industries, right?

1:19:14.160 --> 1:19:18.160
 Like, you know, the way that people make fertilizer right now

1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:22.160
 is still based on the Haber Bosch process from a century ago

1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:27.160
 and it is some many body quantum mechanics problem that no one really understands, right?

1:19:27.160 --> 1:19:33.160
 If you could design a better way to make fertilizer, right, that's, you know, billions of dollars right there.

1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:40.160
 So those are sort of the applications that people are going to be aggressively racing toward over the next decade.

1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:46.160
 Now, I don't know if they're going to realize it or not, but, you know, it is, you know, they certainly at least have a shot.

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:49.160
 So it's going to be a very, very interesting next decade.

1:19:49.160 --> 1:19:51.160
 But just to clarify, what's your intuition?

1:19:51.160 --> 1:19:58.160
 Is if a breakthrough like that comes, is it possible for that breakthrough to be on 50 to 100 qubits

1:19:58.160 --> 1:20:04.160
 or is scale a fundamental thing like 500,000 plus qubits?

1:20:04.160 --> 1:20:09.160
 Yeah, so I can tell you what the current studies are saying.

1:20:09.160 --> 1:20:14.160
 You know, I think probably better to rely on that than my intuition.

1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:21.160
 But, you know, there was a group at Microsoft had a study a few years ago that said

1:20:21.160 --> 1:20:27.160
 even with only about 100 qubits, you know, you could already learn something new about this,

1:20:27.160 --> 1:20:31.160
 the chemical reaction that makes fertilizer, for example.

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:38.160
 The trouble is they're talking about 100 qubits and about a million layers of quantum gates.

1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:42.160
 Okay, so basically they're talking about 100 nearly perfect qubits.

1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:44.160
 So the logical qubits, as you mentioned before.

1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:47.160
 Yeah, exactly. 100 logical qubits.

1:20:47.160 --> 1:20:55.160
 And now, you know, the hard part for the next decade is going to be, well, what can we do with 100 to 200 noisy qubits?

1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:56.160
 Yeah.

1:20:56.160 --> 1:21:04.160
 Is there air correction breakthroughs that might come without the need to do thousands or millions of physical qubits?

1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:09.160
 Yeah, so people are going to be pushing simultaneously on a bunch of different directions.

1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:13.160
 One direction, of course, is just making the qubits better, right?

1:21:13.160 --> 1:21:17.160
 And, you know, there is tremendous progress there.

1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:28.160
 I mean, you know, the fidelity is like the accuracy of the qubits has improved by several orders of magnitude, you know, in the last decade or two.

1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:40.160
 Okay, the second thing is designing better error, you know, let's say lower overhead error correcting codes, and even short of doing the full recursive error correction.

1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:52.160
 You know, there are these error mitigation strategies that you can use, you know, that may, you know, allow you to eke out a useful speed up in the near term.

1:21:52.160 --> 1:22:01.160
 And then the third thing is just taking the quantum algorithms for simulating quantum chemistry or materials and making them more efficient.

1:22:01.160 --> 1:22:07.160
 You know, and those algorithms are already dramatically more efficient than they were, let's say, five years ago.

1:22:07.160 --> 1:22:13.160
 And so when, you know, I quoted these estimates like, you know, a circuit depth of one million.

1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:18.160
 And so, you know, I hope that because people will care enough that these numbers are going to come down.

1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:24.160
 So you're one of the, the world class researchers in this space.

1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:30.160
 There's a few groups that can mention Google and IBM working at this, there's, there's other research labs.

1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:40.160
 But you put also, you have, you have an amazing blog, you just, you put a lot, you put a, you paid me to say it.

1:22:40.160 --> 1:23:02.160
 You put a lot of effort sort of to communicating the science of this and communicating, exposing some of the BS and sort of the natural, just like in the AI space, the natural charlatanism, if that's the word, in this, in quantum mechanics in general, but quantum computers and so on.

1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:19.160
 Can you give some notes about people or ideas that people like me or listeners in general from outside the field should be cautious of when they're taking in news headings that Google achieved quantum supremacy?

1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:24.160
 So what should we look out for? Where's the charlatans in this space? Where's the BS?

1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:34.160
 Yeah, so good question. Unfortunately, quantum computing is a little bit like cryptocurrency or deep learning.

1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:39.160
 Like there is a core of something that is genuinely revolutionary and exciting.

1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:49.160
 And because of that core, it attracts this sort of vast penumbra of, you know, people making, you know, just utterly ridiculous claims.

1:23:49.160 --> 1:24:05.160
 And so with quantum computing, I mean, I would say that the main way that people go astray is by, you know, not focusing on sort of the question of, you know, are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not, right?

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:23.160
 And so, you know, people have like a dismissed quantum supremacy because it's not useful, right? Or, you know, it's not itself, let's say, obviously useful for anything. Okay. But, you know, ironically, these are some of the same people who will go and say, well, we care about useful applications.

1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:42.160
 We care about solving traffic routing and optimal, you know, and financial optimization and all these things. And that sounds really good. You know, but, you know, their entire spiel is sort of counting on nobody asking the question, yes, but how well could a classical computer do the same thing?

1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:58.160
 Yes. Right. You know, I really mean the entire thing is, you know, they say, well, a quantum computer can do this, a quantum computer can do that, right? And they just avoid the question, are you getting a speed up over a classical computer or not?

1:24:58.160 --> 1:25:17.160
 And, you know, if so, how, you know, how do you know, have you really thought carefully about classical algorithms to do, you know, to solve the same problem, right? And a lot of the application areas that, you know, the, you know, companies and investors are most excited about that the popular

1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:37.160
 press is most excited about, you know, for quantum computers have been things like machine learning, AI optimization. Okay. And the problem with that is that since the very beginning, you know, even if you have a perfect, you know, fault tolerant, you know, quantum, scalable

1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:56.160
 quantum computer, you know, we have known of only modest speed ups that you can get for these problems. Okay. So, so there is a famous quantum algorithm called Grover's algorithm. Okay, and what it can do is it can solve many, many of the problems that arise in AI machine

1:25:56.160 --> 1:26:11.160
 learning optimization, including NP complete problems. Okay, but it can solve them in about the square root of the number of steps that a classical computer would need for the same problems. Okay, now a square root speed up is, you know, important.

1:26:11.160 --> 1:26:26.160
 It's impressive. It is not an exponential speed up. Okay, so it is not the kind of game changer that let's say shores algorithm for factoring is, or for that matter that simulation of quantum mechanics is okay it is a more modest speed up.

1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:42.160
 And let's say, you know, roughly, you know, in theory, it could roughly double the size of the optimization problems that you could handle. Right. And so, you know, because people found that I guess too, too boring, or you know, too unimpressive, you know, they've gone on to

1:26:42.160 --> 1:27:00.160
 to like invent all of these heuristic algorithms, where, you know, because no one really understands them, you can just project your hopes onto them, right, that well, maybe it gets an exponential speed up, you can't prove that it doesn't, you know, and the burden is on you to prove that it doesn't get a speed

1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:17.160
 up. Right. And, you know, so they've done an immense amount of that kind of thing. And a really worrying amount of the case for building a quantum computer has come to rest on this stuff that those of us in this field know perfectly well is on extremely shaky foundations.

1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:31.160
 So the fundamental question is, show that there's a speed up. Yes, absolutely. And in this space that you're referring to, which is actually interesting, the area that a lot of people excited about is machine learning. Yeah.

1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:46.160
 So your sense is, do you think it will? So I know that there's a lot of smoke currently. Yeah. But do you think there actually eventually might be breakthroughs where you do get exponential speed ups in the machine learning space?

1:27:46.160 --> 1:28:03.160
 Absolutely, there might be. I mean, I think we know of modest speed ups that you can get for these problems. I think, you know, whether you can get bigger speed ups is one of the biggest questions for quantum computing theory, you know, for people like me to be thinking about.

1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:22.160
 Now, you know, we had actually recently a really, you know, a super exciting candidate for an exponential quantum speed up for a machine learning problem that people really care about. This is basically the Netflix problem, the problem of recommending products to users,

1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:38.160
 given some sparse data about their preferences. Coronetus and Prakash in 2016 had an algorithm for sampling recommendations that was exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm, right? And so, you know, a lot of people were excited.

1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:53.160
 I was excited about it. I had an 18 year old undergrad by the name of Ewin Tang, and she was, you know, she was obviously brilliant. She was looking for a project. I gave her, as a project, can you prove that this speed up is real?

1:28:53.160 --> 1:29:09.160
 You prove that, you know, any classical algorithm would need to access exponentially more data, right? And, you know, this was a case where if that was true, this was not like a P versus NP type of question, right? This might well have been provable. But she worked on it for a year.

1:29:09.160 --> 1:29:21.160
 She couldn't do it. Eventually, she figured out why she couldn't do it. And the reason was that that was false. There is a classical algorithm with a similar performance to the quantum algorithm.

1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:36.160
 Ewin succeeded in dequantizing that machine learning algorithm. And then in the last couple of years, building on Ewin's breakthrough, a bunch of the other quantum machine learning algorithms that were proposed have now also been dequantized.

1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:51.160
 Yeah. Okay. And so I would say, yeah. That's a kind of important backward step. Yes. Like a forward step for science, but a step for quantum machine learning that precedes the big next forward step. Right, right, right.

1:29:51.160 --> 1:30:03.160
 If it's possible. Right. Now, some people will say, well, you know, there's a silver lining in this cloud. They say, well, thinking about quantum computing has led to the discovery of potentially useful new classical algorithms.

1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:15.160
 Right. And so, you know, so you get these spin off applications. But if you want a quantum speed up, you really have to think carefully about that. You know, Ewin's work was a perfect illustration of why.

1:30:15.160 --> 1:30:29.160
 Right. And I think that, you know, the challenge, you know, the field is now open, right? Find a better example. Find, you know, where quantum computers are going to deliver big gains for machine learning.

1:30:29.160 --> 1:30:41.160
 You know, I am, you know, not only do I ardently support, you know, people thinking about that, I'm trying to think about it myself and have my students and postdocs think about it.

1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:54.160
 But we should not pretend that those speed ups are already established. And the problem comes when so many of the companies and, you know, and journalists in this space are pretending that.

1:30:54.160 --> 1:31:15.160
 Like all good things, like life itself, this conversation must soon come to an end. Let me ask the most absurdly philosophical last question. What is the meaning of life? What gives your life fulfillment, purpose, happiness, and yeah, meaning?

1:31:15.160 --> 1:31:43.160
 I would say, you know, number one, trying to discover new things about the world and share them and, you know, communicate and learn what other people have discovered. You know, number two, you know, my friends, my family, my kids, my students, you know, the people around me.

1:31:43.160 --> 1:32:05.160
 Number three, you know, trying, you know, when I can to, you know, make the world better in some small ways. And, you know, it's depressing that I can't do more and that, you know, the world is, you know, in, you know, facing crises over, you know, the climate and over, you know, sort of resurgent authoritarianism and all these other things.

1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:13.160
 But, you know, trying to stand against the things that I find horrible when I can.

1:32:13.160 --> 1:32:18.160
 Let me ask you one more absurd question. What makes you smile?

1:32:18.160 --> 1:32:23.160
 Well, yeah, I guess your question just did. I don't know.

1:32:23.160 --> 1:32:31.160
 I thought I tried that absurd one on you. Well, it was a huge honor to talk to you. It probably talks to you for many more hours. God, thank you so much.

1:32:31.160 --> 1:32:34.160
 Well, thank you. Thank you. It was great.

1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:28.160
 Quote, again and again, I've undergone the humbling experience of first lamenting how badly something sucks, then only much later having the crucial insight that it's not sucking wouldn't have been a Nash equilibrium.

1:33:28.160 --> 1:33:32.160
 Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
