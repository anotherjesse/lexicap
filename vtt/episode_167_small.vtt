00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
 The following is a conversation with Sagar Anjati.

00:03.200 --> 00:08.840
 He is a DC based political correspondent, host of The Rising with Crystal Ball, and host

00:08.840 --> 00:12.800
 of the Realignment podcast with Marshall Kozlov.

00:12.800 --> 00:18.880
 He has interviewed Donald Trump four times and has interviewed a lot of major political

00:18.880 --> 00:23.240
 figures and human beings who wield power.

00:23.240 --> 00:29.720
 He loves policy and loves history, which makes him a great person to sail through the sometimes

00:29.720 --> 00:32.760
 stormy waters of political discourse.

00:32.760 --> 00:37.880
 He showed up to this conversation with a gift of the second volume of Ian Kershaw's

00:37.880 --> 00:43.640
 biography on Hitler, a two volume set that is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest,

00:43.640 --> 00:48.600
 if not the greatest, most definitive studies of Hitler.

00:48.600 --> 00:54.160
 Nothing wins my heart faster on a first meeting or first date than a great book about the

00:54.160 --> 00:57.520
 darkest aspects of human nature and human history.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.760
 I think I started saying that as a joke, but actually, there's probably a lot of truth

01:00.760 --> 01:01.760
 to it.

01:01.760 --> 01:05.640
 I love it when we skip the small talk and go straight to the in depth conversation about

01:05.640 --> 01:09.160
 the best and worst of human nature.

01:09.160 --> 01:14.960

01:23.400 --> 01:27.800
 As a side note, let me say that for better or for worse, I would like to avoid the trap

01:27.800 --> 01:30.440
 of surface political bickering of the day.

01:30.440 --> 01:35.680
 I do find politics fascinating, but not the talking points produced by the industrial

01:35.680 --> 01:38.760
 engagement complex of red versus blue division.

01:38.760 --> 01:44.920
 Instead, I'm fascinated by human beings who seek power and how power changes them.

01:44.920 --> 01:49.600
 I don't have a political affiliation, and my ideas, at least I hope so, are defined

01:49.600 --> 01:55.480
 more by curiosity and learning in the face of uncertainty and less by the echo chambers

01:55.480 --> 01:58.440
 who tell me what I'm supposed to think.

01:58.440 --> 02:04.440
 I'm constantly evolving, learning, and doing my best to do so without ego and with empathy.

02:04.440 --> 02:05.600
 Please be patient with me.

02:05.600 --> 02:11.040
 As far as I'm aware, I do not have any derangement syndromes, nor do I get a medical prescription

02:11.040 --> 02:14.520
 of blue, red, white, or black pills.

02:14.520 --> 02:21.080
 If I say something, I say it because I'm genuinely thinking and struggling with the ideas.

02:21.080 --> 02:26.720
 I have no agenda, just a bit of a hope to add more love to the world.

 And now, here's my conversation with Sagar Unjedi.

02:41.360 --> 02:46.280
 There's no better gifts in this world than a book about Hitler.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.760
 So thank you so much.

02:47.760 --> 02:53.720
 I've gotten a gift when I was just talking about the watch from Joe Rogan, and this almost

02:53.720 --> 02:54.720
 beats it.

02:54.720 --> 02:58.840
 So tell me what this particular book on Hitler is.

02:58.840 --> 03:00.040
 So this is volume two.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.040
 Yes.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.040
 So this is Ian Kershaw.

03:02.040 --> 03:04.480
 He wrote the famous Two Volume on Hitler.

03:04.480 --> 03:09.240
 I'm a big book nerd, and I spend a lot of time reading biographies in particular.

03:09.240 --> 03:13.840
 So this one, if you need a one volume, rise and fall of the Third Reich.

03:13.840 --> 03:18.320
 I think you talked about that, William Shire, because that's like Hitler's rise, Nazi Germany,

03:18.320 --> 03:19.480
 the war, et cetera.

03:19.480 --> 03:25.440
 But I like bios because the good biography is story of the times.

03:25.440 --> 03:29.880
 And so this one, the first volume, it does exactly that, which is that it doesn't just

03:29.880 --> 03:31.000
 tell the story of Hitler.

03:31.000 --> 03:36.360
 It's the context of this kid in Austria, and he's got all these dreams, but then actually

03:36.360 --> 03:40.840
 pretty courageous in terms of World War I, right, gets pinned to metal on by the Kaiser.

03:40.840 --> 03:47.040
 And then what it's like to have to lose World War I and actually like lose this stain and

03:47.040 --> 03:51.600
 then the rise within, everybody knows that story, the Beer Hall Putsch and all of that.

03:51.600 --> 03:55.760
 This one I like, and the reason I like Kershaw is obviously number one, it's English, which

03:55.760 --> 04:00.160
 is actually hard, right, like in order to write that story, who can do both the primary

04:00.160 --> 04:03.160
 source material and then translate it for people like us.

04:03.160 --> 04:10.160
 But he tells the dynamic story of Hitler so well in the second volume, just the level

04:10.160 --> 04:11.160
 of detail.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.800
 You've talked about this, Lex.

04:12.800 --> 04:16.560
 What was it like inside that room, inside with Chamberlain?

04:16.560 --> 04:23.200
 What was it like in terms of who was this magnetic madman who did convince the smartest

04:23.200 --> 04:24.840
 people in the world at the time?

04:24.840 --> 04:32.640
 And up until 1940, the Soviet gamble, it took tremendous risks.

04:32.640 --> 04:36.440
 But like highly calculated, thinking, no, no, no, I'm not going to pay for this one.

04:36.440 --> 04:38.080
 I'm not going to pay for this one.

04:38.080 --> 04:41.920
 And it put himself, he had a remarkable ability, not just to put himself in the minds of the

04:41.920 --> 04:46.240
 German people, but in terms of his adversaries, like with when he was across from Mussolini.

04:46.240 --> 04:50.400
 Calculated, he's like, how exactly did Mussolini, the guy who created fascism, becomes like

04:50.400 --> 04:52.560
 second fiddle to Hitler?

04:52.560 --> 04:53.920
 Think it's an amazing bio.

04:53.920 --> 04:59.080
 And yeah, like Ian Kershaw, along with Richard Evans, two of my favorite authors on the

04:59.080 --> 05:00.240
 Third Reich, no question.

05:00.240 --> 05:05.080
 You think he was born this way, that charisma, whatever that is, or was it something he developed

05:05.080 --> 05:06.080
 strategically?

05:06.080 --> 05:09.320
 That's like the question you apply to some of the great leaders.

05:09.320 --> 05:16.080
 Was he just a madman who had the instinct to be able to control people in the room together

05:16.080 --> 05:17.080
 with them?

05:17.080 --> 05:18.080
 Or is this like, he worked at it?

05:18.080 --> 05:19.440
 I think he worked at it.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.600
 But also, there is an innate quality.

05:21.600 --> 05:28.240
 I'm forgetting his name, his lifelong Rudolph, the one who flew to Berlin in like 1940, Afrika.

05:28.240 --> 05:34.720
 Anyway, so he helped Hitler write Mein Kampf, and he was like slavishly devoted to him in

05:34.720 --> 05:35.720
 prison.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.840
 This is 1925 or something like that.

05:38.840 --> 05:43.480
 And so you read that, and you're like, well, how does he get this like crank wacko to basically

05:43.480 --> 05:46.520
 believe he's like the second coming, help him write this book?

05:46.520 --> 05:50.080
 I mean, literally, they lived together in the prison cell, and they would wake up every

05:50.080 --> 05:51.080
 day.

05:51.080 --> 05:54.840
 And as he was composing Mein Kampf, and because of the Beer Hall Putsch, and all that had

05:54.840 --> 06:00.640
 this like absolute ability to gather people around him, I think his greatest skill was

06:00.640 --> 06:03.040
 is he was just a very good politician, truly.

06:03.040 --> 06:08.360
 I mean, if you look at his ability in order to read coalitional politics, and then convince

06:08.360 --> 06:13.360
 exactly the right people in order to follow him, I think I heard you ask this once and

06:13.360 --> 06:17.080
 I've thought about it a lot, which is like, who could have stopped Hitler in Germany,

06:17.080 --> 06:18.080
 right?

06:18.080 --> 06:19.080
 It's always like the ever present question.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.400
 Of course, like the whole baby Hitler thing.

06:21.400 --> 06:22.720
 Really the answer is Hindenburg.

06:22.720 --> 06:26.920
 Like Hindenburg was the person who could have stopped and had the immense standing within

06:26.920 --> 06:28.040
 the German public.

06:28.040 --> 06:34.800
 The only real like war hero definitely was personally skeptical of fascism and Nazism.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.880
 And didn't like Hitler.

06:35.880 --> 06:36.880
 And didn't like him.

06:36.880 --> 06:38.240
 And he knew he was full of shit.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.080
 He was like, yeah, I think this guy is dangerous.

06:40.080 --> 06:45.920
 I think this guy could do a lot of damage to the Republic, but he acceded basically to

06:45.920 --> 06:46.920
 Hitler at the time.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.240
 And I think that he was one of the main people who could have done something about it.

06:50.240 --> 06:53.800
 And also he was able to convince the generals and military.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.960
 I mean, that was very interesting.

06:56.960 --> 07:03.000
 And to convince Chamberlain and the other political leaders, there's something I often

07:03.000 --> 07:07.440
 think about, because we're just reading books about these people, I think about with like

07:07.440 --> 07:14.280
 Jeffrey Epstein, for example, like evil people, not evil, but people have done evil things.

07:14.280 --> 07:19.920
 Let's not go to the Dan Carlin thing of what is evil?

07:19.920 --> 07:24.040
 People that do evil things, I wonder what they are like in a room, because I know quite

07:24.040 --> 07:34.160
 a lot of intelligent people that were, did not see the evil in Jeffrey Epstein and spent

07:34.160 --> 07:35.160
 time with him.

07:35.160 --> 07:43.280
 And we're not bothered by in the same sense, Hitler, it seems like he was able to get just

07:43.280 --> 07:48.520
 even on a, before he would had power, because people get intoxicated by power and so on.

07:48.520 --> 07:53.920
 They want to be close to power, but even before he had power, he was able to convince people.

07:53.920 --> 07:59.000
 And it's unclear, like, is there something that's more than words?

07:59.000 --> 08:04.440
 It's like the way you, I mean, that people talk, tell stories about like this piercing

08:04.440 --> 08:06.720
 look and whatever, all that kind of stuff.

08:06.720 --> 08:12.760
 I wonder if that, if that's somehow part of it, like that has to be the base floor of

08:12.760 --> 08:14.600
 any of these charismatic leaders.

08:14.600 --> 08:20.320
 You have to be able to in a room alone, be able to convince anybody of anything.

08:20.320 --> 08:27.040
 So I can tell you, from my personal experience, one of the best educated lessons I got was

08:27.040 --> 08:29.440
 when I got to meet Trump.

08:29.440 --> 08:34.000
 So I interviewed Trump four different times as a journalist, spent like two and a half

08:34.000 --> 08:39.280
 hours with him in the Oval Office, not alone, but like me and one person and like the press

08:39.280 --> 08:40.280
 secretary.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.280
 And that was it.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.880
 So I actually got to observe him.

08:42.880 --> 08:47.480
 And as a guy who reads these types of books, right, and you know, you think of Trump, obviously

08:47.480 --> 08:52.040
 most people, what they see on television, you know, in articles and more, but being

08:52.040 --> 08:56.480
 able to observe it like one on one, I was closer to him than, you know, than I am right

08:56.480 --> 08:58.000
 now from you.

08:58.000 --> 09:03.440
 That was one of the most educational experiences I got because it's like you just said, the

09:03.440 --> 09:11.840
 look, the leaning forward, the way he talks, the way he is a master at taking the question

09:11.840 --> 09:14.080
 and answering exactly which party wants.

09:14.080 --> 09:18.400
 And then if you try and follow up, he's like, excuse me, you know, he knows.

09:18.400 --> 09:22.320
 And then whenever you're talking, it's not that he's annoyed about getting interrupted.

09:22.320 --> 09:26.080
 If he realizes he's been Miranda ring and then you interrupt him, all good.

09:26.080 --> 09:31.080
 But if he's striving home a point, which he has to make sure appears in your transcript

09:31.080 --> 09:36.640
 or whatever, it's like it really was fascinating for me to look at.

09:36.640 --> 09:42.040
 And what was also crazy with Trump is I realized how much he was living in the moment.

09:42.040 --> 09:46.320
 So like when I went to the oval, you know, I've read all these biographies and like I

09:46.320 --> 09:50.880
 walk in, I'm like, holy shit, you're like, I'm in the oval office.

09:50.880 --> 09:53.920
 When you interviewed him in the oval, in the oval, every time was in the oval office.

09:53.920 --> 09:54.920
 You scare Schillis.

09:54.920 --> 09:55.920
 Sorry.

09:55.920 --> 09:56.920
 Well, I wasn't scared.

09:56.920 --> 09:59.080
 I was just, look, it's the oval office.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.080
 Right.

10:00.080 --> 10:01.080
 I mean, I'm just nerd.

10:01.080 --> 10:06.480
 He was like this kid when I'm so, I will admit this here, like I printed out on my dad's

10:06.480 --> 10:10.040
 label maker when I was like seven and I wrote like the oval office on my bedroom.

10:10.040 --> 10:14.760
 So I was like, you know, a huge nerd, like obviously you go maniacal, even from seven.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.720
 But so like for this, I mean, it was huge, right?

10:16.720 --> 10:21.960
 I'm like this 25 year old kid and like I walk in there and like I see the couch, right?

10:21.960 --> 10:24.040
 And I'm like, oh man, like that's Kissinger.

10:24.040 --> 10:28.800
 Like, you know, like that's where like Kissinger and Nixon got on their knees and you see over

10:28.800 --> 10:32.360
 by the door and you're like, are the scuff marks still there from when Eisenhower used

10:32.360 --> 10:33.360
 to play golf?

10:33.360 --> 10:34.880
 You know, this is all running through my mind with Trump.

10:34.880 --> 10:35.880
 None of it was there.

10:35.880 --> 10:36.880
 None of it, right?

10:36.880 --> 10:40.760
 So on the moment, even the desk, I got put my phone on the desk to record and I'm like,

10:40.760 --> 10:46.280
 this is the fucking Resolute Esk, like I shouldn't put my phone on this thing.

10:46.280 --> 10:50.520
 And I'm like HMS Resolute, you know, all that, you know, national, even for him, he doesn't

10:50.520 --> 10:51.640
 think about any of it.

10:51.640 --> 10:53.480
 It was like amazing to me.

10:53.480 --> 10:57.560
 Like he had this portrait of Andrew Jackson right next to his, to the, I think from on

10:57.560 --> 11:00.160
 the fireplace, like right here on the right.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.480
 And the most revealing question was when I was like, Mr. President, what are people

11:03.480 --> 11:06.160
 going to remember you for in a hundred years?

11:06.160 --> 11:09.160
 And he was like, he had, he was like, I don't know, like veteran's choice.

11:09.160 --> 11:14.000
 He like has a list in front of him of like, his accomplishments, which is staff.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
 Good question, by the way.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
 Yeah.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
 Well, I mean, that's what I wanted to know.

11:17.000 --> 11:20.840
 And he's like veteran's choice and I remember looking at him and being like, it's not going

11:20.840 --> 11:21.840
 to be better.

11:21.840 --> 11:27.880
 I'm like, I'm looking at you, Donald Trump, the harbinger of something new.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.040
 We still don't know what the hell it is.

11:30.040 --> 11:34.880
 And so I realized with these guys and their charisma and more is that they don't think

11:34.880 --> 11:37.360
 about themselves the way that we think about them.

11:37.360 --> 11:41.000
 And that was actually important to understand because a lot of people like Trump is playing

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
 all this chess.

11:42.000 --> 11:46.400
 I'm like, I assure you, he's not like he's truly one time I was interviewing him and

11:46.400 --> 11:49.880
 he had like a certificate that he had to sign or something on his desk.

11:49.880 --> 11:53.240
 He's like, it was like child almost like he got distracted by the, he's like, oh, what's

11:53.240 --> 11:54.240
 this?

11:54.240 --> 11:57.800
 You know, it's just like picking up and I was like, wow, like this, this is the guy.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.080
 Like this is what he is.

11:59.080 --> 12:05.480
 Well, I wonder if there was a different person because you were recording and then offline

12:05.480 --> 12:09.240
 and you can tell you, well, here's the thing though, because that's another part of it

12:09.240 --> 12:13.560
 because that two hours, I would say like half of that was not on the record.

12:13.560 --> 12:18.480
 So like, whenever he's off the record, he changes completely, right?

12:18.480 --> 12:25.000
 I don't want to like go into too much of it or whatever, but like he, I mean, he is so

12:25.000 --> 12:29.960
 mindful of when that camera is on and when the mic is hot in terms of the language that

12:29.960 --> 12:34.240
 he uses, what he's willing to admit, what he's willing to talk about, how he's willing

12:34.240 --> 12:37.520
 to even appear in front of his staff.

12:37.520 --> 12:41.960
 I think the most revealing thing Trump ever did was there was this press conference like

12:41.960 --> 12:46.400
 right after he lost you, right after the midterm elections of 2018.

12:46.400 --> 12:50.560
 And one of the journalists was like, Mr. President, thank you for doing this press conference.

12:50.560 --> 12:52.960
 And he looks at him and he goes, it's called earned media.

12:52.960 --> 12:53.960
 It's worth billions.

12:53.960 --> 12:59.440
 He just had so much disdain for him because he's like, I'm not doing this for you.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.920
 He's like, I'm doing this for me.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.240
 So he's really aware of the narratives of the story.

13:03.240 --> 13:08.680
 I mean, the people have talked about that all comes from the tabloid media of the, from

13:08.680 --> 13:09.680
 New York and so on.

13:09.680 --> 13:10.960
 He's a master of that.

13:10.960 --> 13:17.160
 But I've also heard stories of just in private, he's a really, I don't want to overuse the

13:17.160 --> 13:24.880
 word charismatic, but just like, he is a really interesting, almost like friendly, like a

13:24.880 --> 13:25.880
 good person.

13:25.880 --> 13:30.160
 Like, that's what I heard, I haven't heard actually surprising the same thing about Hillary

13:30.160 --> 13:31.160
 Clinton.

13:31.160 --> 13:35.160
 That I can't tell you anything about.

13:35.160 --> 13:40.880
 But like the way they present themselves is perhaps very different than they are as human

13:40.880 --> 13:41.880
 beings.

13:41.880 --> 13:49.600
 But that's something, maybe that's just like a skill thing, maybe the way they present

13:49.600 --> 13:56.960
 themselves in public is actually, I mean, almost their real self and they're just really

13:56.960 --> 14:03.080
 good in private one on one to go into this mode of just being really intimate in some

14:03.080 --> 14:04.080
 kind of human way.

14:04.080 --> 14:08.920
 I think that's part of it because I noticed that with Trump, he's almost like a tour guide.

14:08.920 --> 14:12.400
 It was very like, it's very crazy, right, because you're like, you're in the Oval.

14:12.400 --> 14:13.400
 I mean, it's his office.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.400
 And he's like, he's like, do you guys want anything?

14:15.400 --> 14:16.400
 He's like, you want a Diet Coke?

14:16.400 --> 14:18.400
 Because he drinks like all this Diet Coke.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
 That's awesome.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
 You know what I mean?

14:20.400 --> 14:21.400
 That's great.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.400
 I apologize.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.400
 I love it.

14:23.400 --> 14:24.400
 Yeah, he's just like, he's like, you guys want a Diet Coke, right?

14:24.400 --> 14:29.520
 And you're sitting there and you're like, the way he's able to like, like the last time

14:29.520 --> 14:35.440
 I interviewed him, he wanted to do it outside because he like, he's studied himself from

14:35.440 --> 14:39.960
 all angles and he knows exactly how he looks on a camera and with the which lighting.

14:39.960 --> 14:43.520
 And so we were supposed to interview him on camera in the Oval office, which is actually

14:43.520 --> 14:44.520
 rare.

14:44.520 --> 14:45.920
 Like you don't usually get that.

14:45.920 --> 14:49.440
 And they ended up moving it outside at the last minute and he came out and he's like,

14:49.440 --> 14:50.440
 I picked this spot for you.

14:50.440 --> 14:51.440
 He's like, great lighting.

14:51.440 --> 14:52.440
 Yeah.

14:52.440 --> 14:57.000
 I was like, you are your own lighting director, you're the president, right?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.000
 It's great.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.160
 It's so funny.

14:59.160 --> 15:04.240
 But it's like you said, he's very charismatic and friendly.

15:04.240 --> 15:08.800
 I mean, you wouldn't, I mean, look, this is what I mean in terms of the dynamism of these

15:08.800 --> 15:10.880
 people that gets lost.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.360
 And I think even he knows that, like, I don't think he would want that side of him.

15:14.360 --> 15:18.560
 That I, you know, that you see in those off the record moments and more in order to come

15:18.560 --> 15:23.520
 out because he's very keen about how exactly he presents to the public.

15:23.520 --> 15:26.920
 It's like, you know, even his presidential portrait, everybody usually smiles and he

15:26.920 --> 15:27.920
 refused to smile.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.440
 He was like, I want to look like Winston Churchill, you know, like even he knew that.

15:31.440 --> 15:38.840
 I think he believes that he, what, what he kind of implies that he is one of, if not

15:38.840 --> 15:42.080
 the greatest presidents in American history.

15:42.080 --> 15:45.840
 Like people kind of laugh at this, but there's quite, I mean, there's quite a lot of people

15:45.840 --> 15:50.520
 first of all that make the argument that he's the greatest president in history.

15:50.520 --> 15:53.840
 Like I've heard this argument being made.

15:53.840 --> 16:00.560
 And I mean, I don't know what the, first of all, I don't care, like you can't make an

16:00.560 --> 16:02.840
 argument that anyone is the greatest.

16:02.840 --> 16:08.520
 That's just, that's just, I come from a school of like being humble and modest and so on.

16:08.520 --> 16:11.800
 It's like, even Michael, you can't have that conversation.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.800
 Okay.

16:13.800 --> 16:18.880
 So I like that he's humble enough to say like Abraham Lincoln and whatever, like, he says

16:18.880 --> 16:19.880
 maybe Lincoln.

16:19.880 --> 16:20.880
 Maybe.

16:20.880 --> 16:21.880
 Remember that.

16:21.880 --> 16:22.880
 Maybe.

16:22.880 --> 16:23.880
 Maybe.

16:23.880 --> 16:29.160
 Do you think he actually believes that or is that something he understands will create

16:29.160 --> 16:35.960
 news and also perhaps more importantly, piss off a large number of people?

16:35.960 --> 16:44.120
 Is he almost like a musician masterfully playing the emotions of the public or does he, or

16:44.120 --> 16:50.440
 and does he believe when he looks in the mirror, I'm one of the greatest men in history?

16:50.440 --> 16:51.440
 Combination of all three.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.040
 I do think he believes it.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.840
 And for the reason why is I don't think he knows that much about US history.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.280
 I really mean that.

16:57.280 --> 17:00.560
 And that's what I meant whenever I was in there and I realized he was just living in

17:00.560 --> 17:01.560
 the moment.

17:01.560 --> 17:05.360
 I don't think he knew all that much about why, I mean, this is why he was elected in

17:05.360 --> 17:06.360
 many ways, right?

17:06.360 --> 17:10.560
 So I'm not, I'm not saying this is an orbit, like I'm not making a judgment on this.

17:10.560 --> 17:15.640
 I'm just saying, I do think in his mind, he does think he was one of the best presidents

17:15.640 --> 17:19.040
 in American history, largely because, and I encountered this with a lot of people work

17:19.040 --> 17:23.240
 for him, which is that they didn't really know all that much kind of about what came

17:23.240 --> 17:28.280
 before and all that, and it's not necessarily to hold it against them because for in many

17:28.280 --> 17:32.680
 ways is what they were elected to do, or elected to be in many ways.

17:32.680 --> 17:39.360
 It's an interesting question whether knowing history, being a student of history is productive

17:39.360 --> 17:40.360
 or counterproductive.

17:40.360 --> 17:47.120
 I tend to assume I really respect people who are deeply well read in history, like presidents

17:47.120 --> 17:54.240
 that are almost like nerd, history nerds, I admire that, but maybe that gets in the

17:54.240 --> 17:56.880
 way of governance.

17:56.880 --> 17:57.880
 I don't know.

17:57.880 --> 18:03.800
 It's not, you know, I'm just sort of playing devil's advocate to my own beliefs, but it's

18:03.800 --> 18:08.200
 possible that focusing on the moment and the issues and letting history, it's like first

18:08.200 --> 18:15.160
 principles thinking, forget the lessons of the past and just focus on common sense reasoning

18:15.160 --> 18:16.760
 through the problems of today.

18:16.760 --> 18:18.440
 Yeah, it's really hard question.

18:18.440 --> 18:21.920
 In terms of the modern era, I mean, Obama was a student of history.

18:21.920 --> 18:27.440
 He used to have presidential biographers and people over, I mean, famously, like Robert

18:27.440 --> 18:32.520
 Acaro, one of my favorite presidential biographers, he was invited to have dinner with Obama,

18:32.520 --> 18:37.000
 and Obama would pepper some of his, it was interesting because he'd try and justify some

18:37.000 --> 18:40.680
 of the things he didn't do by being like, well, if you look at what they had to do and

18:40.680 --> 18:45.680
 what I have to deal with, mine's much harder, so in that way I was a little pissed off because

18:45.680 --> 18:51.040
 I'd be like, no, that actually, like you're comparing Apple store oranges and all that.

18:51.040 --> 18:56.880
 But if you look at Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt in particular, this was, I mean, a voracious

18:56.880 --> 18:59.640
 reader, not of just American history, all history.

18:59.640 --> 19:06.240
 He wrote just such a bad ass, just incredible, the only, the only president who willed himself

19:06.240 --> 19:07.240
 to greatness.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.440
 That's like the amazing thing about him.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.440
 He wasn't tested by a crisis, right?

19:10.440 --> 19:13.760
 Like, it wasn't not, he didn't have a civil war, he didn't have a World War two, he didn't

19:13.760 --> 19:18.320
 have to found the country literally, or like, didn't have to stave off that, or he didn't

19:18.320 --> 19:20.840
 buy Louisiana Purchase, like all that.

19:20.840 --> 19:28.000
 He literally came into a pretty static country and he could have just governed with, I mean,

19:28.000 --> 19:33.840
 he was, the person who came before him was assassinated, like he easily could have coasted,

19:33.840 --> 19:38.000
 but he literally willed the country into something more.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.080
 And that is, that's always why I've focused a lot on him too, because I'm like, that,

19:42.080 --> 19:45.320
 in many ways, I wouldn't say it's easy to be great during crisis, I mean, like, look

19:45.320 --> 19:46.640
 at Trump, right?

19:46.640 --> 19:51.840
 But there, it can bring out the best within you, but it's a whole other level to bring

19:51.840 --> 19:55.880
 out the best within yourself, just for the sake of doing it, and that's, I think, is

19:55.880 --> 19:56.880
 really interesting.

19:56.880 --> 19:58.200
 The speeches were amazing.

19:58.200 --> 20:04.520
 I'm also a sucker for great speeches, because I tend to see the role of the president as

20:04.520 --> 20:11.720
 in part, like, inspirer in chief, sort of, to be able to, I mean, that's what great leaders

20:11.720 --> 20:18.640
 do, like CEOs, or companies, and so on, establish a vision, a clear vision, and like, like, hit

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
 that hard.

20:19.640 --> 20:26.880
 But the way you establish a vision isn't just like, not to dig at Joe Biden, but like, like

20:26.880 --> 20:33.240
 sleepy, boring statements, you have to sell those statements, and you have to, you know,

20:33.240 --> 20:37.160
 you have to do it in a way where everybody's paying attention, everybody's excited.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.600
 And that, I'll tell you as well, is definitely one of them.

20:40.600 --> 20:47.800
 Obama was, I think, at least early on, I don't know, was incredible at that.

20:47.800 --> 20:52.280
 It does feel that the modern political landscape makes it more difficult to be inspirational

20:52.280 --> 20:55.320
 in a sense, because everything becomes bickering in division.

20:55.320 --> 20:59.400
 I do want to ask you about Trump.

20:59.400 --> 21:03.800
 So, you're now a successful pivcaster.

21:03.800 --> 21:11.080
 I've talked to Joe about Trump, Joe Rogan, and Joe's not interested in talking to Trump.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.400
 It's just fascinating.

21:12.400 --> 21:16.520
 I try to dig into, like, why?

21:16.520 --> 21:22.280
 What would you interview Trump on, like, realignment, for example?

21:22.280 --> 21:27.920
 And do you think it's possible to do a two, three hour conversation with him where you

21:27.920 --> 21:33.960
 will get at something, like, human, or you get at something, like, we were talking about

21:33.960 --> 21:36.040
 the facade he puts forward.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.920
 Do you think you could get past that?

21:37.920 --> 21:39.240
 No, I don't.

21:39.240 --> 21:41.760
 I look, I was a White House correspondent.

21:41.760 --> 21:45.040
 I observed this man very closely.

21:45.040 --> 21:46.320
 I interviewed him.

21:46.320 --> 21:49.440
 I think if that mic is hot, he knows what he's doing.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.160
 He just, he's done this too long, Lex.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.160
 He just knows.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.360
 But do you think he's a different human now after the election?

21:56.360 --> 21:59.560
 Do you think that— Not at all.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.760
 I think he's been the same person since 1976.

22:02.760 --> 22:03.760
 I really do.

22:03.760 --> 22:10.000
 Like, basically, 1976, I studied Trump a lot, and I think he's basically been the core

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
 of who he is and elements of that.

22:13.000 --> 22:18.760
 Ever since he built that, you know, the ice rink in Central Park and got that media attention,

22:18.760 --> 22:19.760
 that was it.

22:19.760 --> 22:20.760
 Yeah, he's a fascinating study.

22:20.760 --> 22:28.600
 I still, I feel there's a hope in me that there would be a podcast like Joe Rogan, like

22:28.600 --> 22:32.920
 a long form podcast, where something could be, you know, and you're actually a really

22:32.920 --> 22:38.600
 good person to do that, where you can have a real conversation that looks back at the

22:38.600 --> 22:40.480
 election and reveal something on us.

22:40.480 --> 22:45.800
 But perhaps he's thinking about running again, and so maybe he'll never let down that guard,

22:45.800 --> 22:46.800
 yes.

22:46.800 --> 22:55.360
 You know, I just love it when there's this switch in people where you start looking back

22:55.360 --> 23:01.640
 at your life and wanting to tell stories, like, you know, trying to extract wisdom and

23:01.640 --> 23:06.400
 realizing you're in this new phase of life where, like, the battles have all been fought.

23:06.400 --> 23:12.640
 Now you're this old, like, former warrior, and now you can tell the stories of that time.

23:12.640 --> 23:16.280
 And it seems like Trump is still at it, like, the young warrior he is.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.160
 He's not in the mode of telling stories.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.720
 You know what I got from Rogan?

23:19.720 --> 23:22.880
 He's the only president who didn't age well in office.

23:22.880 --> 23:23.880
 It's true, right?

23:23.880 --> 23:28.600
 Like, because, and this is what I mean, because he lives in the moment, like, the job actually

23:28.600 --> 23:29.600
 aged Obama.

23:29.600 --> 23:32.080
 I mean, I mean, Bush, same thing.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.080
 Even Clinton.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.080
 Clinton was, like, fat.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.080
 Yeah.

23:35.080 --> 23:39.440
 It looked miserable by, like, 2000 HW, like, I mean, Reagan, famous, actually, yeah, pretty

23:39.440 --> 23:44.880
 much everybody I think about, yeah, including John F. Kennedy, who got much sicker while

23:44.880 --> 23:45.880
 in office.

23:45.880 --> 23:50.840
 If the job, like, weighs on you and makes you physically ill, Trump was, he's the only

23:50.840 --> 23:52.840
 person who just didn't happen to.

23:52.840 --> 23:53.840
 That was amazing.

23:53.840 --> 23:58.800
 He almost got in the stronger, and he was one of the most, like, the climate, there's

23:58.800 --> 24:00.440
 so many people attacking him.

24:00.440 --> 24:06.200
 So much hatred, so much love and hatred, and it was just, it was, I mean, it was whatever

24:06.200 --> 24:10.880
 it was, it was quite masterful and a fascinating study.

24:10.880 --> 24:20.000
 If we, if we stick on Hitler for just a minute, what lessons do you take from that time?

24:20.000 --> 24:26.240
 Do you think it's a unique moment in human history, that World War II, I mean, both

24:26.240 --> 24:34.760
 Stalin and Hitler, you know, is it something that's just an outlier in all of human history

24:34.760 --> 24:40.880
 in terms of the atrocities, or is there the lessons to be learned?

24:40.880 --> 24:46.440
 You mentioned offline that you're not just a student of the entirety of the history,

24:46.440 --> 24:51.040
 but you're also fascinated by just different, like, policies and stuff, like, what's the

24:51.040 --> 24:52.200
 immigration policy?

24:52.200 --> 24:53.680
 What's the policy on science?

24:53.680 --> 24:58.000
 Well, look, Third Reich and power, let me plug it, by Richard Evans, I think, is what

24:58.000 --> 25:02.320
 it was, because that actually will tell you, like, what was it like to live under the Nazi

25:02.320 --> 25:04.840
 regime without the war?

25:04.840 --> 25:09.120
 Yeah, that's a hard question in terms of the lessons that we can learn, because there's

25:09.120 --> 25:14.560
 a lot, and it's actually been over, it's been over indexed almost, everything comes back

25:14.560 --> 25:15.960
 to Hitler in conversation.

25:15.960 --> 25:24.160
 So I kind of think of it within Mao, Stalin and Hitler as, I don't want to say payments

25:24.160 --> 25:33.280
 for, but, like, the end point payment for the sins and the problems of the monarchical

25:33.280 --> 25:38.200
 system that evolve within Europe, basically, like, 1400 and more.

25:38.200 --> 25:45.880
 I basically think that 1400, the wars between France, England, the balance of power, eventually

25:45.880 --> 25:52.320
 World War I, and then Serfdom within Russia, the Russian Revolution, that birthed Stalin,

25:52.320 --> 25:57.560
 same thing, the Kaiser and Imperial Germany and this, like, incredibly crazy system of

25:57.560 --> 26:02.920
 balance of power in World War I, and then same thing within China in terms of the warring

26:02.920 --> 26:08.040
 states and then the disintegration, the European, you know, how this is how they think of it,

26:08.040 --> 26:12.680
 you know, which is like the center of humiliation and they had to have something like this.

26:12.680 --> 26:15.560
 I think of it, I try to think of it within the context of that.

26:15.560 --> 26:19.880
 I don't want to think of, I don't want to sound like an inevitable list, but I think

26:19.880 --> 26:25.280
 of it as I like to think about systems, especially here in DC, that's where I got into politics,

26:25.280 --> 26:31.560
 which is that you have to understand systems of power and the incentives within systems

26:31.560 --> 26:38.520
 and the disincentives and the downside risk of what you're creating, because that is what

26:38.520 --> 26:43.120
 leads and creates the behavior within that system.

26:43.120 --> 26:47.280
 I was just talking to my girlfriend about this yesterday, it's kind of funny, like,

26:47.280 --> 26:51.920
 I read these, I'm obsessed with these books by Robert Caro, the biographies of Lyndon

26:51.920 --> 26:55.400
 Johnson, he's written like 5,000 pages so far and it's still not done.

26:55.400 --> 26:59.640
 Okay, so like, these are, these are like books I based my life on.

26:59.640 --> 27:05.680
 And look, these are Washington and the story of the post New Deal era and forward.

27:05.680 --> 27:10.080
 Not much has changed, like the Senate is the still the Senate, so many of the same problems

27:10.080 --> 27:15.600
 with the Senate are still there, in some cases, no, not, not anymore, but for a while, some

27:15.600 --> 27:19.680
 of the people who were there with Johnson are actually still, one of them is the president

27:19.680 --> 27:22.200
 of the United States, just a joke.

27:22.200 --> 27:26.360
 And you think about also, same with the media relationship, right?

27:26.360 --> 27:31.040
 Like there's this media really, they may have come and gone, like the people who were in

27:31.040 --> 27:37.280
 the media and who were cozy with the administration officials, I mean, they just recreated themselves.

27:37.280 --> 27:41.320
 It's like this, it's like an ecosystem, which doesn't change.

27:41.320 --> 27:47.480
 And the, that's why I'm like, oh, it's not, that was a specific time, that's just DC,

27:47.480 --> 27:53.120
 like that is DC because of the way the system is architected.

27:53.120 --> 27:57.720
 It's pretty much been that way since like 1908, whenever like, you know, Teddy Roosevelt

27:57.720 --> 28:01.360
 was dining with these journalists and he would yell at them and then he would go over to

28:01.360 --> 28:06.720
 the society house and like, in many ways that's now instead of going to Henry Adams's house,

28:06.720 --> 28:12.200
 like the people are congregating in Calorama, which is the richest neighborhood here at

28:12.200 --> 28:14.920
 somebody else's house, like it's the same thing.

28:14.920 --> 28:18.840
 So you have to think about the system and then the incentives within that system about

28:18.840 --> 28:20.520
 what the outcomes that they're producing.

28:20.520 --> 28:23.800
 If you actually want to think about how can I change this from the outside?

28:23.800 --> 28:28.160
 That's also why it's very difficult to change because the system is designed in order to

28:28.160 --> 28:33.800
 produce actually pretty specific outcomes that can only be changed in extraordinary times.

28:33.800 --> 28:41.280
 Yeah, it's sometimes hard to predict what kind of outcomes will result from the incentive,

28:41.280 --> 28:43.040
 the system that you create, right?

28:43.040 --> 28:47.160
 In the case, because especially when it's novel kind of situations, Trump actually

28:47.160 --> 28:49.520
 created a pretty novel situation.

28:49.520 --> 28:56.280
 And a lot of the things that we've seen in the 20th century were very novel systems

28:56.280 --> 28:59.880
 where people are very optimistic about the outcomes, right?

28:59.880 --> 29:05.000
 And then it turned out to not have the results that they predicted.

29:05.000 --> 29:10.200
 In terms of like things being unchanged for the past 100 years and so on, can you like

29:10.200 --> 29:16.680
 Wikipedia style or maybe like in a musical form, like I'm only a Bill, describe to me

29:16.680 --> 29:26.680
 I still sing that to my head sometimes, I'm just a Bill, I don't know what the rest of

29:26.680 --> 29:27.680
 the song is.

29:27.680 --> 29:31.600
 Let's leave that to people's imagination.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.120
 How does this whole thing work?

29:33.120 --> 29:37.200
 How does the U.S. political system work, the three branches?

29:37.200 --> 29:43.200
 How do you think about the system we have now, if you were to try to describe, if aliens

29:43.200 --> 29:49.960
 showed up and asked you like they didn't have time, so this is an elevator thing, should

29:49.960 --> 29:56.200
 we destroy you as you plead to avoid destruction?

29:56.200 --> 29:58.640
 How would you describe how this thing works?

29:58.640 --> 30:03.920
 I would say we come together and we pick the people who make our laws.

30:03.920 --> 30:11.360
 Then we pick the guy who executes those laws and they together pick the people who determine

30:11.360 --> 30:16.560
 whether they or the president is breaking the law at the most basic level.

30:16.560 --> 30:20.280
 That's how I would describe it.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.720
 So the people who make the laws are Congress.

30:22.720 --> 30:29.680
 The executive is charged with executing the laws as passed by Congress, the branches of

30:29.680 --> 30:34.520
 government, and the Supreme Court is picked by the president, confirmed by the Senate,

30:34.520 --> 30:40.920
 which then decides whether you or other people are breaking the law in terms of interpretation

30:40.920 --> 30:42.120
 of that law.

30:42.120 --> 30:43.120
 That's basically it.

30:43.120 --> 30:57.640
 They decide whether those laws fall within the restrictions and the want of the founders

30:57.640 --> 31:02.040
 as expressed by the Constitution of the United States, which is a set of principles that

31:02.040 --> 31:10.680
 we came together in 1787, I want to make sure I get this right, 1787, and decided that we

31:10.680 --> 31:14.880
 were going to live the rest of our lives barring a revolution and more.

31:14.880 --> 31:19.120
 We've made it 200 and something years in order under that system.

31:19.120 --> 31:23.120
 So there's a balance of power because you have multiple branches, there's a tension

31:23.120 --> 31:28.960
 and a balance to it as designed by those original documents.

31:28.960 --> 31:33.240
 Which is the most dysfunctional, the branches, which is your favorite?

31:33.240 --> 31:39.040
 In terms of talking about systems and what's the greatest of concern and what is the greatest

31:39.040 --> 31:41.560
 source of benefit in your view?

31:41.560 --> 31:49.240
 The presidency is my favorite to study, obviously, because it is the one where there's the most

31:49.240 --> 31:54.960
 subjective variable change in terms of the personality involved because of so much power

31:54.960 --> 31:56.880
 imbued within the executive.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.440
 The Senate is actually pretty much the same.

31:59.440 --> 32:05.280
 One of the things I love about reading about the Senate and histories of the Senate is

32:05.280 --> 32:11.160
 you're like, oh yeah, there were always assholes in the Senate who were doing their thing and

32:11.160 --> 32:16.160
 filibustering constantly based upon this or that.

32:16.160 --> 32:23.920
 The personalities involved with the Senate haven't mattered as much since pre Civil War.

32:23.920 --> 32:30.680
 Pre Civil War, you had Henry Clay and then Daniel Webster and John C. Calhoun, who even

32:30.680 --> 32:35.680
 in their own way, they represented larger constituencies and they crafted these compromises up until

32:35.680 --> 32:37.880
 the outbreak of the Civil War, etc.

32:37.880 --> 32:43.000
 But post since then, you don't think about the titans within the Senate.

32:43.000 --> 32:46.840
 Most of that is because a lot of the stuff that they had power over has transferred over

32:46.840 --> 32:47.840
 to the executive.

32:47.840 --> 32:52.120
 So I'm most interested in really in power where it lies.

32:52.120 --> 32:57.080
 It's actually pretty throughout American history, much more used to lie with Congress.

32:57.080 --> 33:02.280
 Now it's obviously just so imbued within the executive that understanding executive power

33:02.280 --> 33:05.000
 is I think the thing I'm probably most interested in here.

33:05.000 --> 33:11.080
 Do you think at this point the amount of power that the president has is corrupting to their

33:11.080 --> 33:14.560
 ability to lead well?

33:14.560 --> 33:18.560
 Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.

33:18.560 --> 33:21.600
 Is there too much power in the presidency?

33:21.600 --> 33:22.840
 There definitely is.

33:22.840 --> 33:28.840
 Part of the problem and one of the things I try to make come across to people is if you're

33:28.840 --> 33:35.720
 the president, unless you have a hyper intentional view of how something must be different in

33:35.720 --> 33:38.000
 government, your view doesn't matter.

33:38.000 --> 33:43.000
 So for example, like if you were Trump, let's take Trump even and even in with a pretty

33:43.000 --> 33:47.520
 intentional view, he was like, I'm going to end the war in Afghanistan and Iraq, right?

33:47.520 --> 33:51.720
 And he came in and he gets these generals in, he's like, I want to end the war in Afghanistan

33:51.720 --> 33:52.720
 and Iraq.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.920
 Oh, and I want to withdraw these troops from Syria.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.360
 And they're like, okay, well, give us like six months.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.360
 He's like, okay.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.360
 And this is the thing about Trump.

33:59.360 --> 34:00.680
 He doesn't realize that it's bullshit.

34:00.680 --> 34:03.520
 So they're like, he's like, six months seems fine, right?

34:03.520 --> 34:07.560
 So then six months comes and he's like, he's like, so, and then he'll announce it.

34:07.560 --> 34:09.440
 He'd be like, and we're getting out of Syria.

34:09.440 --> 34:10.440
 It's great.

34:10.440 --> 34:11.800
 And then the generals freak out.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.720
 They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't have a plan for that.

34:13.720 --> 34:15.120
 He's like, but you guys told me six months.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.120
 He's like, I don't know.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.880
 Now we need another six months in order to figure this thing out.

34:17.880 --> 34:20.080
 So that's, and by that time, now your midterms.

34:20.080 --> 34:22.200
 So now what, now you got to run for reelection.

34:22.200 --> 34:26.340
 So more what I mean by that is, if you don't have a hyperintentional view about how to

34:26.340 --> 34:29.640
 change foreign policy, if you don't have a hyperintentional view about how the Department

34:29.640 --> 34:33.240
 of Commerce should do its job, they are just going to go on autopilot.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.840
 So there's, this is part of the problem.

34:35.840 --> 34:40.760
 When you ask me about the presidency, it's not the presidency itself, like the president

34:40.760 --> 34:43.280
 himself, which has become too powerful.

34:43.280 --> 34:51.800
 It's that we have less democratic checks on the people and the systems that are on autopilot.

34:51.800 --> 35:00.560
 And I would say that basically since 2008, we have voted every single time to disrupt

35:00.560 --> 35:05.000
 that system, except in the case of 2020 with Joe Biden, and there are a lot of different

35:05.000 --> 35:07.120
 reasons around why that happened.

35:07.120 --> 35:12.880
 And in every single one of those cases, Obama and Trump, they all failed in order to, in

35:12.880 --> 35:15.080
 order to radically disrupt that.

35:15.080 --> 35:17.680
 And that just shows you how titanic the task is.

35:17.680 --> 35:21.800
 And I'm using my language precisely because I don't want to be like deep state, but like

35:21.800 --> 35:22.800
 obviously there's deep state.

35:22.800 --> 35:26.200
 Deep state, I guess, has conspiratorial attention to it.

35:26.200 --> 35:32.120
 But so what you're saying is the true power currently lies with the autopilot, okay, deep

35:32.120 --> 35:33.120
 state.

35:33.120 --> 35:36.960
 Well, but see, it's not, this is the thing too, I want to make it clear because I think

35:36.960 --> 35:42.120
 people think conspiratorially that they're all coming together to intentionally do something.

35:42.120 --> 35:43.280
 No, no, no, no.

35:43.280 --> 35:49.440
 They are doing what they know, believe they are right, and don't have real democratic

35:49.440 --> 35:50.800
 checks within that.

35:50.800 --> 35:55.040
 And so now they have entire generations of cultures within each of these bureaucracies

35:55.040 --> 35:59.720
 where they say, this is the way that we do things around here.

35:59.720 --> 36:05.760
 And that's the problem, which is that we have a culture of within many of these agencies

36:05.760 --> 36:12.720
 and more, I think the best example for this would be during the Ukraine, you know, gate

36:12.720 --> 36:14.560
 with Trump and all that with the impeachment.

36:14.560 --> 36:17.680
 And I don't want to, I'm not talking about the politics here, but the most revealing

36:17.680 --> 36:22.780
 thing that happened was when the whistleblower guy, Alexander Vindman, was like, here you

36:22.780 --> 36:27.240
 have the president departing from the policy of the United States.

36:27.240 --> 36:33.640
 And I was like, well, let me educate you, Lieutenant Colonel, the president of the United

36:33.640 --> 36:36.480
 States makes American foreign policy.

36:36.480 --> 36:42.040
 But it was a very revealing comment because he and all the people within national security

36:42.040 --> 36:46.800
 bureaucracy do think that they're like, this is the policy of the United States.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.360
 We have to do this.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.360
 That's where things get screwy.

36:49.360 --> 36:53.600
 Well, listen, for me personally, but also from an engineering perspective, I just talked

36:53.600 --> 36:58.880
 to Jim Keller, it's just, this is the kind of bullshit that we all hate when you're

36:58.880 --> 37:02.440
 trying to innovate and design new products.

37:02.440 --> 37:07.600
 So like that's the, that's what first principles thinking requires is like, we don't give a

37:07.600 --> 37:09.080
 shit what was done before.

37:09.080 --> 37:11.720
 The point is, what is the best way to do it?

37:11.720 --> 37:16.920
 And it seems like the current government, government in general, probably bureaucracies

37:16.920 --> 37:23.640
 in general are just really good at being lazy about never having those conversations and

37:23.640 --> 37:29.160
 just it becomes this momentum thing that nobody has the difficult conversations.

37:29.160 --> 37:34.040
 It's become a game within a certain set of constraints and they never kind of do revolutionary

37:34.040 --> 37:35.040
 tasks.

37:35.040 --> 37:40.600
 But you did say that the presidency is power, but you're saying that more power than the

37:40.600 --> 37:46.720
 others, but that power has to be coupled with like focused intentionality, like you have

37:46.720 --> 37:48.560
 to keep hammering the thing.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.000
 If you want it done, it has to be done.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.760
 I mean, and you got to, you got to, this is the other part too, which is that it's not

37:55.760 --> 38:01.640
 just that you have to get it done, you have to pick the hundred people who you can trust

38:01.640 --> 38:06.880
 to pick 10 people each to actually do what you want.

38:06.880 --> 38:10.640
 One of the most revealing quotes is from a guy named Tommy Corcoran.

38:10.640 --> 38:15.120
 He was the top aide to FDR, this I'm getting from the Carol books too.

38:15.120 --> 38:17.320
 And he said, what is a government?

38:17.320 --> 38:20.800
 It's not just one guy or even 10 guys.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.520
 Hell, it's a thousand guys.

38:23.520 --> 38:29.560
 And what FDR did is he masterfully picked the right people to execute his will through

38:29.560 --> 38:31.080
 the federal agencies.

38:31.080 --> 38:32.840
 Johnson was the same way.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.760
 He played these people like a fiddle.

38:34.760 --> 38:39.160
 He knew exactly who to pick, he knew the system and more.

38:39.160 --> 38:43.560
 Part of the reason that outsiders who don't have a lot of experience in Washington almost

38:43.560 --> 38:48.400
 always fail is they don't know who to pick or they pick people who say one thing to their

38:48.400 --> 38:54.320
 face and then when it comes time to carry out the president's policy in terms of the government,

38:54.320 --> 38:55.480
 they just don't do it.

38:55.480 --> 38:58.880
 And the president's too, think about this, I think some, Rahm Emanuel said this.

38:58.880 --> 39:03.040
 He was like, by the time it gets to the president's desk, nobody else can solve it.

39:03.040 --> 39:04.040
 It's not easy.

39:04.040 --> 39:05.800
 It's not like a yes or no question.

39:05.800 --> 39:11.000
 It's every single thing that hits the president's desk is incredibly hard to do.

39:11.000 --> 39:15.200
 And Obama actually even said, and this was a very revealing quote about how he thinks

39:15.200 --> 39:16.640
 about the presidency.

39:16.640 --> 39:22.040
 Which is, he's like, look, the presidency is like one of those super tankers.

39:22.040 --> 39:27.480
 He's like, I can come in and I can make it two degrees left and two degrees right.

39:27.480 --> 39:32.040
 In a hundred years, two degrees left, that's a whole different trajectory.

39:32.040 --> 39:33.040
 Same thing on the right.

39:33.040 --> 39:36.920
 And he's like, that ultimately is really all you can do.

39:36.920 --> 39:41.760
 I quibble and disagree with that in terms of how he could have changed things in 2008,

39:41.760 --> 39:43.400
 but there's a lot of truth to that statement.

39:43.400 --> 39:44.400
 Okay.

39:44.400 --> 39:45.400
 That's really fascinating.

39:45.400 --> 39:52.240
 And I think that actually both Obama and Trump are probably playing victim here to the system.

39:52.240 --> 39:57.680
 You're making me think that maybe you can correct me that, because I'm thinking of like

39:57.680 --> 40:04.240
 Elon Musk, whose major success despite everything is hiring the right people.

40:04.240 --> 40:08.600
 And like creating those thousands, that structure of a thousand people.

40:08.600 --> 40:13.160
 So maybe a president has power in that if they were exceptionally good at hiring the

40:13.160 --> 40:14.160
 right people.

40:14.160 --> 40:15.680
 That's Elon's policy, man.

40:15.680 --> 40:16.760
 That's what it comes down to.

40:16.760 --> 40:20.640
 But wouldn't you be able to steer the ship way more than two degrees if you hire the

40:20.640 --> 40:21.640
 right people?

40:21.640 --> 40:25.280
 So like, it's almost like Obama was not good at hiring the right people.

40:25.280 --> 40:27.040
 Well, he hired all the Clinton people.

40:27.040 --> 40:28.040
 That's what happened.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.040
 What happened with Trump?

40:29.040 --> 40:30.040
 He hired all the Bush people.

40:30.040 --> 40:35.440
 And then you just sit back and say, oh, president can't, but that means you're just suck at

40:35.440 --> 40:36.440
 hiring.

40:36.440 --> 40:37.440
 Correct.

40:37.440 --> 40:38.440
 Yeah.

40:38.440 --> 40:39.440
 I mean, look, I know it's funny.

40:39.440 --> 40:43.840
 I'm giving you simultaneously the nationalist case against Trump and the progressive case

40:43.840 --> 40:44.840
 against Obama.

40:44.840 --> 40:45.840
 Yes.

40:45.840 --> 40:49.040
 The progressive people are like, why the fuck are you hiring all these Clinton people in

40:49.040 --> 40:51.640
 order to run the government and just recreate?

40:51.640 --> 40:55.680
 Like, why are you hiring Larry Summers, who was one of the people who worked at all these

40:55.680 --> 40:58.560
 banks and didn't believe the bailouts were going to be big enough.

40:58.560 --> 41:02.640
 And then to come in in the worst economic crisis in modern American history.

41:02.640 --> 41:03.880
 That was 2008.

41:03.880 --> 41:08.440
 And Summers actively lobbied against larger bailouts, which had huge implications for

41:08.440 --> 41:12.400
 working class people and pretty much hollowed out America since.

41:12.400 --> 41:13.880
 Okay, from Trump.

41:13.880 --> 41:14.880
 Same thing.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.120
 You're like, I'm going to drain the swamp.

41:16.120 --> 41:22.600
 And by doing that, I'm going to hire Goldman Sachs's Gary Cohn and Steve Mnuchin and all

41:22.600 --> 41:27.640
 these other absolute Bush clowns in order to run my White House.

41:27.640 --> 41:29.400
 Well, yeah, no shit.

41:29.400 --> 41:34.240
 The only thing that you accomplished in your four years in office is passing a massive

41:34.240 --> 41:37.280
 tax cut for the rich and for corporations.

41:37.280 --> 41:39.040
 I wonder how that happened.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.360
 What role does money play in all of this?

41:41.360 --> 41:46.600
 Is money a huge influence in politics, super PACs, all that kind of stuff?

41:46.600 --> 41:50.640
 Or is this more just kind of a narrative that we play with?

41:50.640 --> 41:54.880
 Because from the outsider's perspective, it seems to have, that seems to be one of the

41:54.880 --> 41:56.920
 fundamental problems with modern politics.

41:56.920 --> 42:01.560
 So I was just having this conversation, Marshall and I, Marshall Kossoff, my coast on the realignment.

42:01.560 --> 42:08.280
 And it's funny because if you do enough research, we actually live in the least corrupt age

42:08.280 --> 42:11.040
 in American campaign finance.

42:11.040 --> 42:13.280
 Because it's never been more transparent.

42:13.280 --> 42:18.360
 It's never been more up to the FEC and all of that.

42:18.360 --> 42:22.480
 If you go back and read, not even 50 years ago, we're talking about Lyndon B. Johnson

42:22.480 --> 42:28.680
 handing people, literally as he came up in his youth, paying people for votes.

42:28.680 --> 42:34.800
 The boss of the person who had all the Mexican votes, the person who had, and he was giving

42:34.800 --> 42:35.800
 out briefcases.

42:35.800 --> 42:40.920
 This is within people's lifetimes who are alive in America, so that doesn't happen anymore.

42:40.920 --> 42:46.480
 But I don't like to blame everything on money, although I do think money is obviously a huge

42:46.480 --> 42:47.480
 part of the problem.

42:47.480 --> 42:54.240
 I actually look at it in terms of distribution, which is that how is money distributed within

42:54.240 --> 42:55.560
 our society?

42:55.560 --> 43:01.840
 Because I firmly believe that politics, this is going to get complicated, but I think politics

43:01.840 --> 43:04.720
 is mostly downstream from culture.

43:04.720 --> 43:08.240
 And culture, obviously, I'm using economics because there's obviously a huge interplay

43:08.240 --> 43:09.240
 there.

43:09.240 --> 43:13.920
 In terms of the equitable or lack of equitable distribution of money within our politics,

43:13.920 --> 43:18.240
 what we're really pissed off about is we're like, our politics only seems to work for

43:18.240 --> 43:20.080
 the people who have money.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.960
 I think that's largely true.

43:21.960 --> 43:27.040
 I think that the reason why things worked differently in the past is because our economy

43:27.040 --> 43:29.080
 was structured in different ways.

43:29.080 --> 43:34.360
 And there's a reason that our politics today are very analogous to the last Gilded Age

43:34.360 --> 43:40.720
 because we had very similar levels of economic distribution and cultural problems too at

43:40.720 --> 43:41.720
 the same time.

43:41.720 --> 43:44.360
 I don't want to erase that because I actually think that's what's driving all of our politics

43:44.360 --> 43:45.360
 right now.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.360
 So that's interesting.

43:46.360 --> 43:50.880
 So in that sense, the representative government is doing a pretty good job at representing

43:50.880 --> 43:54.680
 the state of culture and the people and so on.

43:54.680 --> 44:00.400
 Can I ask you, in terms of the deep state and conspiracy theories, there's a lot of

44:00.400 --> 44:06.760
 talk about, again, from an outsider's perspective, if I were just looking at Twitter, it seems

44:06.760 --> 44:13.840
 that at least 90% of people in government are pedophiles, 90 to 95%, I'm not sure what

44:13.840 --> 44:14.840
 that number is.

44:14.840 --> 44:15.840
 Yeah.

44:15.840 --> 44:19.360
 If I were to just look at Twitter, honestly, or YouTube, I would think most of the world

44:19.360 --> 44:20.360
 is a pedophile.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.080
 I would almost feel like...

44:22.080 --> 44:23.080
 Right.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.080
 And if you don't fully believe that, you're a pedophile.

44:25.080 --> 44:26.080
 Yeah.

44:26.080 --> 44:27.080
 Yeah.

44:27.080 --> 44:31.040
 And I wonder, like, wait, am I a pedophile too?

44:31.040 --> 44:34.280
 I'm either a communist or a pedophile, or both, I guess.

44:34.280 --> 44:36.480
 Yeah, that's going to be clipped out.

44:36.480 --> 44:39.400
 Thank you, internet.

44:39.400 --> 44:42.520
 I look forward to your emails.

44:42.520 --> 44:50.800
 But is there any kind of shadow conspiracy theories that give you pause?

44:50.800 --> 44:56.360
 Or sort of the flip side, the response to a lot of conspiracy theories is like, no,

44:56.360 --> 45:01.880
 the reason this happened is because it's a combination of just incompetence.

45:01.880 --> 45:06.360
 So where do you land on some of these conspiracy theories?

45:06.360 --> 45:09.440
 I think most conspiracy theories are wrong.

45:09.440 --> 45:13.320
 Some are true, and those are spectacularly true.

45:13.320 --> 45:14.880
 And if that makes sense.

45:14.880 --> 45:15.880
 Yeah.

45:15.880 --> 45:16.880
 And we don't know which ones.

45:16.880 --> 45:17.880
 I don't know which ones.

45:17.880 --> 45:18.880
 That's the problem.

45:18.880 --> 45:21.480
 I think, oh, well, I mean, look, man, I listened to your podcast.

45:21.480 --> 45:27.720
 I think I was a huge nonbeliever in UFOs, and now I've probably never believed more

45:27.720 --> 45:28.720
 in UFOs.

45:28.720 --> 45:30.920
 I believe in UFOs.

45:30.920 --> 45:35.040
 I'm very comfortable being like, not only do I believe in UFOs, I think we're probably

45:35.040 --> 45:37.760
 being visited by an alien civilization.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.840
 And if you asked me that three years ago, I would be like, you're out of your fucking

45:40.840 --> 45:41.840
 mind.

45:41.840 --> 45:42.840
 Like, what are you talking about?

45:42.840 --> 45:43.840
 Well, listen to David Fravor.

45:43.840 --> 45:45.000
 That's all I have to say.

45:45.000 --> 45:46.000
 That's it.

45:46.000 --> 45:50.800
 Well, I have the sense that the government has information, it hasn't revealed.

45:50.800 --> 45:55.000
 But it's not like they're, I don't think they're holding, there's like a green guy

45:55.000 --> 45:56.000
 sitting there in a room.

45:56.000 --> 45:57.000
 Right.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
 Exactly.

45:58.000 --> 46:00.680
 They just, they have seen things they don't know what to do with, so it's like, they're

46:00.680 --> 46:01.680
 confused.

46:01.680 --> 46:04.560
 They're afraid of revealing that they don't know.

46:04.560 --> 46:05.560
 That's what I think it is.

46:05.560 --> 46:06.560
 They don't know.

46:06.560 --> 46:07.560
 Right.

46:07.560 --> 46:09.200
 It's revealing exactly that they don't know.

46:09.200 --> 46:12.480
 And then in the process, there's a lot of fears tied up in that.

46:12.480 --> 46:17.800
 First, looking incompetent in the public eye, nobody wants to be looked at way.

46:17.800 --> 46:23.040
 And the other is like, in revealing it, even though they don't know, maybe China will figure

46:23.040 --> 46:24.040
 it out.

46:24.040 --> 46:25.040
 Exactly.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.880
 So like, we don't want China to figure it out first.

46:26.880 --> 46:31.960
 And so that, all those kinds of things result in basically secrecy, then that damages the

46:31.960 --> 46:37.000
 trust in institutions on one of the most fascinating aspects.

46:37.000 --> 46:42.960
 Like one of the most fascinating mysteries of humankind of, is there life, intelligent

46:42.960 --> 46:44.480
 life out there in the universe?

46:44.480 --> 46:48.440
 So that's one of them, but there's other ones.

46:48.440 --> 46:53.640
 For me, when I first came across, actually, Alex Jones was 911.

46:53.640 --> 46:59.480
 I remember like, because I was in Chicago, I was thinking like, oh, shit, are they gonna

46:59.480 --> 47:00.480
 hit Chicago too?

47:00.480 --> 47:01.480
 That's right.

47:01.480 --> 47:02.480
 Everybody was thinking.

47:02.480 --> 47:03.480
 Yeah.

47:03.480 --> 47:05.160
 Everybody was thinking like, what does this mean?

47:05.160 --> 47:06.160
 What scale?

47:06.160 --> 47:07.760
 I mean, trying to interpret it.

47:07.760 --> 47:12.480
 And I remember looking for information desperately, like what happened?

47:12.480 --> 47:18.000
 And I remember not being satisfied with the quality of reporting and figuring out like

47:18.000 --> 47:21.480
 rigorous like, here's exactly what happened.

47:21.480 --> 47:26.560
 And so people like Alex Jones stepped up and others that said like, there's some shady

47:26.560 --> 47:28.000
 shit going on.

47:28.000 --> 47:31.920
 And it sure is how it looked like there's shady shit going on.

47:31.920 --> 47:37.280
 So like, and I still stand behind the fact that it seems like there's not, there's not

47:37.280 --> 47:41.720
 enough, like it wasn't a good job of being honest and transparent and all those kinds

47:41.720 --> 47:42.720
 of things.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.720
 Because it would implicate the Saudis.

47:43.720 --> 47:44.720
 Let's be honest.

47:44.720 --> 47:46.120
 See, that's my conspiracy theories.

47:46.120 --> 47:49.280
 I'm like, yeah, I think they covered up a lot of stuff because they wanted to cover

47:49.280 --> 47:51.000
 up for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

47:51.000 --> 47:54.360
 Like, I mean, that was a conspiracy theory not that long ago.

47:54.360 --> 47:55.360
 I think it's true.

47:55.360 --> 47:57.000
 I mean, I think it's 100% true.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.000
 Yeah.

47:58.000 --> 47:59.880
 So those kinds of conspiracy theories are interesting.

47:59.880 --> 48:05.480
 I mean, there's other ones for me personally that touched the institution that means a

48:05.480 --> 48:09.680
 lot to me is MIT and, you know, Jeffrey Epstein.

48:09.680 --> 48:10.680
 I want to hear a lot more.

48:10.680 --> 48:11.680
 I want to hear about that.

48:11.680 --> 48:12.680
 I talk about Epstein a lot.

48:12.680 --> 48:13.680
 So I'm like...

48:13.680 --> 48:14.680
 Oh, you do.

48:14.680 --> 48:15.680
 Yeah.

48:15.680 --> 48:18.840
 And he, I was going to say in terms of conspiracy theory, that one changed my outlook because

48:18.840 --> 48:25.000
 I was like, I was like, whoa, like you have this dude who convinced some of the most successful

48:25.000 --> 48:31.240
 people on earth that he was like some money manager and it looks like it was totally fake.

48:31.240 --> 48:32.240
 Like Leon Black.

48:32.240 --> 48:36.840
 I mean, this is one of the richest men on Wall Street, $9 billion net worth.

48:36.840 --> 48:42.640
 Why has he given him over a hundred million dollars between 2015 and 2019?

48:42.640 --> 48:43.960
 What's going on here?

48:43.960 --> 48:44.960
 Lex Wexner.

48:44.960 --> 48:49.280
 So yeah, I want to hear because you know people who met him and the only person I know who

48:49.280 --> 48:50.760
 met him was Eric Weinstein.

48:50.760 --> 48:51.760
 I've heard his.

48:51.760 --> 48:52.760
 Right.

48:52.760 --> 48:53.760
 Oh boy.

48:53.760 --> 48:54.760
 So I...

48:54.760 --> 48:59.400
 Listen, I'm still in and Eric is fascinating and like Eric is full on saying that...

48:59.400 --> 49:00.400
 Right.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.400
 He was a Mossad or whatever.

49:01.400 --> 49:02.400
 Yeah.

49:02.400 --> 49:07.000
 He was in front for something, something much, much bigger.

49:07.000 --> 49:13.080
 And there's whatever his name, Robert Maxwell, all the, all those stories, like you could

49:13.080 --> 49:17.520
 dig deeper and deeper that Jeff is just like the tip of the iceberg.

49:17.520 --> 49:22.760
 I just think he's an exceptionally charismatic, listen, this isn't speaking from confidence

49:22.760 --> 49:28.800
 or like deep understanding of the situation, but from my speaking with people, he just

49:28.800 --> 49:37.000
 seems like, at least from the side of his influence and interaction with researchers,

49:37.000 --> 49:45.000
 he just seems like somebody that was exceptionally charismatic and actually took interest.

49:45.000 --> 49:52.040
 He was unable to speak about interesting scientific things, but he took interest in them.

49:52.040 --> 49:57.800
 So he knew how to stroke the egos of a lot of powerful people like well, like in different

49:57.800 --> 49:58.800
 kinds of ways.

49:58.800 --> 50:04.560
 I suppose I don't know about this because I don't have, like if a really, okay, this

50:04.560 --> 50:11.520
 is, this is weird to say, but I have an ability, okay, I think women are beautiful.

50:11.520 --> 50:18.440
 I like women, but like if, if like a supermodel came to me or something, like, like I'm able

50:18.440 --> 50:19.440
 to reason.

50:19.440 --> 50:23.760
 It seems like some people are not able to think clearly when there's like an attractive

50:23.760 --> 50:25.440
 woman in the room.

50:25.440 --> 50:29.720
 And I think that was one of the tools he used to manipulate people.

50:29.720 --> 50:30.720
 Interesting.

50:30.720 --> 50:31.720
 I don't know.

50:31.720 --> 50:33.520
 Listen, it's like the pedophile thing.

50:33.520 --> 50:38.200
 I don't know how many people are complete sex addicts, but like it seems like, like

50:38.200 --> 50:42.200
 looking out into the world, like there's a, well, like the Me Too movement have revealed

50:42.200 --> 50:47.200
 that there's a lot of like weird, like creepy people out there.

50:47.200 --> 50:54.880
 I don't know, but I think it was just one of the many tools that he used to convince

50:54.880 --> 51:04.760
 people and manipulate people, but not in some like evil way, but more just really good at

51:04.760 --> 51:11.040
 the art of conversation and just winning people over on the side.

51:11.040 --> 51:15.440
 And then by building, through that process, building a network of other really powerful

51:15.440 --> 51:23.600
 people and not explicitly, but implicitly having done shady shit with powerful people

51:23.600 --> 51:34.880
 like building up a kind of implied power of like, like we did some shady shit together.

51:34.880 --> 51:39.640
 So we're not like, you're going to help me out on this extra thing I need to do now.

51:39.640 --> 51:45.160
 And that builds and builds and builds to where you're able to actually control, like have

51:45.160 --> 51:50.440
 quite a lot of power without explicitly having like a strategy meeting.

51:50.440 --> 51:56.720
 And I think a single person or yeah, I think a single person can do that, can start that

51:56.720 --> 51:58.400
 ball rolling.

51:58.400 --> 52:03.600
 And over time, it becomes a group thing, like, I don't know if Jillian Maxwell was involved

52:03.600 --> 52:05.440
 or others.

52:05.440 --> 52:11.720
 And yeah, over time, it becomes almost like a really powerful organization that wasn't,

52:11.720 --> 52:17.000
 that's not a front for something much deeper and bigger, but it's almost like, maybe it's

52:17.000 --> 52:19.480
 because I love cellular automata, man.

52:19.480 --> 52:24.880
 A system that starts out as a simple thing with simple rules can create incredible complexity.

52:24.880 --> 52:25.880
 Yes.

52:25.880 --> 52:30.760
 And so I just think that we're now looking in retrospect, it looks like an incredibly

52:30.760 --> 52:33.080
 complex system that's operating.

52:33.080 --> 52:37.680
 But like, that's just because it's, you know, there could be a lot of other Jeffrey Epstein's

52:37.680 --> 52:42.880
 in my perspective, that the simple thing just was successful early on and builds and builds

52:42.880 --> 52:44.480
 and builds and builds.

52:44.480 --> 52:50.240
 And then there's creepy shit that like a lot of aspects of the system helped it get bigger

52:50.240 --> 52:52.520
 and bigger and more powerful and so on.

52:52.520 --> 52:59.960
 So the final result is, I mean, listen, I have a pretty optimistic, I tend to see the

52:59.960 --> 53:02.040
 good in people.

53:02.040 --> 53:08.480
 And so it's been heartbreaking to me in general, just to see, you know, people I look up to

53:08.480 --> 53:14.120
 not have the level of integrity I thought they would, or like the strength of character,

53:14.120 --> 53:15.500
 all those kinds of things.

53:15.500 --> 53:21.960
 And it seems like you should be able to see the bullshit that is Jeffrey Epstein, like

53:21.960 --> 53:23.960
 when you meet him.

53:23.960 --> 53:28.760
 We're not talking about like Eric Weinstein, like one or two or three or five interactions.

53:28.760 --> 53:34.000
 But like there's people that had like years of relationship with him.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.000
 And I don't know.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.000
 I'm not sure.

53:36.000 --> 53:37.000
 Even after he was convicted.

53:37.000 --> 53:38.000
 After he was convicted.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.720
 That's the thing that always gets me.

53:39.720 --> 53:40.720
 Yeah.

53:40.720 --> 53:41.720
 There's stories.

53:41.720 --> 53:52.120
 There's stories to sort of, I honestly believe, okay, here's the open question I have.

53:52.120 --> 53:56.680
 I don't know how many creepy sexual people are out there.

53:56.680 --> 54:03.240
 Like, I don't know if there is like, like the people I know, the faculty and so on.

54:03.240 --> 54:08.480
 I don't know if they have like a kink that I'm just not aware of that was being leveraged.

54:08.480 --> 54:16.640
 Because to me, it seems like if people aren't, if not everybody's a pedophile, then it's

54:16.640 --> 54:18.720
 just the art of conversation.

54:18.720 --> 54:24.280
 That is just like the art of just like manipulating people by making them feel good about like

54:24.280 --> 54:25.800
 the exciting stuff they're doing.

54:25.800 --> 54:28.520
 Listen, man, academics, people talk about money.

54:28.520 --> 54:31.680
 I don't think academics care about money as much as people think.

54:31.680 --> 54:38.320
 What they care about is like somebody, they want to be, it's the same thing that Instagram

54:38.320 --> 54:42.760
 models post in their butt pictures is they want to be loved.

54:42.760 --> 54:43.760
 They want attention.

54:43.760 --> 54:44.760
 My parents are professors.

54:44.760 --> 54:45.760
 Yeah.

54:45.760 --> 54:46.760
 I get it.

54:46.760 --> 54:47.760
 Yeah.

54:47.760 --> 54:48.760
 Yeah.

54:48.760 --> 54:52.240
 They, and Jeff Epstein, like the money is another way to show attention.

54:52.240 --> 54:53.240
 Right.

54:53.240 --> 54:54.240
 It's a proxy.

54:54.240 --> 54:56.200
 It's, mind work matters.

54:56.200 --> 55:02.640
 And he for some of, he did that for some of the weirdest, most brilliant people.

55:02.640 --> 55:06.280
 I don't want to sort of drop names, but everybody knows them.

55:06.280 --> 55:11.080
 It's like people that are the most interesting academics is the one he cared about.

55:11.080 --> 55:12.080
 Yeah.

55:12.080 --> 55:16.080
 Like people that are thinking about the most difficult questions in all of science and

55:16.080 --> 55:17.080
 all of engineering.

55:17.080 --> 55:22.880
 So those people were kind of outcasts in academia a little bit because they're doing the weird

55:22.880 --> 55:23.880
 shit.

55:23.880 --> 55:24.880
 They were the weirdos.

55:24.880 --> 55:31.200
 And he cared about the weirdos and he gave them money and that, you know, that's, I don't

55:31.200 --> 55:33.960
 know if there's something more nefarious than that.

55:33.960 --> 55:38.600
 I, I hope not, but maybe I'm surprised and in fact, half the population of the world

55:38.600 --> 55:39.600
 is pedophiles.

55:39.600 --> 55:45.400
 No, I think it's what you were talking about, which is that it's the, it's the implication

55:45.400 --> 55:46.840
 after the initial, right?

55:46.840 --> 55:50.400
 Like you do some shady things together or you do something that you want out of the

55:50.400 --> 55:54.360
 public eye and you're a public person and look, we probably even experience this to

55:54.360 --> 55:55.360
 a limited extent, right?

55:55.360 --> 55:59.040
 You're like, ah, you know, like, I don't want to, I don't know, I almost lost my temper,

55:59.040 --> 56:02.440
 you know, one time whenever a car hit me and I'm like, I can't freak out in public anymore.

56:02.440 --> 56:05.480
 Like that, you know, like, what if somebody takes a photo or something?

56:05.480 --> 56:10.240
 And so I think that there's an extent to that times a billion, literally when you have a

56:10.240 --> 56:14.920
 billion dollars or more and you take that all together and you stack it up on itself.

56:14.920 --> 56:19.520
 I saw a story about like Bill Clinton, like Bill Clinton was with Epstein or with Ghislaine

56:19.520 --> 56:23.360
 Maxwell in a private air terminal or something.

56:23.360 --> 56:28.320
 And she had one of their like sex, you know, one of those girls who was underage had her

56:28.320 --> 56:34.040
 dressed up in a literal like pilot uniform and she was underage in order to, you know,

56:34.040 --> 56:39.120
 and she was just being disguised for being older and she was a masseuse, right?

56:39.120 --> 56:43.680
 Because that was one of the guises which they got in order to sexually traffic these women.

56:43.680 --> 56:46.680
 And she was like, Bill was like complaining about his neck and she's like, give Bill Clinton

56:46.680 --> 56:47.760
 a massage, right?

56:47.760 --> 56:51.400
 So now there's a photo of an underage girl giving a massage to the former president of

56:51.400 --> 56:52.720
 the United States.

56:52.720 --> 56:54.720
 I don't think he knew, right?

56:54.720 --> 56:56.800
 But like, that looks bad.

56:56.800 --> 57:00.920
 And so this is kind of what we're getting at, which is that you're setting it all up

57:00.920 --> 57:03.080
 and creating those preconditions.

57:03.080 --> 57:08.760
 Or like Prince Andrew, do I think Prince Andrew knew that Virginia Gouffre was underage?

57:08.760 --> 57:09.760
 I don't know.

57:09.760 --> 57:13.360
 Probably knew she was pretty young, which I think is, you know, skeevy enough where

57:13.360 --> 57:16.040
 you're a fucking prince, you probably know better.

57:16.040 --> 57:18.840
 But I don't think he knew she was underage.

57:18.840 --> 57:19.840
 Or maybe he did.

57:19.840 --> 57:22.280
 And if he did, then he's even more of a piece of shit than I thought.

57:22.280 --> 57:27.760
 But when we look at these things, the stuff I'm more interested in is like what you were

57:27.760 --> 57:28.760
 talking about.

57:28.760 --> 57:33.960
 I'm like, Bill Gates, how do you get the richest man in the world in your house?

57:33.960 --> 57:34.960
 Under what?

57:34.960 --> 57:37.320
 Gates is like, he was talking about financing and all this.

57:37.320 --> 57:40.400
 I'm like, you don't have access to money or bankers?

57:40.400 --> 57:42.760
 Like you're the richest man in the world.

57:42.760 --> 57:46.400
 You can call Goldman Sachs anytime you want on a hotline.

57:46.400 --> 57:51.040
 Like why do you need, that's where I start again to get more conspiratorial because I'm

57:51.040 --> 57:54.720
 like, Bill, dude, you have the gold credit, right?

57:54.720 --> 57:59.680
 Like you don't need Epstein to create some complicated financing structure.

57:59.680 --> 58:06.200
 Or Leon Black, like what is 2015, 2009, I mean, this is very recent stuff.

58:06.200 --> 58:10.400
 Or and this is the part that really got me is I read the department, I think it's called

58:10.400 --> 58:15.600
 the department of financial service report around Deutsche Bank with Epstein.

58:15.600 --> 58:21.280
 They knew he was a criminal, they solicited his business, explicitly knew that his business

58:21.280 --> 58:26.280
 meant access to other high net worth individuals, just consistently doled money out from his

58:26.280 --> 58:31.320
 account for hush payments to women in Europe and prostitution rings.

58:31.320 --> 58:33.640
 They knew all of this within the bank.

58:33.640 --> 58:35.160
 It was elevated multiple times.

58:35.160 --> 58:39.720
 Here's the other one, one of Epstein's associates was like, hey, how much money can we take

58:39.720 --> 58:45.080
 out before we hit the automatic sensor before you have to tell the IRS?

58:45.080 --> 58:50.880
 And that question, by their own standards, is supposed to result in a notification to

58:50.880 --> 58:52.520
 the feds and they never did it.

58:52.520 --> 58:59.320
 And he was withdrawing like $2 million of cash in five years for tips to, okay, something's

58:59.320 --> 59:00.320
 going on here.

59:00.320 --> 59:01.320
 You see what I'm saying?

59:01.320 --> 59:06.400
 There's a lot of signs that make you think that there is a bigger thing at play than

59:06.400 --> 59:14.920
 just a man, that there is some, it does look like a larger organization is using this front.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.040
 It's, again, I don't know.

59:16.040 --> 59:17.480
 I truly don't know.

59:17.480 --> 59:20.640
 And I'm not willing to use the certainty, which I think a lot of people online are to

59:20.640 --> 59:21.640
 say like, it wants 100%.

59:21.640 --> 59:22.640
 Yes.

59:22.640 --> 59:27.920
 The certainty is always the problem because that's probably why I hesitate to touch conspiracy

59:27.920 --> 59:33.520
 theories is because I'm allergic to certainty in all forms, in politics, any kind of discourse.

59:33.520 --> 59:40.080
 And people are so sure in both directions, actually, it's kind of hilarious.

59:40.080 --> 59:44.960
 And they're sure that the conspiracy theory, particularly whatever the conspiracy theory

59:44.960 --> 59:45.960
 is, is false.

59:45.960 --> 59:51.000
 Like, they almost dismiss it like, they don't even want to talk about it.

59:51.000 --> 59:54.880
 It's like the people, like the way they dismiss that the earth is flat.

59:54.880 --> 1:00:02.040
 Most scientists are like, they don't even want to hear what the flat earthers are saying.

1:00:02.040 --> 1:00:09.480
 They don't have zero patience for it, which is like, maybe in that case, is deserved.

1:00:09.480 --> 1:00:17.360
 But everything else, you really, like, have empathy, like, consider the, you have, okay,

1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:23.640
 this is weird to say, but I feel like you have to consider that the earth might be flat

1:00:23.640 --> 1:00:29.360
 for like, one minute, like, you have to be empathetic, you have to be open minded.

1:00:29.360 --> 1:00:32.360
 I don't see a lot of that through our cultural taste makers and more.

1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:37.000
 And that's, that really is what concerns me the most because it's just another manifestation

1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:42.680
 of all of our problems is that we have this completely bifurcating economy, bifurcating

1:00:42.680 --> 1:00:47.400
 culture literally in terms of, we have the middle of the country and then we have the

1:00:47.400 --> 1:00:48.400
 coast.

1:00:48.400 --> 1:00:51.520
 And in terms of the population, it's almost 50 50.

1:00:51.520 --> 1:00:56.520
 And with, you know, increasing mega cities and urban culture, like urban monoculture

1:00:56.520 --> 1:01:03.880
 of LA, New York and Chicago and DC and Boston and Austin, relative to how an entire other

1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:08.240
 group of Americans live their lives, or even the people within them who aren't rich and

1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:12.320
 upwardly mobile, how they live their lives is just completely separating.

1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:17.080
 And all of our language and communication in mass media and more is to the top.

1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:18.760
 And then everybody else is forgotten.

1:01:18.760 --> 1:01:23.280
 Do you think when you go, when you dig to the core, there is a big, there's a big gap

1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:25.560
 between left and right.

1:01:25.560 --> 1:01:30.160
 Is there, is that division that, that's perceived currently real?

1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:33.520
 Or are most people like center left and center right?

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:37.000
 That's so interesting because that's such a loaded term.

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000
 Center left.

1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.000
 What does that mean?

1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:46.240
 Like, to you, I think the way you're thinking of it is, I'm not like a, well, even this,

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:54.800
 like I'm not a radical socialist, but I'm, I'm marginally left on cultural issues and

1:01:54.800 --> 1:01:56.600
 economic issues.

1:01:56.600 --> 1:01:59.240
 This is how we've traditionally understood things.

1:01:59.240 --> 1:02:02.560
 And then when, when in popular discourse, like center right, like, what does it mean

1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:03.560
 to be center right?

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:09.240
 Like, I am marginally right on social, on concern, on social issues and marginally right

1:02:09.240 --> 1:02:10.840
 on economic issues.

1:02:10.840 --> 1:02:18.400
 But that's just not, like, if you look at survey data, for example, like stimulus checks,

1:02:18.400 --> 1:02:20.840
 people who are against stimulus checks are conservative, right?

1:02:20.840 --> 1:02:23.720
 Well, 80% of the population is for a stimulus check.

1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:27.680
 So that means a sizable number of Republicans are for stimulus checks.

1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:30.960
 Same thing happens on like a wealth tax.

1:02:30.960 --> 1:02:36.880
 Same thing happens on, okay, Florida voted for Trump 3.1%.

1:02:36.880 --> 1:02:44.040
 More than Barack Obama 2008, on the same day passes a $15 minimum wage at 67%.

1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:45.320
 So what's going on?

1:02:45.320 --> 1:02:46.320
 So that's why I...

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:47.320
 What is going on?

1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:50.680
 Well, that's my entire career.

1:02:50.680 --> 1:02:57.800
 But it seems like, so that's, that's fascinating, conversation is different than the policies.

1:02:57.800 --> 1:02:59.280
 Well, it's different than reality.

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:03.200
 That's what I would say, which is that the way we have to understand American politics

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:10.520
 today, it didn't always used to be this way, is it's almost entirely along basic, I would

1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:15.000
 say the main divider is, because even when you talk about class, this misses it in terms

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:22.040
 of socioeconomics, it's around culture, which is that it's basically, if you went to a four

1:03:22.040 --> 1:03:26.020
 year degree granting institution, you are part of one culture.

1:03:26.020 --> 1:03:27.840
 If you didn't, you're part of another.

1:03:27.840 --> 1:03:32.440
 I don't want to erase the 20% or whatever of people who did go to a college degree who

1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:37.480
 were Republicans or vice versa, et cetera, but I'm saying on average, in terms of the

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:43.320
 median way that you feel, we're basically bifurcating along those lines.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:46.480
 And because people get upset, be like, oh, well, you know, there are rich people who

1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:47.480
 voted for Trump.

1:03:47.480 --> 1:03:50.600
 And I'm like, yeah, but you know who they are?

1:03:50.600 --> 1:03:52.400
 They're like plumbers or something.

1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:56.360
 Like they're people who make $100,000 a year, but they didn't go to a four year college

1:03:56.360 --> 1:04:02.640
 degree and they might live in a place which is not an urban metro area.

1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:08.240
 And then at the same time, you have a Vox writer who makes like $30,000, but they have

1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:11.760
 a lot more cultural power than the plumber.

1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:15.080
 So you have to think about where exactly that line is.

1:04:15.080 --> 1:04:18.520
 And I think in general, that's the way that we're trending.

1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:22.160
 So that's why when I say what's going on, are we divided?

1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:23.160
 Yeah.

1:04:23.160 --> 1:04:25.360
 But it's not left and right.

1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:26.800
 And that's why I hate these labels.

1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:29.440
 So it's more just red and blue like teams.

1:04:29.440 --> 1:04:31.720
 They're arbitrary teams.

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:35.840
 So how arbitrary are these teams, I guess, is another completely arbitrary.

1:04:35.840 --> 1:04:40.880
 So what you kind of implied that there's, I don't know if you're sort of in post analyzing

1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:46.240
 the patterns, because it seems like there's a network effects of like, you just pick the

1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:48.720
 team red or blue.

1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:52.800
 And it might have to do with college, you might have to do all of those things, but like,

1:04:52.800 --> 1:04:59.160
 it seems like it's more about just the people around you.

1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:04.440
 So less than whether you went to college or not, I mean, it's almost like seems like it's

1:05:04.440 --> 1:05:08.520
 almost like a weird like network effects that are hard.

1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:13.280
 There's certain strong patterns that you're identifying, but I don't know.

1:05:13.280 --> 1:05:17.640
 It's sad to think that it might be just teams that have nothing to do with what you actually

1:05:17.640 --> 1:05:18.640
 believe.

1:05:18.640 --> 1:05:22.680
 Well, it is like, I look, I mean, I don't want to believe that.

1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:28.040
 But the data points me to this, which especially 2020, I'm one of the people, chief among them,

1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:29.320
 I will own up to it here.

1:05:29.320 --> 1:05:33.080
 I was totally wrong about why Trump was elected in 2016.

1:05:33.080 --> 1:05:38.960
 I believed and based a lot of my public commentary belief on this, Trump was elected because

1:05:38.960 --> 1:05:46.200
 of a rejection of Hillary Clinton neoliberalism on the back of a pro worker message, which

1:05:46.200 --> 1:05:49.840
 was anti immigration, it was its pillar.

1:05:49.840 --> 1:05:56.920
 But alongside of it was a rejection of free trade with China and generally of the political

1:05:56.920 --> 1:06:03.000
 correctness and globalism, which has been come in through the Uniparty and same thing

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:06.880
 here with the military industrial complex and endless war.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:08.440
 He rejected all of that.

1:06:08.440 --> 1:06:10.480
 What's wrong with that prediction?

1:06:10.480 --> 1:06:11.480
 It's wrong, man.

1:06:11.480 --> 1:06:14.160
 And the reason I know this is that it sounds right.

1:06:14.160 --> 1:06:16.800
 I wish it, I honestly wish it was true.

1:06:16.800 --> 1:06:17.960
 But here's the truth.

1:06:17.960 --> 1:06:25.400
 Trump actually governed largely as a neoliberal Republican who was meaner online and who departed

1:06:25.400 --> 1:06:28.040
 from orthodoxy in some very important ways.

1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:29.040
 Don't get me wrong.

1:06:29.040 --> 1:06:31.280
 I will always support the trade war with China.

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:35.480
 I will always support not expanding the wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq.

1:06:35.480 --> 1:06:40.320
 I will support him moving the Overton window on a million different things and revealing

1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:45.720
 once and for all that GOP voters don't care about economic orthodoxy necessarily.

1:06:45.720 --> 1:06:47.640
 But here's what they do care about.

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:54.000
 Trump got more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016 despite not delivering largely, largely

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.640
 for all the Trump people out there on that agenda.

1:06:56.640 --> 1:06:59.960
 He wasn't more pro union, but he won more union votes.

1:06:59.960 --> 1:07:05.120
 He wasn't necessarily more pro worker, but he actually won more votes in Ohio than he

1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:07.280
 did in 2016.

1:07:07.280 --> 1:07:13.960
 And he won more Hispanic votes than despite being all the immigration rhetoric, et cetera.

1:07:13.960 --> 1:07:14.960
 Here's why.

1:07:14.960 --> 1:07:21.000
 It's about the culture, which is that the culture war is so hot that negative partisanship

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:26.400
 is at such high levels, all of the vote is geared upon what the other guy might do in

1:07:26.400 --> 1:07:27.400
 office.

1:07:27.400 --> 1:07:30.520
 And there's a poll actually just came out by Eshalon Insights, Crystal and I were talking

1:07:30.520 --> 1:07:36.640
 about it on Rising, that number one concern amongst Democratic voters is Trump voters.

1:07:36.640 --> 1:07:41.440
 Number one concern, not issues like Trump voters.

1:07:41.440 --> 1:07:43.480
 And number two is white supremacy.

1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:46.840
 And so, like, which is basically code for Trump voters.

1:07:46.840 --> 1:07:48.960
 And is the same rule for the other side?

1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:52.880
 Well, so on the right, number one concern is illegal immigration.

1:07:52.880 --> 1:07:58.040
 And number, I think, three or four, whatever is Antifa, which is code for Democrats.

1:07:58.040 --> 1:07:59.040
 It's nice.

1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:00.880
 At least on the right, there's a policy kind of thing.

1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:01.880
 Well, yeah, it's funny.

1:08:01.880 --> 1:08:03.880
 I saw Ben Shapiro was talking about this.

1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:09.200
 But the reason why I would functionally say it's the same is because, I mean, you can

1:08:09.200 --> 1:08:10.200
 believe whether it's true or not.

1:08:10.200 --> 1:08:15.000
 I think it actually largely is true, but a lot of GOP voters feel like a lot of illegal

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:18.600
 immigration is code for people who are coming in, who are going to be legalized and are

1:08:18.600 --> 1:08:20.040
 going to go vote Democrat.

1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:22.840
 I can just explain it from their point of view.

1:08:22.840 --> 1:08:25.320
 So what does that actually mean?

1:08:25.320 --> 1:08:30.840
 Each other, which is that the number one concern is the other person.

1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:34.000
 So negative partisanship has never been higher.

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:39.040
 And I think people who had my thesis in terms of why Trump was elected in 2016, you have

1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:40.040
 to grapple with this.

1:08:40.040 --> 1:08:43.080
 How did he win 10 million more votes?

1:08:43.080 --> 1:08:48.280
 He came 44,000 votes away from winning the presidency across three states.

1:08:48.280 --> 1:08:52.200
 None of our popular discourse reflects that very stark reality.

1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:58.280
 And I think so much of it is people really hate liberals.

1:08:58.280 --> 1:08:59.960
 They just really hate them.

1:08:59.960 --> 1:09:05.640
 And I was driving through rural Nevada before the election, and I was literally in the middle

1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:06.640
 of nowhere.

1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:11.520
 And there was this massive sign this guy had out in front of his house, and it just said,

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:14.400
 Trump, colon, fuck your feelings.

1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:16.440
 And I was like, that's it.

1:09:16.440 --> 1:09:18.600
 That is why people voted for Trump.

1:09:18.600 --> 1:09:23.480
 And I don't want to denigrate it because they truly feel they have no cultural power in

1:09:23.480 --> 1:09:30.000
 America except to raise the middle finger to the elite class by pressing the button

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:31.000
 for Trump.

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:32.000
 I get that.

1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:35.040
 That's actually a totally rational way to vote.

1:09:35.040 --> 1:09:40.200
 That's not the way I wish we did vote, but that's not my place to say.

1:09:40.200 --> 1:09:41.200
 So this is interesting.

1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:47.760
 If you could just psychoanalyze, again, I'm probably naive about this, but I'm really

1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:52.800
 bothered by the hatred of liberals.

1:09:52.800 --> 1:09:57.720
 It's a amorphous monster that's mocked.

1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:01.240
 It's like the Shapiro liberal tears.

1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:08.680
 And I'm also really bothered by probably more of my colleagues and friends, the hatred

1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:15.360
 of Trump, the Trump and white supremacists.

1:10:15.360 --> 1:10:21.440
 So apparently there's 70 million white supremacists, 75 million, sorry.

1:10:21.440 --> 1:10:25.520
 There's millions of white supremacists.

1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:33.560
 And apparently whatever liberal is, literally liberal has become equivalent to white supremacists

1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:36.520
 in the power of negativity it arouses.

1:10:36.520 --> 1:10:42.120
 I don't even know what those, I mean, honestly, I just don't, they've become swears essentially.

1:10:42.120 --> 1:10:46.480
 Is that, I mean, how do we get out of this?

1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:53.800
 Because that's why I just don't even say anything about politics online because it's like, really?

1:10:53.800 --> 1:10:59.080
 You can't, here's what happens.

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:05.320
 Anything you say that's like thoughtful, like, hmm, I wonder immigration, something.

1:11:05.320 --> 1:11:16.240
 I wonder why we allow these many immigrants in or some version of thinking through these

1:11:16.240 --> 1:11:22.400
 difficult policies and so on, they immediately try to find like a single word in something

1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:30.120
 you say that can put you in a bin of liberal or white supremacists and hammer you to death

1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:32.480
 by saying you're one of the two.

1:11:32.480 --> 1:11:38.120
 And then everybody just piles on happily that we finally nailed this white supremacist or

1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:39.680
 liberal.

1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:44.680
 And that, is this some kind of weird like feature of online communication that we've

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:46.040
 just stumbled upon?

1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:51.120
 Is there a way or is it possible to argue that this is like a feature, not a bug?

1:11:51.120 --> 1:11:52.760
 Like this is a good thing?

1:11:52.760 --> 1:11:53.760
 Yeah.

1:11:53.760 --> 1:11:56.240
 Well, look, I just think it's a reflection of who we are.

1:11:56.240 --> 1:11:57.480
 People like to blame social media.

1:11:57.480 --> 1:11:59.200
 I think we're just incredibly divided right now.

1:11:59.200 --> 1:12:02.240
 I think we've been divided like this for the last 20 years.

1:12:02.240 --> 1:12:08.360
 And I think that the reason I focus almost 99% of my public commentary on economics is

1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:11.000
 because you asked an important question at the top.

1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.040
 How do we fix this?

1:12:13.040 --> 1:12:15.240
 What did I say about the stimulus checks?

1:12:15.240 --> 1:12:17.080
 Stimulus checks have 80% approval rating.

1:12:17.080 --> 1:12:18.240
 So that's the type of thing.

1:12:18.240 --> 1:12:21.960
 If I was Joe Biden and I wanted to actually heal this country, that's the very first thing

1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:24.120
 I would have done when I came into office.

1:12:24.120 --> 1:12:28.960
 Same thing on when you look at anything that's going to increase wages.

1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:32.960
 I said on the show, I was like, look, I think Joe Biden will have an 80% approval rating

1:12:32.960 --> 1:12:33.960
 if he does two things.

1:12:33.960 --> 1:12:39.080
 If he gives every American a $2,000 stimulus check and gives everybody who wants a vaccine

1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:40.080
 a vaccine.

1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:41.080
 That's it.

1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:42.080
 It's pretty simple.

1:12:42.080 --> 1:12:43.080
 Because here's the thing.

1:12:43.080 --> 1:12:45.200
 I don't really like Greg Abbott that much.

1:12:45.200 --> 1:12:46.440
 We have like very different politics.

1:12:46.440 --> 1:12:47.440
 I'm from Texas.

1:12:47.440 --> 1:12:50.400
 My parents got vaccinated really quickly.

1:12:50.400 --> 1:12:51.600
 That means something to me.

1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:55.920
 I'm like, listen, I don't really care about a lot of the other stuff.

1:12:55.920 --> 1:12:58.320
 He got my family vaccinated.

1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:02.520
 Like that, well, I will forever remember that.

1:13:02.520 --> 1:13:05.040
 And that's how we will remember the checks.

1:13:05.040 --> 1:13:09.040
 This is a part of a reason why Trump almost won the election and why if the Republicans

1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:14.880
 had been smart enough to give him another round of checks, 100% would have won, which

1:13:14.880 --> 1:13:17.040
 is that people were like, look.

1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:20.880
 I don't really like Trump, but I got a check with his name on it.

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:24.240
 And that meant something to me and my family.

1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:29.320
 I'm not saying for all the libertarians out there that you should go and endlessly spend

1:13:29.320 --> 1:13:31.120
 money and buy votes.

1:13:31.120 --> 1:13:38.360
 What I am saying is lean into the majoritarian positions without adding your culture war

1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:40.120
 bullshit on top of it.

1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:44.600
 So for example, what's the number one concern that AOC says after the first round of checks

1:13:44.600 --> 1:13:47.400
 got out, oh, the checks didn't go to illegal immigrants.

1:13:47.400 --> 1:13:49.840
 I'm like, are you out of your fucking mind?

1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:56.720
 This is the most popular policy America has probably done in 50 years since Medicare and

1:13:56.720 --> 1:13:58.480
 you're inserting it.

1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:00.280
 You're ruining it.

1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:04.360
 And then on the right is the same thing, which is that they'll be like, these checks

1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:09.960
 are going to low level, blah, blah, people who are lazy and don't work.

1:14:09.960 --> 1:14:14.920
 I'm like, oh, there you go, you're just playing a caricature of what you are like.

1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:18.520
 If you lean into those issues and you got to do it clean, this is what everybody hates

1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:24.080
 about DC, which is that Biden right now is doing the $1,400 checks, but he's looping it

1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:26.880
 in with his COVID relief bill and all that.

1:14:26.880 --> 1:14:27.880
 That's his prerogative.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:28.880
 That's the Democrats prerogative.

1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:29.880
 They won the election.

1:14:29.880 --> 1:14:30.880
 That's fine.

1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:33.120
 But I'll tell you what I would have done if I was him.

1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:36.440
 I would have come in and I would have said there's five United States senators who are

1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:40.800
 on the record, Republicans, who say they'll vote for a $2,000 check, and I would put that

1:14:40.800 --> 1:14:46.320
 on the floor of the United States Senate on the first day possible.

1:14:46.320 --> 1:14:50.080
 And I would have passed it and I would have forced those Republican senators to live up

1:14:50.080 --> 1:14:55.840
 to that, vote for this bill, come to the Oval Office for assigning so that the very first

1:14:55.840 --> 1:15:01.840
 thing of my presidency was to say, I'm giving you all this relief check, this long national

1:15:01.840 --> 1:15:05.480
 nightmare is over, take this money, do with it what you need.

1:15:05.480 --> 1:15:06.960
 We've all suffered together.

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:13.320
 The thing about Biden is, he has a portrait of FDR in the Oval, which bothers me because

1:15:13.320 --> 1:15:18.800
 he thinks of himself as an FDR like figure, but you have to understand the majesty of

1:15:18.800 --> 1:15:20.200
 FDR.

1:15:20.200 --> 1:15:24.640
 We're talking about a person who passed a piece of legislation five days after he became

1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:31.040
 president and he passed 15 transformative pieces of legislation in the first 100 days.

1:15:31.040 --> 1:15:35.480
 Here on day like 34, 35, and nothing has passed.

1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:39.720
 The reconciliation bill will eventually become law, but it'll become law with no Republican

1:15:39.720 --> 1:15:40.720
 votes.

1:15:40.720 --> 1:15:47.320
 And again, that's fine, but it's not fulfilling that legacy and the urgency of the action.

1:15:47.320 --> 1:15:51.520
 And the mandate, which I believe that history has handed, it handed it to Trump and he

1:15:51.520 --> 1:15:53.040
 fucked it up, right?

1:15:53.040 --> 1:15:54.040
 He totally screwed it up.

1:15:54.040 --> 1:15:57.920
 He could have remade America and made us into the greatest country ever coming out on the

1:15:57.920 --> 1:15:59.120
 other side of this.

1:15:59.120 --> 1:16:01.000
 He decided not to do that.

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.240
 I think Biden was again handed that like a scepter almost.

1:16:04.240 --> 1:16:07.880
 It's like, all you have to do, all America wants is for you to raise it up high, but

1:16:07.880 --> 1:16:10.480
 he's keeping it within the realm of traditional politics.

1:16:10.480 --> 1:16:11.680
 I think it's a huge mistake.

1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:12.680
 Why?

1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:15.160
 So everything he's saying makes perfect sense.

1:16:15.160 --> 1:16:21.200
 Like, take, it's like, again, if the aliens showed up, it's like the obvious thing to

1:16:21.200 --> 1:16:28.880
 do is like, what's the popular thing, like 80% of Americans support this?

1:16:28.880 --> 1:16:32.200
 Do that clean.

1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:39.240
 Also do it like with like grace, where you're able to bring people together, not like in

1:16:39.240 --> 1:16:47.920
 a political way, but like obvious, like obvious common sense way, like just people, the Republicans

1:16:47.920 --> 1:16:52.320
 and Democrats is bringing them together on a policy and like bold, just hammer it without

1:16:52.320 --> 1:16:59.200
 the dirt, without the mess, whatever, try to compromise, just yell with, have a good

1:16:59.200 --> 1:17:07.240
 Twitter account, like loud, very clear, we're going to give a $2,000 or a stimulus check.

1:17:07.240 --> 1:17:13.920
 Anyone who wants a vaccine gets a vaccine at scale, what make America, let's make America

1:17:13.920 --> 1:17:20.720
 great again by manufacturing, like we are manufacturing most of the world's vaccine because we're

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:27.960
 bad motherfuckers and without maybe, with more eloquence than that and just do that.

1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:32.840
 Why haven't we seen that for many, for several presidencies?

1:17:32.840 --> 1:17:36.760
 Because of coalitional politics and they owe something to somebody else.

1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:44.600
 For example, Biden has got a lot of the Democratic constituency has to satisfy within this bill.

1:17:44.600 --> 1:17:48.800
 So there's going to be a lot of shit that goes in there, state and local aid, all of

1:17:48.800 --> 1:17:52.720
 a sudden, again, I'm not even saying this is bad, but he's like, his theory is, and

1:17:52.720 --> 1:17:57.280
 this isn't wrong, is like, we're going to take the really popular stuff and use it as

1:17:57.280 --> 1:18:00.680
 cover for the more downwardly less popular.

1:18:00.680 --> 1:18:05.600
 And so the Dems could face the accusation, the people who are on this side, this is their

1:18:05.600 --> 1:18:09.840
 pushback to me, they're like, why would we give away the most popular thing in the bill?

1:18:09.840 --> 1:18:13.360
 And then we would never be able to pass state and local aid, right?

1:18:13.360 --> 1:18:14.360
 Why would we do that?

1:18:14.360 --> 1:18:16.000
 And the Republicans do the same thing, right?

1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:20.160
 Like Mitch McConnell, because he's a fucking idiot, decided to say, we're going to pair

1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:23.760
 these $2,000 stimulus checks with like section 230 repeal.

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:26.160
 And it was like, oh, it's obviously dead, right?

1:18:26.160 --> 1:18:28.360
 Like it's not going to happen together.

1:18:28.360 --> 1:18:33.080
 That's largely why I believe Trump lost the election and why those races down in Georgia

1:18:33.080 --> 1:18:34.480
 went the way that they did.

1:18:34.480 --> 1:18:37.080
 Obviously Trump had something to do with it.

1:18:37.080 --> 1:18:41.280
 But the reason why is they have longstanding things that they've wanted to get done.

1:18:41.280 --> 1:18:45.400
 And in the words of Rahm Emanuel, never let a good crisis go to waste and try and get

1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:49.080
 as much as you possibly can done within a single bill.

1:18:49.080 --> 1:18:55.320
 My counter would be this, things have worked this way for too long, which is that the reconciliation

1:18:55.320 --> 1:19:02.200
 bill is almost certainly going to be the only large signature legislative accomplishment

1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:03.840
 of the Biden presidency.

1:19:03.840 --> 1:19:05.680
 That's just how American politics works.

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:10.240
 Maybe he gets one more, maybe one, he gets a second reconciliation bill, then you're

1:19:10.240 --> 1:19:12.840
 running for midterms, it's over.

1:19:12.840 --> 1:19:18.800
 I believe that by trying to change the paradigm of our politics, leaning into exactly what

1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:23.120
 I'm talking here, you could possibly transcend that to a new one.

1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:24.640
 And I'm not naive.

1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:27.080
 I think people respond to political pressures.

1:19:27.080 --> 1:19:33.320
 And the way that we found this out was David Perdue, who was just a total corporate, you

1:19:33.320 --> 1:19:36.840
 know, dollar general CEO guy.

1:19:36.840 --> 1:19:40.360
 He was against the original $1,200 stimulus checks.

1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:43.480
 But then Trump came out, who's the single most popular figure in the Republican Party,

1:19:43.480 --> 1:19:45.680
 he's like, I want $2,000 stimulus checks.

1:19:45.680 --> 1:19:51.080
 And all of a sudden Perdue running in Georgia is like, yeah, I'm with President Trump, I

1:19:51.080 --> 1:19:53.800
 want a $2,000 stimulus check.

1:19:53.800 --> 1:19:58.320
 That was, if you're an astute observer of politics to say, you can see there that you

1:19:58.320 --> 1:20:02.480
 can force people to do the right thing because it's the popular thing.

1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:07.800
 And that if it's clean, if you don't give them any other excuse, they have to do it.

1:20:07.800 --> 1:20:13.360
 So this is what we've been gaslit into our culture or framework of politics.

1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:20.760
 And the reason it feels so broken and awful is because it is, but there is a way out.

1:20:20.760 --> 1:20:23.880
 It's just that nobody wants to be, it's a game of chicken, right?

1:20:23.880 --> 1:20:25.000
 Because maybe it is true.

1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:29.440
 Maybe we would never be able to get your other Democratic priorities or Republican priorities.

1:20:29.440 --> 1:20:35.080
 But I think that the country understands that this is fucking terrible and would be willing

1:20:35.080 --> 1:20:37.240
 to support somebody who does it differently.

1:20:37.240 --> 1:20:43.120
 It's just a lot of disincentives to not stay without, there's a lot of incentives to not

1:20:43.120 --> 1:20:44.720
 stray from the traditional path.

1:20:44.720 --> 1:20:45.720
 Yeah.

1:20:45.720 --> 1:20:51.440
 Is it also possible that the A students are not participating?

1:20:51.440 --> 1:20:56.360
 Like we drove all of the superstars away from politics.

1:20:56.360 --> 1:20:57.360
 So like you just had...

1:20:57.360 --> 1:20:58.360
 I've heard this argument before.

1:20:58.360 --> 1:21:06.360
 I mean, everything you're saying sort of rings true.

1:21:06.360 --> 1:21:08.640
 Like this is the obvious thing to do.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:11.920
 As a student of history, you can always tell.

1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:15.920
 If you look at great people in history, this is with great leaders in history.

1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:17.280
 This is what they did.

1:21:17.280 --> 1:21:22.480
 It's like clean, bold action.

1:21:22.480 --> 1:21:25.000
 Sometimes facing crisis, but we're facing a crisis right now.

1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:26.000
 No, we're in a crisis.

1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:27.000
 Exactly.

1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:28.000
 Exactly.

1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:33.240
 So why don't we see those leaders step up?

1:21:33.240 --> 1:21:36.760
 I mean, you say that's kind of like, it makes sense.

1:21:36.760 --> 1:21:39.360
 There's a lot of different interests to play.

1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:41.880
 You don't want to risk too many things and so on and so forth.

1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:45.920
 But that sounds like the C students.

1:21:45.920 --> 1:21:47.360
 I don't think it's that.

1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:53.240
 I think it's that the pipeline of politician creation is just totally broken from beginning

1:21:53.240 --> 1:21:54.360
 to end.

1:21:54.360 --> 1:21:59.560
 So it's not that A students don't want to be politicians.

1:21:59.560 --> 1:22:05.000
 It's basically the way that our current primary system is constructed is what is the greatest

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.320
 threat to you as a member of Congress?

1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:10.600
 It's not losing your reelection.

1:22:10.600 --> 1:22:13.440
 It's losing your primary.

1:22:13.440 --> 1:22:18.320
 So that means especially in a safe district, you're most concerned about being hit if

1:22:18.320 --> 1:22:21.840
 you're a Republican from the right and if you're a Democrat from the left for not being

1:22:21.840 --> 1:22:23.080
 a good enough one.

1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:28.520
 That's actually what stops people, more heterodox people in particular from winning primaries

1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:32.440
 because the people who vote in our primaries are the party faithful.

1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:35.240
 That's how you get the production.

1:22:35.240 --> 1:22:39.280
 It's important to understand the production pipeline, which is that, all right, I'm from

1:22:39.280 --> 1:22:40.800
 Texas so that's what I know best.

1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:46.120
 So it's like, if you think in Texas, if you're a more heterodox like state legislature or

1:22:46.120 --> 1:22:50.640
 something who works with the left on this and does that, you're going to get your ass

1:22:50.640 --> 1:22:54.960
 beat in a Republican primary because they're going to be like, he worked with the left

1:22:54.960 --> 1:22:59.120
 to do this, blah, blah, take it out of context and you're screwed.

1:22:59.120 --> 1:23:04.080
 And then that means you never ascend up the next level of the ladder and then so on and

1:23:04.080 --> 1:23:05.680
 so forth all the way.

1:23:05.680 --> 1:23:08.360
 But I do think Trump changed everything.

1:23:08.360 --> 1:23:14.360
 This is why I have some hope, which is that he showed me that all the people I listened

1:23:14.360 --> 1:23:16.880
 to were totally wrong about politics.

1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:20.720
 And that's the most valuable lesson you could ever teach me, which was I was like, wait,

1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.440
 I don't have to listen to these people because they don't know anything actually, you know?

1:23:24.440 --> 1:23:26.000
 And that's powerful, man.

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:27.160
 I'm like, he did it.

1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:28.160
 That's exceptionally powerful.

1:23:28.160 --> 1:23:29.160
 This guy.

1:23:29.160 --> 1:23:32.520
 Even if he didn't do anything with it.

1:23:32.520 --> 1:23:33.520
 It doesn't matter.

1:23:33.520 --> 1:23:34.520
 Right.

1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:35.520
 He showed that it's possible.

1:23:35.520 --> 1:23:36.520
 Exactly.

1:23:36.520 --> 1:23:39.960
 And that means a lot.

1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:40.960
 You're absolutely right.

1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:44.960
 There's young people right now that kind of look, turn around and like, huh.

1:23:44.960 --> 1:23:49.560
 You're like, wait, I don't have to comb my hair a certain way and go to law school and

1:23:49.560 --> 1:23:55.040
 be an asshole who everybody knows is an asshole and then get elected to state legislature.

1:23:55.040 --> 1:24:01.240
 I mean, look, who's the number one person in the New York City primary right now?

1:24:01.240 --> 1:24:02.240
 Andrew Yang.

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:05.160
 He's polling higher than everybody else in the race.

1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:08.760
 Look, maybe the polls are totally fucked and maybe he'll lose because of ranked choice

1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:10.320
 voting and all of that.

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:13.560
 But I consider Andrew, I mean, I know him a little bit and I've followed his candidacy

1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:15.040
 from the very beginning.

1:24:15.040 --> 1:24:17.040
 I consider him an inspiration.

1:24:17.040 --> 1:24:19.840
 He's the new generation of politics.

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:24.200
 If I see who's going to be president 20 years from now, it's going to be, I'm not saying

1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:25.200
 it's going to be Andrew Yang.

1:24:25.200 --> 1:24:29.400
 I think it's going to be somebody like Andrew Yang outside the political system who talks

1:24:29.400 --> 1:24:31.880
 in a totally different way.

1:24:31.880 --> 1:24:35.960
 Just completely, one of my favorite things that he said on the debate stage, he's like,

1:24:35.960 --> 1:24:36.960
 look at us.

1:24:36.960 --> 1:24:38.040
 We're all wearing makeup.

1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:39.040
 It's crazy.

1:24:39.040 --> 1:24:40.040
 You know what I mean?

1:24:40.040 --> 1:24:41.040
 Yeah.

1:24:41.040 --> 1:24:42.040
 And he brought that.

1:24:42.040 --> 1:24:43.040
 And he's right.

1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:44.040
 Yeah.

1:24:44.040 --> 1:24:45.040
 Why are they all wearing makeup?

1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:50.120
 He arguably hasn't gone far enough almost because, but he showed that it's possible.

1:24:50.120 --> 1:24:55.480
 And then you see other like AOC is a good example of somebody, at least in my opinion,

1:24:55.480 --> 1:25:00.560
 is doing the same kind of thing, but going too far in like, well, I don't know.

1:25:00.560 --> 1:25:02.320
 She's doing the Trump thing, but on the other side.

1:25:02.320 --> 1:25:03.320
 So I don't know.

1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:04.320
 What's too far?

1:25:04.320 --> 1:25:05.960
 Don't take an normative judgment of it.

1:25:05.960 --> 1:25:08.040
 I will tell you the future of politics looks like this.

1:25:08.040 --> 1:25:09.040
 Appreciate the art of it.

1:25:09.040 --> 1:25:10.040
 No, I do.

1:25:10.040 --> 1:25:13.760
 Look, I don't, I'm not a big AOC fan, but she's a genius.

1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:16.040
 She's a genius once in a generation talent.

1:25:16.040 --> 1:25:20.960
 The way that she uses social media, Instagram, and everybody on the right is like trying

1:25:20.960 --> 1:25:21.960
 to copy her.

1:25:21.960 --> 1:25:24.200
 Like Matt Gaetz is like, I want to be the conservative AOC.

1:25:24.200 --> 1:25:25.720
 I'm like, it's just not going to happen.

1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:27.240
 Like you just don't have it.

1:25:27.240 --> 1:25:30.240
 Like what she has, it's like, it's electric.

1:25:30.240 --> 1:25:32.040
 And Trump had that.

1:25:32.040 --> 1:25:36.920
 Like I've been to a Trump rally, like to cover as a journalist is nothing like it.

1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:39.160
 And Yang is similar.

1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:43.720
 It's the same way where you're like, there is something going on here, which is just

1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:49.680
 like, I've been to an Obama rally, I've been to a Clinton rally, I've been to several

1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:50.680
 normal politics.

1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:56.360
 Yeah, that's fine, you know, with Trump and with Yang, it was, it's another world.

1:25:56.360 --> 1:25:57.360
 It's another world.

1:25:57.360 --> 1:25:58.360
 Yeah.

1:25:58.360 --> 1:25:59.360
 Yang gang.

1:25:59.360 --> 1:26:03.360
 There's probably thousands of people listening right now who are just like doing a slow clap.

1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:04.360
 Yes.

1:26:04.360 --> 1:26:05.360
 I know, I know.

1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:06.840
 Yang gang forever.

1:26:06.840 --> 1:26:07.840
 Okay.

1:26:07.840 --> 1:26:19.600
 Yeah, I mean, my worst fear, I prefer Andrew Yang kind of free improvisational idea, exchange

1:26:19.600 --> 1:26:27.560
 all that versus AOC, who I think no matter what she stands for is a drama machine, creates

1:26:27.560 --> 1:26:29.360
 dramas just like Trump does.

1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:34.280
 I would say my worst fear would be in 2024, is AOC old enough?

1:26:34.280 --> 1:26:36.240
 It'd be AOC versus Trump.

1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:37.240
 I don't think she's old enough.

1:26:37.240 --> 1:26:40.800
 I think you'd have to be, I think she's 30, so she needs five more years.

1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:41.800
 So probably not.

1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:42.800
 Yeah.

1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:43.800
 Okay.

1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:45.280
 But that kind of, that's or Trump Jr.

1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:47.680
 Well, AOC probably wouldn't win a Democratic primary.

1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:51.080
 So I mean, look, Joe Biden is, you know, they pretty much showed that.

1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:52.480
 That's exactly what you're saying.

1:26:52.480 --> 1:26:53.480
 Yes.

1:26:53.480 --> 1:26:55.880
 This process grooms you over time.

1:26:55.880 --> 1:27:00.960
 You see the same thing in academia actually, which is very interesting, is the process

1:27:00.960 --> 1:27:02.720
 of getting tenure.

1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:12.080
 Is this, it's like you're being taught without explicitly being taught to behave in the way

1:27:12.080 --> 1:27:14.400
 that everybody's behaved before.

1:27:14.400 --> 1:27:22.840
 I've heard this, it was funny, I've had a few conversations that were deeply disappointing,

1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:28.240
 which involved statements like, this is what's good for your career.

1:27:28.240 --> 1:27:34.320
 This kind of conversation, almost like mentor to mentee conversation, where it's, you know,

1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:37.840
 it's like, there's a grooming process in the same way, I guess you're saying the primary

1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:40.120
 process does the same kind of thing.

1:27:40.120 --> 1:27:45.480
 So, I mean, that's what people have talked about with Andrew Yang, he was being suppressed

1:27:45.480 --> 1:27:50.040
 by a bunch of different forces, the mainstream media, you know, just the democratic, just

1:27:50.040 --> 1:27:55.440
 that whole process didn't like the honesty that he would show, right?

1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:59.880
 Yeah, but here's my question to you, people got to see, look, Jordan Peterson is one of

1:27:59.880 --> 1:28:04.200
 the most famous people in America, right, like you have a massive podcast, you're more famous

1:28:04.200 --> 1:28:07.280
 than half the 99% of the people at MIT.

1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:10.840
 So like, from that perspective, everything has changed.

1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:14.520
 And somewhere out there, there's a student who's taking notice.

1:28:14.520 --> 1:28:17.640
 And I've noticed that with my own career, everybody thought I was crazy for doing this

1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:21.160
 show with Crystal, the Hill, they thought it was nuts, they're like, what are you doing?

1:28:21.160 --> 1:28:24.480
 You're a White House correspondent, you've got a job forever.

1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:27.640
 The other job offer I had was being a White House correspondent.

1:28:27.640 --> 1:28:32.880
 And people thought I was nuts for not just sticking there and, you know, aging out within

1:28:32.880 --> 1:28:39.360
 Washington, pining for appearances on Fox News and CNN and MSNBC.

1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:40.360
 But I hated it.

1:28:40.360 --> 1:28:41.360
 I just hated doing it.

1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:45.440
 And I did not want to be a company man, like a Washington man, who's one of those guys

1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:49.800
 who like brags to his friends about how many times he's been on Fox or whatever, mostly

1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:54.680
 because I just have a rebellious streak and I hate being at the subject of other people.

1:28:54.680 --> 1:28:58.600
 I created something new, which a lot of people watch to get their news.

1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:03.520
 And I noticed that younger people who are almost all my audience, they don't really

1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:06.160
 look up to any of the people in traditional, right?

1:29:06.160 --> 1:29:10.880
 They don't go and they're not coming up and being like, how do I be like Jim Acosta?

1:29:10.880 --> 1:29:13.880
 You know, they're like, hey, how did you do what you do?

1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:16.520
 And the way you did it is by bucking the system.

1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:20.400
 So I think that we are at a total split point.

1:29:20.400 --> 1:29:24.460
 And look, there will always be a path for people, because like, I don't want people

1:29:24.460 --> 1:29:25.960
 to over learn this lesson.

1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:27.720
 I have people who are like, I'm not going to go to college.

1:29:27.720 --> 1:29:29.280
 And I'm like, well, just wait.

1:29:29.280 --> 1:29:35.040
 Yeah, like, I'm like, I was starting, yeah, like stop, just like, just hold on a second.

1:29:35.040 --> 1:29:39.320
 But there will always be a path for the institutional that will always be there for you.

1:29:39.320 --> 1:29:41.000
 But now there's something else.

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:45.160
 Now there's another game in town, and that's more appealing to millions and millions and

1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:52.440
 millions and millions of people who feel unserved by the corporate media, CNN, and these people,

1:29:52.440 --> 1:29:58.960
 possibly who feel unserved in the, you know, the faculty, like if you are an up and comer

1:29:58.960 --> 1:30:04.000
 who wants to teach as many young people as possible, I think you should be on YouTube,

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:05.000
 right?

1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:06.000
 Like look at the Khan Academy guy.

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000
 That guy created a huge business.

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:12.960
 So I just think we can be cynical and like upset about what that system is, but we should

1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:13.960
 also have hope.

1:30:13.960 --> 1:30:16.680
 Like I have a lot of hope for what can be in the future.

1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:19.400
 Yeah, there's a guy, people should check us out.

1:30:19.400 --> 1:30:26.360
 My story is a little bit different because I basically stepped aside with the dream of

1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:34.120
 being an entrepreneur earlier in the pipeline than like a legitimate like senior faculty

1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:35.120
 would.

1:30:35.120 --> 1:30:38.640
 There's an example of somebody, people should check out Andrew Huberman from Stanford who's

1:30:38.640 --> 1:30:45.560
 a neuroscientist who's as world class as it gets in terms of like 10 year faculty, just

1:30:45.560 --> 1:30:48.440
 a really world class researcher.

1:30:48.440 --> 1:30:49.960
 And now he's doing YouTube.

1:30:49.960 --> 1:30:51.520
 Yeah, I see him on Instagram.

1:30:51.520 --> 1:30:52.520
 Yeah.

1:30:52.520 --> 1:30:53.520
 So he switched.

1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:58.880
 So he not just does Instagram, he now has a podcast and he's doing, he's changing the

1:30:58.880 --> 1:31:04.960
 nature of like, I believe that Andrew might be the future of Stanford.

1:31:04.960 --> 1:31:11.720
 And for a lot, it's funny, like he's basically Joe Rogan is an inspiration to Andrew.

1:31:11.720 --> 1:31:16.440
 And to me as well, and those ripple effects and Andrew is an inspiration probably just

1:31:16.440 --> 1:31:22.040
 like you're saying to these young like 25 year olds who are soon to become faculty if

1:31:22.040 --> 1:31:23.960
 we're just talking about academia.

1:31:23.960 --> 1:31:31.440
 And the same is probably happening with government is funny enough, Trump probably is inspiring

1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:34.200
 a huge number of people who are saying, wait a minute.

1:31:34.200 --> 1:31:35.720
 I don't have to play by the rules.

1:31:35.720 --> 1:31:36.720
 Exactly.

1:31:36.720 --> 1:31:40.720
 And I have to, I can think outside the box here and you're right.

1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:44.640
 And the institutions we're seeing are just probably lagging behind.

1:31:44.640 --> 1:31:50.280
 So the optimistic view is the future is going to be full of exciting new ideas.

1:31:50.280 --> 1:31:52.680
 So Andrew Young is just kind of the beginning of this whole thing.

1:31:52.680 --> 1:31:54.880
 He's typically iceberg.

1:31:54.880 --> 1:31:57.840
 And I hope that iceberg doesn't, it's not this influencer.

1:31:57.840 --> 1:32:03.400
 One of the things that really bothers me, I've gotten a chance, I should be careful

1:32:03.400 --> 1:32:04.400
 here.

1:32:04.400 --> 1:32:09.320
 I don't want to, I love everybody, but you know, these people who talk about like, you

1:32:09.320 --> 1:32:13.360
 know, how to make your first million or how to succeed.

1:32:13.360 --> 1:32:23.200
 And they're so, I mean, yeah, that, that makes me a little bit cynical about, I'm worried

1:32:23.200 --> 1:32:28.680
 that the people that win the game of politics will be ones that want to win the game of

1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:29.680
 politics.

1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:30.680
 They are.

1:32:30.680 --> 1:32:31.680
 They are, man.

1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:39.160
 Like we mentioned AOC is, I hope they optimize for the 80% populist thing, right?

1:32:39.160 --> 1:32:44.520
 Like they optimize for that badass thing that history will remember you as the great man

1:32:44.520 --> 1:32:50.560
 or woman that did this thing versus how do I maximize engagement today and keep growing

1:32:50.560 --> 1:32:52.060
 those numbers?

1:32:52.060 --> 1:32:56.560
 The influencers are so, I'm so allergic to this man.

1:32:56.560 --> 1:33:02.240
 They keep saying how many followers they have in the different accounts and it's like, I

1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:04.680
 don't think they understand.

1:33:04.680 --> 1:33:05.680
 Maybe I don't understand.

1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:07.680
 I don't really care.

1:33:07.680 --> 1:33:12.480
 I think it has destructive psychological effects.

1:33:12.480 --> 1:33:18.280
 One, like thinking about the number, like getting excited, your number went from a hundred

1:33:18.280 --> 1:33:23.080
 to a hundred and one and being like, and today went out to a hundred and five.

1:33:23.080 --> 1:33:24.760
 Whoa, that's a big jump.

1:33:24.760 --> 1:33:27.440
 And maybe thinking in this way like, I wonder what I did.

1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:28.920
 I'll do that again.

1:33:28.920 --> 1:33:34.600
 In this way, one, it creates anxiety on those psychological effects, whatever.

1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:41.600
 The more important thing is it prevents you from truly thinking boldly in the long arc

1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:48.120
 of history and creatively thinking outside the box, doing huge actions.

1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:52.960
 And I actually, my optimism is in the sense that that kind of action will beat out all

1:33:52.960 --> 1:33:53.960
 the influencers.

1:33:53.960 --> 1:33:58.280
 Well, I don't know, Lex, this is where my cynicism comes in.

1:33:58.280 --> 1:34:05.080
 So there's a guy, Madison Cawthorne, the youngest member of Congress, and he, I don't want to

1:34:05.080 --> 1:34:10.360
 say got caught, but there was like an email where he was like, my staff is only oriented

1:34:10.360 --> 1:34:11.360
 around comms.

1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:17.880
 Like he was basically saying, he got basically caught saying like, my staff is only centered

1:34:17.880 --> 1:34:19.680
 on communications.

1:34:19.680 --> 1:34:21.320
 And that's the right play.

1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:26.320
 If you do want to get the benefits of our current electoral, political, and engagement

1:34:26.320 --> 1:34:31.000
 system, which is that what's the best way to be known within the right as a, as a right

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:32.360
 wing politician?

1:34:32.360 --> 1:34:39.080
 It's to be a culture warrior, go on Ben Shapiro's podcast, be one of the people on Fox News,

1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:43.400
 go on Sean Hannity's show, go on Tucker's show, and all of that, because you become

1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:47.160
 a mini celebrity within that world.

1:34:47.160 --> 1:34:52.240
 What's left unsaid is that that world is increasingly shrinking portion of the American population,

1:34:52.240 --> 1:34:57.720
 and they barely, they can't even win a popular vote election, let alone barely win an eke

1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:01.280
 out an electoral college victory in 2016.

1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:04.720
 Well, but the incentives are all aligned within that.

1:35:04.720 --> 1:35:06.960
 And it's the same thing really on the left.

1:35:06.960 --> 1:35:11.760
 But you're right, which is that ultimately, look, this is, this is why geniuses are geniuses,

1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:15.240
 because they buck the short term incentives.

1:35:15.240 --> 1:35:16.960
 They focus on the long term.

1:35:16.960 --> 1:35:19.680
 They bet big, and they usually fail.

1:35:19.680 --> 1:35:24.680
 But then when they get big, they, they succeed spectacularly.

1:35:24.680 --> 1:35:29.920
 The people I know who have done this the best are like a lot of the crypto folks that I've

1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:31.040
 spoken to.

1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:34.480
 Like some of the stuff they say, I'm like, I don't know if that's going to happen.

1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:36.320
 But look, they're like billionaires, right?

1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:37.320
 Yeah.

1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:38.600
 And you're like, so they were right.

1:35:38.600 --> 1:35:43.480
 So it's, the way I've heard it expressed is you can be wrong a lot, but when you're

1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:45.960
 right, you get right big.

1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:52.160
 And I mean, I've seen this thing on my career, I mean, he took spectacular risk, like spectacular

1:35:52.160 --> 1:35:56.320
 risk and just double down, double down, double down, double down, double down.

1:35:56.320 --> 1:35:59.120
 And you can kind of tell to him, I mean, you know better than I do.

1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:03.280
 But like from my observation, I don't think the money matters as right.

1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:09.800
 I just, like when I see him, I'm like, it's nobody works as hard as you do and builds

1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:11.000
 the way that you build.

1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:13.760
 If it's just about the money, it's just, it just doesn't happen.

1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:18.400
 Like nobody wills SpaceX into existence just for the money.

1:36:18.400 --> 1:36:19.920
 Like it's not worth it, frankly, right?

1:36:19.920 --> 1:36:23.640
 Like he probably destroyed years of his life and like mental sanity.

1:36:23.640 --> 1:36:25.880
 Money or attention or fame, none of that.

1:36:25.880 --> 1:36:26.880
 It's not the primary priority.

1:36:26.880 --> 1:36:30.640
 Well, that's what's so appealing to me, to me in particular about him, just like in

1:36:30.640 --> 1:36:34.360
 how he built, like I read a biography of him and just like the way that he constructed

1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:38.960
 his life and like is able to hyper focus and meeting after meeting and drill down and also

1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:44.680
 hire all the right people who execute each one of his tasks discreetly to his perfection

1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:45.680
 is amazing.

1:36:45.680 --> 1:36:48.760
 Like that's actually the mark of a good leader.

1:36:48.760 --> 1:36:52.520
 But I mean, if you think about his career, the reason he's a renegade is because probably

1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:56.160
 he was told to like put it in an index fund or whatever, like whenever he made is like

1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:57.680
 29 million.

1:36:57.680 --> 1:36:59.640
 And from PayPal, I don't know how much he made.

1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:04.120
 And then just go along that one, he's like, no, so he succeeds spectacularly.

1:37:04.120 --> 1:37:08.280
 So you have to have somebody who's willing to come in and buck that system.

1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:12.040
 So for now, I think our politics are generally frozen.

1:37:12.040 --> 1:37:18.880
 I think that that model is going to be most generally appealing to the mean person.

1:37:18.880 --> 1:37:20.720
 But somebody will come along and we'll change everything.

1:37:20.720 --> 1:37:23.240
 Yeah, I'm just surprised there's not more of them.

1:37:23.240 --> 1:37:24.240
 Yeah.

1:37:24.240 --> 1:37:28.080
 On that topic, it's now 20, what is it, 21?

1:37:28.080 --> 1:37:29.080
 Yes.

1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:32.960
 Let's make some predictions that you can be wrong about.

1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:34.200
 Good.

1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:42.720
 What major political people are you thinking will run in 2024, including Trump, Jr., Sr.,

1:37:42.720 --> 1:37:50.380
 or Ivanka, I don't know, any Trump, Trump.

1:37:50.380 --> 1:37:52.360
 And who do you think wins?

1:37:52.360 --> 1:37:56.200
 I think Joe Biden will run again in 2024.

1:37:56.200 --> 1:37:59.600
 And I think he will run against someone with the last name Trump.

1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:03.920
 I do not know whether that is Trump or Trump Jr.

1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:08.320
 But I think one of those people will probably be the GOP nominee in 2024.

1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:09.320
 Who was it?

1:38:09.320 --> 1:38:10.720
 Some prominent political figure.

1:38:10.720 --> 1:38:11.720
 Was it Romney?

1:38:11.720 --> 1:38:15.120
 Somebody like that said that Trump will win the primary if he runs again.

1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:16.120
 Of course.

1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:17.120
 That's not even a question.

1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:22.360
 Trump is the single most popular figure in the Republican Party by orders of magnitude.

1:38:22.360 --> 1:38:23.360
 Still.

1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:25.400
 I mean, probably more, honestly.

1:38:25.400 --> 1:38:29.640
 There was a, actually, I can tell you, because I saw the data, which is that pre January

1:38:29.640 --> 1:38:34.040
 6th, it was like 54% of Republicans wanted him to run again.

1:38:34.040 --> 1:38:38.520
 Then it went down eight points after January 6th, two days later.

1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:42.520
 And then after impeachment, it went right back up to 54%.

1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:50.080
 So the exact same number is in February, a post impeachment vote, as it was after November.

1:38:50.080 --> 1:38:53.960
 Now look, yeah, again, surveys, bullshit, et cetera, but like, that's all the data we

1:38:53.960 --> 1:38:54.960
 have.

1:38:54.960 --> 1:38:55.960
 That's what I can point to.

1:38:55.960 --> 1:39:00.880
 If he runs, he will be the nominee and he will be, he will be the 2024 nominee.

1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:03.680
 I just don't know if he wants to, it really depends.

1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:09.120
 Do you think he wins after the Trump vaccine heals all of us?

1:39:09.120 --> 1:39:10.280
 Do you think Trump wins?

1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:13.560
 It depends on how popular culture functions over the next four years.

1:39:13.560 --> 1:39:16.920
 And I can tell you that they are, because I don't think Biden has that much to do with

1:39:16.920 --> 1:39:17.920
 it.

1:39:17.920 --> 1:39:23.120
 Because again, Trump is not a manifestation of an affirmative policy action.

1:39:23.120 --> 1:39:29.800
 It is a defensive, bulwark wall against cultural liberalism.

1:39:29.800 --> 1:39:33.440
 So it's like, this is why it doesn't matter what Biden does.

1:39:33.440 --> 1:39:41.560
 If there are more riots, if there is a more sense of persecution amongst people who are

1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:46.360
 more lean towards conservative or like, hey, I don't know about that, that's crazy, then

1:39:46.360 --> 1:39:48.080
 he very well could win.

1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:52.080
 Okay, let's say Joe Biden doesn't run and they put up like Kamala Harris, I think he

1:39:52.080 --> 1:39:53.080
 would beat her.

1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:57.120
 And I don't think there's a question that Trump would beat Kamala Harris in 2024.

1:39:57.120 --> 1:40:01.240
 And you don't think anybody else, I don't know how the process works.

1:40:01.240 --> 1:40:04.640
 You don't think anybody else on the Democratic side can take the...

1:40:04.640 --> 1:40:07.800
 Well, how could you run against the sitting vice president?

1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:13.320
 It's like if Joe Biden has a 98% approval rating in the Democratic party, if he says

1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:18.040
 she is my heir, I think enough people will listen to him in a competitive primary or

1:40:18.040 --> 1:40:19.320
 a non competitive primary.

1:40:19.320 --> 1:40:23.160
 And then there's all these things about how primary systems themselves are rigged.

1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:30.280
 The DNC could make it known that they'll blacklist anybody who does try in primary Kamala Harris.

1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:35.120
 And look, I mean, progressives aren't necessarily all that popular amongst actual Democrats.

1:40:35.120 --> 1:40:37.920
 Like we found that out during the election.

1:40:37.920 --> 1:40:42.520
 There's an entire constituency which loves Joe Biden and Joe Biden level politics.

1:40:42.520 --> 1:40:47.240
 And so if he tells them to vote for Kamala, I think she would probably get it.

1:40:47.240 --> 1:40:50.000
 But again, there's a lot of game theory obviously happening.

1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:56.040
 But see, I think you're talking about everything you're saying is correct about mediocre candidates.

1:40:56.040 --> 1:41:01.520
 It feels like if there's somebody like a really strong, I don't want to use this term incorrectly,

1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:11.080
 but populist, somebody that speaks to the 80% that is able to provide bold, eloquently

1:41:11.080 --> 1:41:15.000
 described solutions that are popular.

1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:17.200
 I think that breaks through all of this nonsense.

1:41:17.200 --> 1:41:19.520
 How do they break through the primary system?

1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:22.520
 Because the problem is the primary system is not populism.

1:41:22.520 --> 1:41:24.040
 It's primary.

1:41:24.040 --> 1:41:24.680
 So it's like...

1:41:24.680 --> 1:41:27.680
 But you don't think they can tweet their way to...

1:41:27.680 --> 1:41:30.720
 Well, you have to be willing to win a GOP primary.

1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:32.800
 You basically have to be at...

1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:37.680
 Whoever wins the GOP primary, in my opinion, will be the person most hated by the left.

1:41:37.680 --> 1:41:41.920
 One of the things that people forget is, you know who came in second to Trump?

1:41:41.920 --> 1:41:42.960
 Ted Cruz.

1:41:42.960 --> 1:41:48.680
 And the reason why is because Ted Cruz was the second most hated guy by liberals in America.

1:41:48.680 --> 1:41:51.520
 But second to Trump, they have nothing in policy in common.

1:41:51.520 --> 1:42:02.240
 But don't you think this brilliantly described system of hate being the main mechanism of our electoral choices?

1:42:02.240 --> 1:42:05.000
 Don't you think that just has to do with mediocre candidates?

1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:13.880
 Like, it's basically the field of candidates, including Trump, including everybody, was just like...

1:42:13.880 --> 1:42:16.640
 Didn't make anyone feel great.

1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:17.680
 It's like, really?

1:42:17.680 --> 1:42:19.680
 This is what we have to choose from?

1:42:19.680 --> 1:42:22.120
 Maybe a Mark Cuban.

1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:26.040
 Or like, Mark Cuban is a Democrat.

1:42:26.040 --> 1:42:29.120
 Or it would have to be somebody like that.

1:42:29.120 --> 1:42:29.920
 Somebody who...

1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:30.920
 Because here's the thing about Trump.

1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:32.400
 It's not just that it was Trump.

1:42:32.400 --> 1:42:34.320
 He was so fucking famous.

1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:36.880
 Like, people don't realize he was so famous.

1:42:36.880 --> 1:42:41.680
 Like, even when I first met Trump, I met a couple of other presidents.

1:42:41.680 --> 1:42:44.480
 But when I met Trump, even I felt like kind of starstruck.

1:42:44.480 --> 1:42:47.400
 Because I was like, yo, this is the guy from The Apprentice.

1:42:47.400 --> 1:42:49.160
 I'm like, this is the dude.

1:42:49.160 --> 1:42:50.760
 Like, this is the guy from The Apprentice.

1:42:50.760 --> 1:42:55.360
 Because I'm like, my dad and I used to sit and watch The Apprentice when I was in high school.

1:42:55.360 --> 1:43:00.840
 And then one of the guys was from College Station where I grew up and were like, oh my God, like, that guy's on The Apprentice.

1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:02.200
 Like, it was a phenomenon.

1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:06.240
 There's like that level, it's kind of like when I met Joe Rogan, I'm like, holy shit, that's Joe Rogan.

1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:09.920
 I don't feel that way when I meet Mitt Romney or Tom Cotton or Josh Hawley.

1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:10.920
 And I met all of them.

1:43:10.920 --> 1:43:12.400
 But there's a lot of celebrities, right?

1:43:12.400 --> 1:43:15.440
 Do you think there's some celebrities you're not even thinking about that could step in?

1:43:15.440 --> 1:43:15.960
 The Rock?

1:43:15.960 --> 1:43:16.600
 You have to be...

1:43:16.600 --> 1:43:19.400
 So, I was about to say, I think the Rock could do it.

1:43:19.400 --> 1:43:20.800
 But does he want to do it?

1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:21.840
 I mean, it's terrible.

1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:23.680
 Like, it's terrible gig.

1:43:23.680 --> 1:43:25.360
 It's very hard to do.

1:43:25.360 --> 1:43:29.600
 I don't know if the Rock necessarily has like the formed policy agenda.

1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:31.000
 Because then, here's the other problem.

1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:35.080
 What if we set ourselves up for a system where like, these people keep winning, but like with Trump,

1:43:35.080 --> 1:43:36.960
 they have no idea how to run a government.

1:43:36.960 --> 1:43:38.560
 It's actually really hard, right?

1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:42.800
 And you have to have the know how and the trust to find the right people.

1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:48.440
 This is where the genius element comes in, is you have to understand that front,

1:43:48.440 --> 1:43:51.920
 and you have to understand how to execute discrete tasks.

1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:54.360
 Like, this is the FDR.

1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:55.640
 This is why it's so hard.

1:43:55.640 --> 1:44:00.840
 Like, FDR, Lincoln, TR, they were who they were and they live in history

1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:04.200
 and their name rings like for a reason.

1:44:04.200 --> 1:44:09.680
 And yeah, I mean, one of the most depressing lessons I got from 2020 is at almost,

1:44:09.680 --> 1:44:16.560
 it seems like in my opinion, that we over learn the lesson of our success and not of our failures.

1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:21.840
 For example, like, we have this narrative in our head that we always have the right person

1:44:21.840 --> 1:44:23.920
 at the right time during crisis.

1:44:23.920 --> 1:44:25.640
 And in some cases, it was true.

1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:27.000
 We didn't deserve Lincoln.

1:44:27.000 --> 1:44:28.560
 We didn't deserve FDR.

1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:30.400
 We didn't deserve.

1:44:30.400 --> 1:44:33.360
 We didn't deserve a lot of presidents at times of crisis.

1:44:33.360 --> 1:44:38.480
 But then you're like, okay, George W. Bush, 911, that was terrible.

1:44:38.480 --> 1:44:41.800
 Reconstruction, Andrew Johnson, awful, right?

1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:48.480
 Like, we had several periods in our history where the crisis was there, they were called,

1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:50.160
 and they did not show up.

1:44:50.160 --> 1:44:55.640
 And I really, it hadn't happened in my lifetime except for 911.

1:44:55.640 --> 1:45:01.240
 And even then, you could kind of see that as an opportunity for somebody like Obama to come in and fix it,

1:45:01.240 --> 1:45:04.440
 but then he didn't do it, and then Trump didn't do it.

1:45:04.440 --> 1:45:13.920
 And you realize, I feel like our politics are most analogous to the 1910s in terms of the Gilded Age.

1:45:13.920 --> 1:45:22.280
 In terms of that, remember that long period of presidents between Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt?

1:45:22.280 --> 1:45:29.400
 We were like, wait, who was president, or even TR was an exception, where you're like Calvin Coolidge,

1:45:29.400 --> 1:45:33.000
 who's like, silent cow, Grover Cleveland.

1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:38.680
 That's kind of how, if I think of us within history, I feel like we're in one of those times.

1:45:38.680 --> 1:45:39.480
 We're just waiting.

1:45:39.480 --> 1:45:43.480
 It feels really important to us right now, like this is the most important moment in history,

1:45:43.480 --> 1:45:44.440
 but it might be the most...

1:45:44.440 --> 1:45:45.720
 It could just be a blip, right?

1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:47.240
 A 20, 30 year blip.

1:45:47.240 --> 1:45:56.680
 When you think about who was president between 1890 and 1888 and 1910,

1:45:56.680 --> 1:46:01.640
 nobody really thinks about that period of America, but that was an entire lifetime for people, right?

1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:04.920
 How did they feel about the country that they were in?

1:46:04.920 --> 1:46:05.640
 That's hilarious.

1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:07.160
 That's how I kind of think about where we are right now.

1:46:07.160 --> 1:46:13.880
 It's funny to think, I mean, I don't want to minimize it, but we haven't really gone through a World War II style crisis.

1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:21.320
 So like, say that there is a crisis in like several decades of that level, right?

1:46:21.320 --> 1:46:24.680
 Existential risks to a large portion of the world.

1:46:26.120 --> 1:46:31.320
 Then what will be remembered is World War II, maybe a little bit about Vietnam,

1:46:32.440 --> 1:46:34.040
 and then whatever that crisis is.

1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:37.080
 And this whole period that we see as dramatic, even coronavirus.

1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:37.960
 Even 9 11.

1:46:37.960 --> 1:46:43.560
 Even 9 11, it's like, because you can look at how many people died and all those kinds of things,

1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:46.760
 all the drama around the war on terror and all those kinds of things.

1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:51.480
 Maybe Obama will be remembered for being the first African American president,

1:46:52.280 --> 1:46:56.120
 but then like, that's, yeah, that's fascinating to think about.

1:46:56.120 --> 1:47:00.200
 Oh man, even Trump will be like, oh, okay.

1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:01.240
 He would be that guy.

1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:07.400
 Yeah, maybe he'll be remembered as the first celebrity.

1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:10.600
 I mean, Reagan was already a governor, right?

1:47:10.600 --> 1:47:14.760
 Yeah, so like the first apolitical celebrity that was a,

1:47:14.760 --> 1:47:17.800
 so maybe if there's more celebrities in the future,

1:47:17.800 --> 1:47:23.000
 they'll say that Trump was the first person to pave the way for celebrities to win.

1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:24.440
 Oh man, yeah.

1:47:25.720 --> 1:47:30.200
 And yeah, I still, I still hold that this, this era will probably be remembered.

1:47:32.040 --> 1:47:36.680
 You know, people say I talk about Elon way too much, but the reality is like,

1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:39.480
 there's not many people that are doing the kind of things he's doing.

1:47:39.480 --> 1:47:44.600
 He's why I talk about is, I think this era, it's not necessarily Elon and SpaceX,

1:47:44.600 --> 1:47:53.240
 but this era will be remembered by the new, the like of the space exploration of the commercial,

1:47:53.240 --> 1:47:58.200
 of companies getting into space exploration of space travel and perhaps,

1:47:59.720 --> 1:48:04.040
 perhaps like artificial intelligence around social media, all those kinds of things.

1:48:04.040 --> 1:48:07.560
 This might be remembered for that, but every, all the political bickering,

1:48:07.560 --> 1:48:11.000
 all of that nonsense, that might be very well forgotten.

1:48:11.000 --> 1:48:15.480
 One way to think about it is that the internet is so young.

1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:20.840
 I think about it with, so Jeff Jarvis, he's a media scholar, I respect.

1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:23.400
 He's not the only person to say this, but many others have, which is that,

1:48:23.400 --> 1:48:25.640
 look, this is kind of like the printing press.

1:48:25.640 --> 1:48:29.240
 There was a whole 30 years war because of the printing press.

1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:31.640
 It took a long time for shit to sort out.

1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:33.080
 I think that's where we're at with the internet.

1:48:33.080 --> 1:48:37.240
 Like at a certain level, it disrupts everything and that's a good thing.

1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:38.520
 It can be very tumultuous.

1:48:39.720 --> 1:48:42.760
 I never felt like I was living through history until coronavirus.

1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:46.760
 Until we were all locked down, I was like, I'm living through history.

1:48:47.800 --> 1:48:52.440
 There's this very overused cliche in DC where every comm staffer wants you to think that what

1:48:52.440 --> 1:48:54.360
 their boss just did is history.

1:48:54.360 --> 1:48:55.880
 And I've always been like, this isn't history.

1:48:55.880 --> 1:48:58.120
 This is some stupid fucking bill, whatever.

1:48:58.120 --> 1:49:02.520
 But that was the first time I was like, this is history, this is right here.

1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:10.680
 Well, I was hoping, tragedy aside, that this, I wish the primaries happened during coronavirus

1:49:10.680 --> 1:49:17.320
 so that we, because then we can see, so okay, here's a bunch of people facing crisis.

1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:19.400
 It's an opportunity for leaders to step up.

1:49:20.680 --> 1:49:27.400
 I still believe the optimistic view is the game theory of influencers

1:49:27.400 --> 1:49:30.520
 will always be defeated by actual great leaders.

1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:35.960
 So like, maybe the great leaders are rare, but I think they're sufficiently out there

1:49:35.960 --> 1:49:38.280
 that they will step up, especially in the moments of crisis.

1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:45.880
 And coronavirus is obviously a crisis where like, mass manufacture of tests,

1:49:47.880 --> 1:49:51.720
 all kinds of infrastructure building that you could have done in 2020,

1:49:51.720 --> 1:49:54.840
 there's so many possibilities for just like bold action.

1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.120
 It makes me sad.

1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:58.120
 None of that.

1:49:58.120 --> 1:50:04.120
 None of that, even just forget actually doing the action, advocating for it.

1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:04.600
 Yeah.

1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:07.080
 Just saying like this, we need to do this.

1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:13.400
 And none of that, like the speeches that Biden made, I don't even remember a single speech

1:50:13.400 --> 1:50:18.840
 that Biden made, because there's zero bold, I mean, their strategy was to be quiet and let

1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:27.880
 Donald Trump polarize the electorate and hope that results in them winning,

1:50:29.080 --> 1:50:32.760
 because of the high unemployment numbers and all those kinds of things, as opposed to like,

1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:35.800
 let's go big, let's go with a big speech.

1:50:39.400 --> 1:50:41.880
 Yeah, it's a lost opportunity in some sense.

1:50:42.520 --> 1:50:47.240
 So we talked a bunch about politics, but one of the other interesting things that you're involved

1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:54.360
 with is, or involved with defining the future of his journalism, I suppose, you can think of

1:50:54.360 --> 1:51:00.040
 podcasts as a kind of journalism, but also just writing in general and just whatever the hell

1:51:00.040 --> 1:51:05.320
 the future of this thing looks like is up to be defined by people like you.

1:51:05.320 --> 1:51:11.640
 So what do you think is broken about journalism and what do you think is the future of journalism?

1:51:11.640 --> 1:51:17.080
 I think the future of journalism looks much more like what we and I are doing here right now.

1:51:17.080 --> 1:51:22.120
 And journalism is going to be downstream from a culture that can be a good and a bad thing,

1:51:22.120 --> 1:51:27.560
 depending on how you look at it. We are going to look at our media. Our media is going to look

1:51:27.560 --> 1:51:36.680
 much more like it did pre mass media. And the way that I mean that is that back in the 1800s,

1:51:36.680 --> 1:51:43.000
 in particular, especially after the invention of the telegraph, when information itself was known.

1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:47.640
 So for example, like you and I don't need to, let's say you and I are competing journalists,

1:51:47.640 --> 1:51:54.040
 you and I are no longer competing, quote unquote, to tell the public X event happened.

1:51:54.040 --> 1:52:03.080
 All journalism today is largely explaining why did X happen? And part of the problem with that

1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:09.000
 is that that means that it's all up for partisan interpretation. Now you can say that that's a

1:52:09.000 --> 1:52:15.720
 bad thing. I think it's a great thing because the highest level of literacy and news viewership

1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:21.160
 in America was during the time of yellow journalism was during the time of partisan

1:52:21.160 --> 1:52:26.680
 journalism. Not a surprise. People like to read the news from people that they agree with.

1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:32.200
 You could say that's bad echo chambers, etc. That's the downside of it. The upside is more

1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:37.960
 people are more educated, more people are interested in the news. So I think the proliferation

1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:46.680
 of mass media, I mean, sorry, of this format, of long form, not just long form. Dude, I do

1:52:46.680 --> 1:52:50.680
 updates on Instagram, which are five minutes. Are you considered like Instagram? Yeah.

1:52:50.680 --> 1:52:54.840
 Almost even Twitter. Oh, of course, Twitter. Twitter is where I get my news from. I don't read

1:52:54.840 --> 1:52:59.480
 the paper. I have literally Twitter is my news aggregator. It's called my wire, where I find

1:52:59.480 --> 1:53:03.960
 out about hard events, like the president has departed the White House. But not only that,

1:53:03.960 --> 1:53:08.200
 I don't know about you, but I also looked at Twitter to the exact thing you're saying, which is the

1:53:08.200 --> 1:53:14.120
 response to the news. The thoughtful sounds ridiculous, but you can be pretty thoughtful

1:53:14.120 --> 1:53:19.960
 in a single tweet. If you follow the right people, you can get that. And so that is the

1:53:19.960 --> 1:53:26.120
 future of media, which is that the future of media is it will be much smaller amounts,

1:53:26.120 --> 1:53:30.840
 it's much larger amounts of people, which are famous to smaller groups. So Walter Cronkite's

1:53:30.840 --> 1:53:36.120
 never going to happen again, at least in probably within our lifetimes where everybody in America

1:53:36.120 --> 1:53:41.560
 know who's this guy is that that age is over. I think that's a good thing because now people

1:53:41.560 --> 1:53:46.280
 are going to get the news from the people that they trust. Yes, some of it will be opinionated.

1:53:46.280 --> 1:53:52.280
 I'm in my program. I'm Crystal and I are like, we are this, she's coming from this

1:53:52.920 --> 1:53:57.480
 like view. I'm coming from this view. That's our bias. When we talk about information,

1:53:57.480 --> 1:54:01.640
 and we're going to talk about the information that we think is important, and it has garnered a

1:54:01.640 --> 1:54:07.000
 large audience, I think that's very much where the future is going to be. And the reason why I

1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:13.880
 think that's a good thing is because people will be engaged more within it rather than the current

1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:19.800
 system where news is highly concentrated, highly consolidated, has group think, has the same

1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:25.560
 elite production pipeline problem of everybody knows journalists all come from the same

1:54:25.560 --> 1:54:30.920
 socioeconomic background, and they all party together here in DC or in New York or in LA

1:54:30.920 --> 1:54:34.680
 or wherever, and they're part of the same monoculture. And that affects what they

1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:43.160
 report. This will cause a total dispersion of all of that. The battle of our age

1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:48.520
 is going to be the guild versus the non guild. So like what we see right now with the New York

1:54:48.520 --> 1:54:55.880
 Times and Clubhouse, this is a very, very, very, very intentional thing that is happening, which

1:54:55.880 --> 1:55:01.480
 is that the Times talking about unfettered conversations, that's happening on Clubhouse

1:55:01.480 --> 1:55:08.760
 for people who aren't aware. This is important because they need to be the fetters of conversation.

1:55:08.760 --> 1:55:13.880
 They need to be the interagent. That's where they get their power. They get their power

1:55:13.880 --> 1:55:20.040
 from convincing Facebook that they are the ones who can fact check stuff. They are the ones who

1:55:20.040 --> 1:55:27.240
 can tell you whether something is right or wrong. That battle over unimpeded conversation and the

1:55:27.240 --> 1:55:32.520
 explosion of a format that you and I are doing really well in, and then this more consolidated one,

1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:38.200
 which holds cultural power and elite power and more importantly, money over you and I,

1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:39.800
 that's the battle that we're all going to play out.

1:55:39.800 --> 1:55:43.080
 Do you think unfettered conversations have a chance to win this battle?

1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:49.080
 Yes, I do in the long run. In the long run, the Internet is simply too powerful. But here's

1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:53.160
 the mistake everybody makes. The New York Times will never lose. It will just become one of us.

1:55:53.880 --> 1:55:54.680
 You think so?

1:55:54.680 --> 1:55:56.200
 They already are. They are the largest.

1:55:56.200 --> 1:55:56.840
 The daily?

1:55:56.840 --> 1:56:01.800
 The daily. Look at the daily. Not even that. Think about it not in podcasting. The Times

1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:09.240
 is not a mass media product. It is a subscription product for upper middle class, largely white

1:56:09.240 --> 1:56:15.240
 liberals who live the same circumstances across the United States and in Europe.

1:56:15.240 --> 1:56:19.720
 There's nothing wrong with that, but here's the thing. You can't be the paper of record when

1:56:19.720 --> 1:56:25.640
 you're actually the paper of upper middle class, white America. Your job is to report on the news

1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:30.360
 from that angle and deliver them the product that they want. There's nothing wrong with that.

1:56:30.360 --> 1:56:35.400
 Their stock price is higher than ever. They're making 10 times more money than they did 10 years

1:56:35.400 --> 1:56:43.480
 ago, but it comes at the cost of not having a mass application audience. I think people in our

1:56:43.480 --> 1:56:48.440
 space are always like, the New York Times is going to be destroyed. No, it's actually even better.

1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:53.000
 They will just become one of us. They already are their subscription platform.

1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:58.440
 Well, yes, in terms of the actual mechanism, but New York Times is still, and I don't think

1:56:58.440 --> 1:57:06.680
 I'm speaking about a particular sector. As a brand, it does have the level of credibility

1:57:06.680 --> 1:57:14.360
 assigned to it still. There's politicization of it, but there's a credibility. It has much

1:57:14.360 --> 1:57:23.640
 more credibility than I think you and I have in terms of your podcast. People are not going to be

1:57:23.640 --> 1:57:31.880
 like, they're going to cite the New York Times versus what you said on the podcast for an opinion.

1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:37.720
 I wonder in the sense of battles, whether unfettered conversations, whether Joe Rogan,

1:57:37.720 --> 1:57:45.160
 whether your podcast can have the same level of legitimacy or the flip side,

1:57:45.160 --> 1:57:52.520
 New York Times loses legitimacy to be at the same level in terms of how we talk about it.

1:57:52.520 --> 1:57:57.160
 It's a long battle. It's going to take a long time. I'm saying this is where I think the end

1:57:57.160 --> 1:58:01.800
 state is going. Look at what the Times is doing. They're leaning into podcasting for a reason,

1:58:01.800 --> 1:58:09.160
 but not just podcasting as in NPR level. Here's what's happening. Michael Barbaro is a fucking

1:58:09.160 --> 1:58:15.240
 celebrity, the guy who does the daily. That guy's famous amongst these people because they're like,

1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:19.240
 oh my God, I love Michael. I love the way he does this stuff. Again, that's fine.

1:58:19.240 --> 1:58:23.560
 More people are listening to the news. I think that's a good thing. Who else do they hire?

1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:29.160
 Ezra Klein from Vox, Kara Swisher also from Vox, who does Pivot, which is an amazing podcast.

1:58:30.200 --> 1:58:37.000
 Or Jane Costa, same thing. It's personalities who are becoming bundled together within this

1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:46.120
 brand. Maybe I'm just a hater because I love podcasting from the beginning. I love Green Day

1:58:46.120 --> 1:58:52.760
 before they were cool, man. But I am bothered by it. Why doesn't Kara Swisher, she's done

1:58:52.760 --> 1:58:57.560
 successfully? I think, no, she was always a part of some kind of institution. I'm not sure, but

1:58:57.560 --> 1:59:03.320
 She started her own thing, I think. Recode, I don't know if that's her own thing.

1:59:04.760 --> 1:59:09.800
 She was very successful there. Why the hell did she join the New York Times with the new podcast?

1:59:09.800 --> 1:59:15.480
 Why is Michael Barbaro not do his own thing? Because he gets paid and because he wants the

1:59:15.480 --> 1:59:20.440
 elite cachet that you just referenced within his social circle in New York, which is that I think

1:59:20.440 --> 1:59:25.640
 the biggest mistake that some of the venture people make is, if we give everybody the tools

1:59:25.640 --> 1:59:30.680
 that those people are all going to leave to go sub stack and go independent, within their social

1:59:30.680 --> 1:59:36.840
 circle, sacrificing some money from being independent is worth it to be a part of the New

1:59:36.840 --> 1:59:45.000
 York Times. That's sad to me because it propagates old thinking. It propagates old

1:59:45.000 --> 1:59:51.000
 institutions. You could say that New York Times is going to evolve quickly and so on, but I would

1:59:51.000 --> 1:59:59.080
 love it if there was a mechanism for reestablishing, for building new New York Times in terms of public

1:59:59.080 --> 2:00:06.200
 legitimacy. I suppose that's a wishful thinking because it takes time to build trust in institutions

2:00:06.200 --> 2:00:10.360
 and it takes time to build new institutions. My main thing I would say is public legitimacy

2:00:10.360 --> 2:00:14.520
 as a concept is not going to be there in mass media anymore. Because of the Balkanization

2:00:14.520 --> 2:00:21.800
 of Audiences, think about it. This is like lesion, the classic stuff around 1,000 true fans,

2:00:21.800 --> 2:00:26.360
 or no, sorry, like 100 true fans even now. You can make a living on the internet just talking

2:00:26.360 --> 2:00:31.160
 to 100 people. If as long as they're all high frequency traders, some of the highest paid

2:00:31.160 --> 2:00:35.880
 people on sub stack, they don't have that many subs. It's just that they're Wall Street guys,

2:00:35.880 --> 2:00:41.080
 so people pay a lot of money. Again, that's great. What you will have is an increasing

2:00:41.080 --> 2:00:47.880
 Balkanization of the internet of audiences and of niches. People will become increasingly famous

2:00:47.880 --> 2:00:52.280
 within us. You will become astoundingly famous. I'm sure you've noticed this with your fan base.

2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:56.440
 I certainly have with mine. 99% of people have no idea who I am, but when somebody

2:00:56.440 --> 2:01:03.640
 meets, they're like, oh my God, I watch your show every day. It's the only thing I watch for news.

2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:08.360
 Instead of casually famous, if that makes sense, they're like, oh yeah, that's like Alec Baldwin.

2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:13.320
 Like, oh shit, that's Alec Baldwin. But you're not like, oh shit, I love you Alec Baldwin.

2:01:14.040 --> 2:01:18.040
 This is a Ben Smith of the New York Times. Actually, he wrote this column. He's like,

2:01:18.040 --> 2:01:23.960
 the future is everybody will be famous, but only to a small group of people. I think that is true,

2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:29.000
 but again, I don't decry it. I think it's great because I think that the more that that happens,

2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:34.760
 the more engaged people will be, and it empowers different voices to be able to come in and then

2:01:34.760 --> 2:01:40.600
 possibly, I wouldn't say destroy, but compete against. I mean, look at Joe. Joe is more powerful

2:01:40.600 --> 2:01:47.480
 than CNN and MSNBC and Fox all put together. That gives me like immense inspiration. Like,

2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:51.400
 he created the space for me to succeed. And I told him that when I met him, I was like,

2:01:52.200 --> 2:01:57.080
 dude, like I listened to his podcast when I was like, young and like, and I remember like,

2:01:57.080 --> 2:02:01.240
 when I got to meet him and all that, and I told him this on this pod, I was like, I didn't know

2:02:01.240 --> 2:02:07.160
 people were millions. We're willing to listen to a guy talk about chimps for three straight hours,

2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:10.920
 including me. I didn't know that I could be one of those people. Yeah, me too. I learned something

2:02:10.920 --> 2:02:16.920
 about myself over show. Yeah. And so by creating that space, I'd be like, wait, there's a hunger

2:02:16.920 --> 2:02:22.360
 here. Like he showed us all the way. And none of us will ever again be as famous as Rogan because

2:02:22.360 --> 2:02:28.440
 he was the first. And that's fine because he created the umbrella ecosystem for us all to thrive.

2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:32.600
 That is where I see like a great amount of hope within that story.

2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:36.200
 Yeah. And the cool thing he also supports that ecosystem. He's such a...

2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:37.240
 He's so, so generous.

2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:43.720
 One of the things he paved the way out for me is to show that you can just be honest,

2:02:44.760 --> 2:02:51.880
 publicly honest, and not jealous of other people's success, but instead of be supportive.

2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:56.920
 And all those kinds of things, just like loving towards others. He's been an inspiration. I mean,

2:02:56.920 --> 2:03:04.120
 to the comics community, I think they're a bunch of... Before that, I think they were all a bunch

2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:09.320
 of competitive haters towards each other. Yeah. And now he's like just injected love. Yeah. You

2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:13.320
 know? They're like, they're still like, many are still resistant, but they're like, they can't help

2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:18.840
 it because he's such a huge voice. He like forces them to be like loving towards each other. And

2:03:18.840 --> 2:03:25.800
 the same, I tried to... One of the reasons I wanted to start this podcast was to try to

2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:33.160
 and... I wanted to be like a do what Joe Rogan did, but for the scientific community,

2:03:33.160 --> 2:03:38.520
 like my little circle of scientific community of like, let's support each other. Yeah. Well,

2:03:38.520 --> 2:03:42.440
 like Avi Loeb, I would have no idea who he was if it wasn't for you. I mean,

2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:45.960
 I assume you put him in touch with Joe. He went on Joe's show. I had him on my show.

2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:49.400
 Like millions of people would have no idea who he was if it wasn't for you.

2:03:49.400 --> 2:03:53.560
 Just by the way, in terms of deep state and shadow government, Avi Loeb has to do with

2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:58.840
 aliens. You better believe Joe. Dude, the last thing I sent to him was the American Airlines

2:03:58.840 --> 2:04:04.600
 Audio. Did you see that? The pilots who were... Oh my God, dude, this is amazing. So like,

2:04:04.600 --> 2:04:10.600
 I'm getting excited. This American Airlines flight crew was over New Mexico, five or six

2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:17.000
 days ago. And the guy comes and goes, hey, do you have any targets up here? A large cylindrical

2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:25.640
 object just flew over me. Okay. So this happens. So this happens. Yes. Then a guy or like a radio

2:04:25.640 --> 2:04:32.680
 catcher records this and posts it online. American Airlines confirms that this is authentic audio

2:04:33.320 --> 2:04:38.840
 and they go, all further questions should be referred to the FBI. So then, okay, American

2:04:38.840 --> 2:04:44.680
 Airlines just confirms a legitimate transmission, FBI, then the FAA comes out and says,

2:04:44.680 --> 2:04:51.560
 we were tracking no objects in the vicinity of this plane at the time of the transmission.

2:04:51.560 --> 2:04:57.000
 So the only plausible explanation that online sleuths have been able to say is maybe he saw a

2:04:57.000 --> 2:05:04.760
 LearJet, which was using like open source data, FAA rules that out. So what was it? He saw a

2:05:04.760 --> 2:05:10.440
 large cylindrical object while he was mid flight, American Airlines flight. You can go online,

2:05:10.440 --> 2:05:16.600
 online, listen to the audio yourself. This is a 100% no shit transmission confirmed by American

2:05:16.600 --> 2:05:25.400
 Airlines of a commercial pilot over New Mexico, seeing a quote unquote, large cylindrical object

2:05:25.400 --> 2:05:29.560
 in the air. Like I said, when we first started talking, I've never believed, I've never believed

2:05:29.560 --> 2:05:37.400
 more in UFOs and aliens. Yeah. This is awesome. Yeah. I just wish both American Airlines, FBI

2:05:37.400 --> 2:05:43.160
 and government would be more transparent. Like there would be voices. I know it sounds ridiculous,

2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:48.840
 but the kind of transparency that you see, maybe not Joe Rogan, he's like overly transparent. He's

2:05:48.840 --> 2:05:56.280
 just a comic really, but just a, I don't know, like a podcast from the FBI, just like being honest,

2:05:56.280 --> 2:06:04.360
 like excited, confused. I'm sure that they're being overly cautious about the release information.

2:06:04.360 --> 2:06:07.400
 I'm sure there's a lot of information that would inspire the public,

2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:12.200
 that it would inspire trust in institutions that will not damage national security.

2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:16.280
 Like it seems to me obvious. And the reason they're not sharing it is because of the

2:06:16.280 --> 2:06:21.400
 momentum of bureaucracy of caution and so on. But there's probably so much cool information

2:06:21.400 --> 2:06:25.640
 that the government has. The way I almost, I wouldn't say it confirmed it's real,

2:06:26.440 --> 2:06:31.640
 but Trump didn't declassify it. Like you know that if there was ever president that actually

2:06:31.640 --> 2:06:37.000
 wanted to get to the bottom of it, it was him. Yeah. I mean, he didn't declassify it, man.

2:06:37.000 --> 2:06:41.800
 And people begged him to, I know for a fact, because I pushed to try and make this happen,

2:06:41.800 --> 2:06:45.800
 that some people did speak to him about it. And he was like, no, I'm not going to do it.

2:06:46.360 --> 2:06:50.520
 So he might be afraid. That's what I mean, though. But they were probably all telling him,

2:06:50.520 --> 2:06:54.200
 they're like, sir, you can't do this, you know, all this, like, wow. And I get that. And

2:06:54.200 --> 2:06:58.200
 there's this legislation written in COVID that like, they have six months to release.

2:06:58.200 --> 2:07:01.320
 Is that real? What is that? Is that a bunch of bullshit? I think it's bullshit. I think it's

2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:05.720
 bull. There's so many different levels of classification that people need to understand.

2:07:05.720 --> 2:07:11.480
 I mean, look, I read John Podesta, he was the chief of staff to Bill Clinton. He's a big UFO guy.

2:07:11.480 --> 2:07:17.480
 He tried. Like him and Clinton tried to get some of this information and they could not get any

2:07:17.480 --> 2:07:21.400
 of it. And we're talking about the president and the White House chief of staff. Well,

2:07:21.400 --> 2:07:25.720
 there's a whole bureaucracy bill just like you're saying with intent. You have to be like,

2:07:25.720 --> 2:07:29.640
 that has to be your focus because there's a whole bureaucracy built around secrecy

2:07:29.640 --> 2:07:33.640
 for probably for a good reason. So to get through to the information,

2:07:33.640 --> 2:07:37.800
 there's a whole like paperwork process, all that kind of stuff. You can't just walk in and get the,

2:07:37.800 --> 2:07:42.680
 unless again, with intention, that becomes your thing. Like less revolutionized this thing.

2:07:43.880 --> 2:07:49.800
 And then you get only so many things. It's sad that the bureaucracy has gotten so bulky.

2:07:49.800 --> 2:07:54.840
 But I think the hopeful messages from earlier in our conversation seems like

2:07:56.040 --> 2:08:01.800
 a single person can't fix it, but if you hire the right team, it feels like you can.

2:08:01.800 --> 2:08:06.280
 Can't fix everything. I don't want to give people unrealistic explanations. You can fix a lot,

2:08:06.280 --> 2:08:11.000
 especially in crisis, you can remake America. And the reason I know that is because it's already

2:08:11.000 --> 2:08:20.840
 happened twice. FDR, or in modern history, FDR and JFK, sorry, FDR and JFK's assassination, LBJ,

2:08:20.840 --> 2:08:27.000
 two hypercompetent men who understood government, who understood personnel,

2:08:27.000 --> 2:08:30.920
 and coincidentally were friends. I love this. I don't think actually people understand this.

2:08:30.920 --> 2:08:38.600
 FDR met Johnson three days after he won his election to Congress, special election. He was

2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:45.000
 only 29 years old. And he left that meeting and called somebody and said, this young man is going

2:08:45.000 --> 2:08:50.680
 to be president of the United States someday. Even then, what was within him to understand

2:08:50.680 --> 2:08:55.000
 and to recognize that? And sometimes Johnson as a young member of Congress would come and have

2:08:55.000 --> 2:09:00.840
 breakfast with FDR, just to the great political minds of the 20th century just sitting there

2:09:00.840 --> 2:09:05.880
 talking. I would give anything to know what that was happening. I hope they were real with each

2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:09.720
 other. It was like a genuine human connection, right? That seems to be the...

2:09:09.720 --> 2:09:12.280
 Well, Johnson wasn't a genuine guy, so it wasn't...

2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:19.400
 Well, I need to read those thousands of pages. I've been way too focused on Hitler.

2:09:20.600 --> 2:09:24.360
 I was going to say, one of my goals in coming to this is like, I got to get Lex into two things

2:09:24.360 --> 2:09:29.160
 because I knew he'll love it. I know he'll love LBJ as it takes the time to read the books.

2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:29.880
 Really?

2:09:29.880 --> 2:09:31.480
 100%. He's the most popular...

2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:32.600
 Of all the presidents?

2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:35.720
 I didn't say you'll love him, but you'll love the books about him because the books

2:09:35.720 --> 2:09:40.200
 are a story of America, the story of politics, the story of power. This is the guy who wrote

2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:46.600
 The Power Broker. These books are up there with Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Edward

2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:48.600
 Gibbon in terms of how power works.

2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:49.640
 The study of power.

2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:50.280
 Exactly.

2:09:50.280 --> 2:09:55.400
 No, that's why Carol wrote the books. And that's why the books are not really about LBJ.

2:09:55.400 --> 2:09:59.960
 They're about power in Washington and about the consolidation of power post New Deal.

2:09:59.960 --> 2:10:05.720
 The consolidation then where they're using the levers of power like Johnson knew in order to

2:10:05.720 --> 2:10:10.520
 change the House of Representatives, the Senate of the United States, and ultimately the Presidency

2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:14.840
 of the United States, which ended in failure and disaster with Vietnam. Don't get me wrong,

2:10:14.840 --> 2:10:19.800
 but he's overlooked for so many of the incredible things that he did with civil rights.

2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:23.720
 Nobody else could have done it. No one else could have gotten it done.

2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:27.080
 And the second thing is, we got to get you into World War I.

2:10:27.080 --> 2:10:31.640
 We got to get you more into World War I because I think that's a rabbit hole,

2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:35.080
 which I know you're a Dan Carlin fan. So blueprint for Armageddon.

2:10:35.080 --> 2:10:35.800
 Yeah, that's good.

2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:36.680
 You're guaranteed.

2:10:36.680 --> 2:10:39.880
 But there's fewer evil people there.

2:10:39.880 --> 2:10:47.720
 Yes, but that's what actually there's a banality of that evil, of the Kaiser and of the

2:10:48.680 --> 2:10:54.280
 Austro Hungarians. And see, I like World War I more because it was unresolved.

2:10:54.280 --> 2:10:58.040
 It's one of those periods I was talking to you about like sometimes you're called and you fail.

2:10:58.040 --> 2:11:03.400
 Like that's what happened. I mean, 50 million people were killed in the most horrific way.

2:11:03.400 --> 2:11:08.040
 Like people literally drowned in the mud like an entire generation.

2:11:09.080 --> 2:11:14.600
 One stat I love is that, you know, Britain didn't need a draft till 1916.

2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:20.520
 Like they went two years of throwing people into barbed wire voluntarily.

2:11:20.520 --> 2:11:24.840
 And because people love their country and they love the king and they thought they were going

2:11:24.840 --> 2:11:30.040
 against the Kaiser, it's just like that conflict to me, I just can't read enough about it.

2:11:30.040 --> 2:11:34.360
 Also just like births, Russian revolution, you know, Hitler.

2:11:34.360 --> 2:11:36.920
 You can't talk about World War II without World War I.

2:11:36.920 --> 2:11:40.680
 Right. And I'm obsessed with the conflict. I've read way too many books about it.

2:11:40.680 --> 2:11:46.120
 For this reason is it's unresolved and like the roots of so much of even our current problems

2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:50.840
 are happened in Versailles, right? Like Vietnam is because of the Treaty of Versailles.

2:11:51.640 --> 2:11:55.160
 Many ways the Middle Eastern problems and the division of the states there,

2:11:55.160 --> 2:11:58.680
 the Treaty of Versailles in terms of the penalties against Germany.

2:11:58.680 --> 2:12:04.200
 But also they fall out from those wars on the French and the German population or the French

2:12:04.200 --> 2:12:11.560
 and the British populations and their reluctance for war in 1939 or 1938 when Neville Chamberlain

2:12:11.560 --> 2:12:15.080
 goes, right? Like that's one of the things people don't understand is the actual appetite of the

2:12:15.080 --> 2:12:19.240
 British public. At that time, they didn't want to go to war, only Churchill. He was the only one in

2:12:19.960 --> 2:12:24.840
 the gathering storm, right? Like being like, hey, this is really bad. And all of that.

2:12:24.840 --> 2:12:28.920
 And then even in the United States, our streak of isolationism, which swept, I mean,

2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:35.480
 things were, because of that conflict, we were convinced as a country that we wanted

2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:40.520
 nothing to do with Europe and its problems. And in many ways that contributed to the proliferation

2:12:40.520 --> 2:12:44.360
 of Hitler and more. So like I'm obsessed with World War I for this reason, which is that it's

2:12:44.360 --> 2:12:50.520
 just like the root, it's like the culmination of the monarchies, then the fall, and then just all

2:12:50.520 --> 2:12:55.800
 the shit spills out from there for like a hundred years. So World War I is like the most important

2:12:55.800 --> 2:13:01.880
 shift in human history versus World War II is like a consequence of that. Yeah. So I have a degree

2:13:01.880 --> 2:13:06.200
 in security studies from Georgetown. And one of the things is that we would focus a lot on that is

2:13:06.200 --> 2:13:13.880
 like war, but also like the complexity around war. And it's funny, we never spent that much time on

2:13:13.880 --> 2:13:20.840
 World War II because there's actually quite of a clean war. It's a very atypical war as in the war

2:13:20.840 --> 2:13:26.680
 object, which we learned from World War I is we must inflict suffering on the German people and

2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:33.320
 invade the borders of Germany and destroy Hitler. Like the center of gravity is the Nazi regime

2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:40.520
 and Hitler. So it had a very basic begin and end, begin, liberate France, invade Germany,

2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:48.600
 destroy Hitler, reoccupy, rebuild. World War I, what are you fighting for? Like, are you, I mean,

2:13:48.600 --> 2:13:53.400
 nobody even knew. You can go to the German general staff. They were like, even in 1917,

2:13:53.400 --> 2:13:57.080
 they're like, the war was worth it because now we have Luxembourg. I'm like, really? Like you killed

2:13:57.080 --> 2:14:01.720
 two million of your citizens for fucking Luxembourg and like half of Belgium, which is now like a

2:14:01.720 --> 2:14:07.320
 pond. And same thing, the French are like, well, the French more so they're defending their borders.

2:14:07.320 --> 2:14:11.320
 But like, what are the British fighting for? Why did hundreds of thousands of British people die

2:14:11.320 --> 2:14:16.760
 in order to preserve the balance of power in Europe and prevent the Kaiser from having a port

2:14:17.320 --> 2:14:23.160
 on the English Channel? Like really, that's why these, that's more what wars are as they become

2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:33.160
 these like atypical, they become these protracted conflicts with a necessary diplomatic resolution

2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:39.080
 that's not clean. It's very dirty. It usually leads in the outbreak of another war and another

2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:43.960
 war and another war and a slow burn of ethnic conflict, which bubbles up. So that's why I

2:14:43.960 --> 2:14:48.920
 look at that one, even because it's more typical of warfare and how it works.

2:14:48.920 --> 2:14:55.000
 Exactly. It's kind of interesting. You make me realize that World War II is one of the rare

2:14:55.640 --> 2:14:59.480
 wars where you can make a strong case for it's a fight of good versus evil.

2:14:59.480 --> 2:15:03.320
 Just war theory, obviously. Like, yeah, they're literally slaughtering Jews. Like, you know,

2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:07.000
 we have to kill them. And there's one person doing it. I mean, there's one person at the core.

2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:13.720
 There's, it's, yeah, that's fascinating. And it's short and there's a clear aggression.

2:15:15.480 --> 2:15:21.080
 It's interesting that Dan Carlin has been avoiding Hitler as well. Yeah.

2:15:22.360 --> 2:15:27.160
 Probably for this reason. Probably for this reason. I mean, but it's complicated too,

2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:33.240
 because there's a pressure that guy has his demons. I love Dan so much. So this is the,

2:15:33.240 --> 2:15:39.800
 the, I don't know if you feel this pressure, but as a creative, he feels the pressure of being,

2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:48.360
 maybe not necessarily correct, but maybe correct in the sense that his understanding,

2:15:48.360 --> 2:15:59.480
 he gets to the bottom of why something happened, of what really happened, get to the bottom of it

2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:04.760
 before he can say something publicly about it. And he is tortured by that burden.

2:16:04.760 --> 2:16:09.560
 I know. You know, he takes so much shit from the historical community for no reason. I think he's

2:16:09.560 --> 2:16:16.200
 the greatest popularizer, quote unquote, of history. And I wish more people in history understood it

2:16:16.200 --> 2:16:20.760
 that way. He was an inspiration to me. I mean, I do some videos sometimes on my Instagram,

2:16:20.760 --> 2:16:24.520
 now where I'll like, I'll do like a book tour. I'll be like, here's my bookshelf of these presidents.

2:16:24.520 --> 2:16:27.880
 And like, here's where I learned from this book and this book and this, and that was very much like

2:16:27.880 --> 2:16:34.200
 a, a skill I learned from him of being like, as, you know, as a historian writes, you know,

2:16:34.200 --> 2:16:38.760
 you know, I look, I just love the way he talks. He's like, in the mud. Or you know, he'll be like,

2:16:38.760 --> 2:16:48.280
 quote unquote. He inspires me, man. He really does to like learn more. And I've read, I bought a lot

2:16:48.280 --> 2:16:52.840
 of books because of Dan Carlin, you know, because of this guy, because of that guy. In terms of,

2:16:52.840 --> 2:16:57.160
 you know, another thing he does, which nobody else, and I'm probably guilty of this, he focuses

2:16:57.160 --> 2:17:03.880
 on the actual people involved. Like he would tell the story of actual British soldiers in World War

2:17:03.880 --> 2:17:09.720
 one. And I probably, and maybe you're guilty of this too, we over focus on what was happening in

2:17:09.720 --> 2:17:13.400
 the German general staff, what was happening in the British general staff. And he doesn't make

2:17:13.400 --> 2:17:18.920
 that mistake. That's what he tells real history. Yeah. And, and make it gives it a feeling. The

2:17:18.920 --> 2:17:23.160
 result is that there's a feeling you get the feeling of what it was like to be there. Exactly.

2:17:24.200 --> 2:17:27.640
 You know, you're becoming quickly becoming more and more popular.

2:17:27.640 --> 2:17:38.280
 Speaking about political issues in part, do you feel a burden, like almost like

2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:46.840
 the prison of your prior convictions of having to being popular with a certain kind of audience,

2:17:47.560 --> 2:17:53.720
 and thereby unable to really think outside the box. I had, I've really struggled with this.

2:17:53.720 --> 2:18:01.160
 I came up in right wing media. I came up a much more doctrinaire conservative in my professional

2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:07.720
 life. I wasn't always conservative. We can get to that later, if you want. And I did feel an immense

2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:16.680
 pressure after Jan, after the election by people to say, wanted me to say the election was stolen.

2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:22.680
 And I knew that I had a sizable part of my audience. Well, here's the benefit. Most people

2:18:22.680 --> 2:18:28.280
 most people know me from rising, which is with Crystal and me. That is inherently a left right

2:18:28.280 --> 2:18:34.920
 program. So it's a large audience. So I felt comfortable and I knew that I could still be

2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:40.200
 fine in terms of my numbers, whatever, because a lot, many people knew me who were on the left.

2:18:40.200 --> 2:18:46.040
 And if, you know, my right listeners abandoned me, so be it. I was had the luxury of able to take

2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:53.000
 that choice. But I still felt an immense amount of pressure to say the election was stolen, to give

2:18:53.000 --> 2:18:58.600
 credence to a lot of the stuff that Trump was doing, to downplay January 6th, to downplay many

2:18:58.600 --> 2:19:03.160
 of the Republican senators, or justify many of the Republican senators, some of whom I know,

2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:07.880
 who objected to the electoral college certification and who stoked some of the flames

2:19:08.760 --> 2:19:15.240
 that have eaten the Republican base. And I just wouldn't do it. And that was hard, man.

2:19:15.240 --> 2:19:22.920
 Like, I feel more politically homeless right now than I ever have. But I have realized

2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:25.960
 in the last couple of months, that's the best thing that ever happened to me.

2:19:25.960 --> 2:19:26.920
 It's freedom.

2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:33.960
 It's true freedom. I now say, I say exactly what I think. And it's not that I wasn't doing that

2:19:33.960 --> 2:19:41.160
 before. It's maybe I would avoid certain topics or like, I would think about things more from a

2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:46.600
 team perspective of like, am I making sure that it's, it's, I'm not saying I didn't fight it.

2:19:46.600 --> 2:19:50.760
 And I still, I criticized the right plenty and Trump plenty before the election and more.

2:19:51.320 --> 2:19:58.440
 It's more just like, I no longer feel as if I even have the illusion of a stake within the game.

2:19:58.440 --> 2:20:05.160
 I'm like, I only look at myself as an outside observer, and I will only call it as I see it

2:20:05.160 --> 2:20:12.520
 truly. And I was aspiring to that before, but I had to have, in a way, Trump stopped the

2:20:12.520 --> 2:20:17.640
 steel thing. It like took my shackles off 100%. Because I was like, no, this is bullshit. And

2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:22.280
 I'm going to say it's bullshit. And I think it's bad. And I think it's bad for the Republican party.

2:20:22.280 --> 2:20:27.480
 And if people in the Republican party don't agree with me on that, that's fine. I'm just not going

2:20:27.480 --> 2:20:30.760
 to be necessarily like associated with you anymore.

2:20:30.760 --> 2:20:32.360
 This is probably one of the first political,

2:20:32.360 --> 2:20:38.600
 related, politics related conversations we've had. I mean, unless you count Michael Malis, who

2:20:38.600 --> 2:20:42.280
 he was great. He's a funny guy.

2:20:42.280 --> 2:20:45.880
 He's not so much political as he is like, burning down, man.

2:20:47.400 --> 2:20:51.160
 He leans too far in anarchy for me. Yeah, I think he's,

2:20:51.720 --> 2:20:55.240
 there's a place for that. It's, it's almost, well, first of all, he's,

2:20:55.240 --> 2:20:59.160
 he's working on a new book, which I really appreciate outside of the, he's working on

2:20:59.160 --> 2:21:05.880
 like a big book for a while, which is white pill. There's also working on this like short

2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:12.520
 little thing, which is like anarchist handbook or something like that. It's like anarchy for

2:21:12.520 --> 2:21:21.640
 idiots or something like that, which I think is really, well, me being an idiot and being curious

2:21:21.640 --> 2:21:24.520
 about anarchy seems useful. So I like those kinds of books.

2:21:24.520 --> 2:21:27.400
 That's Russian heritage, man. They're anarchist one on one.

2:21:27.400 --> 2:21:33.880
 Yeah. I, I mean, it's, I find those kinds of things a useful thought experiment because

2:21:34.600 --> 2:21:40.200
 that's why it's frustrating to me when people talk about communism and socialism,

2:21:40.200 --> 2:21:46.600
 or even capitalism, where they can't enjoy the thought experiment of like, why did

2:21:47.800 --> 2:21:54.280
 communism fail and maybe ask the question of like, are there, is it possible to make

2:21:54.280 --> 2:21:58.840
 communism succeed or are there good ideas in communism? Like I enjoy the thought experiment,

2:21:58.840 --> 2:22:04.440
 like the discourse of it, like the reasoning and like devil's advocate and all that.

2:22:04.440 --> 2:22:08.600
 People have like, seem to not have patience for that. They're like, communism bad, red.

2:22:09.160 --> 2:22:16.200
 I was obsessed with the question and still am. I will never be, I will never quench my thirst

2:22:16.200 --> 2:22:28.600
 for Russian history. I love that period of 1890 to 1925. It's just like, it's so

2:22:28.600 --> 2:22:36.120
 fucking crazy. Like the autocracy embodied in Tsar Alexander. And then you get this like,

2:22:36.120 --> 2:22:43.400
 weird fail son, Nicholas, who is kind of a good guy, but also terrible. And also Russian autocracy

2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:47.800
 itself is terrible. And then I just became obsessed with the question of like, why did the

2:22:47.800 --> 2:22:53.800
 Bolshevik revolution succeed? Because like, people in Russia didn't necessarily want Bolshevism.

2:22:53.800 --> 2:23:00.760
 People suffered a lot under Bolshevism and it led to Stalinism. How did Vladimir Lenin do it?

2:23:00.760 --> 2:23:06.200
 Right? Like, and I became obsessed with that question. And it's still, I find it so interesting,

2:23:06.200 --> 2:23:15.080
 which is that series of accidents of history, incredible boldness by Lenin, incredible real

2:23:15.080 --> 2:23:24.520
 politic, smart, unpopular decisions made by Trotsky and Stalin, and just like the arrogance of the

2:23:24.520 --> 2:23:32.760
 Tsars and of the Russian like autocracy. And just, but at the same time, there's all these like,

2:23:32.760 --> 2:23:38.520
 cultural implications of this, right? In terms of like, how it became hollowed out post Catherine

2:23:38.520 --> 2:23:43.960
 the Great and all that. I was obsessed with autocracy because Russia was an actual autocracy.

2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:50.040
 And like, actually, and I'm like, it was there, like, they didn't even remove serfdom to like,

2:23:50.040 --> 2:23:55.000
 the civil war in America. Like, that's crazy. Like, you know, and nobody really talks about it.

2:23:55.000 --> 2:24:02.280
 And I just became, yeah, I was like, was Bolshevism a natural reaction to the excesses of

2:24:02.280 --> 2:24:08.680
 czarism? There is a convenient explanation where that is true. But there were also a series of

2:24:09.240 --> 2:24:13.960
 decisions made by Lenin and Stalin to kill many of the people in the center left and

2:24:13.960 --> 2:24:19.320
 marginalize them to and also not to associate with the more, quote unquote, like,

2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:25.960
 like, amenable communists in order to make sure that their pure strain of Bolshevism

2:24:26.520 --> 2:24:30.680
 was the only thing. And the reason I like that is because it comes back to a point I made it

2:24:30.680 --> 2:24:35.960
 earlier. It's all about intentionality, which is that you actually can will something into

2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:41.160
 existence, even if people don't want it. That was the craziest thing. Like, nobody wanted this.

2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:47.720
 But it's still ruled for half a century or more, actually, I mean, almost, you know, 75 years to

2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:55.320
 think that there could have been a history of the Soviet Union that was dramatically different

2:24:56.040 --> 2:25:02.440
 than Leninism, Stalinism, that was completely different, like almost would be the American

2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:07.640
 story. Yeah, easily. I mean, there's a world where, and I don't have all the characters,

2:25:07.640 --> 2:25:12.760
 there's like Kerensky, and then there was like, whoever Lenin's number two Stalin's chief rival,

2:25:12.760 --> 2:25:17.000
 and even, I mean, look, even a Soviet Union led by Trotsky, that's a whole other world,

2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:22.040
 right? Like literally a whole other world. And yeah, it's just, I don't know, I find it so

2:25:22.040 --> 2:25:26.280
 interesting. I will never not be fascinated by Russia. I always will. It's funny that I get

2:25:26.280 --> 2:25:30.040
 to talk to you, because it's like, I read this book, I forget what it's called, it won, I think it

2:25:30.040 --> 2:25:37.240
 won a Pulitzer Prize. And it was like the story of, I tried to understand Russia post Crimea,

2:25:37.240 --> 2:25:41.960
 because I came up amongst people who are much more like neoconservative, and they're like,

2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:47.720
 fuck Russia, Russia is bad. And I was like, okay, what do these people think? And we have this

2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:51.960
 narrative of like the fall of the Soviet Union. And then I read this book from the perspective

2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:55.960
 of Russians who lived through the fall, and they were like, I was like, this is terrible.

2:25:55.960 --> 2:26:02.120
 Like, actually, the introduction of capitalism was awful. And like the rise of all these crazy

2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:11.640
 oligarchs, that's why Putin came to power, to restore order to the oligarchy.

2:26:11.640 --> 2:26:15.400
 And he still talks to this day. Do you guys, I mean, that's always the threat of like,

2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:18.520
 do you want to return to the 90s? Right. Do you want to return?

2:26:18.520 --> 2:26:23.640
 To Yeltsin. And like, but the thing is in the West, we have this like our own propaganda of

2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:27.720
 like, no, Yeltsin was great. That was the golden age, what could have been with Russia. And I was

2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:34.200
 like, well, what do actual Russians think? And so that, yeah, I'll always be fascinated by it.

2:26:34.200 --> 2:26:41.160
 And then just like to understand the idea of feeling encircled by NATO and all that,

2:26:41.160 --> 2:26:46.360
 you have to understand like Russian defense theory, all the way of going back to the Tsars

2:26:46.360 --> 2:26:52.600
 has always been defense in depth in terms of having Estonia, Lithuania and more is like

2:26:52.600 --> 2:26:57.080
 protection of the heartland. I'm not justifying in this. So NATO shills like, please don't come

2:26:57.080 --> 2:27:02.360
 after me. But look, Estonian, Estonians like NATO, they want to be in NATO. So I don't want to

2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:07.480
 minimize that. I'm more just saying like, I understand him and Russia much better,

2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:12.360
 having done that. And we are very incapable in America, I think this is probably because my

2:27:12.360 --> 2:27:17.800
 parents are immigrants, I've traveled a lot of putting yourself in the mind of people who aren't

2:27:18.360 --> 2:27:23.400
 Western and haven't lived a history, especially our lives of America's fucking awesome, we're the

2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:27.880
 number one country in the world. Like, we're literally better than you, like in many ways.

2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:34.520
 And they, they can't empathize with people who have suffered so much. And I just, yeah, it's

2:27:34.520 --> 2:27:39.880
 just so interesting to me. What about if we could talk for just a brief moment about the human of

2:27:39.880 --> 2:27:51.640
 Putin and power? You are clearly fascinated by power. Do you think power changed Putin? Do you

2:27:51.640 --> 2:27:59.800
 think power changes leaders? If you look at the great leaders in history, whether it's LBJ, FDR,

2:27:59.800 --> 2:28:05.000
 or do you think power really changes people? Like, is there a truth to that kind of old

2:28:05.000 --> 2:28:11.640
 proverb? It reveals. I think that's what it does. It reveals. So Putin was a much more

2:28:11.640 --> 2:28:17.480
 deft politician, much more amenable to the West. If you think back, you know, to 2001 and more

2:28:18.040 --> 2:28:22.040
 right when he came, because he was still, because at that time, his biggest problem was

2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:27.400
 intra Russian politics, right? Like it was all consolidating power within the oligarchy.

2:28:27.400 --> 2:28:34.120
 Once he did that by around like 2007, there's that famous time when he spoke out against the

2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:38.920
 West at the Munich security conference. I forget when it was. And that's when everybody in the

2:28:38.920 --> 2:28:43.960
 audience was like, whoa, and he was talking about like NATO encirclement and like, we will not be

2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:49.640
 beaten back by the West very shortly afterwards, like the Georgia invasion happens. And that was

2:28:49.640 --> 2:28:54.200
 like a big wake up call of like, we will not be pushed around anymore. I mean, he said before

2:28:54.200 --> 2:28:58.360
 publicly, like the worst thing that ever happened was the fall or what did he say was like the

2:28:58.360 --> 2:29:02.280
 fall of the Soviet Union was a tragedy, right? Yeah, of course, people in the West were like,

2:29:02.280 --> 2:29:08.200
 what? I'm like, I get it. Like they were a superpower. Now their population is declining.

2:29:08.200 --> 2:29:14.040
 Like it's like a petro state. It sucks. Like, I understand. I understand like how somebody

2:29:14.040 --> 2:29:21.960
 could feel about that. I think it revealed his character, which is that he, I think he thinks

2:29:21.960 --> 2:29:28.120
 of himself probably as he always has since 2001 as like this benevolent, almost as a

2:29:28.120 --> 2:29:31.960
 benevolent dictator. He's like, without me, the whole system would collapse. I'm the only guy

2:29:31.960 --> 2:29:36.440
 is keeping these people and I'm the only guy keeping all these people in check. Most Russians

2:29:36.440 --> 2:29:42.840
 probably do support Putin because they feel like they support some form of functional

2:29:42.840 --> 2:29:49.160
 government and they view like a check against that, which is a long, you know, has a long history

2:29:49.160 --> 2:29:55.240
 within Russia too. So I don't know if it changed him. I think it just revealed him because it's

2:29:55.240 --> 2:29:59.000
 not like he, I mean, he has a bill, you know, Navalny has put that like billion dollar palace

2:29:59.000 --> 2:30:04.680
 and all that. I don't know. Sometimes I feel like Putin does that for show. He doesn't seem like

2:30:04.680 --> 2:30:08.680
 somebody who indulges in all that stuff or maybe we just don't see it. Like, I don't know. Well,

2:30:08.680 --> 2:30:12.280
 I don't. Yeah, it's very difficult for me to understand. I've been hanging out. Thanks to

2:30:12.280 --> 2:30:20.040
 Clubhouse. A lot of, I've gotten to learn a lot about the Navalny folks and it's been very educational.

2:30:21.160 --> 2:30:26.520
 Made me ask a lot of important questions about what, you know, question a lot of my

2:30:26.520 --> 2:30:34.280
 assumptions about what I do and don't know. But I'll just say that I do believe, you know,

2:30:34.280 --> 2:30:41.000
 there's a lot of the Navalny folks say that Putin is incompetent and is a bad executive, like,

2:30:41.000 --> 2:30:47.720
 is bad at basically running government. But to me. Well, why do Russians not think that?

2:30:48.280 --> 2:30:53.880
 Right? Well, they probably say propaganda. Yeah, they would say the control. There is a strong,

2:30:53.880 --> 2:30:59.000
 either control or pressure on the press. But I think there is a legitimate support and love

2:30:59.000 --> 2:31:05.640
 of Putin in Russia that is not grounded in just misinformation and propaganda. There's

2:31:05.640 --> 2:31:13.080
 legitimacy there. Mostly I try to remain apolitical and actually genuinely remain apolitical. I'm

2:31:13.080 --> 2:31:20.600
 legitimately not interested in the politics of Russia of today. I feel I have some responsibility

2:31:20.600 --> 2:31:26.520
 and I'll take it that responsibility on as I need to. But my fascination as it is perhaps with you

2:31:26.520 --> 2:31:32.920
 in part is in the historical figure of Putin. I know he's currently president, but I'm almost

2:31:32.920 --> 2:31:38.680
 looking like as if I was a kid in 30 years from now reading about him, studying the human being,

2:31:40.120 --> 2:31:46.920
 the games of power that are played that got him to gain power, to maintain power,

2:31:46.920 --> 2:31:54.680
 what that says about his human nature, the nature of the bureaucracy that's around him,

2:31:54.680 --> 2:31:59.800
 the nature of Russia, the people, all those kinds of things, as opposed to the politics and the

2:31:59.800 --> 2:32:04.840
 manipulation and the corruption and the control of the media that results in misinformation.

2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:10.040
 Those are the bickering of the day, just like we were saying, what will actually be remembered

2:32:10.040 --> 2:32:13.960
 about this moment in history? Totally. He's a transformational figure in Russian history,

2:32:13.960 --> 2:32:17.800
 really, like the bridge between the fall of the Soviet Union and the chaos of Yeltsin.

2:32:18.360 --> 2:32:23.240
 That will be how he's remembered. The only question is what comes next and what he wants

2:32:23.240 --> 2:32:27.800
 to come next. I'm always, I'm like, he's getting up. How old is he? 60 something?

2:32:27.800 --> 2:32:34.680
 Yeah, 60. So he would be, I think he would be 80. So with the change of the constitution,

2:32:34.680 --> 2:32:46.520
 he cannot be president until 2034, I think it is. So he would be like 80 something,

2:32:46.520 --> 2:32:49.560
 and he would be in power for over 30 years, which is longer than Stalin.

2:32:49.560 --> 2:32:57.720
 But he still seems to be... He seems fit. I think he's going to be around for a long time.

2:32:57.720 --> 2:33:01.720
 But this is a fascinating question that you ask, which is like, what does he want?

2:33:01.720 --> 2:33:05.880
 I don't know. Yeah, that's the question. And this is where I think,

2:33:05.880 --> 2:33:09.800
 given all of his behavior and more, I don't know if it's about money. I don't know if it's

2:33:09.800 --> 2:33:14.120
 about enriching himself. Obviously, he did to the tune of billions and billions and billions of

2:33:14.120 --> 2:33:20.200
 dollars. But I think he probably, he's as close to like an actual Russian nationalist,

2:33:20.200 --> 2:33:25.960
 like at the top, who really does believe in Russia as its rightful superpower.

2:33:25.960 --> 2:33:31.720
 Everything he does seems to stem from that opposition to NATO, intro to Syria, like wanting

2:33:31.720 --> 2:33:40.120
 to play a large role in affairs, deeply distrustful and yet coveting of the European powers.

2:33:40.120 --> 2:33:46.120
 Like I could describe every czar in those same language. Like every czar falls into the exact

2:33:46.120 --> 2:33:51.640
 same category. Yeah. And it makes me wonder, looking at some of the biggest leaders in human

2:33:51.640 --> 2:33:56.920
 history to ask the question of what was the motivation? What was the motivation for even

2:33:56.920 --> 2:34:02.680
 just the revolutionaries like Lenin, Trotsky and Stalin? What was the motivation? Because it sure as

2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:13.080
 hell seems like the motivation was at least in part driven by the idea, by ideas, not self

2:34:13.800 --> 2:34:18.840
 interest of like power. For Lenin, it was, I think he was a true believer and an actual

2:34:18.840 --> 2:34:23.000
 narcissist who thought he was the only one who could do it. Stalin, I do think, just wanted

2:34:23.000 --> 2:34:27.160
 power and realized, well, I don't know. Look, he wrote very passionately when he was young.

2:34:27.160 --> 2:34:33.480
 And he really believed in communism. In the beginning he did. I'm always fascinated

2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:39.400
 as I'm like around 1920, what happened, right? Post revolution, you crushed the whites,

2:34:40.200 --> 2:34:45.480
 now it's all about consolidation. That's where the games really began. And I'm like,

2:34:45.480 --> 2:34:53.080
 I don't think that was about communism. Yeah, maybe it became a useful propaganda tool,

2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:58.040
 but it still seemed like he believed in it, whether it was, of course, this is the question.

2:34:58.600 --> 2:35:04.760
 This is the problem with conspiracy theories for me. And this is legitimate criticism towards me

2:35:04.760 --> 2:35:10.760
 about conspiracy theories, which is just because you're not like this doesn't mean others aren't

2:35:10.760 --> 2:35:17.640
 like this. So I can't believe that somebody be like deeply two faced. Oh, I've met them. You're

2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:28.280
 welcome to Washington. But like, I think that I would be able to detect. Like, no. Well, my question

2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:33.880
 is, I've seen it. I mean, well, so there's difference. There's two face, like, there's

2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:41.480
 different levels of two face. Like what I mean is to be killing people. And it's like House of

2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:48.200
 Card style, right? And and still present a front like you're, like you're not killing people.

2:35:48.920 --> 2:35:55.160
 I don't know if I guess it's possible, but I just don't see that at scale. Like,

2:35:55.160 --> 2:35:58.600
 there's a lot of people like that. And I don't have trouble imagining

2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:06.440
 some, you know, that's such a compelling narrative that people like to say, like people,

2:36:06.440 --> 2:36:12.040
 that's the conspiratorial mindset. I think that skepticism was really powerful and important

2:36:12.040 --> 2:36:16.920
 to have because it's true. A lot of powerful people abuse their power. But saying that about

2:36:17.880 --> 2:36:25.480
 I feel like people over assume that I see that with use of steroids often in sports,

2:36:25.480 --> 2:36:31.160
 people seem to make that claim about like everybody who's successful. And I want to be

2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:37.160
 very, I don't know, something about me wants to be cautious because I want to give people a chance.

2:36:37.800 --> 2:36:41.960
 Being purely cynical isn't helpful. People say this about me. He's always saying this to do this.

2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:46.200
 Yeah. But at the same time, being naively optimistic about everything is also kind of

2:36:46.200 --> 2:36:49.880
 a deathly scheme of people are going to fuck you over. And more importantly,

2:36:50.600 --> 2:36:53.960
 that doesn't bother me. More importantly, you're not going to be able to reason about

2:36:53.960 --> 2:36:58.760
 how to create systems that are going to be a robust corruption to malevolent

2:36:58.760 --> 2:37:05.880
 parties. So in order to create, you have to have a healthy balance of both,

2:37:05.880 --> 2:37:11.400
 I suppose, especially if you want to actually engineer things that work in this world that

2:37:11.400 --> 2:37:15.160
 has evil in it. I can't believe there's a book of Hitler on the desk.

2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:22.840
 We've mentioned a lot of books throughout this conversation. I wonder, and this makes me really

2:37:22.840 --> 2:37:30.600
 curious to explore in a lot of depth the kind of books that you're interested in. I think you

2:37:30.600 --> 2:37:38.440
 mentioned in your show that you provide recommendations. Yes, I do. In the form of spoken word,

2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:45.480
 can you be on what we've already recommended, mention books, whether it is historical,

2:37:46.760 --> 2:37:51.000
 nonfiction, or whether it's more like philosophical or even fiction that had a big

2:37:51.000 --> 2:37:55.000
 impact on your life. Is there a few that you can mention? Sure. I already talked about the

2:37:55.000 --> 2:38:00.200
 Johnson books. I'll leave that alone. Robert A. Caro, he's still alive. Thank God. He's finishing

2:38:00.200 --> 2:38:07.000
 the last book. I hope he makes it. So those Johnson books. Second, can I ask you a question

2:38:07.000 --> 2:38:11.480
 about those books? Yes. What the hell do you fit into so many pages? Everything, man.

2:38:12.760 --> 2:38:15.720
 Let me tell you this. So I'll just give you an anecdote. This is why I love these books.

2:38:15.720 --> 2:38:21.800
 The beginning, the first book, is about Lyndon Johnson. His life, when he gets elected to

2:38:21.800 --> 2:38:29.240
 Congress, the book begins with a history of Texas and its weather patterns, and then of his great,

2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:35.800
 great grandfather moving to Texas. Then the story of that, about 100 or so pages in,

2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:41.240
 you get to Lyndon Johnson. Yes. That's how you do it, which is you get. It looks like a Tolstoy

2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:45.880
 style retelling. This is the thing. It's not a biography. It's a story of the times. That's

2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:50.280
 a great biography. Got it. So another one. This isn't part of my list, so don't do it.

2:38:51.880 --> 2:38:58.120
 It's Grant Ron Chernau. Ron Chernau's grant. It's a thousand pages. And the reason I tell

2:38:58.120 --> 2:39:04.200
 everybody to read it is it's not just the story of Grant. It is the story of precivil war America,

2:39:04.200 --> 2:39:10.680
 the Mexican American war, the civil war, and reconstruction all told in the life of one person

2:39:10.680 --> 2:39:14.280
 who was involved in all three. Most people don't know anything about the Mexican American war.

2:39:14.280 --> 2:39:18.520
 It's fascinating. Most people don't know anything about reconstruction. Now,

2:39:18.520 --> 2:39:22.760
 more so because people are talking, it's a hot topic now. I've been reading about it for years.

2:39:22.760 --> 2:39:27.720
 That is another thing people need to learn a lot more about. In terms of nonhistory books,

2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:34.760
 the book that probably had the most impact on me, which is also historical nonfiction,

2:39:34.760 --> 2:39:44.440
 is I am obsessed with Antarctic exploration. And it all began with a book called Shackleton's

2:39:44.440 --> 2:39:50.840
 Incredible Journey, which is the collection of diaries of everybody who was on Shackleton's

2:39:50.840 --> 2:39:58.200
 Journey. For those who don't know, Shackleton was the last explorer of the heroic age of

2:39:58.200 --> 2:40:06.520
 Antarctic exploration. He led a ship called the Endurance, which froze in the ice off the coast

2:40:06.520 --> 2:40:14.520
 of Antarctica in 1914. And they didn't have radios or the last exploration, the last one

2:40:14.520 --> 2:40:20.840
 without the age of radio. And he happens to freeze in the ice. And then the ship collapses

2:40:20.840 --> 2:40:29.640
 after a year frozen in the ice. And this man leads his entire crew from that ship onto the ice with

2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:36.360
 a team of dogs, survives out on the ice for another year with three little lifeboats,

2:40:36.360 --> 2:40:42.680
 and is able to get all of his men, every single one of them alive, to an island hundreds of miles

2:40:42.680 --> 2:40:49.000
 away called Elephant Island. And when they got there, he had to leave everybody behind except

2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:56.680
 for six people. And him and two other guys, I'm forgetting their names, navigated by the stars

2:40:57.240 --> 2:41:03.400
 800 miles through the Drake Passage with seas of hundreds of feet to Prince George,

2:41:03.400 --> 2:41:08.360
 I think it's called Prince George's Island. And then when they got to Prince George's Island,

2:41:08.360 --> 2:41:14.360
 they landed on the wrong side, and they had to hike from one side to the other to go and

2:41:14.360 --> 2:41:19.160
 meet the whalers. And every single one of those things was supposed to be impossible. Nobody

2:41:19.160 --> 2:41:24.120
 was ever, nobody was ever supposed to hike that island. It wasn't done again until like the 1980s

2:41:24.120 --> 2:41:29.480
 with professional equipment. He did it after two years of starvation. Nobody was ever supposed to

2:41:29.480 --> 2:41:36.200
 make it from Elephant Island to Prince George. The guy, they had to hold him steady, his legs,

2:41:36.200 --> 2:41:41.560
 so that he could chart the stars. And if they missed this island, they're into open sea,

2:41:41.560 --> 2:41:47.560
 they're dead. And then before that, how do you survive for a year on the ice? On seals. And

2:41:47.560 --> 2:41:54.920
 before that, he kept his crew from depression frozen one year in the ice. It's just an amazing

2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:59.720
 story. And it made me obsessed with Antarctic exploration. So I've read like 15 books on

2:41:59.720 --> 2:42:04.360
 what the hell is it about the human spirit? That's the thing about Antarctica is it brings it out

2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:09.960
 of you. For example, I read another one recently called Mawson's Will, Douglas Mawson. He was an

2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:16.360
 Australian. He was on one of the first Shackled, or Robert Frost Expeditions. He leads an expedition

2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:23.320
 down to the south. Him and a partner, they're leading explorations, 1908, something like that.

2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:30.680
 They're going around Antarctica with dog teams. And one of the, what happens is they keep going

2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:36.920
 over these snow bridges where there's a crevice, but it's covered in snow. And so one of the lead

2:42:36.920 --> 2:42:44.440
 driver, the dogs go over and they've plummet. And that sled takes with it. So the guy survives,

2:42:44.440 --> 2:42:52.680
 but that sled takes all their food, half the dogs, their stove, the camping tent,

2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:57.960
 the tent specifically designed for the snow, everything. And they're hundreds of miles away

2:42:57.960 --> 2:43:04.920
 from base camp. He and this guy have to make it back there in time before the ship comes

2:43:04.920 --> 2:43:11.000
 to come get them on an agreed upon date. And he makes it. But the guy he was with, he dies.

2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:15.800
 And it's a crazy story. First of all, they have to eat the dogs. A really creepy part of Antarctic

2:43:15.800 --> 2:43:21.800
 Exploration is everyone ends up eating dogs at different points. And part of the theory,

2:43:21.800 --> 2:43:28.760
 which is so crazy, is that the guy he was with was dying because they were eating dog liver.

2:43:28.760 --> 2:43:34.600
 And dog liver has a lot of vitamin E, which if you eat too much of it, can give you a poisoning.

2:43:34.600 --> 2:43:40.760
 And so Mossin, by trying to help his friend, was giving him more of all the things that kills you.

2:43:40.760 --> 2:43:45.720
 I know, his dog liver. And so his friend ends up dying, have a horrific heart attack,

2:43:45.720 --> 2:43:51.320
 all of that. Mossin crawls back hundreds of miles away, makes it back to base camp

2:43:51.320 --> 2:43:57.720
 hours after the ship leaves. And two guys, or a couple of guys stayed behind for him.

2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:02.440
 And he basically has to recuperate for like six months before he can even walk again.

2:44:02.440 --> 2:44:05.640
 But it's like you were saying about the human spirit, it's like Antarctica

2:44:06.280 --> 2:44:09.800
 brings that out of people. Or Amundsen, the guy who made it to the South Pole,

2:44:10.440 --> 2:44:17.480
 Robert Amundsen. Oh my God. Like this guy trained his whole life in the ice from Norway

2:44:18.280 --> 2:44:23.640
 to make it to the South Pole. And he beat Robert Frost, the British guy with all this money

2:44:23.640 --> 2:44:27.080
 and all these. I could go on this forever. I'm obsessed with it.

2:44:27.080 --> 2:44:32.680
 Well, first of all, I'm going to take this part of the podcast. I'm going to set it to music.

2:44:32.680 --> 2:44:37.400
 I'm going to listen to it because I've been whining and bitching about running 48 miles with

2:44:37.400 --> 2:44:42.680
 Goggins this next weekend. And this is going to be so easy. I'm just going to listen to this over

2:44:42.680 --> 2:44:46.520
 and over in my head. Elon's obsessed with Shackleton. He talks about him all the time.

2:44:46.520 --> 2:44:50.600
 He uses, I was going to ask you about that. He uses an example of,

2:44:50.600 --> 2:44:57.480
 that is an example of what Mars colonization would be like. He's right.

2:44:58.280 --> 2:45:01.880
 No, Antarctica is as close to, you can simulate that.

2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:08.760
 Antarctica is as close to what you could simulate what it would get. That Nat Geo series on Mars,

2:45:08.760 --> 2:45:13.560
 I'm not sure if you watched it. It's incredible. Elon's actually in it. And it's like,

2:45:13.560 --> 2:45:20.360
 they get there, everything goes wrong, somebody dies, it's horrible, they can't find any water,

2:45:20.360 --> 2:45:24.200
 it's not working. So what is it? Is it like simulating the experience of what it would be

2:45:24.200 --> 2:45:31.880
 like to colonize? So it's like a docuseries where the fictionalized part is the astronauts on Mars.

2:45:31.880 --> 2:45:36.760
 But then they're interviewing people like Elon Musk and others who were the ones who paved the

2:45:36.760 --> 2:45:42.600
 way to get to Mars. So it's a really interesting concept. I think it's on Netflix. And yeah,

2:45:42.600 --> 2:45:47.720
 I agree with him 100%, which is that the first guys to make, for example, Robert Frost who

2:45:47.720 --> 2:45:56.200
 went to Antarctica, the British explorer who was beaten to the South Pole three weeks by

2:45:56.200 --> 2:46:01.240
 Robert Amundsen, he died on the way back. And the reason why is because he wasn't well prepared.

2:46:01.240 --> 2:46:08.280
 He was arrogant. He didn't have the proper amounts of supplies. His team had terrible morale.

2:46:08.280 --> 2:46:14.360
 Antarctica is a brutal place. If you fuck up one time, you die. And this is what you read a lot

2:46:14.360 --> 2:46:19.880
 about, which is the reason why such heroic characters like Shackleton Shine is a lot of

2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:25.240
 people died. Like there were some people who got frozen in the eye. I mean, man, this again also

2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:30.280
 came to the North exploration. So I read a lot about like the exploration of the North Pole.

2:46:30.920 --> 2:46:37.800
 And same thing, these unextraordinary men take people out into the ice and get frozen out there

2:46:37.800 --> 2:46:44.440
 for years and shit goes so bad. They end up eating each other. They all die. There's the famous,

2:46:44.440 --> 2:46:49.240
 I want to forget his name, the British Franklin expedition, where they went searching for them

2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:53.480
 for like 20 years. And they eventually came across a group of Inuit who were like, oh yeah,

2:46:53.480 --> 2:46:58.200
 we saw some weird white men here like 15 years ago. And they find their bones and there's like

2:46:58.200 --> 2:47:02.920
 saw marks which show that they were eating each other. So history remembers the ones who didn't

2:47:02.920 --> 2:47:09.560
 eat each other. Yeah. Well, yeah, we remember the ones who made it, but there are... And that

2:47:09.560 --> 2:47:13.560
 would be the story of Mars as well. That will be the story of Mars. But nevertheless, that's the

2:47:13.560 --> 2:47:21.080
 interesting thing about Antarctica. Nevertheless, something about human nature drives us to explore

2:47:21.080 --> 2:47:27.800
 it. And that seems to be like, a lot of people have this kind of, to me, frustrating conversations

2:47:27.800 --> 2:47:34.760
 like, well, Earth is great, man. Why do we need to colonize Mars? You just don't get it. I don't

2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:39.560
 know. I mean, I don't know. It's the same people that say, like, why are you running, like, why

2:47:39.560 --> 2:47:45.480
 are you running a marathon? What are you running from, man? Yeah. I don't know. It's pushing the

2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:53.240
 limits of the human mind of the, of what's possible. It's torch Mallory because it's there.

2:47:53.240 --> 2:48:00.920
 Yeah. It's simple. And that somehow, actually, the result of that, if you want to be pragmatic about

2:48:00.920 --> 2:48:06.440
 it, there's something about pushing that limit that has side effects that you don't expect that

2:48:06.440 --> 2:48:11.320
 will create a better world back home for the people, not necessarily on Earth, but like,

2:48:11.880 --> 2:48:18.120
 just in general, it raises the quality of life for everybody, even though the initial endeavor

2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:26.360
 doesn't make any sense. The very fact of pushing the limits of what's possible then has side effects

2:48:26.360 --> 2:48:32.840
 of benefiting everybody. And it's difficult to predict ahead of time of what those benefits

2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:38.360
 will be. Say with colonizing Mars, it's unclear what the benefits will be for Earth or in general.

2:48:38.360 --> 2:48:43.960
 Well, what do we get from the moon? What did we get from Apollo, right? Technically. And there

2:48:43.960 --> 2:48:48.600
 were a lot of socialists at the time making this argument. They're like, all this money going,

2:48:48.600 --> 2:48:54.680
 you know what? We went to the fucking moon in 1969. That was amazing. The greatest

2:48:54.680 --> 2:49:02.200
 feat in human history, period. What did we learn from it? We learned about interstellar or

2:49:02.200 --> 2:49:09.080
 interplanetary travel. We learned that we could do something off of a device less powerful than

2:49:09.080 --> 2:49:16.200
 the computer in my pocket. The amount of potential locked within my pocket and your pocket,

2:49:17.240 --> 2:49:24.200
 if you were to define my politics in one way, it's a quest for national greatness. There is no

2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:29.400
 greatness without fulfilling the ultimate calling of the human spirit, which is more,

2:49:30.120 --> 2:49:37.320
 it's not enough. And why should it be? It wasn't enough. Our ancestors could have been content

2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:42.520
 to sit. Well, actually, many of them were, were content to sit and say, these berries will be here

2:49:42.520 --> 2:49:48.040
 for a long time. And they got eaten and they died. And it's the ones who got out and went to the next

2:49:48.040 --> 2:49:54.360
 place and the next place and went across a Siberian land bridge and went across more and just did

2:49:54.360 --> 2:50:00.440
 extraordinary things. The craziest ones, we are their offspring and we fail them if we don't go

2:50:00.440 --> 2:50:07.720
 into space. That's how I would put it. You should run for president. I'm just pro space, man. I love

2:50:07.720 --> 2:50:14.680
 space. No, you're pro doing difficult things and pushing, exploring the world and all of its forms.

2:50:14.680 --> 2:50:24.040
 I hope that kind of spirit permeates politics too. That same kind of can. Well, it can and I hope so.

2:50:24.600 --> 2:50:28.280
 I don't know if you want to stay on it, but I think that was book number one or two. Oh,

2:50:28.280 --> 2:50:34.120
 shit. All right. Well, this one is second. This actually is a corollary to that, which is sapiens.

2:50:34.120 --> 2:50:38.920
 And I know that's a very normal, normy answer. One of the best selling books. I think there's

2:50:38.920 --> 2:50:44.840
 a reason for that. You've all know Harari. Okay, look, yes, he didn't do any new research. I get

2:50:44.840 --> 2:50:48.840
 that. All he did was aggregate. I'm sure he's very controversial in the scientific community.

2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:56.200
 But guess what? He wrote a great book. It's a very easy to read general explanation of the

2:50:56.200 --> 2:51:01.960
 rise of human history. And it helps challenge a lot of preconceptions. Are we special? Are we an

2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:08.680
 accident? Are we more like a parasite? Are we not? What is there a destiny to all of us? I don't know.

2:51:08.680 --> 2:51:14.120
 You know, if anything, it's like what I just described, which is more move, move out, the

2:51:14.120 --> 2:51:20.360
 evolution of money. Like, I know he gets a lot of hate, but I think that he writes it so clearly

2:51:20.360 --> 2:51:25.160
 and well, that for your average person to be able to read that, you will come away with a more

2:51:25.160 --> 2:51:30.600
 clear understanding of the human race than before. And I think that that's why it's worth it.

2:51:30.600 --> 2:51:36.440
 I agree with you 100%. I'm ashamed to, I usually don't bring up sapiens because it's like...

2:51:36.440 --> 2:51:39.960
 Yeah, it's like, his uncle's read it, but that's a good thing.

2:51:41.000 --> 2:51:45.320
 It is one of the, I think you'll be remembered as one of the great books of this particular era.

2:51:46.360 --> 2:51:50.920
 Yeah, because it's so clearly, it's like the selfish gene with doctors. I mean,

2:51:50.920 --> 2:51:56.840
 it just aggregates so many ideas together and puts language to it that makes it very useful to talk

2:51:56.840 --> 2:52:03.560
 about. So it is one of the great books. 100%. Another one is definitely Born to Run for the

2:52:03.560 --> 2:52:08.040
 same reason by Christopher McDougal, which is that... I'm just gonna listen to this whole podcast

2:52:08.040 --> 2:52:15.320
 next week. You have to. You should because it, you are inheriting our most basic skill, which is

2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:24.680
 running and reimagining human history or reimagining what we were as opposed to what we are is very

2:52:24.680 --> 2:52:30.920
 useful because it helps you understand how to tap into primal aspects of your brain,

2:52:30.920 --> 2:52:36.360
 which just drive you. And the reason I love McDougal's writing is because I love anybody who

2:52:36.360 --> 2:52:42.600
 writes like this. Malcolm Gladwell, who else? Michael Lewis, people who find characters to

2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:46.840
 tell a bigger story. Michael Lewis finds characters to tell us the story of the financial crisis.

2:52:47.960 --> 2:52:52.200
 Malcolm Gladwell writes, finds characters to tell us the story of learning new skills and

2:52:52.200 --> 2:53:00.040
 outliers and whatever his latest book is. I forget what it's called. But McDougal tells the vignettes

2:53:00.040 --> 2:53:07.640
 and a tiny story of a single person in the history of running and how it's baked into your DNA.

2:53:07.640 --> 2:53:11.640
 And I think there was just something very useful to that for me for being like,

2:53:11.640 --> 2:53:15.240
 I don't need to go to the gym or like, I'm not saying you should still go to the gym.

2:53:15.240 --> 2:53:20.760
 I'll be clear. I'm saying like, in order to fulfill like who you are, you can actually tap

2:53:20.760 --> 2:53:25.320
 into something that's the most basic. I don't know if I'm sure you've listened to the David

2:53:25.320 --> 2:53:33.240
 Cho episode with Joe Rogan. Oh, where he's the animal. Yeah, with the baboon. And there's something

2:53:33.240 --> 2:53:38.680
 to that man. There's something to that, which is like, they are living the way that we were supposed

2:53:38.680 --> 2:53:43.080
 to. But not to put, well, I don't want to put a normative judgment on it. They're living the way

2:53:43.720 --> 2:53:48.600
 that we used to. There's something very honest somehow to our true nature.

2:53:48.600 --> 2:53:54.120
 There's a guy I follow on Instagram. I've come from Paul Saladino, Carnivore MD. He just went

2:53:54.120 --> 2:53:59.640
 over there to the Hadza to live with them. And I was watching his stuff just like, I was like,

2:53:59.640 --> 2:54:05.480
 man, there's something in you that wants to go. I'm like, I want to do that. I wouldn't be very

2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:11.000
 good at it. But like I want to. I'm so glad that somebody who thinks deeply about politics is

2:54:11.000 --> 2:54:19.240
 so fascinated with exploration and with the very basic nature, like human nature, nature of our

2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:27.320
 existence. I love that. There's something in you. And still you're stuck in DC. For now. Speaking of

2:54:27.320 --> 2:54:36.600
 which, you are from Texas. What do you make of the future of Texas politically, culturally,

2:54:37.880 --> 2:54:45.800
 economically? I am in part moving, well, I'm moving to Austin. But I'm also doing the Eric

2:54:45.800 --> 2:54:51.800
 Weinstein advice, which is like, dude, you're not married. You don't have kids. There's no such

2:54:51.800 --> 2:54:59.800
 thing as moving. What are you moving? You're like your three suits and some shirts and underwear.

2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:07.480
 What exactly is the move and tail? So I have nothing. So I'm basically, it's very just remain

2:55:07.480 --> 2:55:17.160
 mobile. But there's a promise. There's a hope to Austin. Outside of just like friendships,

2:55:17.160 --> 2:55:22.680
 I have no, it's a very different culture that Joe Rogan is creating. I'm mostly interested in what

2:55:22.680 --> 2:55:29.320
 the next Silicon Valley will be, what the next hub of technological innovation. And there's a promise,

2:55:30.520 --> 2:55:37.320
 maybe a dream for Austin being that next place that doesn't have the baggage of

2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:46.680
 some of the political things, maybe some of the sort of things that hold back the beauty of,

2:55:47.880 --> 2:55:53.960
 that makes capitalism, that makes innovation so powerful, which is like meritocracy, which is

2:55:53.960 --> 2:56:02.040
 excellence. Diversity is exceptionally important, but it should not be the only priority. It has to

2:56:02.040 --> 2:56:12.440
 be something that coexists with the insatiable drive towards excellence. And it seems like Texas

2:56:12.440 --> 2:56:20.040
 is a nice place, like having a Austin, which is like a kind of this weird, I hope it stays weird,

2:56:20.040 --> 2:56:25.720
 man. I love weird people. I don't know about that, but we can get into it. But it has this

2:56:25.720 --> 2:56:33.320
 hope is it remains this weird place of brilliant innovation amongst the

2:56:34.440 --> 2:56:38.200
 estate that's like more conservative. So like there's a nice balance of everything.

2:56:38.200 --> 2:56:42.360
 What are your thoughts about the future of Texas? I think it's so fascinating to me,

2:56:43.080 --> 2:56:49.560
 because I never thought I would want to move back, but now I'm beginning to be convinced.

2:56:49.560 --> 2:56:59.080
 I'm being honest, and many Texas will hate me for this. Texas was not a place that was kind to

2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:06.840
 me. And this is because of my own parent. I was raised in College Station, Texas,

2:57:06.840 --> 2:57:12.440
 which is a town of 50,000. It's a university town. It exists only for the university.

2:57:14.280 --> 2:57:18.600
 I did not get the full Texas experience. It's purely speaking from a College Station experience.

2:57:18.600 --> 2:57:26.520
 But growing up, first generation, or I forget what it is. I'm the first American. I was born

2:57:26.520 --> 2:57:33.800
 and raised in College Station. My parents are from India. Being raised in a town where the

2:57:33.800 --> 2:57:39.400
 dominant culture was predominantly white evangelical Christian was hard. It was just

2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:50.360
 difficult. In the beginning, I would say ages like zero to eight, it was cultural ignorance,

2:57:50.360 --> 2:57:55.800
 as in they just don't know how to interact with you. And there was a level of always,

2:57:55.800 --> 2:58:01.640
 there was the evangelical kind of antipathy towards you being not Christian. My parents are

2:58:01.640 --> 2:58:09.800
 Hindu. That's how I was raised. And so there was that. But 911 was very difficult. 911 happened

2:58:09.800 --> 2:58:17.240
 when I was in third or fourth grade. And that changed everything, man. Our temple had to print

2:58:17.240 --> 2:58:21.960
 out T shirts. And I'm not saying this is a sob story to be clear. I'm still actually largely,

2:58:21.960 --> 2:58:26.920
 for my adult life, identified on the political right. So don't take this as some race manifesto.

2:58:26.920 --> 2:58:33.480
 I'm just telling it like this is what happened, which is that it was just hard to be

2:58:34.120 --> 2:58:41.560
 proud, frankly, and to have some of the fallout from 911 and during Iraq. And the reason I am

2:58:41.560 --> 2:58:51.320
 political is because I realize in myself, I have a strong rebellious nature against systems and

2:58:51.320 --> 2:58:56.840
 structures of power. And the first people I ever rebelled against were all the people telling

2:58:56.840 --> 2:59:04.360
 me to shut up and not question the Iraq war. So the reason I am in politics is because I hated

2:59:04.360 --> 2:59:10.920
 George W. Bush with the passion. And I hated the war. And I was so again, my entire background is

2:59:10.920 --> 2:59:15.560
 largely a national security for this reason, which is I was obsessed with the idea of like,

2:59:15.560 --> 2:59:20.920
 how do we get people who are not going to get us into these quagmire situations in positions of

2:59:20.920 --> 2:59:26.840
 power? That's how I became fascinated by power in the first place was all a question of how do

2:59:26.840 --> 2:59:31.800
 this happen? Like, how did this catastrophe happen? I realized it's not as bad as like,

2:59:31.800 --> 2:59:36.440
 you know, previous conflicts, but this one was mine. And to see how it changed our domestic

2:59:36.440 --> 2:59:42.840
 politics forever. And so that was my rebellion. But it's funny because I identified as a left

2:59:42.840 --> 2:59:48.760
 on the left when I was growing up up until I was 18. I had also a funny two year stint. This is

2:59:48.760 --> 2:59:53.640
 where everything kind of changed for me when I was 16. Actually, I moved to Qatar to Doha, Qatar,

2:59:53.640 --> 3:00:00.840
 because my dad was a dean or associate dean of Texas A&M University at Doha. So my last two years

3:00:00.840 --> 3:00:06.040
 of high school were at this. I went from this small town in Texas. And I love my parents because

3:00:06.040 --> 3:00:11.240
 they could recognize that I had within me that I was not a small town kid. So they took me out of

3:00:11.240 --> 3:00:16.600
 this country every chance they got. I traveled everywhere and constantly let me go. And so I

3:00:16.600 --> 3:00:23.320
 was, I went from school and college station to like this ritzy private school, American school.

3:00:24.280 --> 3:00:28.440
 Best thing that ever happened to me, because first of all, it got me out of college station.

3:00:29.480 --> 3:00:36.200
 Second, at that time, I had this annoying streak of, I wouldn't call it being anti America,

3:00:36.200 --> 3:00:41.640
 but you don't appreciate America. Let me tell everybody out there listening, leave for a while.

3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:49.640
 You will miss it so much. You do not know what it is like to not have freedom of speech until

3:00:49.640 --> 3:00:58.200
 you don't have it. And I was going to high school with these guys in the Qatari royal family. And

3:00:58.200 --> 3:01:02.760
 all I wanted to do was speak out how they were pieces of shit for the way that they treated

3:01:02.760 --> 3:01:08.680
 Indian citizens in that country who are basically used as slave labor. And I could not say one word

3:01:08.680 --> 3:01:13.880
 because I knew I would be deported and my dad would lose his job and my mom will lose her job

3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:17.560
 and we would be forced out of the country. You don't know what it's like to live like that.

3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:22.360
 Or to be in a society where like, you know, you have like a high school girlfriend or something

3:01:22.360 --> 3:01:28.840
 and you can't even touch in public or you're lectured for public decency. Like, listen,

3:01:28.840 --> 3:01:35.160
 I've lived under a Gulf monarchy now. And I have that turned me into the most pro America guy

3:01:35.160 --> 3:01:44.840
 ever. Like, I came back so like, Merica like, I still am because of that experience. Living abroad,

3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:51.400
 like that will do it to you. Live in a non democracy. You have, even in Europe, I would say

3:01:51.400 --> 3:01:55.560
 you guys aren't living as free as we are here. It's awesome. And I love it. You're ultimately

3:01:55.560 --> 3:02:01.960
 another human being than the one who left Texas. Yeah. So I mean, have you actually considered

3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:06.760
 moving to Texas and broadly, just outside of your own story, what do you think is the future

3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:12.760
 of Texas? What is the future of Austin? There's so much transformation seemingly happening now

3:02:12.760 --> 3:02:17.560
 related to Silicon Valley, to California. That's the best part to me, which is that since I left,

3:02:17.560 --> 3:02:23.960
 it's changed dramatically, which is that it used to be like this conservative state where the main

3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:30.360
 money to be made was oil and everybody knew that. Petro, it was a Petro state, Houston, all of that.

3:02:30.360 --> 3:02:34.920
 Austin was always weird, but it was more of a music town and a university town. It was not a tech

3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:41.320
 town. But in the 10 years or so since I left, I have begun to realize, I'm like, well, the Texas

3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:49.960
 I grew up in is over. It is not a deep red state in any sense of the term. The number one U Hall

3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:55.960
 route in the country pre pandemic already was San Francisco to Austin. So like, you have this

3:02:55.960 --> 3:03:03.240
 massive influx of people from California and New York and the state, the composition of it is

3:03:03.240 --> 3:03:09.160
 changed dramatically. The intra composition and the outro. Yeah. So the intra composition, it's

3:03:09.160 --> 3:03:14.120
 become way more urban. So when I grew up, Texas was a much more rural state. Its politics were

3:03:14.120 --> 3:03:20.760
 much more static. It looked much more like Rick Perry, like that. He was a very accurate representation

3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:28.120
 of who we were. Now, I don't think that that's the case. Texas is now a dynamic economy,

3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:35.640
 not just 100% reliant on oil because of its kind of like, I would call it like regulatory arbitrage

3:03:35.640 --> 3:03:41.320
 relative to California and New York offers a large incentive to people who are more,

3:03:41.320 --> 3:03:45.240
 I wouldn't say culturally liberal, but they're not necessarily like culturally conservative,

3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:49.080
 like the people who I grew up with. That's changed the whole state's politics.

3:03:49.080 --> 3:03:53.320
 Beto came two points away from beating Ted Cruz. I'm not saying the state's going to go blue.

3:03:53.320 --> 3:03:57.000
 I think the Republican party will just change and we'll have to readjust.

3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:03.720
 But the re urbanization of Texas has made it, I'll put it in this way, much more,

3:04:04.760 --> 3:04:10.520
 much, much more attractive to me than the place that I grew up. And then from my perspective,

3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:17.320
 well, first of all, I love some of the cowboy things that Texas stands for. But for more

3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:24.520
 practically, from my perspective, the injection of the tech innovation that's moving to Texas

3:04:24.520 --> 3:04:30.600
 has made it very exciting to me. It seems like outside of all that, maybe you can speak to the

3:04:30.600 --> 3:04:41.560
 weird in Austin. It seems like I know that Joe Rogan is a rich sort of almost like mainstream

3:04:41.560 --> 3:04:47.480
 at this point, but he's also attracting a lot of weirdos. And so is Elon and a lot of those

3:04:47.480 --> 3:04:52.120
 weirdos are my friends. And they're like, like Michael Malus, like those weirdos.

3:04:53.400 --> 3:04:57.960
 And it's like, I have a hope for Austin that all kinds of different flavors of weirdos will

3:04:57.960 --> 3:05:02.840
 get injected. It's possible. You know, I actually think the most significant thing that happened

3:05:02.840 --> 3:05:09.800
 were Tesla moving there. The reason why is I love Joe, obviously, but like he can only attract

3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:16.840
 X amount of people. Elon actually employs thousands of people. And then you will also Oracle,

3:05:16.840 --> 3:05:24.280
 Oracle's decision to move to Austin is just as important because those two men, Larry was

3:05:24.280 --> 3:05:31.320
 Ellison, right? Ellison and Elon, they actually employ tens of thousands of people collectively.

3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:36.680
 That can change the nature of the city. So you combine that with Joe bringing this

3:05:36.680 --> 3:05:43.640
 entire new entertainment complex with the bodies of people who will appreciate said entertainment

3:05:43.640 --> 3:05:48.680
 complex. Spend money on the entertainment. Exactly. You just remade the entire city.

3:05:48.680 --> 3:05:53.240
 And that's why I'm fascinating. Obviously, there's network effects, which is now that all those

3:05:53.240 --> 3:05:57.560
 people are down there. I mean, if I were Elon Musk, I would donate a shit ton of money to the

3:05:57.560 --> 3:06:01.960
 University of Texas, and I would turn it into my Stanford for Silicon Valley. Let's introduce

3:06:01.960 --> 3:06:08.120
 some competition and let UT Austin hire the best software developers, engineers, professors, and

3:06:08.120 --> 3:06:14.520
 more and turn Texas into a true like Austin revolving door hub where people come to UT Austin

3:06:14.520 --> 3:06:19.880
 to get an internship at Tesla and then become an executive there and then create their own company

3:06:19.880 --> 3:06:25.480
 in their own garage in Austin, which is the next Facebook, Twitter. That's how it happens.

3:06:25.480 --> 3:06:29.640
 This is why I'm much more skeptical of Miami. There's a whole tech Miami crew. I'm like,

3:06:29.640 --> 3:06:35.880
 yeah, like there's no university. It's very organic. Look, I think Miami's awesome. I just like,

3:06:36.520 --> 3:06:41.960
 I don't know if the same building blocks are there and also no multi billion dollar companies,

3:06:41.960 --> 3:06:46.840
 which employ thousands of people are coming there. That's the ingredient. It's not just Joe

3:06:46.840 --> 3:06:51.720
 Rogan. It's not just even Elon Musk, if you still operate it in California, it's all the people

3:06:51.720 --> 3:06:58.360
 he employs. I think that is where I think Texas is going to dramatically change within the next

3:06:58.360 --> 3:07:06.040
 10 years. It's already become a more urbanized state that's moved away from oil and gas in terms

3:07:06.040 --> 3:07:11.480
 of its emphasis, not necessarily in terms of its real economics. 10 years from now, I don't think

3:07:11.480 --> 3:07:18.760
 it will be necessarily the name prop of the town. The only question to me is how that manifests

3:07:18.760 --> 3:07:24.520
 politically because it's very possible though, because a lot of these workers themselves are

3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:30.840
 California culturally liberal, you could see a Gavin Newsom type person getting elected governor

3:07:30.840 --> 3:07:36.040
 of Texas or like the mayor of Austin. I mean, look, mayor of Austin is already a Democrat,

3:07:36.040 --> 3:07:41.560
 right? I mean, Joe has his own problems with Austin. It's funny. I remember him leaving LA and I'm

3:07:41.560 --> 3:07:49.080
 like, we've been to Austin. It's not everything it's cracked up to be necessarily.

3:07:49.080 --> 3:07:55.800
 But no matter what, a new place allows the possibility for new ideas, even if they're

3:07:55.800 --> 3:08:00.200
 somehow left leaning and all those kinds of things. I do think the only two things missing

3:08:00.200 --> 3:08:07.480
 from Austin and Texas are two dudes in a suit that sometimes have a podcast talking much

3:08:07.480 --> 3:08:13.320
 in nonsense and a mic. So let's bring the best suit game to Texas. I hope you do make it to Texas

3:08:14.280 --> 3:08:18.600
 at some point. Thanks so much for talking to me. Thanks for listening to this conversation

3:08:37.160 --> 3:08:44.040
 Luther King Jr. about the idea that what is just and what is legal are not always the same thing.

3:08:44.040 --> 3:08:51.400
 He said, never forget that what Hitler did in Germany was legal. Thank you for listening

3:08:51.400 --> 3:09:14.200
 and hope to see you next time.
