00:00.000 --> 00:04.520
 The following is a conversation with Magnus Carlson, the number one ranked chess player

00:04.520 --> 00:09.720
 in the world and widely considered to be one of, if not THE greatest chess player of all

00:09.720 --> 00:11.280
 time.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.760
 The camera on Magnus died 20 minutes into the conversation.

00:14.760 --> 00:19.680
 Most folks still just listen to the audio through a podcast player anyway, but if you're

00:19.680 --> 00:25.440
 watching this on YouTube or Spotify, we did our best to still make it interesting by adding

00:25.440 --> 00:28.200
 relevant image overlays.

00:28.200 --> 00:34.440
 I mess things up sometimes, like in this case, but I'm always working hard to improve.

00:34.440 --> 00:36.840
 I hope you understand.

00:36.840 --> 00:39.840
 Thank you for your patience and support along the way.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.240
 I love you all.

00:42.240 --> 00:43.960
 This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.

00:47.480 --> 00:52.080
 And now dear friends, here's Magnus Carlson.

00:52.080 --> 00:56.040
 You're considered by many to be one of the greatest, if not THE greatest chess players

00:56.040 --> 01:01.520
 of all time, but you're also one of the best fantasy football, aka soccer competitors in

01:01.520 --> 01:06.400
 the world, plus recently picking up poker and competing at a world class level.

01:06.400 --> 01:10.920
 So before chess, let's talk football and greatness.

01:10.920 --> 01:15.080
 You're a Real Madrid fan, so let me ask you the ridiculous big question.

01:15.080 --> 01:19.800
 Who do you think is the greatest football, aka soccer player of all time?

01:19.800 --> 01:22.280
 Can you make the case for Messi?

01:22.280 --> 01:28.800
 Can you make the case for Cristiano Ronaldo, Pele, Maradona, does anybody jump to mind?

01:28.800 --> 01:36.520
 I think it's pretty hard to make a case for anybody else than Messi for his all around

01:36.520 --> 01:37.520
 game.

01:37.520 --> 01:48.880
 And frankly, like my Real Madrid fandom sort of predates the Ronaldo era, the second Ronaldo,

01:48.880 --> 01:50.480
 not the first one.

01:50.480 --> 01:56.960
 So I always liked Ronaldo, but I always kind of thought that Messi was better.

01:56.960 --> 02:03.120
 And I went to quite a number of Madrid games and they've always been super helpful to me

02:03.120 --> 02:04.120
 down there.

02:04.120 --> 02:08.760
 The only thing is that, like they asked me, they were going to do an interview and they

02:08.760 --> 02:14.320
 were going to ask me who my favorite player was and I said somebody else.

02:14.320 --> 02:19.560
 I think I said Isco at that point and I was like, okay, take two, now you say Ronaldo.

02:19.560 --> 02:26.600
 So for them, it was very important, but it wasn't that huge to me.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.640
 So Messi over Maradona?

02:28.640 --> 02:34.960
 Yeah, but I think just like with chess, it's hard to compare eras.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.760
 Obviously the improvements in football have been, like in technique and such, have been

02:39.760 --> 02:49.160
 even greater than they have been in chess, but it's always a weird discussion to have.

02:49.160 --> 02:54.480
 And just as a fan, what do you think is beautiful about the game?

02:54.480 --> 02:55.800
 What defines greatness?

02:55.800 --> 03:02.320
 Is it, you know, with Messi, one, he's really good at finishing, two, very good at assist.

03:02.320 --> 03:03.640
 Like three, there's just magic.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.520
 It's just beautiful to see the play.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.080
 So it's not just about the finishing.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.840
 There's some, it's like Maradona's hand of God.

03:09.840 --> 03:13.520
 There's some creativity on the pitch.

03:13.520 --> 03:18.080
 Is that important or is it very important to get the World Cups and the big championships

03:18.080 --> 03:19.160
 and that kind of stuff?

03:19.160 --> 03:26.680
 I think the World Cup is pretty, pretty overrated seeing us as it's such a small sample size.

03:26.680 --> 03:36.160
 So it sort of annoys me always when, you know, titles are always appreciated so much even

03:36.160 --> 03:46.920
 though that particular title can be a lot of luck or at least some luck.

03:46.920 --> 03:54.680
 So I do appreciate statistics a bit and all the statistics say that Messi is the best

03:54.680 --> 03:58.600
 finisher of all time, which I think helps a lot.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.520
 And then there's the intangibles as well.

04:01.520 --> 04:10.280
 The flip side of that is the small sample size is what really creates the magic.

04:10.280 --> 04:13.280
 It's just like the Olympics.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.320
 You basically train your whole life for this.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.680
 You live your whole life for this.

04:16.680 --> 04:21.000
 It's a rare moment, one mistake and it's all over.

04:21.000 --> 04:26.320
 That's for some reason, a lot of people either break under that pressure or rise up under

04:26.320 --> 04:27.320
 that pressure.

04:27.320 --> 04:28.840
 You don't admire the magic of that.

04:28.840 --> 04:29.840
 No, I do.

04:29.840 --> 04:37.840
 I just think that like rising into the pressure and breaking under the pressure is often really

04:37.840 --> 04:43.520
 oversimplified like take on what's happening.

04:43.520 --> 04:46.200
 Yeah, we do romanticize the game.

04:46.200 --> 04:47.200
 Yeah.

04:47.200 --> 04:50.920
 Well, let me ask you another ridiculous question and another, you're also a fan of basketball.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.920
 Yes.

04:51.920 --> 04:55.600
 Let me ask the goat question.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.840
 I'm biased because I went to high school in Chicago.

04:59.840 --> 05:03.480
 You know, Chicago Bulls during the Michael Jordan era.

05:03.480 --> 05:07.840
 Let me ask the Jordan versus LeBron James question.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.480
 Let's continue on this thread of greatness.

05:10.480 --> 05:13.520
 Which one do you pick or somebody else?

05:13.520 --> 05:15.720
 So I'll give you a completely different answer.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.040
 Uh oh.

05:18.040 --> 05:23.560
 Depending on my mood and depending on whom I talk to, I pick one of the two and then

05:23.560 --> 05:24.560
 I try to argue for that.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.240
 It's a quantum mechanical thing.

05:26.240 --> 05:36.240
 Can you, again, what would, if you were to argue for either one, statistically I think

05:36.240 --> 05:38.560
 LeBron James is going to surpass Jordan?

05:38.560 --> 05:40.000
 Yeah, no doubt.

05:40.000 --> 05:49.800
 And so, again, there's a debate between unquantifiable greatness, I mean, that's the whole debate.

05:49.800 --> 05:50.800
 Yes.

05:50.800 --> 05:53.600
 So it's, well, it's quantifiable versus unquantifiable.

05:53.600 --> 05:54.600
 Yeah.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.680
 What's more important and you're depending on mood all over the place.

05:59.680 --> 06:06.000
 But what do you lean in general with these folks, with soccer, with anything in life towards

06:06.000 --> 06:07.640
 the unquantifiable more?

06:07.640 --> 06:10.680
 No, definitely towards the quantifiable.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.480
 So when you're unsure, lean towards the numbers.

06:12.480 --> 06:13.480
 Yeah.

06:13.480 --> 06:17.800
 But see, like it's later generations, there's something that's what people say about Maradona

06:17.800 --> 06:25.400
 is, you know, he took a arguably somewhat mediocre team to a World Cup.

06:25.400 --> 06:30.000
 So there's that also uplifting nature of the player to be able to rise up the whole, it

06:30.000 --> 06:31.320
 is a team sport.

06:31.320 --> 06:39.440
 So are you going to like, are you going to punish Messi for taking a mediocre Argentine

06:39.440 --> 06:46.880
 squad to the to the final in 2014 and punish him because they lost to a great team very

06:46.880 --> 06:50.680
 narrowly after they missed the end.

06:50.680 --> 06:57.440
 He set up like a great chance for a win in the first half, which he, which he fluffed

06:57.440 --> 06:59.880
 and then yeah, eventually they lost the game.

06:59.880 --> 07:05.000
 Yeah, they do criticize Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi for being on really strong squads in

07:05.000 --> 07:10.800
 terms of the club teams and saying, yeah, okay, it's easy when you have like Ronaldinho

07:10.800 --> 07:12.960
 or whoever on your team.

07:12.960 --> 07:18.560
 It would be very interesting just if the league could make a decision.

07:18.560 --> 07:22.320
 Yeah, just random, random allocation.

07:22.320 --> 07:23.560
 Yeah.

07:23.560 --> 07:31.800
 And just every single game just keep relocating or maybe once a season or every season you

07:31.800 --> 07:32.800
 get random.

07:32.800 --> 07:40.720
 Yeah, but let's say every, every player, if let's say they sign a five year contract

07:40.720 --> 07:45.800
 for a team, like one of them, you're going to get randomly allocated to, to let's say

07:45.800 --> 07:48.360
 a bottom half team.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.000
 I bet you there's going to be so much corruption around that.

07:51.000 --> 07:55.840
 No, obviously it wouldn't, wouldn't ever happen or, or, or work, but I think it's, it's,

07:55.840 --> 07:56.840
 you never know.

07:56.840 --> 07:57.840
 Just think to think about.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.640
 So on chess, let's zoom out.

08:01.640 --> 08:08.440
 If you break down your approach to chess, when you're at your best, what, what do you

08:08.440 --> 08:12.520
 think, what do you think contributes to that approach?

08:12.520 --> 08:15.360
 Is it memory recalls specific lines and positions?

08:15.360 --> 08:16.680
 Is it intuition?

08:16.680 --> 08:18.280
 How much of it is intuition?

08:18.280 --> 08:20.400
 How much of it is pure calculation?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.440
 How much of it is messing with the strategy of the opponent?

08:23.440 --> 08:28.880
 So the game theory aspect in terms of what contributes to the highest level of play that

08:28.880 --> 08:30.800
 that you do?

08:30.800 --> 08:39.240
 I think the answer differs a little bit now from what it did eight years ago.

08:39.240 --> 08:46.640
 For instance, like I've, I feel like I've had like two peaks in, in my career in 2014.

08:46.640 --> 08:50.880
 Well, 2013, 2014, and also in 2019.

08:50.880 --> 09:01.760
 And in those years, I was very different in terms of, of my strength, strength as specifically

09:01.760 --> 09:08.040
 in 2019, I benefited a lot from opening preparation.

09:08.040 --> 09:16.200
 While in 2013, 2014, I mostly tried to avoid my opponents preparation rather than that

09:16.200 --> 09:19.320
 being a, being a strength.

09:19.320 --> 09:26.360
 So I'm mentioning that also because it's something, something you didn't, didn't mention.

09:26.360 --> 09:34.120
 I think like my intuitive understanding of chess has over those years always been a little

09:34.120 --> 09:41.360
 bit better than the others, even though it has evolved as well.

09:41.360 --> 09:46.960
 Only there are, there are things that I understand now that I didn't understand back then, but

09:46.960 --> 09:52.000
 that's not only for me, that's for, for others as well.

09:52.000 --> 09:56.120
 I was younger back then, so I played with more energy, which meant that I could play

09:56.120 --> 10:04.240
 better in long drawn out games, which was also a necessity for me because I didn't,

10:04.240 --> 10:09.320
 I couldn't, couldn't beat people in the, in the openings.

10:09.320 --> 10:16.280
 But in terms of calculation, that's always been a weird issue for me.

10:16.280 --> 10:22.480
 Like I've always been really, really bad at solving exercises in chess.

10:22.480 --> 10:28.960
 Like that's been like a blind spot for me.

10:28.960 --> 10:38.560
 First of all, I found it hard to concentrate on them and to look, to look deep enough.

10:38.560 --> 10:42.440
 So this is like a puzzle, a position made in X.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.680
 I mean, one thing is made, but find the best move.

10:45.680 --> 10:47.040
 That's generally the exercise.

10:47.040 --> 10:52.320
 Like find the best move, find the best line, you just don't connect with it.

10:52.320 --> 10:55.000
 Usually like you have to, to look, look deep.

10:55.000 --> 11:03.440
 And then when I get these lines during the game, I very often find the, the, the right

11:03.440 --> 11:14.440
 solution, even though, even though I'm, it's not still the best part of my game to, to

11:14.440 --> 11:16.760
 calculate very, very deeply.

11:16.760 --> 11:21.000
 But it doesn't feel like calculation you're saying in terms of, you know,

11:21.000 --> 11:26.440
 No, it does sometimes, but for me, it's more like I'm at the board trying to find, trying

11:26.440 --> 11:31.600
 to find the solution and I understand like the training at home is like trying a little

11:31.600 --> 11:33.320
 bit to, to replicate that.

11:33.320 --> 11:40.240
 Like you give somebody half an hour in a position like in this instance, you might have thought

11:40.240 --> 11:45.120
 for half an hour if you play the game, but I just, I just kind of do it.

11:45.120 --> 11:53.960
 One thing I know that I am good at though is calculating short lines because I calculate

11:53.960 --> 11:59.000
 them, them well, I'm good at seeing little details.

11:59.000 --> 12:07.280
 And I'm also much better than, than most at evaluating, which I think is something that

12:07.280 --> 12:11.880
 sets me, sets me apart from, from others.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.440
 So evaluating specific position.

12:14.440 --> 12:21.640
 If I, if I make this move and the position changes in this way, is this the right step

12:21.640 --> 12:22.640
 in the right direction?

12:22.640 --> 12:24.160
 Like in a big picture way?

12:24.160 --> 12:25.160
 Yeah.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.960
 Like you calculate a few moves ahead and then you evaluate because a lot of, a lot of

12:28.960 --> 12:35.480
 the time, a lot of the times you cannot, the branches become so big that you cannot calculate

12:35.480 --> 12:36.480
 everything.

12:36.480 --> 12:37.480
 So you have to.

12:37.480 --> 12:38.480
 A fog.

12:38.480 --> 12:39.480
 Yeah.

12:39.480 --> 12:44.720
 So you have to, you have to make valuations based on, you know, based mostly on knowledge

12:44.720 --> 12:50.040
 and intuition and somehow I seem to do that pretty well.

12:50.040 --> 12:54.120
 When you say you're good at short lines, what's that, what's, what's short?

12:54.120 --> 12:59.080
 That's usually like lines of two to four moves each.

12:59.080 --> 13:00.080
 Okay.

13:00.080 --> 13:04.280
 So that, that's directly applicable to even faster games like Blitz, chess and so on.

13:04.280 --> 13:05.280
 Yeah.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.480
 Blitz is a lot about calculating force lines.

13:09.480 --> 13:15.920
 So those, you can see pretty clearly that the players who struggle at Blitz who are

13:15.920 --> 13:22.160
 great at classical are those who rely on a deep calculating ability because you simply

13:22.160 --> 13:24.480
 don't have time for, for that in Blitz.

13:24.480 --> 13:29.280
 You have to calculate quickly and rely a lot on intuition.

13:29.280 --> 13:30.880
 Can you try to, I know it's really difficult.

13:30.880 --> 13:36.440
 Can you try to talk through what's actually being visualized in your head?

13:36.440 --> 13:39.280
 Is there, is there a visual component?

13:39.280 --> 13:40.280
 Yeah.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.280
 No, I just visualized the board.

13:41.280 --> 13:44.880
 I mean, the board is in, is in, is in my head.

13:44.880 --> 13:46.000
 Two dimensional.

13:46.000 --> 13:50.080
 My interpretation is that it's, it is two, two dimensional.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.760
 Like what colors, is it brown tinted?

13:52.760 --> 13:53.760
 Is it black?

13:53.760 --> 13:56.200
 Is it, like, what's the theme?

13:56.200 --> 13:58.320
 Is it a big board, small board?

13:58.320 --> 14:02.040
 Are the, what do the pawns look like?

14:02.040 --> 14:04.320
 Or is it more in the space of concepts?

14:04.320 --> 14:11.240
 Like, yeah, there, there, there aren't a lot of colors it's, it's mostly, so what is it?

14:11.240 --> 14:12.240
 Queens gambit?

14:12.240 --> 14:16.200
 I'm trying to find it now to, to imagine it.

14:16.200 --> 14:19.480
 What about when you do the branching, when you have multiple boards and so on?

14:19.480 --> 14:20.480
 How does that look?

14:20.480 --> 14:22.120
 No, but it's only one at a time.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.120
 So like.

14:23.120 --> 14:24.120
 One position at a time.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.440
 One position at a time, so then I go back.

14:26.440 --> 14:30.840
 And that's what, when, when people play, or at least that's what I do.

14:30.840 --> 14:35.320
 When I play blindfold chess against several people, then it's just always one board at

14:35.320 --> 14:39.040
 a time and the rest are stored away somewhere.

14:39.040 --> 14:40.560
 But how do you store them away?

14:40.560 --> 14:45.520
 So like, you went down one branch, you're like, all right, that's, I got that.

14:45.520 --> 14:48.520
 I understand that's, there's some good there, there's some bad there.

14:48.520 --> 14:50.400
 Now let me go down another branch.

14:50.400 --> 14:54.520
 Like, how do you store away the information you just put on a shelf kind of?

14:54.520 --> 14:56.600
 I, I trend store it away.

14:56.600 --> 15:00.520
 Sometimes I have to sort of repeat it because I forget.

15:00.520 --> 15:07.640
 And it does happen frequently in games that you're thinking for, especially if you're

15:07.640 --> 15:12.920
 thinking for long, let's say a half an hour, or even more than that, that you play a move

15:12.920 --> 15:17.120
 and then your opponent plays a move, then you play a move and they play a move again

15:17.120 --> 15:20.120
 and you realize, oh, I actually calculated that.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.400
 I just forgot about it.

15:22.400 --> 15:26.400
 So that's obviously what happens when you store the information and you cannot retrieve

15:26.400 --> 15:27.400
 it.

15:27.400 --> 15:32.080
 When you think about a move for 20, 30 minutes, like, how do you break that down?

15:32.080 --> 15:38.640
 What can you describe what, like, what's the algorithm here that takes 30 minutes to run?

15:38.640 --> 15:46.320
 30 minutes is, at least for me, it's usually a waste 30 minutes usually means that I don't

15:46.320 --> 15:47.320
 know what to do.

15:47.320 --> 15:51.720
 And I'm trying just running into the wall, yeah, I'm trying to find something that isn't

15:51.720 --> 15:52.720
 there.

15:52.720 --> 16:00.160
 I think 10 to 15 minutes things in complicated positions can be really, really helpful.

16:00.160 --> 16:04.720
 Then you can spend your time pretty efficiently.

16:04.720 --> 16:10.440
 Just, it just means that the branches are getting, getting wide.

16:10.440 --> 16:19.160
 There's a lot to run through, both in terms of calculation and lots you have to evaluate

16:19.160 --> 16:20.160
 as well.

16:20.160 --> 16:27.720
 And then based on, based on that 10 to 15 minute thing, you have a pretty good idea what to

16:27.720 --> 16:28.720
 do.

16:28.720 --> 16:34.960
 I mean, it's very rare that I would think for half an hour and I would have a eureka moment

16:34.960 --> 16:35.960
 during the game.

16:35.960 --> 16:39.880
 Like, if I haven't seen it in 10 minutes, I'm probably not going to see it at all.

16:39.880 --> 16:44.720
 We're going to different branches and like after 15 minutes, it's like, it may lead to

16:44.720 --> 16:50.280
 the middle game because when you get to the end game, it's usually brute force calculation

16:50.280 --> 16:53.040
 that makes you spend so much time.

16:53.040 --> 16:59.440
 So middle game is normally, it's, it's, it's a complicated mix of brute force calculation

16:59.440 --> 17:10.200
 and, and, and like creativity and, and evaluation, so end game, it's, it's more, it's, it's easier

17:10.200 --> 17:11.200
 in that sense.

17:11.200 --> 17:16.680
 Well, you're good at every aspect of chess, but you're also, your end game is legendary.

17:16.680 --> 17:18.520
 It baffles experts.

17:18.520 --> 17:22.360
 So can you linger on that then try to explain what the heck is going on there?

17:22.360 --> 17:28.520
 Like if you look at game six of the previous world championship, the longest game ever

17:28.520 --> 17:37.680
 played in chess, what it was, um, I think, uh, his queen versus your rook knight in two

17:37.680 --> 17:38.680
 pawns.

17:38.680 --> 17:39.680
 Yeah.

17:39.680 --> 17:40.680
 There's so many options there.

17:40.680 --> 17:44.600
 It's such an interesting little, little dance and it's kind of not obvious that it wouldn't

17:44.600 --> 17:45.600
 be a draw.

17:45.600 --> 17:49.240
 So how do you escape the, it not being a draw and you wouldn't that match?

17:49.240 --> 17:57.600
 No, I knew, um, that for most of the time it was a theoretical draw since, um, chess

17:57.600 --> 18:02.000
 with seven or less pieces on the board is solved.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.400
 So you can, like people who are watching online, they can just check it.

18:05.400 --> 18:11.840
 They can check and they can check a so called table base and they, it just going to spit

18:11.840 --> 18:15.200
 out when for white, when for black or a draw.

18:15.200 --> 18:21.440
 So, and, and also I knew that I knew that didn't know that position specifically, but

18:21.440 --> 18:23.960
 I knew that it had to be a draw.

18:23.960 --> 18:34.000
 So for me, it was about staying alert, first of all, trying to look for the best way to

18:34.000 --> 18:40.560
 put my pieces, uh, but, but yeah, those end games are a bit, they're a bit unusual.

18:40.560 --> 18:43.200
 They don't happen too often.

18:43.200 --> 18:49.740
 So what I'm usually good at is I'm using my, my strengths that I also use in, in middle

18:49.740 --> 18:56.520
 games is that I, um, I value it well and I calculate short variations quite, uh,

18:56.520 --> 18:58.600
 even for the end game, short variations matter.

18:58.600 --> 18:59.600
 Yes.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.760
 It does matter in some simpler end games.

19:01.760 --> 19:02.760
 Yeah.

19:02.760 --> 19:09.720
 But also like there are these theoretical end games with very few pieces like Rook Knights,

19:09.720 --> 19:15.160
 uh, and Troupons versus Queens, but a lot of end games are simply defined by the Queens

19:15.160 --> 19:21.200
 being exchanged and there are a lot of other pieces left and then it's usually not brute

19:21.200 --> 19:22.200
 force.

19:22.200 --> 19:28.280
 It's usually more of, um, understanding and evaluation and then, then I can use my, my

19:28.280 --> 19:30.920
 strengths, um, very well.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.640
 Why are you so damn good at the end game?

19:32.640 --> 19:37.440
 Isn't there a lot of moves from when the end game starts to when the end game finishes

19:37.440 --> 19:41.200
 and you have a few pieces and you have to figure out it's like a sequence of little

19:41.200 --> 19:43.560
 games that happens, right?

19:43.560 --> 19:48.080
 Like little pattern, like how, how does it, being able to evaluate a single position lead

19:48.080 --> 19:53.760
 you to evaluate a long sequence of positions that eventually lead to a checkmate?

19:53.760 --> 19:59.760
 Well, I think if you evaluate well at the start, you know what plans to go for.

19:59.760 --> 20:04.960
 And then usually the play from there is, is often pretty simple.

20:04.960 --> 20:13.760
 Let's say you understand how to arrange your pieces and often also how to arrange your

20:13.760 --> 20:21.720
 pawns early in the end game, then that makes all, all the, um, all the difference.

20:21.720 --> 20:30.320
 And after that is like what we call technique of very often, uh, that it's technique basically

20:30.320 --> 20:37.280
 just mean means that, um, the moves are simple and, uh, these are moves that, you know, a

20:37.280 --> 20:42.520
 lot of players could, could make not only, not only the very strongest ones, these are

20:42.520 --> 20:45.960
 moves that are kind of understood and known.

20:45.960 --> 20:49.960
 So with the evaluation, you're just constantly improving a little bit and that just leads

20:49.960 --> 20:53.160
 to suffocating the position and then eventually to the win.

20:53.160 --> 20:58.200
 As long as you're doing the evaluation, well, one step at a time, to some extent.

20:58.200 --> 21:05.600
 So yeah, as I said, like if you value it better and thus accumulated some, some small advantages,

21:05.600 --> 21:11.320
 then you can, you can often make your, your, your life pretty easy towards the end of the

21:11.320 --> 21:12.320
 end game.

21:12.320 --> 21:19.000
 So you said in, uh, 2019, sort of the second phase of why you're so damn good, you, uh,

21:19.000 --> 21:21.240
 you did a lot of opening preparation.

21:21.240 --> 21:28.800
 What's the goal for you of, uh, the opening game of chess is to throw the opponent off

21:28.800 --> 21:31.120
 from any prepared lines.

21:31.120 --> 21:35.600
 Is there something you could put into words about why you're so damn good at the openings?

21:35.600 --> 21:40.160
 Again, these things have changed a lot over time.

21:40.160 --> 21:47.120
 Back in Kasparov's days, for instance, um, he very often got huge advantages from the

21:47.120 --> 21:49.560
 opening as, as white.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.560
 Can you explain why?

21:50.560 --> 21:54.760
 Um, there were several reasons for, for that.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.640
 First of all, he, he worked harder.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.440
 He was more creative and finding ideas.

21:59.440 --> 22:02.400
 He was able to look places others didn't.

22:02.400 --> 22:09.920
 Uh, also he had a very strong team of people who had specific strengths in, in openings

22:09.920 --> 22:11.800
 that he could use.

22:11.800 --> 22:15.680
 So they will come up with ideas and he would, he was integrate those ideas into.

22:15.680 --> 22:16.680
 Yeah.

22:16.680 --> 22:20.240
 And he would also very often come up with them, them himself.

22:20.240 --> 22:29.040
 Also, uh, at the start, he had, um, some of the first computer engines to, to work, um,

22:29.040 --> 22:34.440
 for him to, to find his ideas, to look deeper, to verify his ideas.

22:34.440 --> 22:39.400
 He was better at using them than a lot of others.

22:39.400 --> 22:44.440
 Now I feel like the playing field is a lot more level.

22:44.440 --> 22:52.600
 There are both computer engines, neural networks and hybrid engines available to practically

22:52.600 --> 22:54.000
 anybody.

22:54.000 --> 23:03.200
 So it's, it's much harder to find ideas now that, um, that actually like give you an advantage

23:03.200 --> 23:05.200
 with the, the, the, the white pieces.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.520
 I mean, people don't expect to find those ideas anymore.

23:08.520 --> 23:16.560
 Now it's all about finding ideas that are missed by the, uh, engines, either they're

23:16.560 --> 23:25.440
 missed entirely or they're missed at low depth, uh, and using them to, you know, gain some

23:25.440 --> 23:31.480
 advantage in the sense that you have more, more knowledge and, uh, you know, it's also

23:31.480 --> 23:36.160
 good to know that usually these are not complete bluffs.

23:36.160 --> 23:40.240
 These are like semi bluffs so that you know that even if your opponent makes all the right

23:40.240 --> 23:43.640
 moves, you can still make a draw.

23:43.640 --> 23:50.640
 And also at the start of 2019, neural networks had just started to be a thing in, in chess

23:50.640 --> 23:56.800
 and, uh, I'm not entirely sure, but there were at least some players in, even in the

23:56.800 --> 24:02.520
 top events who you could see did not use them or did not use them in the right way.

24:02.520 --> 24:08.880
 And then you could gain a huge advantage because a lot of positions, they were being evaluated

24:08.880 --> 24:15.320
 differently by the neural networks than traditional chess engines because they simply think about

24:15.320 --> 24:18.840
 chess in a very, very, um, different way.

24:18.840 --> 24:26.400
 So short answer is these days it's all about surprising your, your opponent and taking

24:26.400 --> 24:29.440
 it into position where you have more, more knowledge.

24:29.440 --> 24:34.600
 So is there some sense in which it's okay to make suboptimal quote unquote moves?

24:34.600 --> 24:36.240
 No, you have to.

24:36.240 --> 24:42.680
 I mean, you, you have to, because the best moves have been analyzed to, to death mostly.

24:42.680 --> 24:46.640
 So that's a kind of, when you say semi bluff, that's a kind of sacrifice.

24:46.640 --> 24:53.160
 You're, you're sacrificing the optimal move, the optimal position so that you can take

24:53.160 --> 24:54.160
 the opponent.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.920
 I mean, that's a game theoretics sense.

24:55.920 --> 24:59.080
 You take the opponent to something they didn't prepare well.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.080
 Yeah.

25:00.080 --> 25:06.920
 But you could also look at it another way that regardless, like if you turn on whatever

25:06.920 --> 25:12.200
 engine you turn on, like if you try to analyze either from the starting position or the starting

25:12.200 --> 25:17.960
 position of some popular opening, like if you analyze long enough, it's always going

25:17.960 --> 25:19.600
 to end up in a draw.

25:19.600 --> 25:26.840
 So in, in that sense, you may not be going for like the objective, the tries that are

25:26.840 --> 25:32.280
 objectively the most difficult to draw against, but you know, you are trying to look at least

25:32.280 --> 25:35.680
 that, at the less obvious paths.

25:35.680 --> 25:37.320
 How much do you use engines?

25:37.320 --> 25:42.000
 Do you use Lila stock fish in your preparations?

25:42.000 --> 25:50.200
 My team does personally, I try not to use them too much on, on my own, because I know

25:50.200 --> 25:56.560
 that when I play, you can obviously cannot have help from, from engines and often I feel

25:56.560 --> 26:05.320
 like often having imperfect or knowledge about a position or some engine knowledge can be

26:05.320 --> 26:09.640
 a lot worse than, than having no knowledge.

26:09.640 --> 26:13.520
 So I try to look at engines as little as possible.

26:13.520 --> 26:20.800
 So that your team uses them for research for a generation of ideas, but you are relying

26:20.800 --> 26:22.760
 primarily on your human resources.

26:22.760 --> 26:23.760
 Yeah, for sure.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.760
 You can evaluate well, you don't lean.

26:26.760 --> 26:33.040
 Yeah, I can evaluate as a human, I can know what they find unpleasant and, and, and so

26:33.040 --> 26:34.040
 on.

26:34.040 --> 26:40.880
 And it's very often the case for me to some extent, but a lot for, for others that you

26:40.880 --> 26:46.560
 arrive in a position and your opponent plays a move that you didn't expect.

26:46.560 --> 26:52.120
 And you know, if you didn't expect it, you know that it's probably not a great move since

26:52.120 --> 26:54.720
 it hasn't been expected by, by the engine.

26:54.720 --> 27:02.200
 But if it's not, if it's not obvious why it's not a good move, it's usually very, very hard

27:02.200 --> 27:04.200
 to figure it out.

27:04.200 --> 27:09.560
 And so then looking at the engines doesn't necessarily help because at that point, like

27:09.560 --> 27:14.040
 you're facing a human, you have to sort of think as a human.

27:14.040 --> 27:18.320
 I was chatting with the demo sassaba CEO of DeepMind a couple of days ago and he asked

27:18.320 --> 27:25.040
 me to ask you about what you first felt when you saw the, the, the play of AlphaZero.

27:25.040 --> 27:28.800
 Like interesting ideas, any creativity.

27:28.800 --> 27:31.280
 Did you feel fear that the machine is taking over?

27:31.280 --> 27:37.440
 Did you, were you inspired and any, what was going on in your mind and heart?

27:37.440 --> 27:45.280
 Funny thing about Demis is he, he doesn't play chess at all, like, like an AI.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.560
 He plays in a very, very human way.

27:48.560 --> 27:54.480
 No, I was hugely inspired when I saw the games at first.

27:54.480 --> 28:01.960
 And in terms of man versus machine, I mean, that battle was, was kind of lost for humans

28:01.960 --> 28:08.080
 even before I entered top level chess.

28:08.080 --> 28:10.440
 So that's never been an issue for me.

28:10.440 --> 28:14.400
 I never, never liked playing as computers much anyway.

28:14.400 --> 28:20.640
 So, so that's completely fine, but it was amazing to see how they quote unquote thought

28:20.640 --> 28:28.080
 about chess and in such a different way and in a way that you could mistake for creativity.

28:28.080 --> 28:29.080
 Mistake for creativity.

28:29.080 --> 28:30.580
 Strong words.

28:30.580 --> 28:31.580
 Is it wild to you?

28:31.580 --> 28:36.600
 How many sacrifices it's willing to make that like sacrifice pieces and then wait for prolonged

28:36.600 --> 28:39.040
 periods of time before doing anything with that?

28:39.040 --> 28:42.400
 Is that, is that weird to you that that's part of chess?

28:42.400 --> 28:48.240
 No, it's, it's one of the things that's hardest to replicate as a human as well, or at least

28:48.240 --> 28:55.200
 for my playing, playing style that usually when I, I sacrifice, I feel like I'm, you

28:55.200 --> 29:02.200
 know, I don't do it unless I feel like I'm getting something like tangible in, in return

29:02.200 --> 29:06.240
 and like a few moves down the line, a few moves down the line.

29:06.240 --> 29:11.360
 You can see that you can either retrieve the material or you can put your opponents king

29:11.360 --> 29:18.200
 under pressure or have some very, like very concrete positional advantage that sort of

29:18.200 --> 29:20.600
 compensates for it.

29:20.600 --> 29:26.880
 For instance, in chess, so bishops and knights are fairly equivalent.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.440
 We both give them three points, but bishops are a little bit better.

29:30.440 --> 29:36.160
 And especially a bishop pair is a lot better than, than a bishop and a knight.

29:36.160 --> 29:44.280
 So, or especially two knights depends on the position, but like on average, they are.

29:44.280 --> 29:50.800
 So like sacrificing a pawn in order to get, get a bishop pair, that's one of the most

29:50.800 --> 29:52.560
 common sacrifices in chess.

29:52.560 --> 29:53.560
 You're okay making that sacrifice.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.560
 Yeah.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.640
 I mean, it depends on the situation, but generally that's fine.

29:57.640 --> 30:02.400
 And there are a lot of openings that are based on that, that you sacrifice a pawn for the

30:02.400 --> 30:07.480
 bishop pair and then eventually it's some sort of positional equality.

30:07.480 --> 30:08.680
 So that's fine.

30:08.680 --> 30:18.520
 But the way AlphaZero would, would sacrifice a knight or sometimes two pawns, three pawns.

30:18.520 --> 30:23.360
 And you could see that it's looking for some sort of positional domination, but it's, it's

30:23.360 --> 30:24.360
 hard to understand.

30:24.360 --> 30:28.040
 And it's, it was really fascinating to see.

30:28.040 --> 30:34.880
 Um, yeah, in 2019, I was sacrificing a lot of, a lot of pawns, especially, and it was,

30:34.880 --> 30:36.720
 it was a great joy.

30:36.720 --> 30:40.200
 Unfortunately, it's not so easy to continue to do that.

30:40.200 --> 30:47.160
 People, people have found more solid opening lines since that don't allow me to, to do

30:47.160 --> 30:48.760
 that as often.

30:48.760 --> 30:54.840
 I'm still trying both to get those positions and still trying to, to learn the art of, of

30:54.840 --> 30:56.680
 sacrificing pieces.

30:56.680 --> 31:03.960
 So Demis also made a comment that was interesting to my new chess brain, which is one of the

31:03.960 --> 31:08.360
 reasons that chess is fun is because of the quote, creative tension between the bishop

31:08.360 --> 31:09.360
 and the knight.

31:09.360 --> 31:14.880
 So you were talking about this interesting, um, difference between the two pieces, that

31:14.880 --> 31:17.640
 there's some kind of, how would you convert that?

31:17.640 --> 31:20.400
 I mean, that's like a poetic statement about chess.

31:20.400 --> 31:24.080
 I think he said that wise chess been played for such a long time.

31:24.080 --> 31:29.440
 Wise is so fun to play at every level that if you can reduce it to one thing is, is it's

31:29.440 --> 31:34.360
 the bishop and the, and the knight, some kind of weird dynamics that they create in chess.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.520
 Is there any truth to that?

31:36.520 --> 31:38.280
 It sounds very good.

31:38.280 --> 31:44.480
 I haven't tried a lot of other games, but I tried to play a little bit of shogi and for

31:44.480 --> 31:51.440
 my new shogi brain, um, comparing it to chess, what annoyed me about that game is how much

31:51.440 --> 31:52.760
 the pieces suck.

31:52.760 --> 31:57.040
 Basically, you have one rook and you have one bishop that move like in chess and the

31:57.040 --> 32:01.840
 rest of the pieces are really not very powerful.

32:01.840 --> 32:07.920
 So I think that's one of the attractions of chess, like how powerful, especially the queen

32:07.920 --> 32:14.640
 is, which I kind of think makes it makes a lot of fun.

32:14.640 --> 32:19.960
 You, you think power is more fun than like variety?

32:19.960 --> 32:26.680
 No, there is a variety in chess as well, though, just, but not much more so than like, like

32:26.680 --> 32:32.160
 no, no, no, no, no, no, that's for, so like knight, I mean, they all move in different

32:32.160 --> 32:33.160
 ways.

32:33.160 --> 32:34.160
 They're all like weird.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.480
 There's just all these weird patterns and positions that can emerge.

32:37.480 --> 32:40.960
 The difference in the pieces create all kinds of interesting dynamics, I guess is what I'm

32:40.960 --> 32:41.960
 trying to say.

32:41.960 --> 32:42.960
 Yeah.

32:42.960 --> 32:49.080
 And I guess it is quite fascinating that all those years ago, they created the Knights

32:49.080 --> 32:55.000
 and the Bishop without probably realizing that they would be almost equally, equally

32:55.000 --> 32:57.800
 strong with such different qualities.

32:57.800 --> 33:02.960
 That's crazy that this, you know, like when you design computer games, it's like an art

33:02.960 --> 33:06.160
 form, it's science and an art to balance it.

33:06.160 --> 33:11.560
 You know, you talk about Starcraft and all those games, like so that you can have competitive

33:11.560 --> 33:18.120
 play at the highest level with all those different units and in the case of chess, it's different

33:18.120 --> 33:23.240
 pieces and they somehow designed a game that was super competitive, but there's probably

33:23.240 --> 33:26.960
 some kind of natural selection that the chess would just wouldn't last if it was designed

33:26.960 --> 33:27.960
 poorly.

33:27.960 --> 33:28.960
 Yeah.

33:28.960 --> 33:35.680
 And I think the rules have changed over time a little bit, but I would be, I mean, speaking

33:35.680 --> 33:44.420
 of games and all that, I'm also interested to play other games like chess 960 or Fisher

33:44.420 --> 33:50.080
 Random, as they call it, like, that you have 960 maps instead of one.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.080
 Yeah.

33:51.080 --> 33:56.040
 So for people who don't know, Fisher Random, chess 960s, yeah, that basically just means

33:56.040 --> 34:03.600
 that the pawns are in the same way and the major pieces are distributed randomly on the

34:03.600 --> 34:04.760
 last rank.

34:04.760 --> 34:09.640
 Only that there have to be obviously bishops of opposite color and the king has to be in

34:09.640 --> 34:12.040
 between the rooks so that you can castle both ways.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.840
 Oh, you can still castle.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.520
 You can still castle, but it makes it interesting.

34:16.520 --> 34:20.680
 So you still have, it still castles in the same way.

34:20.680 --> 34:24.240
 So let's say the king is like, yeah, what happens in that case?

34:24.240 --> 34:25.240
 Yeah.

34:25.240 --> 34:28.240
 Let's say the king is in the corner.

34:28.240 --> 34:32.640
 So to castle this side, you have to clear a whole lot of pieces.

34:32.640 --> 34:35.320
 What would castling look like though?

34:35.320 --> 34:38.320
 No, the king would go here and the rook would go there.

34:38.320 --> 34:39.640
 Oh, okay.

34:39.640 --> 34:45.240
 And that's happened in my games as well, like I forgot about castling and I've been like

34:45.240 --> 34:50.480
 attacking a king over here and then all of a sudden it escapes to the other side.

34:50.480 --> 35:03.440
 I think Fisher chess is good that the maps will generally be worse than regular chess.

35:03.440 --> 35:11.040
 Like I think the starting position is as close to ideal for creating a competitive game as

35:11.040 --> 35:17.320
 possible, but they will still be like interesting and diverse enough that you can play very,

35:17.320 --> 35:18.520
 very interesting games.

35:18.520 --> 35:23.920
 So when you say maps, there's 960 different options and like what fraction of that creates

35:23.920 --> 35:26.640
 interesting games at the highest level?

35:26.640 --> 35:31.160
 This is something that a lot of people are curious about because when you challenge a

35:31.160 --> 35:39.200
 great chess player like yourself to look at a random starting position, that feels like

35:39.200 --> 35:42.360
 it pushes you to play pure chess versus memorizing lines.

35:42.360 --> 35:43.360
 Oh yeah, for sure.

35:43.360 --> 35:44.360
 Or for sure.

35:44.360 --> 35:45.880
 But that's the whole idea.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.360
 That's what you want and...

35:47.360 --> 35:48.360
 How hard is it to play?

35:48.360 --> 35:53.080
 Can you talk about what it feels like to you to play with a random starting position?

35:53.080 --> 35:55.680
 Is there some intuition you've been building up?

35:55.680 --> 36:03.880
 It's very, very different and I mean, understandably, engines have an even greater advantage in

36:03.880 --> 36:07.960
 960 than they have in classical chess.

36:07.960 --> 36:17.400
 No, it's super interesting and that's why also I really wish that we played more classical

36:17.400 --> 36:26.320
 chess like long games, four to seven hours and in fish random chess 960 because then

36:26.320 --> 36:29.880
 you really need that time.

36:29.880 --> 36:35.120
 Even on the first moves, what usually happens is that you get 15 minutes before the game,

36:35.120 --> 36:39.600
 you're getting told the position 15 minutes before the game and then you can think about

36:39.600 --> 36:45.520
 it a little bit, even check the computer but that's all the time you have but then you

36:45.520 --> 36:49.440
 really need to figure it out.

36:49.440 --> 36:53.480
 Some of the positions obviously are a lot more interesting than the others.

36:53.480 --> 37:01.600
 In some of them, it appears that if you don't play symmetrically at the start, then you're

37:01.600 --> 37:03.920
 probably going to be in a pretty bad position.

37:03.920 --> 37:05.080
 What do you mean with the pawns?

37:05.080 --> 37:06.080
 With the pawns, yeah.

37:06.080 --> 37:07.080
 Why?

37:07.080 --> 37:08.080
 How does that make sense?

37:08.080 --> 37:10.120
 That's the thing about chess though.

37:10.120 --> 37:17.560
 So let's say white opens with e4, which has always been the most played move.

37:17.560 --> 37:22.040
 There are many ways to meet that but the most solid ways of playing has always been the

37:22.040 --> 37:29.040
 symmetrical response with the e5 and then there's the relopus, there's the petrophoping

37:29.040 --> 37:32.520
 and so on.

37:32.520 --> 37:37.880
 If you just banned symmetry on the first move in chess, you would get more interesting games.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.120
 Oh, interesting.

37:39.120 --> 37:43.640
 Or you'd get more decisive games.

37:43.640 --> 37:47.920
 So that's the good thing about chess is that we've played it so long that we've actually

37:47.920 --> 37:53.000
 devised non symmetrical openings that are also fairly equal.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.480
 But symmetry is a good default.

37:55.480 --> 38:01.240
 But yeah, symmetry is a good default and it's a problem that by playing symmetrical armed

38:01.240 --> 38:06.960
 with good preparation in regular chess, it's just a little bit too easy.

38:06.960 --> 38:18.840
 It's a little bit too dryish and I guess if you analyzed a lot in chess 960, then a lot

38:18.840 --> 38:24.960
 of the positions would end up being pretty dryish as well.

38:24.960 --> 38:28.320
 Because the random starting points are so shitty, you're forced to...

38:28.320 --> 38:30.720
 You're actually forced to play symmetrically.

38:30.720 --> 38:37.640
 You cannot actually try and play in a more interesting manner.

38:37.640 --> 38:40.960
 Is there any other variations that are interesting to you?

38:40.960 --> 38:43.720
 Oh yeah, there are several.

38:43.720 --> 38:52.240
 So no castling chess has been promoted by former world champion Vladimir Kramnik.

38:52.240 --> 38:59.200
 There have been a few tournaments with that, not any that I've participated in though.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.720
 I kind of like it.

39:00.720 --> 39:09.000
 Also, my coach uses non castling engines quite a bit to analyze regular positions just to

39:09.000 --> 39:13.320
 get a different perspective.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.240
 So castling is like a defensive thing.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.240
 So if you remove castling, it forces you to be more offensive.

39:18.240 --> 39:19.240
 Is that why?

39:19.240 --> 39:23.240
 Yeah, for sure.

39:23.240 --> 39:26.400
 It seems like a tiny little difference.

39:26.400 --> 39:31.920
 No castling probably forces you to be a little bit more defensive at the start.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.080
 Or I would guess so.

39:34.080 --> 39:37.720
 Because you cannot suddenly escape with the kings.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.160
 It's going to make the game a bit slower at the start.

39:40.160 --> 39:51.440
 But I feel like eventually it's going to make the games less dryish for sure.

39:51.440 --> 40:02.760
 Then you have some reader variants like where the pawns can move both diagonally and forward.

40:02.760 --> 40:06.520
 And also you have self capture chess, which is quite interesting.

40:06.520 --> 40:08.760
 So that pawns can, or pieces...

40:08.760 --> 40:10.360
 Could commit suicide?

40:10.360 --> 40:11.600
 Yeah, people can...

40:11.600 --> 40:14.200
 Why would that be a good move?

40:14.200 --> 40:17.600
 No, sometimes one of your pieces occupies a square.

40:17.600 --> 40:26.520
 I mean, let me just set up a position, let's put it like this, for instance, like here.

40:26.520 --> 40:30.800
 I mean, there are a lot of ways to checkmate for white, like this, for instance, or there

40:30.800 --> 40:32.720
 are several ways.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.920
 But like this would be...

40:34.920 --> 40:38.200
 Oh, cool.

40:38.200 --> 40:44.080
 For people who are just listening, yeah, basically you bring in a knight close to the king, the

40:44.080 --> 40:45.080
 queen and so on.

40:45.080 --> 40:46.080
 Yeah.

40:46.080 --> 40:47.080
 And you replace the knight with a queen.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.080
 Yeah, that's interesting.

40:48.080 --> 40:54.280
 So you have like a front of pieces and then you just replace them with the second piece?

40:54.280 --> 40:55.280
 Yeah.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.280
 That's cool.

40:56.280 --> 40:57.280
 I mean, that could be interesting.

40:57.280 --> 41:01.000
 I think also maybe sometimes it's just clearance, basically.

41:01.000 --> 41:04.920
 It adds an extra element of clearance.

41:04.920 --> 41:09.600
 So I think there are many, many different variants.

41:09.600 --> 41:16.280
 I don't think any of them are better than the one that has been played for at least

41:16.280 --> 41:22.440
 a thousand years, but it's certainly interesting to see.

41:22.440 --> 41:28.160
 So one of your goals is to reach the Fedia ELO chess rating of 2900.

41:28.160 --> 41:33.640
 Maybe you can comment on how is this rating calculated and what does it take to get there?

41:33.640 --> 41:36.480
 Is it possible for a human being to get there?

41:36.480 --> 41:44.080
 Basically you play with a factor of 10, which means that if I were to play against an opponent

41:44.080 --> 41:50.720
 who's rated the same as me, I would be expected to score 50%, obviously.

41:50.720 --> 41:55.760
 And that means that I would win five points with a win, lose five points with a draw and

41:55.760 --> 41:57.920
 then equal if I draw.

41:57.920 --> 42:05.840
 If your opponent is 200 points lower rated, you're expected to score 75% and so on.

42:05.840 --> 42:09.520
 And you establish that rating by playing a lot of people and then it slowly converges

42:09.520 --> 42:13.920
 towards an estimate of how likely you are to win or lose against different people.

42:13.920 --> 42:21.120
 And my rating is obviously carried through thousands of games.

42:21.120 --> 42:26.000
 Right now my rating is 2861, which is decent.

42:26.000 --> 42:33.160
 I think that pretty much corresponds to the level I have at the moment, which means in

42:33.160 --> 42:43.400
 order to reach 2900, I would have to either get better at chess, which I think is fairly

42:43.400 --> 42:47.360
 hard to do, at least considerably better.

42:47.360 --> 42:55.040
 So what I would need to do is try and optimize even more in terms of the matchups, the game

42:55.040 --> 43:00.120
 preparations, everything, but not necessarily like select internments and so on, but like

43:00.120 --> 43:08.840
 just optimizing in terms of preparation, like making sure I never have any bad days.

43:08.840 --> 43:10.360
 You basically can't lose.

43:10.360 --> 43:11.360
 Yeah.

43:11.360 --> 43:17.720
 You can't fuck up ever if I want to reach that goal.

43:17.720 --> 43:22.800
 And so I think reaching 2900 is pretty unlikely.

43:22.800 --> 43:32.400
 The reason I've set the goal is to have something to play for, to have a motivation to actually

43:32.400 --> 43:40.840
 try and be at my best when I play, because otherwise I'm playing to some extent mostly

43:40.840 --> 43:50.400
 for fun these days in that I love to play, I love to try and win, but I don't have a

43:50.400 --> 43:57.560
 lot to prove or anything, but that gives me at least the motivation to try and be at my

43:57.560 --> 44:02.280
 best all the time, which I think is something to aim for.

44:02.280 --> 44:12.160
 So at the moment, I'm quite enjoying that process of trying to optimize.

44:12.160 --> 44:18.600
 What would you say motivates you in this now and in the years leading up to now, the love

44:18.600 --> 44:23.040
 of winning or the fear of losing?

44:23.040 --> 44:29.520
 So for the World Championship, it's been fair of losing for sure.

44:29.520 --> 44:35.360
 Other tournaments, love of winning is a great, great factor.

44:35.360 --> 44:40.440
 And that's why I also get more joy from winning most tournaments than I do for winning the

44:40.440 --> 44:44.520
 World Championship, because then it's mostly been a relief.

44:44.520 --> 44:51.000
 I also think I enjoy winning more now than I did before, because I feel like I'm a little

44:51.000 --> 44:53.560
 bit more relaxed now.

44:53.560 --> 44:57.240
 And I also know that it's not going to last forever.

44:57.240 --> 45:02.960
 So every little win, I appreciate a lot more now.

45:02.960 --> 45:08.760
 And in terms of fear of losing, that's the huge reason why I'm not going to play the

45:08.760 --> 45:14.880
 World Championship, because it really didn't give me a lot of joy.

45:14.880 --> 45:17.480
 It really was all about avoiding losing.

45:17.480 --> 45:22.400
 Why is it that the World Championship really makes you feel this way, the anxiety?

45:22.400 --> 45:29.920
 And when you say losing, do you mean not just a match, but every single position, the fear

45:29.920 --> 45:30.920
 of a blunder?

45:30.920 --> 45:33.560
 No, I mean, the blunder is okay.

45:33.560 --> 45:40.320
 When I sit down at the board, then it's mostly been fine, because then I'm focused on the

45:40.320 --> 45:41.320
 game.

45:41.320 --> 45:42.880
 And then I know that I can play the game.

45:42.880 --> 45:49.840
 It's a time in between knowing that I feel like losing is not an option, because it's

45:49.840 --> 45:54.080
 the World Championship, and because in a World Championship, there are two players, there's

45:54.080 --> 45:56.440
 a winner and a loser.

45:56.440 --> 46:03.880
 If I don't win a random tournament that I play, then I'm usually, it depends on a tournament.

46:03.880 --> 46:10.960
 I might be disappointed for sure, might even be pretty pissed, but ultimately, you go on

46:10.960 --> 46:11.960
 to the next one.

46:11.960 --> 46:15.280
 With the World Championship, you don't go on to the next one.

46:15.280 --> 46:24.440
 It's like, it's years, and it also has been a core part of my identity for a while now

46:24.440 --> 46:26.920
 that I am World Champion.

46:26.920 --> 46:32.000
 And so, there's not an option of losing that.

46:32.000 --> 46:38.600
 Yeah, you're going to have to, at least for a couple of years, carry the weight of having

46:38.600 --> 46:39.600
 lost.

46:39.600 --> 46:46.320
 You're the former World Champion now, if you lose, versus the current World Champion.

46:46.320 --> 46:52.600
 There are certain sports that create that anxiety and others that don't.

46:52.600 --> 46:57.880
 For example, I think UFC makes martial arts are a little better with losing.

46:57.880 --> 47:02.080
 It's understood like everybody loses, but they're not everybody though.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.080
 Not everybody.

47:03.080 --> 47:04.080
 Not everybody.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.080
 Not everybody.

47:05.080 --> 47:06.080
 Yes.

47:06.080 --> 47:12.320
 We went to the chat, but in boxing, there is like that extra pressure of like maintaining

47:12.320 --> 47:13.320
 the championship.

47:13.320 --> 47:17.480
 I mean, maybe you could say the same thing about the UFC as well.

47:17.480 --> 47:23.960
 So for you personally, for a person who loves chess, the first time you won a World Championship,

47:23.960 --> 47:28.760
 that was the thing that was fun.

47:28.760 --> 47:32.960
 And then everything after is like stressful.

47:32.960 --> 47:40.920
 Essentially, there was certainly stress involved the first time as well, but it was nothing

47:40.920 --> 47:44.800
 compared to the others.

47:44.800 --> 47:49.680
 So the only World Championship after that that I really enjoyed was the one in 2018

47:49.680 --> 47:51.840
 against the American Fabiano Caruana.

47:51.840 --> 47:57.440
 And what that made that different is that I'd been kind of slumping for a bit and he'd

47:57.440 --> 47:58.840
 been on the rise.

47:58.840 --> 48:01.880
 So our ratings were very, very similar.

48:01.880 --> 48:10.080
 They were so close that if at any point during the during the match, I'd lost the game.

48:10.080 --> 48:12.480
 He would have been ranked as number one in the world.

48:12.480 --> 48:18.120
 Like our ratings were so close that for each draw, they didn't move and and the game itself

48:18.120 --> 48:19.120
 was close.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.120
 Yeah.

48:20.120 --> 48:21.560
 The game themselves were very close.

48:21.560 --> 48:28.080
 I, I had a winning position in, in the first game that I couldn't really get anywhere for

48:28.080 --> 48:34.320
 a lot of games, then he had a couple of games where he could potentially have won.

48:34.320 --> 48:37.280
 Then in the last game, I was a little bit better.

48:37.280 --> 48:42.240
 And eventually they were all, they were all drawn, but I felt like all the way that this

48:42.240 --> 48:48.800
 is an interesting match against an opponent who is at this position at this point equal

48:48.800 --> 48:49.920
 to me.

48:49.920 --> 48:55.880
 And so losing that would not have been a disaster because all in all the other matches, I would

48:55.880 --> 49:02.600
 know that I would have lost against somebody who I know I'm much better than.

49:02.600 --> 49:07.000
 And that would be, would be a lot harder for me to, to take.

49:07.000 --> 49:12.680
 Well, that's fascinating and beautiful that the stress isn't from losing this because

49:12.680 --> 49:14.600
 you have fun.

49:14.600 --> 49:18.920
 You enjoy playing against somebody who's as good as you, maybe better than you.

49:18.920 --> 49:20.320
 That's exciting to you.

49:20.320 --> 49:21.320
 Yeah.

49:21.320 --> 49:27.520
 It's, it's losing at this high stakes thing that only happens rarely to a person who's

49:27.520 --> 49:28.760
 not as good as you.

49:28.760 --> 49:29.760
 Yeah.

49:29.760 --> 49:35.000
 And that's why it's also been incredibly frustrating in other matches, like when I know, when we

49:35.000 --> 49:39.560
 play draw after draw, and I can just, I know that I'm better.

49:39.560 --> 49:44.400
 I can sense during the game that I understand it better than them, but I cannot, you know,

49:44.400 --> 49:46.320
 I cannot get over the hump.

49:46.320 --> 49:53.600
 So you are the best chess player in the world and you not playing the world championship

49:53.600 --> 49:59.240
 really makes the world championship not seem important or, I mean, there's an argument

49:59.240 --> 50:01.520
 to be made for that.

50:01.520 --> 50:05.400
 Is there anything you would like to see if you had a change about the world championship

50:05.400 --> 50:09.800
 that would make it more fun for you and better for the game of chess period for everybody

50:09.800 --> 50:10.800
 involved?

50:10.800 --> 50:18.720
 So I think 12 games or now 14 games that there is for the world championship is fairly, fairly

50:18.720 --> 50:20.320
 low sample size.

50:20.320 --> 50:25.280
 If you want to determine who the best player is, or at least the best player in that particular

50:25.280 --> 50:27.880
 matchup, you need more, more games.

50:27.880 --> 50:34.800
 And I think to some extent, if you're going to have a world champion and call them the

50:34.800 --> 50:39.700
 best players, you best player, you got to make sure that the format increases the chance

50:39.700 --> 50:42.040
 of finding the best players.

50:42.040 --> 50:46.280
 So I think having more games, and if you're going to have a lot more games than you need

50:46.280 --> 50:53.680
 to, then you need to decrease the time control a bit, which in turn, I think is also a good

50:53.680 --> 51:01.680
 thing because in very long time controls with deep preparation, you can sort of mask a lot

51:01.680 --> 51:10.600
 of your deficiencies as a chess player because you have a lot of time to think and to defend

51:10.600 --> 51:15.040
 and also, yeah, you have deep preparation.

51:15.040 --> 51:18.160
 So I think those would be for me to play.

51:18.160 --> 51:24.880
 Those would be the main things, more games and less time.

51:24.880 --> 51:29.880
 So you want to see more games and rules that emphasize pure chess?

51:29.880 --> 51:40.060
 Yeah, but already less time emphasizes pure chess because defensive techniques are much

51:40.060 --> 51:42.720
 harder to execute with little time.

51:42.720 --> 51:43.720
 What do you think?

51:43.720 --> 51:46.360
 Is there a sweet spot in terms of, are we talking about Blitz?

51:46.360 --> 51:47.360
 How many minutes?

51:47.360 --> 51:49.680
 I think Blitz is a bit too fast.

51:49.680 --> 51:56.680
 To their credit, this was suggested by Fida as well for a start to have two games per

51:56.680 --> 52:04.480
 day and let's say you have 45 minutes a game plus 15 or 30 seconds per move.

52:04.480 --> 52:10.360
 That means that each sessions will probably be about or a little less than two hours.

52:10.360 --> 52:12.240
 That would be a start.

52:12.240 --> 52:18.920
 Also what we're playing in the tournament that I'm playing here in Miami, which is four

52:18.920 --> 52:27.200
 games a day with 15 minutes plus 10 seconds per move, those would be more interesting

52:27.200 --> 52:29.880
 than the one there is now.

52:29.880 --> 52:32.960
 I understand that there are a lot of traditions.

52:32.960 --> 52:35.680
 People don't want to change the world championship.

52:35.680 --> 52:36.680
 That's all fine.

52:36.680 --> 52:42.760
 I just think that the world championship should do a better job of trying to reflect

52:42.760 --> 52:46.440
 who's the best overall chess player.

52:46.440 --> 52:53.280
 So would you say if it's faster games, you'd probably be able to get a sample size of over

52:53.280 --> 52:55.480
 20 games, 20, 30, 40.

52:55.480 --> 52:58.440
 You think there's a number that's good over a long period of time?

52:58.440 --> 53:00.360
 I would prefer as many as possible.

53:00.360 --> 53:02.360
 It's like 100.

53:02.360 --> 53:07.960
 Yeah, but let's say you play 12 days to games a day.

53:07.960 --> 53:08.960
 That's 24.

53:08.960 --> 53:11.600
 I feel like that's already quite a bit better.

53:11.600 --> 53:16.160
 You play one black game, one white game each day.

53:16.160 --> 53:17.160
 Sometimes wise, that's okay.

53:17.160 --> 53:18.360
 Yeah, I think that's fine.

53:18.360 --> 53:19.800
 Like you will have three days as well.

53:19.800 --> 53:23.600
 So I don't think that will be a problem.

53:23.600 --> 53:29.080
 And also you have to prepare two sets of openings for each day, which makes it more difficult

53:29.080 --> 53:32.640
 for the teams preparing, which I think is also good.

53:32.640 --> 53:34.680
 Let me ask you a fun question.

53:34.680 --> 53:41.640
 If Hikaru Nakamura was one of the two people, I guess, I apologize for that.

53:41.640 --> 53:43.840
 Yeah, he could have finished second.

53:43.840 --> 53:46.080
 So he lost the last round of the candidates.

53:46.080 --> 53:53.160
 And maybe you can explain to me, InternetSpeakCopium is something you tweeted.

53:53.160 --> 54:01.360
 But if he got second, would you just despite him still play the world championship?

54:01.360 --> 54:02.800
 That's Internet question.

54:02.800 --> 54:06.640
 And when the Internet asks, I must abide, the due to abide.

54:06.640 --> 54:07.640
 Yeah, sure.

54:07.640 --> 54:11.080
 Thank you, Internet.

54:11.080 --> 54:20.080
 So after the last match, I did an interview right after where I talked about the fact

54:20.080 --> 54:22.360
 that I was unlikely to play the next one.

54:22.360 --> 54:29.720
 I'd spoken privately to both family, friends, and of course, also my chess team, that this

54:29.720 --> 54:35.280
 was likely going to be the last, the last match.

54:35.280 --> 54:40.680
 What happened was that right before the world championship match, there was this young player

54:40.680 --> 54:43.640
 Alireza Fyrusha, he had a dramatic rise.

54:43.640 --> 54:46.200
 He rose to second in the world rankings.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.960
 He was 18 then, he's 19 now.

54:48.960 --> 54:51.040
 He qualified for the candidates.

54:51.040 --> 54:58.520
 And it felt like there was at least a half realistic possibility that he could be the

54:58.520 --> 55:01.920
 challenger for the next world championship.

55:01.920 --> 55:03.920
 And that sort of lit a fire under me.

55:03.920 --> 55:06.280
 Do you like that idea?

55:06.280 --> 55:07.360
 I like that a lot.

55:07.360 --> 55:12.000
 I love the idea of playing him in the next world championship.

55:12.000 --> 55:18.880
 And originally, I was sure that I wanted to announce right after the tournament, the match

55:18.880 --> 55:20.640
 that this was it, I'm done.

55:20.640 --> 55:22.680
 I'm not playing the next one.

55:22.680 --> 55:24.240
 But this lit a fire under me.

55:24.240 --> 55:29.920
 So that made me think, you know, this actually motivates me.

55:29.920 --> 55:34.960
 And I just wanted to get it out there for several reasons, to create more hype about

55:34.960 --> 55:41.880
 the candidates, to sort of motivate myself a little bit, maybe motivate him.

55:41.880 --> 55:49.120
 Also, obviously, I wanted to give people a heads up for the candidates that you might

55:49.120 --> 55:53.280
 be playing for more than first place.

55:53.280 --> 55:56.320
 Like normally the candidates is first place or best.

55:56.320 --> 55:59.440
 It's like the world championship.

55:59.440 --> 56:04.360
 And then, so Nakamura was one of many people who just didn't believe me.

56:04.360 --> 56:12.280
 Which is fair, because I've talked before about not necessarily wanting to defend again.

56:12.280 --> 56:16.920
 But I never talked as concretely or was as serious as this time.

56:16.920 --> 56:19.040
 So he simply didn't believe me.

56:19.040 --> 56:21.560
 And he was very vocal about that.

56:21.560 --> 56:27.280
 And he said, nobody believe me, no, no, no, the players may or may not have been true.

56:27.280 --> 56:31.880
 And then, yeah, he lost he lost the last game and he didn't didn't qualify.

56:31.880 --> 56:33.320
 But to answer the question.

56:33.320 --> 56:38.160
 No, I'd already at that point decided that I wouldn't play.

56:38.160 --> 56:44.560
 I would have liked it less if he had not lost the last round.

56:44.560 --> 56:45.560
 But the decision was made.

56:45.560 --> 56:48.760
 But the decision was already made.

56:48.760 --> 56:54.600
 Does it break your heart a little bit that you're walking away from it?

56:54.600 --> 56:57.360
 In all the ways that you mentioned that it's just not fun.

56:57.360 --> 57:02.120
 There's a bunch of ways that it doesn't seem to bring out the best kind of chess.

57:02.120 --> 57:05.680
 It doesn't bring out the best out of you and the particular opponents involved.

57:05.680 --> 57:11.000
 Does it just break your heart a little bit like you're walking away from something or

57:11.000 --> 57:17.240
 maybe the entire chess community is walking away from a kind of a historic event that

57:17.240 --> 57:21.120
 was so important in the 20th century, at least.

57:21.120 --> 57:23.760
 So I won the championship in 2013.

57:23.760 --> 57:28.480
 I said no to the candidates in 2011.

57:28.480 --> 57:30.680
 I didn't particularly like the format.

57:30.680 --> 57:34.000
 I also wasn't, I was just not in a mood.

57:34.000 --> 57:40.320
 I didn't want the pressure that was connected with the world championship.

57:40.320 --> 57:46.560
 And I was perfectly content at the time to play the tournaments that I did play.

57:46.560 --> 57:50.520
 Also to be ranked number one in the world, I was comfortable with the fact that I knew

57:50.520 --> 57:57.200
 that I was the best and I didn't need a title to show others.

57:57.200 --> 58:02.240
 And what happened later is I suddenly decided to play.

58:02.240 --> 58:05.200
 In 2013, I liked, they changed the format.

58:05.200 --> 58:08.280
 I liked it better.

58:08.280 --> 58:11.320
 I just decided, you know, it could be interesting.

58:11.320 --> 58:13.840
 Let's try and get this.

58:13.840 --> 58:17.360
 There really wasn't more than, more than that to it.

58:17.360 --> 58:21.840
 It wasn't like fulfilling life or a dream or anything.

58:21.840 --> 58:24.520
 I just thought, you know, let's play.

58:24.520 --> 58:26.480
 So it's just a cool tournament.

58:26.480 --> 58:27.480
 Yeah.

58:27.480 --> 58:28.480
 It's a cool tournament.

58:28.480 --> 58:29.480
 It's a good challenge.

58:29.480 --> 58:31.840
 You know, why not?

58:31.840 --> 58:35.120
 It's something that could be a motivation.

58:35.120 --> 58:40.640
 It motivated me to get in the best shape of my life that had been until then.

58:40.640 --> 58:42.680
 So it was a good thing.

58:42.680 --> 58:46.680
 And 2013 match brought me a lot of joy as well.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.480
 So I'm very, very happy that I did that.

58:49.480 --> 58:54.720
 But I never had any thoughts that I'm going to keep the title for a long time immediately

58:54.720 --> 58:57.960
 after the match in 2013.

58:57.960 --> 59:03.720
 I mean, also before the match, I'd spoken against the fact that champion is seeded into

59:03.720 --> 59:07.600
 the final, which I thought was unfair.

59:07.600 --> 59:13.440
 After the match, I made a proposal that we have a different system where the champion

59:13.440 --> 59:18.920
 doesn't have these privileges and people's reaction, both players and chess community

59:18.920 --> 59:22.160
 was general, generally like, okay, we're good.

59:22.160 --> 59:25.400
 We don't, we don't want that you keep your privileges.

59:25.400 --> 59:28.040
 And I was like, okay, whatever.

59:28.040 --> 59:30.160
 So you want to fight for it every time?

59:30.160 --> 59:34.680
 Yeah, I want that.

59:34.680 --> 59:41.240
 Have to ask just in case you have an opinion, if you can maybe from a fantasy chess perspective,

59:41.240 --> 59:49.240
 analyze Ding versus Neppo, who wins the current, the two people that would play if you're

59:49.240 --> 59:50.920
 not playing?

59:50.920 --> 59:57.360
 Actually I would consider that Ding has a slightly better overall chess strength.

59:57.360 --> 1:00:02.760
 What are the strengths and weaknesses of each if you can kind of summarize it?

1:00:02.760 --> 1:00:11.480
 So Neppo, he's even better at calculating short lines than I am.

1:00:11.480 --> 1:00:15.840
 But he can sometimes like a little bit of, little bit of depth.

1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:20.040
 Like he's in short lines, he's an absolute calculation monster.

1:00:20.040 --> 1:00:25.360
 He's extremely, he's extremely quick, but he can sometimes like a bit of depth.

1:00:25.360 --> 1:00:28.840
 Also recently, he's improved his openings quite a bit.

1:00:28.840 --> 1:00:37.160
 So now he has a lot of, a lot of good ideas and he's very, very solid.

1:00:37.160 --> 1:00:44.200
 Ding is not quite as well prepared, but he has an excellent understanding of dynamics

1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:48.960
 and imbalances in chess, I would say.

1:00:48.960 --> 1:00:51.880
 What do you mean by imbalances?

1:00:51.880 --> 1:00:55.840
 Imbalances like bishops against knights and material imbalances.

1:00:55.840 --> 1:00:57.520
 He can take advantage of those.

1:00:57.520 --> 1:01:03.680
 Yes, I would say he's very, very good at that and understanding the, you know, the dynamic

1:01:03.680 --> 1:01:10.400
 factors as we call them, like material versus time, especially.

1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:13.000
 I think Neppo got the better of him and the candidates.

1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:17.040
 So what's your sense why Ding has an edge in the championship?

1:01:17.040 --> 1:01:24.080
 I feel like individual past results hasn't necessarily been a great indicator of world

1:01:24.080 --> 1:01:25.440
 championship results.

1:01:25.440 --> 1:01:31.280
 I feel like overall stress strength is more, more important.

1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:34.640
 I mean, to be fair, I only think like Ding has a very small edge.

1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:41.240
 Like difference is not big at all, but our individual head to head record was probably

1:01:41.240 --> 1:01:45.760
 the main reason that a lot of people thought Neppo had a good chance against me as well.

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:53.240
 It was like four to one in his favor before the match, but that was just another example

1:01:53.240 --> 1:01:56.520
 of why that may not necessarily mean anything.

1:01:56.520 --> 1:02:04.120
 Also in our case, it was a very, very low sample size, I think, about the size of the

1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:09.280
 match in total 14 games and that generally doesn't mean much.

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.120
 How close were those games, would you say, in your mind for the previous championship?

1:02:14.120 --> 1:02:19.480
 So that game six where it was a turning point where you won, was there any doubt in your

1:02:19.480 --> 1:02:24.480
 mind that, you know, like if you do a much larger sample size, you'll get the better

1:02:24.480 --> 1:02:25.480
 of Neppo?

1:02:25.480 --> 1:02:28.720
 No, no, larger sample size is always good for me.

1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:36.920
 So World Championship, it's a great parallel to football because it's a low scoring game.

1:02:36.920 --> 1:02:44.360
 And if the better player or the better team scores, they win most of the time.

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:47.320
 That's generally for championships or in general?

1:02:47.320 --> 1:02:55.000
 Yeah, for championships, like they generally win because the other slightly weaker team,

1:02:55.000 --> 1:03:00.000
 they're good enough to defend, to make it very, very difficult for the others.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:04.240
 But when they actually have to create the chances, then they have no chance.

1:03:04.240 --> 1:03:09.080
 And then it very often ends with a blowout as it did in our match.

1:03:09.080 --> 1:03:13.320
 If I hadn't won game six, it probably would have been very, very close.

1:03:13.320 --> 1:03:15.000
 He might have edged it.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:18.440
 There's always the bigger chance that I would have edged it.

1:03:18.440 --> 1:03:24.280
 But this is just what happens a lot in chess, but also in football that matches are close.

1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:30.120
 And then they, somebody scores, somebody scores and then things change.

1:03:30.120 --> 1:03:37.040
 And this gives people the illusion that the matchup was very close, which, well, actually,

1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:43.880
 it just means that the nature of the game makes the matches close very often.

1:03:43.880 --> 1:03:49.000
 But it's always much more likely that one of the teams is going to, or one of the players

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.800
 is going to break away than the others.

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:58.400
 And in other matches as well, even though a lot of people before the match in 2016 against

1:03:58.400 --> 1:04:05.640
 Karajakin, there were people who thought before the match that I was massively overrated

1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:16.160
 as a favorite and that essentially the match was pretty close, like whatever, 60, 40, or

1:04:16.160 --> 1:04:19.120
 some people even said like 55, 45.

1:04:19.120 --> 1:04:26.200
 And what I felt was that the match went very, very wrong for me and I still won.

1:04:26.200 --> 1:04:30.200
 And some people saw that as an indication that the pre match probabilities were probably

1:04:30.200 --> 1:04:32.120
 a bit closer than people thought.

1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:37.760
 Well, I would look at it in the way that everything went wrong and I still won, which

1:04:37.760 --> 1:04:41.000
 probably means that I was pretty big favorite to begin with.

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:46.120
 I do have a question to you about that match, but first, so Sergei Karajakin was originally

1:04:46.120 --> 1:04:51.440
 a qualifier for the candidate tournament, but was disqualified for breaching the Fedia

1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:57.400
 Code of Ethics after publicly expressing approval for the 2022 Russian invasion in Ukraine.

1:04:57.400 --> 1:05:04.680
 When you look at the Cold War and some of the US versus Russian games of the past, does

1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:09.160
 some of this geopolitics, politics ever creep its way into the game?

1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:13.720
 Do you feel the pressure, the immensity of that as it does sometimes for the Olympics,

1:05:13.720 --> 1:05:20.480
 these big nations playing each other, competing against each other, almost like fighting out

1:05:20.480 --> 1:05:26.040
 in a friendly way, the battles, the tensions that they have in the space of geopolitics?

1:05:26.040 --> 1:05:27.760
 I think it still does.

1:05:27.760 --> 1:05:34.160
 So the president of the World Chess Federation, who was just reelected, is a Russian, like

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:39.760
 I like him personally for sure, but he is quite connected to the Kremlin.

1:05:39.760 --> 1:05:46.440
 And it's quite clear that the Kremlin considers it at least a semi important goal to bring

1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:49.400
 the chess crown home to Russia.

1:05:49.400 --> 1:05:53.200
 So it's still definitely a factor.

1:05:53.200 --> 1:06:00.000
 And I mean, I can answer for in the Karyakin case, like, I don't have a strong opinion

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:03.720
 on whether he should have been banned or not.

1:06:03.720 --> 1:06:08.800
 Obviously, I don't agree with anything that he says.

1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:16.960
 But in principle, I think that you should ban either no Russians or all Russians.

1:06:16.960 --> 1:06:22.920
 I'm generally not particularly against either.

1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:32.600
 But I don't love banning wrong opinions, even if they are as reprehensible as has been.

1:06:32.600 --> 1:06:38.440
 Yeah, there's something about the World Chess Championships or the Olympics, where it feels

1:06:38.440 --> 1:06:43.160
 like banning is counterproductive to the alleviating some of the conflicts.

1:06:43.160 --> 1:06:44.160
 We don't know.

1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:45.160
 This is the thing, though.

1:06:45.160 --> 1:06:46.160
 Yeah.

1:06:46.160 --> 1:06:49.120
 We don't know about the long term conflicts.

1:06:49.120 --> 1:06:54.440
 And a lot of people try to do the right thing in this sense, which I don't really blame

1:06:54.440 --> 1:06:55.440
 at all.

1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:58.080
 It's just that we don't know.

1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:04.600
 And I guess sometimes there are other ways you want to try and help as well.

1:07:04.600 --> 1:07:09.040
 Like within the competition, within some of those battles of US versus Russia or so on

1:07:09.040 --> 1:07:15.680
 of the past, there's also between the individuals, maybe you'll disagree with this, but from

1:07:15.680 --> 1:07:19.040
 a spectator perspective, there's still a camaraderie.

1:07:19.040 --> 1:07:25.320
 Like at the end of the day, there's a thing that unites you, which is this appreciation

1:07:25.320 --> 1:07:29.520
 of the fight over the chessboard.

1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:31.320
 Even if you hate each other in a moment.

1:07:31.320 --> 1:07:32.320
 Yeah, for sure.

1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:38.640
 I think for every match that's been, you would briefly discuss the game with your opponent

1:07:38.640 --> 1:07:42.040
 after the game, no matter how much you hate each other.

1:07:42.040 --> 1:07:44.240
 And I think that's lovely.

1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:48.880
 And Kasparov, I mean, he was quoted like one, somebody in his team asked him, like,

1:07:48.880 --> 1:07:52.400
 why, why are you talking to the carp of after the game?

1:07:52.400 --> 1:07:57.280
 Like he, you hate that guy and he's like, yeah, sure, but he's the only one who understands

1:07:57.280 --> 1:07:58.280
 me.

1:07:58.280 --> 1:07:59.280
 Yeah.

1:07:59.280 --> 1:08:00.280
 The only one who understands.

1:08:00.280 --> 1:08:01.760
 So that's, no, I think that's really lovely.

1:08:01.760 --> 1:08:08.040
 And I would love to see that in other, in other areas was as well that you can, regardless

1:08:08.040 --> 1:08:12.120
 of what happens, you can have, you can have a good chat about the game.

1:08:12.120 --> 1:08:17.520
 And you can, you can just talk about the ideas with people who, who understand what you,

1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:18.920
 what you understand.

1:08:18.920 --> 1:08:24.800
 So if you're not playing the world championships, there's a lot of people who are saying that

1:08:24.800 --> 1:08:27.280
 perhaps the world championships don't matter anymore.

1:08:27.280 --> 1:08:30.120
 Do you think there's some truth to that?

1:08:30.120 --> 1:08:37.880
 I said that back a long time ago as well, that for me, I don't know if it never happened.

1:08:37.880 --> 1:08:39.440
 So I don't know what would have happened.

1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:44.040
 But I was thinking like the moment that I realized that I'm not the best player in the

1:08:44.040 --> 1:08:48.800
 world, like I felt like morally I have to renounce the world championship title, you

1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:51.520
 know, because it doesn't mean anything.

1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:53.640
 As long as you're not the best player.

1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:58.880
 So the ratings really tell a bigger, a clearer story.

1:08:58.880 --> 1:08:59.880
 I think so.

1:08:59.880 --> 1:09:05.880
 At least, at least over time, like I'm a lot more proud of my streak of being rated

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:13.760
 number one in the world, which is now since I think the summer of 2011, I'm a lot more

1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:17.840
 proud of, of that than, than the world championships.

1:09:17.840 --> 1:09:23.320
 How much anxiety or even fear do you have before making a difficult decision on the

1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:24.560
 chess board?

1:09:24.560 --> 1:09:26.800
 So it's a high stakes game.

1:09:26.800 --> 1:09:28.920
 How nervous do you get?

1:09:28.920 --> 1:09:31.040
 How much anxiety do you have in all that calculations?

1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:35.240
 You're sitting there for 10, 15 minutes because you're in a fog.

1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:38.120
 There's always a possibility of a blunder of a mistake.

1:09:38.120 --> 1:09:39.360
 Are you anxious about it?

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:41.080
 Are you afraid of it?

1:09:41.080 --> 1:09:42.840
 Really depends.

1:09:42.840 --> 1:09:45.840
 I have been, I have been at times.

1:09:45.840 --> 1:09:53.840
 I think the most nervous I've ever been was game 10 of the world championships in 2018.

1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:58.440
 I thought that was just a thrilling game.

1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:00.000
 I was black.

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:04.520
 I basically abandoned the queen side at some point to attack him on the king side.

1:10:04.520 --> 1:10:12.200
 And I knew that my attack, if it doesn't work, I'm going to lose, but I had so much adrenaline.

1:10:12.200 --> 1:10:13.320
 So that was, that was fine.

1:10:13.320 --> 1:10:15.120
 I thought I was going to win.

1:10:15.120 --> 1:10:20.200
 Then at some point I realized that it's not so clear and my time was ticking and I was

1:10:20.200 --> 1:10:21.920
 just getting so nervous.

1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:25.400
 I, I still remember what happened.

1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:31.800
 Like we played this time trouble face where he had very little time, but I had even less.

1:10:31.800 --> 1:10:36.680
 And I just remember, I kind of remember much of it, just that when it was over, I was just

1:10:36.680 --> 1:10:41.960
 so relieved because then it was clear that the position was probably going to clear out

1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:43.800
 the name in a draw.

1:10:43.800 --> 1:10:51.000
 Otherwise, I'm often nervous before games, but when I get there, it's all business.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:57.880
 And especially when I'm playing well, I'm never afraid of losing when I, when I play

1:10:57.880 --> 1:11:03.560
 because I trust, I trust my instincts, I trust my, my skills.

1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:07.840
 How much psychological intimidation is there from you to the other person, from the other

1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:09.800
 person to you?

1:11:09.800 --> 1:11:15.000
 I think people will play a lot better if they played against an anonymous me.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:16.500
 I would love to.

1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:18.000
 Are people scared of you?

1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:24.080
 I would love to have a tournament online where let's say you play 10 of the best players

1:11:24.080 --> 1:11:29.320
 in the world and you don't, for each round, you don't know who you're playing.

1:11:29.320 --> 1:11:31.480
 Would be, that's an interesting question.

1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:35.600
 You know, like there's these like videos where people eat McDonald's, a Burger King

1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:38.640
 or Diet Coke versus Diet Pepsi.

1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:45.080
 Would people be able to tell they're playing you like from the style of play, do you think?

1:11:45.080 --> 1:11:48.600
 Or from the strength of play?

1:11:48.600 --> 1:11:50.600
 If there was a decent sample size, sure.

1:11:50.600 --> 1:11:59.520
 And what about you, would you be able to tell others in like one game, very unlikely?

1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:01.720
 What sample size would you need to tell accurately?

1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:03.760
 I feel like this is science.

1:12:03.760 --> 1:12:04.760
 Yeah.

1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:08.480
 I think 20 games would help a lot per person.

1:12:08.480 --> 1:12:09.480
 Yeah.

1:12:09.480 --> 1:12:15.160
 But I know that they've already developed AI bots that are pretty good at recognizing

1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:17.160
 somebody's style.

1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:18.160
 Okay.

1:12:18.160 --> 1:12:20.680
 So, which is quite fascinating.

1:12:20.680 --> 1:12:26.240
 And it'd be fascinating if those bots were able to summarize the style somehow.

1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:30.560
 Maybe great attacking chess, like some of the same characteristics you've been describing

1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:35.840
 like great at short line calculations, all that kind of stuff.

1:12:35.840 --> 1:12:36.840
 Or just talk shit.

1:12:36.840 --> 1:12:42.480
 I mean, really, really all the best chess players, there are basically just two camps.

1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:46.520
 People who are good at longer lines or shorter lines.

1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.640
 Just the hair and the tortoise, basically.

1:12:49.640 --> 1:12:58.200
 And sometimes, you know, I feel like I'm the closest you can get to a hybrid of those.

1:12:58.200 --> 1:13:03.720
 Because you got both, you're good in every position, so the middle game and end game.

1:13:03.720 --> 1:13:04.720
 Yeah.

1:13:04.720 --> 1:13:10.800
 And also, I can think to some extent, both rapidly and deeply, which a lot of people,

1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:11.800
 they can do both.

1:13:11.800 --> 1:13:15.640
 But, I mean, to answer your question from before, I think, yeah.

1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:22.520
 I sometimes can get a little bit intimidated by my opponent, but it's mostly if there's

1:13:22.520 --> 1:13:28.440
 something unknown, it's mostly if it's something that I don't understand fully.

1:13:28.440 --> 1:13:33.600
 And I do think, especially when I'm playing, well, people, they just play more timidly

1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:39.960
 against me than they do against each other, sometimes without even realizing it.

1:13:39.960 --> 1:13:43.000
 And I certainly use that to my advantage.

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:49.680
 If I sense that my opponent is apprehensive, if I sense that they are not going to necessarily

1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:53.760
 take all their chances, it just means that I can take more risk.

1:13:53.760 --> 1:13:58.480
 And I always try and find that balance.

1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:00.000
 To shake them up a little bit.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.000
 Yeah.

1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:04.440
 What's been the toughest loss of your career that you remember?

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:08.120
 Would that be the World Championship match?

1:14:08.120 --> 1:14:09.680
 Oh, yeah, for sure.

1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:12.520
 Can you take Game 8 in 2016?

1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:13.800
 And who was it against?

1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:16.080
 Against Karyakin in New York.

1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:19.480
 Can you take it through the story of that game?

1:14:19.480 --> 1:14:25.160
 Where were you before that game in terms of Game 1 through 7?

1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:29.440
 Yeah, so Game 1 and 2, not much happened.

1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:33.240
 Game 3 and 4, I was winning in both of them.

1:14:33.240 --> 1:14:37.920
 And normally, I should definitely have converted both.

1:14:37.920 --> 1:14:38.920
 I couldn't.

1:14:38.920 --> 1:14:48.960
 Partly due to good defense on his part, but mostly because I just, I messed up.

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:56.760
 And then after that, games 5, 6 and 7, not much happened.

1:14:56.760 --> 1:15:00.440
 I was getting impatient at that point.

1:15:00.440 --> 1:15:08.200
 So for Game 8, I was probably ready to take a little bit more risks than I had before,

1:15:08.200 --> 1:15:18.160
 which I guess was insane because I knew that he couldn't beat me unless I beat myself.

1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:20.640
 Like he wasn't strong enough to outplay me.

1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:23.520
 And that was leading to impatience somehow and impatience.

1:15:23.520 --> 1:15:26.120
 No, because I knew that I was better.

1:15:26.120 --> 1:15:27.120
 I knew that I was better.

1:15:27.120 --> 1:15:30.640
 I knew that I just needed to win one game, and then the match is over.

1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:33.240
 That's what happened in 2021 as well.

1:15:33.240 --> 1:15:37.080
 When I won the first game against Nebo, I knew that the match was over, unless I fuck

1:15:37.080 --> 1:15:42.560
 up royally, then he's not going to be able to beat me.

1:15:42.560 --> 1:15:48.760
 So what happened was that I played a kind of an innocuous opening as white, just trying

1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:52.280
 to get a game, trying to get him out of book as soon as possible.

1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:56.360
 Okay, can you elaborate innocuous, get him out of the book?

1:15:56.360 --> 1:16:00.200
 No, but basically, I set up pretty defensively as white.

1:16:00.200 --> 1:16:04.440
 I wasn't really crossing into his half at the start at all.

1:16:04.440 --> 1:16:10.000
 I was just, I played more like a system more than like a concrete opening.

1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.760
 It was like, I'm going to set up my pieces this way.

1:16:12.760 --> 1:16:17.600
 You can set them up however you want, and then later where sort of the armies are going

1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:20.880
 to meet, I'm not going to try and bother you at the start.

1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:25.080
 And that means you're going to have with as many pieces as possible, kind of pure chest

1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:32.680
 in the middle game without any of the lines, the standard lines in the opening.

1:16:32.680 --> 1:16:37.600
 And so there was at some point, a couple of exchanges, then some maneuvering, a little

1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:42.680
 bit better, then he was sort of equalizing, and then I started to take too many risks.

1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:44.880
 And I was still sort of fine.

1:16:44.880 --> 1:16:51.640
 But then at some point, I realized that I'd gone a bit too far and I had to be really

1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:52.640
 careful.

1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:54.080
 Then I just froze.

1:16:54.080 --> 1:16:56.360
 I just completely froze.

1:16:56.360 --> 1:16:57.360
 Mentally?

1:16:57.360 --> 1:16:58.360
 Like what?

1:16:58.360 --> 1:16:59.360
 Yeah, mentally.

1:16:59.360 --> 1:17:00.360
 What happened?

1:17:00.360 --> 1:17:08.080
 I realized that all the thoughts of, I might lose this, what have I done, why did I take

1:17:08.080 --> 1:17:09.080
 so many risks?

1:17:09.080 --> 1:17:15.760
 I knew that I could have drawn at any moment, just be patient, don't give him these opportunities.

1:17:15.760 --> 1:17:19.000
 What triggered that like face transition in your mind?

1:17:19.000 --> 1:17:24.360
 No, it was just a position on the board, like realizing, like there was one particular

1:17:24.360 --> 1:17:32.520
 move he played that I missed, and then I realized this could potentially not go my way.

1:17:32.520 --> 1:17:38.760
 So then I made another couple of mistakes, and to his credit, once he realized he had

1:17:38.760 --> 1:17:43.240
 the chance, he knew that this was his one chance.

1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:45.120
 He had to take it.

1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:47.120
 And so he did.

1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:53.960
 And yeah, that's the worst I've ever felt after a chess game.

1:17:53.960 --> 1:17:59.840
 I realized that I'm probably going to lose my title against somebody who's not even close

1:17:59.840 --> 1:18:02.480
 to my level.

1:18:02.480 --> 1:18:08.360
 And I've done it because of my own stupidity, most of all.

1:18:08.360 --> 1:18:17.680
 And that was really, really, at the time, like I was all in my own head, that was hard

1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:18.680
 to deal with.

1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:24.440
 And I felt like I didn't really recover too much for the next game.

1:18:24.440 --> 1:18:27.280
 So what I did, there was a free day after the eighth game.

1:18:27.280 --> 1:18:31.600
 So I did something that I never did at any other world championship.

1:18:31.600 --> 1:18:39.240
 Like I, after game eight, I just, I got drunk with my team.

1:18:39.240 --> 1:18:40.880
 And that's not a standard procedure.

1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:45.640
 No, no, that's, that's the only time that's happened in the, in the world championship

1:18:45.640 --> 1:18:46.640
 during the match.

1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:53.160
 So yeah, I just tried to forget, but still before game nine, game nine, I was a little

1:18:53.160 --> 1:18:59.960
 bit more relaxed, but I was still a bit nervous then game nine, I was almost lost as well.

1:18:59.960 --> 1:19:04.480
 Then only game 10, game 10, I was still, I wasn't in a great mood.

1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:07.360
 I was really, really tense.

1:19:07.360 --> 1:19:09.040
 The opening was good.

1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:10.760
 I had some advantage.

1:19:10.760 --> 1:19:12.040
 I was getting optimistic.

1:19:12.040 --> 1:19:13.960
 Then I made one mistake.

1:19:13.960 --> 1:19:18.120
 He could have forced the draw and then the old, old, the negativity came back.

1:19:18.120 --> 1:19:22.080
 Like I was thinking during game, like how I'm going to play for win with black in the

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:23.080
 next game.

1:19:23.080 --> 1:19:26.560
 Like what, what, what am I doing?

1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:32.920
 And then, you know, eventually it ended, it ended well, it didn't find the right line.

1:19:32.920 --> 1:19:33.920
 I ground him down.

1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:38.560
 Actually I played at some point pretty well in the end game.

1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:46.320
 And after that game, like there was such a weight lifted, no, I, I, after that there

1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:49.320
 was like no thought of losing the match whatsoever.

1:19:49.320 --> 1:19:57.320
 I knew that, okay, I'd basically gotten away with not with murder, but getting gotten away

1:19:57.320 --> 1:19:59.320
 with something.

1:19:59.320 --> 1:20:05.280
 What can you say about the after game eight, where are the places you've gone in your mind?

1:20:05.280 --> 1:20:08.800
 Do you go to some, some dark places, we're talking about like depression.

1:20:08.800 --> 1:20:11.520
 Do you think about quitting at that point?

1:20:11.520 --> 1:20:18.280
 No, I mean, I think about quitting every time I lose the classical game or at least I used

1:20:18.280 --> 1:20:19.280
 to.

1:20:19.280 --> 1:20:20.280
 Yeah.

1:20:20.280 --> 1:20:21.280
 Like especially if it's in a stupid way.

1:20:21.280 --> 1:20:25.840
 I'm thinking like, okay, if I'm going to, going to play like this, if I'm going to do

1:20:25.840 --> 1:20:29.960
 things that I know are wrong, then, you know, I might as well quit.

1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:34.160
 No, that's happened, that's happened a bunch of, bunch of times.

1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:40.440
 And I definitely gotten a bit more carefree about losing these days, which it's not necessarily

1:20:40.440 --> 1:20:41.440
 a good thing.

1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:47.320
 Like my hatred of losing led to me not losing a lot.

1:20:47.320 --> 1:20:54.440
 And it also led to fire under me that I think my performance after losses in, in classical

1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:58.200
 chess over the last 10 years is like over 2900.

1:20:58.200 --> 1:21:03.480
 Like I really play well after a loss, even though it's really, really unpleasant.

1:21:03.480 --> 1:21:10.040
 So apparently like, I don't think the way that I dealt with them is particularly healthy,

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.760
 but it's worked.

1:21:11.760 --> 1:21:12.920
 It's worked so far.

1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:19.520
 But then you discovered now a love for winning to where ultimately longevity wise creates

1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:20.520
 more fun.

1:21:20.520 --> 1:21:21.520
 Yeah.

1:21:21.520 --> 1:21:22.520
 For sure.

1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:23.520
 Yeah.

1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:28.840
 What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen on a day of a big chess match?

1:21:28.840 --> 1:21:33.600
 It doesn't have to be world championship, but if, if it's a chess match you care about

1:21:33.600 --> 1:21:36.000
 what, what time do you wake up?

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:37.000
 What do you eat?

1:21:37.000 --> 1:21:44.520
 Oh, it depends on when the game is, but let's say the game is at three or probably wake

1:21:44.520 --> 1:21:57.760
 up pretty late at about 11, then I'll go for, go for a walk, might listen to some podcasts.

1:21:57.760 --> 1:22:02.720
 Maybe I'll spend a little bit of time looking at some, you know, some NBA game from last

1:22:02.720 --> 1:22:04.240
 night or whatever.

1:22:04.240 --> 1:22:05.760
 To not chess related stuff.

1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:07.120
 No, no, no, no.

1:22:07.120 --> 1:22:13.680
 Then I'll, I'll get back, I'll have big lunch, like usually like a big omelet with a bunch

1:22:13.680 --> 1:22:21.160
 of salad and stuff, then go to the game, win like a very nice clean game.

1:22:21.160 --> 1:22:22.440
 This is the perfect day.

1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:25.120
 Just go back after relax.

1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:30.840
 Like the, the things that make me the happiest that tournaments is just having a good routine

1:22:30.840 --> 1:22:33.520
 and feeling, feeling well.

1:22:33.520 --> 1:22:36.920
 I don't like it when too much is happening around me.

1:22:36.920 --> 1:22:44.200
 So the tournament that I came from now was the Chess Olympiad, which is the team then.

1:22:44.200 --> 1:22:46.420
 So we were team Norway.

1:22:46.420 --> 1:22:47.920
 We did horribly.

1:22:47.920 --> 1:22:48.920
 Yeah.

1:22:48.920 --> 1:22:52.080
 I like, I did okay, but the team in general did, did horribly.

1:22:52.080 --> 1:22:53.640
 You won that Italy?

1:22:53.640 --> 1:22:58.400
 No, no, Italy beat us, but Uzbekistan won the end.

1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:01.000
 They were this amazing team of young players.

1:23:01.000 --> 1:23:03.020
 It was really, it was really impressive.

1:23:03.020 --> 1:23:05.560
 But the thing is like we had a good camaraderie in the team.

1:23:05.560 --> 1:23:07.360
 We had our meals together.

1:23:07.360 --> 1:23:13.360
 We played a bit of football when swimming and I couldn't understand why things went wrong.

1:23:13.360 --> 1:23:17.240
 And I still don't understand, but the thing is for me, it was all very nice.

1:23:17.240 --> 1:23:22.200
 But now I'm so happy to be on my own at a tournament, just to have my own routines,

1:23:22.200 --> 1:23:28.720
 not see too many people, otherwise just have like a very small team of people that I see.

1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:31.200
 You are a kind of celebrity now.

1:23:31.200 --> 1:23:37.760
 So, you know, people within the chess tournament and outside recognize you want to socialize,

1:23:37.760 --> 1:23:40.800
 want to tell you about how much you mean to them, how much you inspire them, all that

1:23:40.800 --> 1:23:41.800
 kind of stuff.

1:23:41.800 --> 1:23:46.920
 Does that get in the way for you when you're like trying to really focus on the match?

1:23:46.920 --> 1:23:49.200
 Are you able to block that?

1:23:49.200 --> 1:23:53.480
 Like are you able to enjoy those little interactions and still keep your focus?

1:23:53.480 --> 1:23:57.800
 Yeah, most of the time that's fine, as long as it's not too much.

1:23:57.800 --> 1:24:09.320
 But I have to admit, when I'm at home in Norway, I rarely go out without big headphones

1:24:09.320 --> 1:24:10.320
 and something.

1:24:10.320 --> 1:24:11.320
 Oh, like a disguise?

1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:17.720
 No, not a disguise, just to block out the world, otherwise.

1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:18.720
 Don't make eye contact.

1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:23.320
 Yeah, so the thing is, people in general are nice.

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:29.640
 I mean, people, they wish me well, and they don't like bother me.

1:24:29.640 --> 1:24:34.160
 Also when I have the headphones on, I don't notice as much people like turning around

1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:40.000
 and all of that, so I can be more of in my own world.

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:41.000
 So I like that.

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:42.000
 Yeah.

1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:47.560
 What about in this perfect day after the game, do you try to analyze what happened?

1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:51.400
 Do you try to think through systematically, or do you just kind of loosely think about

1:24:51.400 --> 1:24:52.400
 like?

1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:53.600
 No, I just loosely think about it.

1:24:53.600 --> 1:24:57.800
 I've never been very structured in that sense.

1:24:57.800 --> 1:25:04.040
 I know that it was always recommended that you analyze your own games, but I generally

1:25:04.040 --> 1:25:07.840
 felt that I mostly had a good idea about that.

1:25:07.840 --> 1:25:14.640
 Like nowadays, I will loosely see what the engine says at a certain point if I'm curious

1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:15.640
 about that.

1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:20.120
 Otherwise, I usually move on to the next.

1:25:20.120 --> 1:25:21.120
 What about diet?

1:25:21.120 --> 1:25:23.120
 You said omelette and salad and so on.

1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:29.520
 I heard in your conversation with the other Magnus, Magnus number two, about you had

1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:31.280
 like this bet about meat.

1:25:31.280 --> 1:25:37.840
 One of you are going to go vegan if you lose, I forget which, vegetarian though, vegetarian.

1:25:37.840 --> 1:25:43.040
 And you both have an admiration for me.

1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:48.440
 Is there some aspect about optimal performance that you look for in food, like maybe eating

1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:54.160
 only like once or twice a day or a particular kind of food like meat, heavy diet?

1:25:54.160 --> 1:25:55.240
 Is there anything like that?

1:25:55.240 --> 1:25:57.480
 Or you just try to have fun with the food?

1:25:57.480 --> 1:26:04.560
 I think whenever I'm at tournaments, like it's very natural to eat at least for me

1:26:04.560 --> 1:26:06.240
 to eat only twice a day.

1:26:06.240 --> 1:26:08.920
 So usually I do that when I'm at home as well.

1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:13.120
 So you do eat before the tournament though, you don't play fasted.

1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:22.000
 No, no, no, but I try not to eat too heavy before the game or in general to avoid sugary

1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:28.440
 stuff to have a pretty stable blood sugar level because that's the easiest way to make

1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:36.200
 mistake that your energy levels just suddenly drop and they don't necessarily need to be

1:26:36.200 --> 1:26:39.400
 too high as long as they're pretty stable.

1:26:39.400 --> 1:26:46.080
 Have you ever tried playing fasted, like intermittent fasting, so playing without having

1:26:46.080 --> 1:26:47.080
 eaten?

1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:52.600
 I mean, the reason I ask, especially when you do a low carb diet, when I have done

1:26:52.600 --> 1:26:56.840
 a person at low carb diet, I've been able to fast for a long time like he wants a day,

1:26:56.840 --> 1:27:03.760
 maybe twice a day, but I just, the mind is most focused on like really difficult thinking

1:27:03.760 --> 1:27:05.960
 tasks when it's fasted.

1:27:05.960 --> 1:27:08.840
 It's an interesting, a lot of people kind of talk about that.

1:27:08.840 --> 1:27:09.840
 Yeah.

1:27:09.840 --> 1:27:13.560
 You're able to kind of like zoom in and if you're doing a low carb diet, you don't have

1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:15.480
 this energy, the energy stable.

1:27:15.480 --> 1:27:17.120
 No, that is true.

1:27:17.120 --> 1:27:18.840
 Maybe that will be interesting to try.

1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:24.640
 So what's happened for me is I played a few tournaments where I've had food poisoning

1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:31.400
 and then that generally means that you're both sleep deprived and you have no energy.

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:38.280
 And what I've found is that it makes me, it makes me very calm, of course, because I

1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:42.240
 don't have the energy and it makes me super creative.

1:27:42.240 --> 1:27:43.240
 Interesting.

1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:46.600
 Like being sleep deprived, I think in general makes you creative.

1:27:46.600 --> 1:27:52.880
 Just the first thing that goes away is the ability to do the simple things.

1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:54.880
 That's what affects you the most.

1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:56.640
 Like you cannot be precise.

1:27:56.640 --> 1:28:05.200
 So that's the only thing I'm worried about, like if I'm fasted, that I won't be precise

1:28:05.200 --> 1:28:06.520
 when I play.

1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:08.360
 But you might be more creative.

1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:09.360
 It's an interesting trend.

1:28:09.360 --> 1:28:12.080
 Fasted, yeah, potentially.

1:28:12.080 --> 1:28:16.640
 What about you have been known to on a rare occasion play drunk?

1:28:16.640 --> 1:28:22.360
 Is there a mathematical formula for sort of on the X axis, how many drinks you had and

1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:26.800
 then the Y axis, your performance slash creativity?

1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:31.640
 Is there like an optimal for like one of, would you suggest for the Fede world championship

1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:34.120
 that people would be required to drink?

1:28:34.120 --> 1:28:36.240
 Would that change things in interesting ways?

1:28:36.240 --> 1:28:38.600
 Yeah, not at all.

1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:45.720
 Maybe for rapid, but for Blitz, think if you're playing Blitz, you're mostly playing on short

1:28:45.720 --> 1:28:47.480
 calculation and intuition.

1:28:47.480 --> 1:28:54.320
 I think those are probably enhanced if you've had a little bit of a little bit to drink.

1:28:54.320 --> 1:29:02.520
 Can you explain the physiology of why that's why it's enhanced or the you're just you're

1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:03.520
 thinking less.

1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:04.520
 You're more confident.

1:29:04.520 --> 1:29:05.520
 Oh, yeah.

1:29:05.520 --> 1:29:07.760
 I think I think it's just confidence.

1:29:07.760 --> 1:29:14.720
 I think also like a lot of people feel like they're better at speaking languages.

1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:19.920
 For instance, if they've drunk a little bit, it's just like removing these barriers.

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:25.360
 I think that it's a little bit of the same in chess.

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:33.000
 In 2012, I played the world Blitz championship and then I was doing horribly for a long time.

1:29:33.000 --> 1:29:34.840
 I also had food poisoning there.

1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:37.640
 I couldn't play at all for three days.

1:29:37.640 --> 1:29:47.200
 Before the last break, I was in the middle of the pack in 20th place or something.

1:29:47.200 --> 1:29:56.160
 I decided as the last gasp, I'm going to go to the mini bar and just have a few drinks.

1:29:56.160 --> 1:30:02.320
 What happened is that I came back and I was suddenly relaxed and I was playing fast and

1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:03.320
 I was playing confidence.

1:30:03.320 --> 1:30:05.600
 I thought I was playing so well.

1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:10.240
 I wasn't playing nearly as well as I thought, but it still helped me.

1:30:10.240 --> 1:30:15.120
 I won my remaining eight games and if there had been one more round, I probably would

1:30:15.120 --> 1:30:18.320
 have won the whole thing, but finally I was second.

1:30:18.320 --> 1:30:23.440
 Generally, I wouldn't recommend that, but maybe as the last resort sometimes.

1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:29.840
 If you feel that you have the ability, obviously none of this is remotely relevant if you don't

1:30:29.840 --> 1:30:32.400
 feel like you have the ability to begin with.

1:30:32.400 --> 1:30:39.400
 If you feel like you have the ability, there are just factors that make it impossible for

1:30:39.400 --> 1:30:42.520
 you to show it.

1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:45.040
 Norming your mind a bit can probably be a good thing.

1:30:45.040 --> 1:30:46.040
 Yeah.

1:30:46.040 --> 1:30:47.040
 Well, it's interesting.

1:30:47.040 --> 1:30:51.280
 Especially during training, you have all kinds of sports that have interacted with a lot

1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:54.880
 of athletes in grappling sports.

1:30:54.880 --> 1:30:57.120
 It's different when you train under extreme exhaustion.

1:30:57.120 --> 1:31:01.520
 For example, you start becoming, you start to discover interesting things.

1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:02.520
 You start being more creative.

1:31:02.520 --> 1:31:03.520
 Yeah.

1:31:03.520 --> 1:31:10.120
 A lot of people, at least in Brazilian jiu jitsu, they'll smoke weed.

1:31:10.120 --> 1:31:16.120
 It creates this kind of anxiety and relaxation that enables that creative aspect.

1:31:16.120 --> 1:31:17.440
 It's interesting for training.

1:31:17.440 --> 1:31:21.920
 Of course, you can't rely on any one of those things too much, but it's cool to throw in

1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:30.600
 a few drinks every once in a while to relax and have fun and two, to try things differently,

1:31:30.600 --> 1:31:32.480
 to unlock a different part of your brain.

1:31:32.480 --> 1:31:33.480
 Yeah, for sure.

1:31:33.480 --> 1:31:35.880
 What about supplements?

1:31:35.880 --> 1:31:38.360
 Do you a coffee guy?

1:31:38.360 --> 1:31:40.640
 Oh, no.

1:31:40.640 --> 1:31:48.920
 I quite like the taste of coffee, but the thing is I've never had a job, so I've never

1:31:48.920 --> 1:31:51.680
 needed to wake up early.

1:31:51.680 --> 1:31:55.880
 My thought is basically that if I'm tired, I'm tired.

1:31:55.880 --> 1:31:57.040
 That's fine.

1:31:57.040 --> 1:32:01.640
 Then I'll work it out.

1:32:01.640 --> 1:32:09.120
 So I don't want to ever make my brain get used to coffee.

1:32:09.120 --> 1:32:19.080
 If you see me drinking coffee, that probably means that I'm massively hungover.

1:32:19.080 --> 1:32:24.240
 I just want to try anything to make my brain work.

1:32:24.240 --> 1:32:25.240
 Yeah, that's interesting.

1:32:25.240 --> 1:32:27.360
 So for a lot of people, like you said, taste of coffee.

1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:33.000
 For a lot of people, coffee is part of a certain kind of ritual that they enjoy.

1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:39.800
 So I know that I would enjoy it a lot, but you don't want to rely on that.

1:32:39.800 --> 1:32:44.400
 I also like the taste, so there's no problem there.

1:32:44.400 --> 1:32:48.840
 What about exercise?

1:32:48.840 --> 1:32:51.800
 How does that work?

1:32:51.800 --> 1:32:59.440
 A lot of people talk about the extreme stress that chest puts in your body physically and

1:32:59.440 --> 1:33:00.440
 mentally.

1:33:00.440 --> 1:33:02.920
 How do you prepare for that to be physically and mentally?

1:33:02.920 --> 1:33:07.440
 Is it just through playing chess or do you do cardio and any of that kind of stuff?

1:33:07.440 --> 1:33:09.720
 This is going to be up and down.

1:33:09.720 --> 1:33:15.960
 As I said in 2013, I was in great shape.

1:33:15.960 --> 1:33:24.880
 Generally, I was exercising doing sports every day, either playing football or tennis or

1:33:24.880 --> 1:33:32.720
 even other sports, otherwise, if I couldn't do that, I would try and take my bike for

1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:33.960
 a ride.

1:33:33.960 --> 1:33:39.480
 I had a few training camps and I played tennis against one of my seconds.

1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:43.800
 He's not a super fit guy, but he's always been very good at tennis.

1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:53.360
 I never played in any organized way, and that was the perfect exercise because I was running

1:33:53.360 --> 1:34:01.160
 around enough to make the games pretty competitive, and it meant that he had to run a bit less

1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:02.160
 as well.

1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:12.920
 But he said he was shocked that if we played for two hours, I wouldn't flinch at all.

1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:13.920
 Interesting.

1:34:13.920 --> 1:34:22.480
 So, like a combination of fun and the differential between skill, result in good cardio.

1:34:22.480 --> 1:34:29.080
 It's just that, so in those days, I was pretty fit in that sense.

1:34:29.080 --> 1:34:36.480
 I've always liked doing sports, but at times, I think in winter especially, I never had

1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:37.480
 a schedule.

1:34:37.480 --> 1:34:45.400
 So, at times, I let myself go a little bit, and I've always kind of done it more for fun

1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:48.560
 than for a concrete benefit.

1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:54.720
 But now, at least after the pandemic, I was not in great shape, so now I'm trying to get

1:34:54.720 --> 1:35:00.320
 back, get better habits and so on.

1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:11.840
 I feel like I've always been the poster boy for making being fit a big thing in chess,

1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:17.280
 and I always felt that it was not really a dessert because I never liked doing weights

1:35:17.280 --> 1:35:19.880
 much at all.

1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:24.040
 I run a bit at times, but I never liked it too much.

1:35:24.040 --> 1:35:25.280
 You just love playing sports.

1:35:25.280 --> 1:35:33.560
 So, I think people confuse that because I'm not like massively athletic, but I am decent

1:35:33.560 --> 1:35:41.640
 at sports, and that sort of helped build that perception, even though others who are top

1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:51.040
 level chess players, they're more fit, like Karana for instance, his body is really, really

1:35:51.040 --> 1:35:52.040
 strong.

1:35:52.040 --> 1:35:53.040
 It's just that he doesn't...

1:35:53.040 --> 1:35:54.040
 He goes to the gym and...

1:35:54.040 --> 1:35:55.040
 Yeah.

1:35:55.040 --> 1:35:57.560
 So, sports, that's the difference.

1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:02.760
 And the thing about sports is also it's an escape.

1:36:02.760 --> 1:36:09.280
 It helps you forget for a brief moment about the obsessions, the pursuits of the main thing,

1:36:09.280 --> 1:36:10.280
 which is chess.

1:36:10.280 --> 1:36:12.440
 Yeah, for sure.

1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:21.200
 And I think it also helps your main pursuit to feel that you're even not mastering, but

1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:25.400
 doing well in something else.

1:36:25.400 --> 1:36:32.360
 I found that if I just juggle a ball, that makes me feel better before a game.

1:36:32.360 --> 1:36:34.560
 So, a skilled activity...

1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:35.560
 Like a juggle of football.

1:36:35.560 --> 1:36:36.560
 Yeah.

1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:42.480
 A skilled activity that you can improve on over time, it flexes the same kind of muscle,

1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:46.840
 but on the thing that you're much worse at, it focuses you, relaxes you.

1:36:46.840 --> 1:36:48.560
 That's really interesting.

1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:53.360
 What's the perfect day in the life of Magnus Carlsen when he's training?

1:36:53.360 --> 1:37:00.240
 So, what's a good training regimen in terms of daily training that you have to put in

1:37:00.240 --> 1:37:07.080
 across many days, months, and years to just keep yourself sharp in terms of chess?

1:37:07.080 --> 1:37:12.200
 I would say when I'm at home, I do very little deliberate practice.

1:37:12.200 --> 1:37:14.600
 I've never been that guy at all.

1:37:14.600 --> 1:37:18.960
 I could never force myself to just sit down and work.

1:37:18.960 --> 1:37:22.560
 So deliberate practice, just so maybe you can educate me.

1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:25.680
 For some grandmasters, what would that look like?

1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:27.760
 Just doing puzzles kind of thing?

1:37:27.760 --> 1:37:33.400
 Yeah, doing puzzles and opening analysis, that would be the main things.

1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:34.400
 Studying games?

1:37:34.400 --> 1:37:38.920
 Just studying games, yeah, a little bit.

1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:44.440
 But I feel like that's something that I do, but it's not deliberate.

1:37:44.440 --> 1:37:48.040
 It's like reading our article or reading a book.

1:37:48.040 --> 1:37:49.040
 Got it.

1:37:49.040 --> 1:37:50.040
 I love chess books.

1:37:50.040 --> 1:37:54.600
 I'll read just anything, and I'll find something interesting.

1:37:54.600 --> 1:37:59.880
 So chess books that are on openings and stuff like that, or chess books that go over different

1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:00.880
 games?

1:38:00.880 --> 1:38:05.640
 Yeah, books on, so there are three main categories.

1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:08.800
 There are books on openings, and there are books on strategy, and there are books on

1:38:08.800 --> 1:38:12.960
 chess history, and I find all of them very, very interesting.

1:38:12.960 --> 1:38:17.160
 What fraction of the day would you say you have a chessboard floating somewhere in your

1:38:17.160 --> 1:38:21.680
 head, meaning you're thinking about it?

1:38:21.680 --> 1:38:23.720
 Probably be a better question to ask.

1:38:23.720 --> 1:38:24.720
 How many hours a day?

1:38:24.720 --> 1:38:28.600
 I don't have a chessboard floating in my head.

1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:32.960
 I mean, it could be just floating there and nothing is happening, but you're like...

1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:35.960
 I often do it parallel to some other activity, though.

1:38:35.960 --> 1:38:37.240
 And what does that look like?

1:38:37.240 --> 1:38:39.960
 Are you daydreaming different?

1:38:39.960 --> 1:38:44.240
 Is it actual positions you're just fucking around with, fumbling with different pieces

1:38:44.240 --> 1:38:46.080
 in your head?

1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:52.640
 Often I've looked at a random game on my phone, for instance, or in a book, and then my brain

1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:58.240
 just keeps going at the same position, analyzing it, and often it goes all the way to the end

1:38:58.240 --> 1:38:59.240
 game.

1:38:59.240 --> 1:39:00.240
 And those are actual games?

1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:01.840
 Or you conjure up fake games?

1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:07.520
 No, they were often based on real games, and then I'm thinking like, oh, but it wouldn't

1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:11.760
 be more interesting if the pieces were a little bit different, and then often I play it out

1:39:11.760 --> 1:39:12.760
 from there.

1:39:12.760 --> 1:39:15.560
 So you don't have a...

1:39:15.560 --> 1:39:21.560
 You don't sit behind a computer or a chessboard, and you lay out the pieces, and then you're...

1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:24.960
 No, I'm not at all a poster board for deliberate practice.

1:39:24.960 --> 1:39:27.720
 I could never work that way.

1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:36.120
 My first coach, he gave me some exercises during home sometimes, but he realized at

1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:44.360
 some point that wasn't going to work, because I wouldn't do it really or enjoy it.

1:39:44.360 --> 1:39:50.160
 So what he would do instead is that at the school where I had the trainings with him,

1:39:50.160 --> 1:39:56.880
 there was this massive chess library, so he was just like, yeah, pick out books.

1:39:56.880 --> 1:40:02.280
 You can have anything you want, just pick out books you like, and then you give it back

1:40:02.280 --> 1:40:03.520
 the next time.

1:40:03.520 --> 1:40:05.240
 So that's what I did instead.

1:40:05.240 --> 1:40:08.360
 Yeah, I just absolutely rated them.

1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:13.000
 Then my next tournament, I will try out one of the openings from that book if it was an

1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:14.560
 opening book and so on.

1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:17.800
 Does it feel like a struggle, like challenging?

1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:20.840
 Like to be thinking of those positions, or is it fun and relaxing?

1:40:20.840 --> 1:40:22.360
 No, it's completely fine.

1:40:22.360 --> 1:40:23.360
 I don't...

1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:27.760
 Like if it's a difficult position to figure out, you know, like to calculate...

1:40:27.760 --> 1:40:30.520
 Then I go on to something else.

1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:35.520
 Like if I can't figure it out, then, you know, I go on.

1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:37.800
 Change it so that it's easier to figure out.

1:40:37.800 --> 1:40:43.200
 There was a point in your life where Kasparov was interested in being your coach, or training

1:40:43.200 --> 1:40:44.200
 with you.

1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:45.640
 Why did you choose not to go with him?

1:40:45.640 --> 1:40:47.880
 That's a pretty bold move.

1:40:47.880 --> 1:40:50.040
 Was there a good reason for this?

1:40:50.040 --> 1:40:51.680
 No.

1:40:51.680 --> 1:40:56.760
 The first homework exercise he gave me was to analyze.

1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:01.960
 He picked out, I think, three or four of my worst losses, and he wanted me to analyze

1:41:01.960 --> 1:41:08.200
 them and give him my thoughts, and it wasn't that there were painful losses or anything

1:41:08.200 --> 1:41:10.480
 that that was a problem.

1:41:10.480 --> 1:41:14.560
 I just didn't really enjoy that.

1:41:14.560 --> 1:41:21.880
 Also I felt that this whole structured approach and everything, I just felt like from the

1:41:21.880 --> 1:41:23.640
 start it was a hassle.

1:41:23.640 --> 1:41:29.320
 So I loved the idea of being able to pick his brain with everything else.

1:41:29.320 --> 1:41:37.760
 I just, you know, couldn't see myself, couldn't see myself enjoying.

1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:42.320
 At the end of the day, I did then and always have played for fun.

1:41:42.320 --> 1:41:45.240
 That's always been the main reason.

1:41:45.240 --> 1:41:50.720
 It's great that you had the confidence to sort of basically turn down the approach of

1:41:50.720 --> 1:41:54.320
 one of the greatest chess players of all time, at that time probably the greatest chess

1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:55.320
 player of all time.

1:41:55.320 --> 1:41:58.120
 I don't think I thought of it that way.

1:41:58.120 --> 1:42:00.040
 I just thought this is not for me.

1:42:00.040 --> 1:42:01.600
 I wouldn't try another way.

1:42:01.600 --> 1:42:06.200
 I don't think I was particularly thinking that this is my one opportunity or anything.

1:42:06.200 --> 1:42:08.400
 It was just, yeah, I don't enjoy this.

1:42:08.400 --> 1:42:09.640
 Let's try something else.

1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:15.680
 When you were 13, you faced Kasparov, and he wasn't able to beat you.

1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:17.040
 Can you go through that match?

1:42:17.040 --> 1:42:18.040
 What did that feel like?

1:42:18.040 --> 1:42:19.040
 How important was that?

1:42:19.040 --> 1:42:21.040
 How epic was that?

1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:22.640
 We played three games.

1:42:22.640 --> 1:42:25.280
 I lost two and I drew one.

1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:26.280
 Right.

1:42:26.280 --> 1:42:27.280
 But one draw.

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:29.360
 No, the one draw.

1:42:29.360 --> 1:42:32.760
 And didn't you say that you kind of had a better position in that?

1:42:32.760 --> 1:42:35.040
 Yeah, I remember that day very well.

1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:36.560
 There was a Blitz game.

1:42:36.560 --> 1:42:38.480
 This was a rapid tournament.

1:42:38.480 --> 1:42:46.040
 And there was a Blitz tournament the day before, which determined the pairings for the rapids.

1:42:46.040 --> 1:42:50.160
 For people who don't know, super short games are called bullet, kind of short games are

1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:56.200
 called Blitz, semi short games are called rapids.

1:42:56.200 --> 1:42:59.560
 And classic chess, I guess, is very super long.

1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:03.360
 Yeah, basically, bullet is never played over the board.

1:43:03.360 --> 1:43:06.960
 So in terms over the board chess, Blitz is the shortest.

1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:11.320
 Rapid is like a hybrid between classical and Blitz.

1:43:11.320 --> 1:43:12.880
 You need to have the skills of both.

1:43:12.880 --> 1:43:16.000
 And then classical is the Blitz tournament.

1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:18.640
 Which didn't go so well.

1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:24.240
 Like I got a couple of wins, but I was beaten badly in a lot of games, including by Gary.

1:43:24.240 --> 1:43:28.800
 And so there was the pairing that I had to play him, which is pretty exciting.

1:43:28.800 --> 1:43:34.520
 So I remember I was so tired after the Blitz tournament, like I slept for 12 hours or something.

1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:41.720
 Then I woke up like, okay, I'll turn on my computer, I'll search chess space for Kasparov.

1:43:41.720 --> 1:43:44.400
 And we'll go from there.

1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:49.200
 So before that, I hadn't spent like a lot of time specifically studying his games.

1:43:49.200 --> 1:43:55.120
 It was super intimidating because a lot of these openings I knew, I was like, oh, he

1:43:55.120 --> 1:43:56.840
 was the first one to play that.

1:43:56.840 --> 1:43:57.840
 Oh, that was his idea.

1:43:57.840 --> 1:43:59.800
 I actually didn't know that.

1:43:59.800 --> 1:44:02.680
 So I was a bit intimidated before we played.

1:44:02.680 --> 1:44:08.840
 Then of course, the first game, he arrived a bit late because they changed the time from

1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:13.240
 the first day to the other, which is a bit strange and everybody else have noticed it.

1:44:13.240 --> 1:44:17.680
 But him, then he tried to surprise me in the opening.

1:44:17.680 --> 1:44:22.360
 I think psychologically, the situation was not so easy for him, like clearly it would

1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:27.120
 be embarrassing for him if it didn't win both games against me.

1:44:27.120 --> 1:44:32.360
 Then I was spending way too much time on my moves because I was playing Kasparov, I was

1:44:32.360 --> 1:44:36.120
 double checking everything too much, like normally I would be playing pretty fast in

1:44:36.120 --> 1:44:37.680
 those days.

1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:42.360
 And then at some point, I calculated better than him.

1:44:42.360 --> 1:44:46.640
 He missed a crucial detail and had a much better position.

1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:47.920
 I couldn't convert it though.

1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:54.240
 I knew what line I had to go for in order to have a chance to win, but I thought like,

1:44:54.240 --> 1:44:55.960
 I'll play a bit more carefully.

1:44:55.960 --> 1:44:56.960
 Maybe I can win still.

1:44:56.960 --> 1:44:58.600
 I couldn't.

1:44:58.600 --> 1:45:05.920
 And then I lost the second game pretty badly, which it wasn't majorly upsetting, but I felt

1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:10.200
 that I had two black games against Kasparov both in the Blitz and Thrap it and I lost

1:45:10.200 --> 1:45:12.760
 both of them without any fight whatsoever.

1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:14.720
 I wasn't happy about that at all.

1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:19.200
 That was like less than I thought I could be able to do.

1:45:19.200 --> 1:45:25.880
 So to me, yeah, I was proud of that, but it was a gimmick.

1:45:25.880 --> 1:45:30.640
 I was like a very strong IM that had GM's strength.

1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:36.960
 I was like, it can happen that a player of that strength makes a draw against Gary once

1:45:36.960 --> 1:45:37.960
 in a while.

1:45:37.960 --> 1:45:44.640
 But I mean, I understand I'm 13, but like, still I felt a bit more gimmicky than anything.

1:45:44.640 --> 1:45:48.960
 I mean, I guess it's a good thing that made me noticed.

1:45:48.960 --> 1:45:51.840
 But apart from that, it wasn't.

1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:56.800
 And for people who don't know, IM is international master and GM is grandmaster and you were

1:45:56.800 --> 1:46:01.240
 just on the verge of becoming a youngest grandmaster ever.

1:46:01.240 --> 1:46:03.880
 I was the second youngest ever.

1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:06.120
 I think I'm like the seventh youngest now.

1:46:06.120 --> 1:46:12.480
 I mean, these kids, these days, kids, these days, yeah, yeah, no, but, uh, but I was the

1:46:12.480 --> 1:46:16.240
 youngest grandmaster at the time in the world.

1:46:16.240 --> 1:46:17.240
 Yeah.

1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:23.360
 So there is a, you know, you say it's gimmicky, but there's a romantic notion is the, especially

1:46:23.360 --> 1:46:25.920
 as things have turned out, right?

1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:27.640
 Like, no, for sure.

1:46:27.640 --> 1:46:30.520
 And have you talked to Gary at since then about that?

1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:31.520
 No, not really.

1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:34.040
 I don't, I think he's embarrassed about it.

1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:35.040
 He's still bitter, you think?

1:46:35.040 --> 1:46:40.440
 No, I don't think it's his bitter, but I think the game in itself was, was a bit embarrassing

1:46:40.440 --> 1:46:41.440
 for him.

1:46:41.440 --> 1:46:47.680
 Uh, so even he can't see past, like, I think he's completely fine with that.

1:46:47.680 --> 1:46:51.160
 I think like in retrospect, it's a good story.

1:46:51.160 --> 1:46:53.280
 He appreciates, he appreciates that.

1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:57.000
 I don't think that's the problem, but it never made sense for me to broach the subject

1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:58.000
 with him.

1:46:58.000 --> 1:46:59.000
 Yeah.

1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:05.120
 It's just, it's funny just having interacted with Gary, now having talked to you, there

1:47:05.120 --> 1:47:08.680
 is a little thing you still hate losing.

1:47:08.680 --> 1:47:13.800
 No matter how beautiful like that moment is, because it's like, in a way, it's a passing

1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:16.880
 of the baton from like one great champion to another.

1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:17.880
 Yeah.

1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:18.880
 Right?

1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:21.600
 But like, you still just don't like the fact that you didn't play a good game from a Gary

1:47:21.600 --> 1:47:22.600
 Gary's perspective.

1:47:22.600 --> 1:47:27.480
 Like, he's still just annoyed probably that you could have played better.

1:47:27.480 --> 1:47:33.920
 And we did, so we did work together in 2009, quite a lot.

1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:42.400
 And that corporation ended early 2010, but we did play a lot of training games in 2009,

1:47:42.400 --> 1:47:47.480
 which was interesting because he was still a very, very strong.

1:47:47.480 --> 1:47:51.960
 And at that time it was fairly equal, like he was at playing me quite a bit, but I was,

1:47:51.960 --> 1:47:52.960
 I was fighting well.

1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:57.400
 So it was, it was pretty, pretty even then.

1:47:57.400 --> 1:48:02.360
 So I mean, I appreciate those games a lot more than some random game from when I was

1:48:02.360 --> 1:48:03.720
 13.

1:48:03.720 --> 1:48:11.840
 And I, maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about, but I always found it, at least based

1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:16.360
 on that game, you couldn't tell that I was going to take his, that I was going to take

1:48:16.360 --> 1:48:17.360
 his spot.

1:48:17.360 --> 1:48:24.120
 Like I made a horrible blunder and lost to an Uzbek kid in the world rapid championship

1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:29.040
 in, in 2018.

1:48:29.040 --> 1:48:33.040
 And I mean, granted, he was part of the team that now won gold in the Chess Olympia, but

1:48:33.040 --> 1:48:34.280
 he wasn't the crucial part.

1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:35.800
 He barely played any games.

1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:39.080
 Like it wasn't like I would think that he would become world champion because he beat

1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:40.080
 me.

1:48:40.080 --> 1:48:44.480
 I'm always skeptical of those who said that they knew that I was going to be world champion

1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:48.280
 after, after that game or at all at that time.

1:48:48.280 --> 1:48:53.120
 I mean, it was easy to see that I would become a very, very strong player.

1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:57.320
 You couldn't see that, but to be the best in the world or one of the best ever.

1:48:57.320 --> 1:48:58.320
 It's true.

1:48:58.320 --> 1:48:59.320
 That's hard to say.

1:48:59.320 --> 1:49:05.440
 It's, it is hard to say, but I do remember seeing Messi when he was 16 and 17.

1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:07.640
 But hasn't that happened with other players though?

1:49:07.640 --> 1:49:11.040
 Yeah, but I, I personally, I just had a personal experience.

1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:15.000
 He did look different than there's like magic there.

1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:19.720
 Maybe you can't tell he would be one of the greatest ever, but there's, there's still

1:49:19.720 --> 1:49:20.720
 magic.

1:49:20.720 --> 1:49:21.720
 But you're right.

1:49:21.720 --> 1:49:26.160
 You're trying to project, we see a young kid being an older person and you start to

1:49:26.160 --> 1:49:30.040
 think, okay, this could be the next great person, then we forget when they don't become

1:49:30.040 --> 1:49:31.040
 that.

1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:32.040
 Yeah, exactly.

1:49:32.040 --> 1:49:33.040
 That's, I think what happens.

1:49:33.040 --> 1:49:39.200
 But when it does become, or maybe some people are just so good at seeing these patterns

1:49:39.200 --> 1:49:40.200
 that they can actually see.

1:49:40.200 --> 1:49:42.600
 Aren't you supposed to do that kind of thing with fantasy football?

1:49:42.600 --> 1:49:46.200
 Like see the long shot and bet on them and then they turn out to be good?

1:49:46.200 --> 1:49:51.600
 No, you make a lot of, a lot of long shot bets and then some of them come good.

1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:54.320
 And then people call you a genius for making the bet.

1:49:54.320 --> 1:49:59.400
 Well, let me ask you the goat question again, from fantasy perspective.

1:49:59.400 --> 1:50:06.280
 Can you make the case for the greatest chess player of all time for each yourself, Magnus

1:50:06.280 --> 1:50:11.760
 Carlson, for Garrick Asparov, I don't know who else, Bobby Fisher, Mikhail Tal, anyone

1:50:11.760 --> 1:50:16.560
 else for Hikaru Nakamura?

1:50:16.560 --> 1:50:17.560
 Just kidding.

1:50:17.560 --> 1:50:25.720
 I think I can make a case for myself, for Gary and for Fisher, so I'll start with Fisher.

1:50:25.720 --> 1:50:30.440
 For him, it's very, very simple.

1:50:30.440 --> 1:50:33.720
 He was ahead of his time, but that's like intangible.

1:50:33.720 --> 1:50:36.000
 You can say that about a lot of people.

1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:44.560
 But he had a peak from 1970 to 72 when he was so much better than the others.

1:50:44.560 --> 1:50:47.040
 He won 20 games in a row.

1:50:47.040 --> 1:50:53.640
 Until the way that he played was so powerful and with so few mistakes that he just had

1:50:53.640 --> 1:50:54.960
 no position there.

1:50:54.960 --> 1:51:00.960
 So he had just a peak that's been better than anybody.

1:51:00.960 --> 1:51:01.960
 The gap between first and second was high.

1:51:01.960 --> 1:51:08.600
 The gap between him and others was greater than it's ever been in history at any other

1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:12.960
 time and that would be the argument for him.

1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:21.520
 For Gary, he's played in a very competitive era and he's beaten several generations.

1:51:21.520 --> 1:51:29.640
 He was the best, well, he was the consensus best player, I would say for almost 20 years,

1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:39.920
 which nobody else has done, at least in recent time, and the longevity, for sure.

1:51:39.920 --> 1:51:47.960
 Also at his peak, he was not quite the level of Fisher in terms of the gap, but it was

1:51:47.960 --> 1:51:53.000
 similar to or I think even a little bit better than mine.

1:51:53.000 --> 1:52:00.160
 As for me, I'm of course unbeaten as a world champion in five tries.

1:52:00.160 --> 1:52:07.640
 I've been world number one for 11 years straight in an even more competitive era than Gary.

1:52:07.640 --> 1:52:09.960
 I have the highest chest rating of all time.

1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:15.280
 I have the longest streak ever without losing a game.

1:52:15.280 --> 1:52:23.480
 I think for me, the main argument would be about the era where the engines have leveled

1:52:23.480 --> 1:52:31.280
 the playing field so much that it's harder to dominate and still, I haven't always been

1:52:31.280 --> 1:52:36.960
 a clear number one, but I've been number one for 11 years and for a lot of the time,

1:52:36.960 --> 1:52:39.560
 the gap has been pretty big.

1:52:39.560 --> 1:52:43.320
 So I think there are decent arguments for all of them.

1:52:43.320 --> 1:52:48.400
 I've said before and I haven't changed my mind that Gary generally edges it because

1:52:48.400 --> 1:52:55.160
 of the longevity in the competitive era, but there are arguments.

1:52:55.160 --> 1:52:59.800
 People also talk about you in terms of the style of play, so it's not just about dominance

1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:04.760
 or the height, it's just the creative genius of it.

1:53:04.760 --> 1:53:08.920
 Yeah, but I'm not interested in that.

1:53:08.920 --> 1:53:16.840
 In terms of greatest of all time, I'm not interested in questions of style.

1:53:16.840 --> 1:53:21.600
 So for Messi, you don't give credit for the style, for the stylistic games?

1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:24.400
 I like watching it.

1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:27.360
 But you're not going to give points for the...

1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:31.200
 So Messi gets best ever because of the finishing?

1:53:31.200 --> 1:53:37.440
 No, it's not because of the finishing, it's because of his overall impact on the game

1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:41.400
 that's higher than anybody else's.

1:53:41.400 --> 1:53:48.880
 He contributes more to winning than anybody else does.

1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:53.840
 You're somebody who is advocated for and has done quite a bit of study of classic games.

1:53:53.840 --> 1:54:03.720
 What would you say is the number one or maybe top three games of chess ever played?

1:54:03.720 --> 1:54:04.920
 It doesn't interest me at all.

1:54:04.920 --> 1:54:05.920
 You don't think of the nose?

1:54:05.920 --> 1:54:06.920
 No, I don't think of it.

1:54:06.920 --> 1:54:08.240
 I mean, I try to...

1:54:08.240 --> 1:54:12.960
 I find the games interesting, I try to learn from them, but trying to rank them has never

1:54:12.960 --> 1:54:13.960
 interested me.

1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:17.480
 What games pop out to you that's super interesting then?

1:54:17.480 --> 1:54:27.640
 Is there things like old school games where there's interesting ideas that you go back...

1:54:27.640 --> 1:54:32.440
 Or you find surprising and pretty cool that those ideas were developed back then.

1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:36.160
 Is there something that jumps to the mind?

1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:43.360
 There are several games of Young Kasparov before he became world champion.

1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:47.880
 If you're going to ask for my favorite player or favorite style, that's probably...

1:54:47.880 --> 1:54:48.880
 Young Kasparov.

1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:49.880
 Young Kasparov.

1:54:49.880 --> 1:54:55.880
 Can you describe, statistically, or in any other way, what Young Kasparov was like that

1:54:55.880 --> 1:54:56.880
 you like?

1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:00.040
 It was just an overflow energy in his play.

1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:02.120
 So aggressive attacking chess.

1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:04.400
 Extremely aggressive dynamic chess.

1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:13.320
 It probably appeals to me a lot because these are the things that I cannot do as well.

1:55:13.320 --> 1:55:15.880
 That it just feels very special to me.

1:55:15.880 --> 1:55:23.240
 But yeah, in terms of games, I never thought about that too much.

1:55:23.240 --> 1:55:29.520
 Is there memories big or small, weird, surprising?

1:55:29.520 --> 1:55:35.200
 Just any kind of beautiful anecdote from your chess career, like stuff that pops out that

1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:39.440
 people might not know about, just stuff when you look back and just makes you smile?

1:55:39.440 --> 1:55:48.480
 No, so I'll tell you about the most satisfying tournament victory of my career.

1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:52.800
 So that was the Norwegian Championship under 11 in 2000.

1:55:52.800 --> 1:56:00.000
 Before that tournament, I was super anxious because I started kind of late at chess.

1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:04.280
 I played my first tournament when I was eight and a half, and a lot of my competitors had

1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:10.800
 already played for a couple of years, or even three, four years at that point.

1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:16.520
 And the first time, so I played the under 11 championship in 1999, that was like a little

1:56:16.520 --> 1:56:17.960
 over the middle of the pack.

1:56:17.960 --> 1:56:22.240
 I'd never played against any of them before, so I didn't know what to expect at all.

1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:26.760
 And then over the next year, I was just like edging a little bit closer.

1:56:26.760 --> 1:56:30.320
 In each tournament, I felt like I was getting a little bit better.

1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:36.720
 And when we had the championship, I knew that I was ready, that I was now at the same level

1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:38.720
 of the best players.

1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:41.160
 I was so anxious to show it.

1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:46.680
 I remember I was just, the feeling of excitement and nervousness before the tournament was

1:56:46.680 --> 1:56:47.920
 incredible.

1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:56.400
 The tournament was weird because I started out, I gave away a draw to a weaker player,

1:56:56.400 --> 1:56:58.040
 whom I shouldn't have drawn to.

1:56:58.040 --> 1:57:06.320
 And then I drew against the other guy, who was clearly like the best or the second best.

1:57:06.320 --> 1:57:11.440
 And at that point, I thought it was over, because I thought he wouldn't give away points

1:57:11.440 --> 1:57:12.940
 to others.

1:57:12.940 --> 1:57:16.280
 And then the very next day, he lost to somebody.

1:57:16.280 --> 1:57:20.840
 So the rest of the tournament, it was just like, I was always like playing my game and

1:57:20.840 --> 1:57:22.240
 watching his.

1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:27.240
 And we both won the rest of our games, but it meant that I was half a point ahead.

1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:34.320
 Like the feeling when I realized that I was going to win, that was just so amazing.

1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:42.000
 It was like the first time that I was the best at my age.

1:57:42.000 --> 1:57:44.360
 And at that point, you were hooked.

1:57:44.360 --> 1:57:45.360
 Yeah.

1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:49.920
 At that point, I realized, you know, this, I could actually be very good at this.

1:57:49.920 --> 1:57:53.760
 So you kind of saw, what did you think your ceiling would be?

1:57:53.760 --> 1:57:54.760
 Did you see that?

1:57:54.760 --> 1:57:57.440
 Did you see that one day you could be the number one?

1:57:57.440 --> 1:57:58.440
 No, I didn't.

1:57:58.440 --> 1:58:01.400
 I didn't think that was possible at all.

1:58:01.400 --> 1:58:02.400
 But when did you first?

1:58:02.400 --> 1:58:05.360
 I thought that could be the best in Norway.

1:58:05.360 --> 1:58:06.360
 The best in Norway.

1:58:06.360 --> 1:58:07.360
 At that point.

1:58:07.360 --> 1:58:08.360
 When did you?

1:58:08.360 --> 1:58:16.120
 Because like I started relatively late and also like, I knew that I studied a lot more

1:58:16.120 --> 1:58:17.120
 than the others.

1:58:17.120 --> 1:58:19.920
 I knew that I had a passion that they didn't have.

1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:26.680
 They saw chess as something like, it was, you know, it was a hobby.

1:58:26.680 --> 1:58:27.920
 It was like an activity.

1:58:27.920 --> 1:58:34.160
 It was like, it was like going to, to football practice or any other sports.

1:58:34.160 --> 1:58:38.840
 Like you go, you practice like once or twice a week, and then you play a tournament at

1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:39.840
 the weekend.

1:58:39.840 --> 1:58:41.240
 That's, that's what you did.

1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:42.640
 For me, it wasn't like that.

1:58:42.640 --> 1:58:49.520
 Like I would go with my books and my board every day after school.

1:58:49.520 --> 1:58:55.600
 And I wouldn't, I would just constantly be trying to learn new things.

1:58:55.600 --> 1:59:02.120
 I had like two hours of internet time on the computer each week.

1:59:02.120 --> 1:59:05.720
 And I would always spend them on, on chess.

1:59:05.720 --> 1:59:17.400
 Like I think before I was 13 or 14, I'd never opened a browser for any other reason than

1:59:17.400 --> 1:59:19.960
 to play chess.

1:59:19.960 --> 1:59:24.680
 Would you describe that as love or as obsession or something in between?

1:59:24.680 --> 1:59:25.680
 It's everything.

1:59:25.680 --> 1:59:26.680
 Yeah.

1:59:26.680 --> 1:59:27.680
 Everything.

1:59:27.680 --> 1:59:33.800
 Well, but so, I mean, it wasn't hard for me to tell at that point that I had something

1:59:33.800 --> 1:59:41.000
 that the other, other kids didn't, because I was never the, the one to grasp something

1:59:41.000 --> 1:59:42.080
 very, very quickly.

1:59:42.080 --> 1:59:46.480
 But once I started, I always got hooked and then I never stopped learning.

1:59:46.480 --> 1:59:47.480
 What would you say?

1:59:47.480 --> 1:59:52.800
 You've talked about the middle game as a, as a place where you can play pure chess.

1:59:52.800 --> 1:59:56.400
 What do you think is beautiful to you about chess?

1:59:56.400 --> 1:59:58.800
 Like the thing when you were 11.

1:59:58.800 --> 2:00:04.240
 What is beautiful to me is when your opponent can predict every single one of your moves

2:00:04.240 --> 2:00:06.280
 and they still lose.

2:00:06.280 --> 2:00:07.280
 How does that happen?

2:00:07.280 --> 2:00:14.280
 No, like it means that at some point early, your planning, your evaluation has been better.

2:00:14.280 --> 2:00:17.240
 So that you play just very simply, very clearly.

2:00:17.240 --> 2:00:22.440
 It looks like you did nothing special and your opponent lost without a chance.

2:00:22.440 --> 2:00:24.840
 So you're, how do you think about that?

2:00:24.840 --> 2:00:29.600
 By the way, are you basically narrowing down this gigantic tree of options to where your

2:00:29.600 --> 2:00:35.120
 opponent has less and less and less options to win, to escape, and then they're trapped?

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:36.120
 Yeah.

2:00:36.120 --> 2:00:37.120
 That's it.

2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:38.120
 Essentially.

2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:43.600
 Is there some aspect to the patterns themselves, to the positions, to the elegance of like

2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:51.320
 the, the dynamics of the game that you just find beautiful that, that doesn't, that, well,

2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:53.000
 you forget about the opponent.

2:00:53.000 --> 2:00:58.400
 I, in general, I try and create harmony on the board.

2:00:58.400 --> 2:01:06.280
 Like what I would usually find harmonious is that the pieces work together, that they

2:01:06.280 --> 2:01:13.800
 protect each other, and that there are no pieces that are suboptimally placed.

2:01:13.800 --> 2:01:19.200
 Or if they are suboptimally placed, they can be improved pretty easily.

2:01:19.200 --> 2:01:26.080
 Like I hate when I have one piece that I know is badly placed and I cannot improve it.

2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:30.000
 When, yeah, when you're thinking about the harmony of the pieces, when you look at the

2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:36.960
 position you're evaluating it, are you looking at, at the whole board?

2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:43.920
 Or is it like a bunch of groupings of pieces overlapping and like dancing together kind

2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:44.920
 of thing?

2:01:44.920 --> 2:01:50.560
 I would say it's more of the latter that would be more precise that you look.

2:01:50.560 --> 2:01:58.040
 I mean, I look mostly closer to the middle, but then I would focus on one, like there

2:01:58.040 --> 2:02:03.920
 are usually like one grouping of pieces on one side and then some more closer to the

2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:04.920
 other side.

2:02:04.920 --> 2:02:08.400
 So I would, I would think of it a little bit that way.

2:02:08.400 --> 2:02:12.080
 So and everything's kind of gravitating to the middle?

2:02:12.080 --> 2:02:14.240
 If it's going well, then yes.

2:02:14.240 --> 2:02:15.240
 And in harmony.

2:02:15.240 --> 2:02:16.240
 Yeah.

2:02:16.240 --> 2:02:17.360
 In harmony.

2:02:17.360 --> 2:02:23.320
 Like if you can control the middle, you can more easily attack on both sides.

2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:26.840
 That applies to pretty much any game.

2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:27.840
 It's as simple as that.

2:02:27.840 --> 2:02:36.400
 And like attacking on one side without control of the middle would feel very nonharmonious

2:02:36.400 --> 2:02:37.720
 for me.

2:02:37.720 --> 2:02:44.720
 Like I talked about the 10th game and in the world championship, like that's the time I

2:02:44.720 --> 2:02:46.080
 was the most nervous.

2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:52.160
 And it was because it was a kind of attack that I hate where you just have to, you're

2:02:52.160 --> 2:02:57.720
 abandoned on one side and you, the attack has to work.

2:02:57.720 --> 2:03:02.640
 There was one side and part of the middle as well, which I didn't control at all.

2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:06.680
 That's like the opposite of harmony for me.

2:03:06.680 --> 2:03:14.760
 What advice would you give to chess players of different levels, how to improve in chess?

2:03:14.760 --> 2:03:18.920
 Very beginner, complete beginner, I mean, at every level, is there, is there something

2:03:18.920 --> 2:03:19.920
 you can?

2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:26.600
 It's very, very hard for me to say because I mean, the easiest way is like love chess,

2:03:26.600 --> 2:03:27.600
 be obsessed.

2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:32.040
 Well, that's a really important statement, but that doesn't work for everybody.

2:03:32.040 --> 2:03:34.720
 So I feel like it can feel like a grind.

2:03:34.720 --> 2:03:38.760
 So you're saying if the less it can feel like a grind, the better, the better.

2:03:38.760 --> 2:03:39.760
 Yeah, for sure.

2:03:39.760 --> 2:03:40.760
 At least for you.

2:03:40.760 --> 2:03:41.760
 That's for sure.

2:03:41.760 --> 2:03:49.880
 But I'm also very, very skeptical about giving advice because I think, again, my way of

2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:56.360
 it only works if you have some combination of talent and obsession.

2:03:56.360 --> 2:03:59.640
 So I'm not sure that I'd generally recommend it.

2:03:59.640 --> 2:04:06.520
 Like what I've done doesn't go with what most coaches suggest for their kids.

2:04:06.520 --> 2:04:11.720
 I've been lucky that I've had coaches from early on that have been very, very hands off

2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:16.200
 and just allowed me to do my thing basically.

2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:23.120
 But there's a lot to be said about cultivating the obsession, like really, really letting

2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:29.720
 that flourish to where you spend a lot of hours, like with the chessboard in your head

2:04:29.720 --> 2:04:31.880
 and it doesn't feel like a struggle.

2:04:31.880 --> 2:04:32.880
 No.

2:04:32.880 --> 2:04:37.760
 So like just letting me do my thing, like if you give me a bunch of work, it will probably

2:04:37.760 --> 2:04:38.760
 feel like a chore.

2:04:38.760 --> 2:04:44.000
 And if you don't give me, I will spend all of that time on my own without thinking that

2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:49.160
 it's work or without thought that I'm doing this to improve my chess.

2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:56.240
 Well, in terms of learning stuff like books, there's one thing that's relatively novel

2:04:56.240 --> 2:04:57.240
 from your perspective.

2:04:57.240 --> 2:04:58.840
 People are starting now as there's YouTube.

2:04:58.840 --> 2:05:01.120
 There's a lot of good YouTubers.

2:05:01.120 --> 2:05:03.160
 You're a part time YouTuber.

2:05:03.160 --> 2:05:04.560
 You have stuff on YouTube, I guess.

2:05:04.560 --> 2:05:05.560
 Yeah, I have.

2:05:05.560 --> 2:05:11.320
 But if you've seen my YouTube, it's mostly, it's not, it's definitely not high effort

2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:12.320
 content.

2:05:12.320 --> 2:05:13.320
 Yeah.

2:05:13.320 --> 2:05:17.560
 But do you like any particular YouTubers?

2:05:17.560 --> 2:05:19.560
 I could just recommend like stuff I've seen.

2:05:19.560 --> 2:05:25.040
 So Agad Matar, Gotham Chess, Botez Live.

2:05:25.040 --> 2:05:32.480
 I really like St. Louis Chess Club, Daniel Naroditsky and John Bartholomew, those are

2:05:32.480 --> 2:05:33.480
 good channels.

2:05:33.480 --> 2:05:34.480
 But is there something you can recommend?

2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:37.480
 No, all of them are good.

2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:45.600
 You know, the best recommendation I could give as Agad Matar, purely...

2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:47.240
 How much did he pay you to say that?

2:05:47.240 --> 2:05:53.080
 No, so the thing about that is that I haven't really, I have, so I can tell you I've never

2:05:53.080 --> 2:05:56.760
 watched any of his videos from start to finish.

2:05:56.760 --> 2:06:00.160
 I'm not like, I'm not the target audience, obviously.

2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:07.400
 But I think the only chess YouTube video that my dad has ever watched from start to finish

2:06:07.400 --> 2:06:08.920
 is Agad Matar.

2:06:08.920 --> 2:06:15.000
 And he said like, I watched one of his videos, I wanted to know what it was all about.

2:06:15.000 --> 2:06:20.560
 Because I think Agad Matar is like the same strength as my father, maybe just a little

2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:23.320
 bit weaker, like 1900 or something.

2:06:23.320 --> 2:06:26.000
 My father is probably about 2000.

2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.200
 And my father has played chess his whole life.

2:06:28.200 --> 2:06:30.240
 He loves, he absolutely loves the game.

2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:34.000
 It was like, that's the only time he's actually sat through one of those videos.

2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:35.840
 And he said like, yeah, I get it.

2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:36.840
 I enjoy it.

2:06:36.840 --> 2:06:39.560
 So that's the best recommendation I could give.

2:06:39.560 --> 2:06:43.160
 That's the only channel that my father actually enjoys.

2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:45.000
 This is hilarious.

2:06:45.000 --> 2:06:49.280
 I talked to him before this to ask him if he has any questions for you.

2:06:49.280 --> 2:06:52.040
 And he said, no, just do your thing, you know.

2:06:52.040 --> 2:06:53.480
 No, he's so careful.

2:06:53.480 --> 2:06:54.880
 He wouldn't do that.

2:06:54.880 --> 2:06:59.640
 He did mention jokingly about Evan's gambit, I think.

2:06:59.640 --> 2:07:00.640
 Is that a thing?

2:07:00.640 --> 2:07:01.640
 Evan's gambit?

2:07:01.640 --> 2:07:03.120
 It's some weird thing he made up.

2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:04.560
 It might be an inside joke.

2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:05.560
 I don't know.

2:07:05.560 --> 2:07:06.560
 But he asked me to.

2:07:06.560 --> 2:07:07.560
 Well, anyway.

2:07:07.560 --> 2:07:08.560
 Yeah.

2:07:08.560 --> 2:07:09.560
 I didn't even get...

2:07:09.560 --> 2:07:10.560
 It's some...

2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:11.560
 Yeah.

2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:12.560
 He made up.

2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:15.240
 I didn't even realize that he plays the Evan's gambit.

2:07:15.240 --> 2:07:16.840
 Like he plays a lot of gambits that are...

2:07:16.840 --> 2:07:18.360
 Wait, Evan's gambit is a thing?

2:07:18.360 --> 2:07:19.360
 Yeah.

2:07:19.360 --> 2:07:20.360
 Yeah.

2:07:20.360 --> 2:07:21.360
 That's a thing.

2:07:21.360 --> 2:07:22.920
 Like that's an old opening from the 1800s.

2:07:22.920 --> 2:07:25.280
 And Evan's apparently invented it.

2:07:25.280 --> 2:07:26.800
 Why would he mention that particular one?

2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:27.800
 Yeah, I don't know.

2:07:27.800 --> 2:07:28.800
 Is there something hilarious about that one?

2:07:28.800 --> 2:07:29.800
 I don't know.

2:07:29.800 --> 2:07:34.360
 I don't think I've ever faced the Evan's gambit in a game.

2:07:34.360 --> 2:07:37.160
 I feel like both of you are trolling me right now.

2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:43.040
 But I mean, he's played a lot of other gambits.

2:07:43.040 --> 2:07:45.560
 Maybe this is the one he wanted to mention.

2:07:45.560 --> 2:07:46.560
 So this...

2:07:46.560 --> 2:07:49.040
 Maybe this is called the Evan's gambit as well.

2:07:49.040 --> 2:07:52.680
 But I just know it as like the 2G4 gambit.

2:07:52.680 --> 2:07:53.680
 Maybe this is the one.

2:07:53.680 --> 2:08:03.560
 Like this one, he has played a bunch, and he's been telling me a lot about his games

2:08:03.560 --> 2:08:04.560
 in this line.

2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:06.560
 He's like, oh, it's not so bad.

2:08:06.560 --> 2:08:09.400
 And I'm like, yeah, it's your pawn down.

2:08:09.400 --> 2:08:10.720
 But I can sort of see it.

2:08:10.720 --> 2:08:12.920
 I can sort of understand it.

2:08:12.920 --> 2:08:17.800
 And he's proud of the fact that nobody told him to play this line or anything.

2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:20.040
 He came up with it himself.

2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:23.880
 And there's this, I'll tell you another story about my father.

2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:31.920
 So there's this line that I call the Henry Carlson line.

2:08:31.920 --> 2:08:36.360
 So at some point, you know, he never knew a lot of openings in chess.

2:08:36.360 --> 2:08:41.240
 But I taught him a couple of openings as black.

2:08:41.240 --> 2:08:51.080
 It's the Sveshnikov Sicilian that I played a lot myself also during the World Championship

2:08:51.080 --> 2:08:52.080
 in 2018.

2:08:52.080 --> 2:08:54.760
 I won a bunch of games in 2019 as well.

2:08:54.760 --> 2:08:55.920
 So that's one opening.

2:08:55.920 --> 2:09:00.080
 And I also taught him as black to play the Rogosin defense.

2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:05.360
 And then, so the Rogosin defense goes like this.

2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:10.840
 It's characterized by this bishop move.

2:09:10.840 --> 2:09:17.000
 And so he would play those openings pretty, pretty exclusively and as black in the tournaments

2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:18.000
 that he did play.

2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:23.760
 And also the Sveshnikov Sicilian is like, that's the only two of my sisters play.

2:09:23.760 --> 2:09:26.120
 I played a bunch of chess tournaments as well.

2:09:26.120 --> 2:09:29.080
 And that's the only opening they know as well.

2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:33.280
 So my family's portrait is very narrow.

2:09:33.280 --> 2:09:35.760
 So this is the system.

2:09:35.760 --> 2:09:40.600
 Black goes here and then we open white takes the pawn and black takes the pawn.

2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:48.120
 So at some point I was watching one of my father's online blitz game.

2:09:48.120 --> 2:09:52.520
 As white, he played this, this.

2:09:52.520 --> 2:09:54.400
 So this is called the Karakhan defense.

2:09:54.400 --> 2:09:55.400
 He took the pawn.

2:09:55.400 --> 2:10:03.280
 It was taken back, then he went with the knight, his opponent went here.

2:10:03.280 --> 2:10:05.480
 And then he played a bishop here.

2:10:05.480 --> 2:10:12.080
 So I, I'd never seen this opening before and I was like, wow, how on earth did he come

2:10:12.080 --> 2:10:13.080
 up with that?

2:10:13.080 --> 2:10:17.320
 And he said, no, I just played the Rogosin with the different colors because if the

2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:19.200
 knight was here, it would be the same position.

2:10:19.200 --> 2:10:27.320
 I was like, I never, I was like, how, how am I like one of the best players in the world?

2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:28.760
 And I've never thought about that.

2:10:28.760 --> 2:10:30.800
 So I actually started playing.

2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:36.920
 I started playing this line as white with pretty decent results and it results and it

2:10:36.920 --> 2:10:39.640
 actually became kind of popular.

2:10:39.640 --> 2:10:44.000
 And everybody who asked about the line, it's like, I would always tell him, yeah, that's

2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:45.960
 the Henry Carlson application.

2:10:45.960 --> 2:10:48.280
 I wouldn't necessarily explain why it was called that.

2:10:48.280 --> 2:10:50.160
 I would just always call it that.

2:10:50.160 --> 2:10:55.560
 So I really hope that this, at some point, this line will be, will finisher.

2:10:55.560 --> 2:10:56.560
 It's rightful name.

2:10:56.560 --> 2:10:57.560
 Yeah.

2:10:57.560 --> 2:11:00.040
 It finds its ways into the history books.

2:11:00.040 --> 2:11:04.000
 And you, what, what, what did you learn about life from your dad?

2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:08.520
 What role has your dad played in your life?

2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:15.160
 He's taught me a lot of things, but most of all, as long as you win a chess, then everything

2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:19.320
 else is fine.

2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:28.160
 I think my, especially my father, but my parents in general, they, they always wanted me to

2:11:28.160 --> 2:11:33.880
 get a good education and find a job and so on.

2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:39.640
 Even though my father loves chess and he wanted me to, to play chess, I don't think he had

2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:41.480
 any plans for me to be professional.

2:11:41.480 --> 2:11:44.120
 I think things changed at some point.

2:11:44.120 --> 2:11:52.080
 Like I was less and less interested in school and for a long time we were kind of going

2:11:52.080 --> 2:11:57.800
 back and forth fighting about that, especially my father, but also my mother a little bit.

2:11:57.800 --> 2:11:59.960
 It was, at times a little bit difficult.

2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:01.200
 They wanted you to go to school.

2:12:01.200 --> 2:12:02.200
 Yeah.

2:12:02.200 --> 2:12:05.720
 They just sort of wanted me to do more school, to, to have more options.

2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:15.560
 And then I think at some point they just gave up, but I think that sort of coincided

2:12:15.560 --> 2:12:18.640
 when I was actually starting to make real money of tournaments.

2:12:18.640 --> 2:12:25.200
 And after that, you know, everything's been sort of easy and like terms of the family,

2:12:25.200 --> 2:12:33.160
 like they've never put any pressure on me or they've never put any demands on me.

2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:36.640
 There's just, yeah, my ass has to focus on chess.

2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:38.840
 That's, that's, that's it.

2:12:38.840 --> 2:12:48.640
 Like I think they taught me in general to be curious about the world and to get a decent

2:12:48.640 --> 2:12:55.040
 general education, not necessarily from, from school, but like just knowing about the world

2:12:55.040 --> 2:13:01.160
 around you and knowing history and being, you know, just being interested in society.

2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:05.200
 I think in that sense they've done well.

2:13:05.200 --> 2:13:07.840
 And he's been with you throughout your chess career.

2:13:07.840 --> 2:13:14.480
 I mean, there's something to be said about just family support and love that you have

2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:19.040
 that, you know, this world is a lonely place.

2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:24.080
 It's good to have people around you there like, yeah, they got your back kind of, you

2:13:24.080 --> 2:13:34.920
 know, it's a cliche, but I think to some extent, all the people you surround yourself with,

2:13:34.920 --> 2:13:36.920
 they can help you a lot.

2:13:36.920 --> 2:13:41.320
 It's only family that only has their own interests at heart.

2:13:41.320 --> 2:13:48.160
 And so for that reason, like my father is like the only one that's been like constantly

2:13:48.160 --> 2:13:51.440
 in the team that and that is always been around.

2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:55.960
 And it's, it's for that reason that I know he has my back no matter what.

2:13:55.960 --> 2:14:04.000
 Now there's a cliche question here, but let's try to actually get to some deep truths, perhaps.

2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:08.920
 But people who don't know much about chess seem to like to use chess as a metaphor for

2:14:08.920 --> 2:14:11.040
 everything in life.

2:14:11.040 --> 2:14:16.320
 But there is some aspect to the decision making to the kind of reasoning and involved in chess

2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:19.280
 that's transferable to other things.

2:14:19.280 --> 2:14:25.000
 Can you, can you speak to that in your, in your own life and in general?

2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:31.560
 The kind of reasoning involved with chess, how much is that just transferred to life

2:14:31.560 --> 2:14:32.560
 out there?

2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:34.360
 It just helps you make decisions.

2:14:34.360 --> 2:14:35.360
 I mean.

2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:36.360
 Of all, of all kinds.

2:14:36.360 --> 2:14:37.360
 Yeah.

2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:41.960
 That would be my main takeaway that you learn to make informed guesses in a limited amount

2:14:41.960 --> 2:14:42.960
 of time.

2:14:42.960 --> 2:14:49.240
 I mean, does it frustrate you when, you know, that you have geopolitical thinkers and leaders

2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:53.800
 that, you know, Henry Kissinger will often talk about geopolitics as a game of chess

2:14:53.800 --> 2:14:55.840
 or 3D chess.

2:14:55.840 --> 2:15:02.160
 Is that a too oversimplified of a projection or, or do you think that the kind of deliberations

2:15:02.160 --> 2:15:07.040
 you have on the world stage is, is similar to the kind of decision making you have on

2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:08.040
 the chess board?

2:15:08.040 --> 2:15:13.640
 Well, I never, I'm never trying to get reelected when I play a game of chess.

2:15:13.640 --> 2:15:15.720
 There's no special interest.

2:15:15.720 --> 2:15:16.880
 You have to get happy.

2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:17.880
 Yeah.

2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:18.880
 That kind of helps.

2:15:18.880 --> 2:15:25.960
 No, I can, I can understand that obviously for every action, there's a reaction and you

2:15:25.960 --> 2:15:33.920
 have to, to calculate far ahead, it probably would be a good thing if more big players

2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:39.760
 on the international scene thought a little bit more like, like a chess player in that

2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:46.680
 sense, like trying to make good decision based on, based on limited amount of data rather

2:15:46.680 --> 2:15:51.200
 than thinking about other, other factors, but it's so tough.

2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:57.480
 But it doesn't annoy me when, when people make moves that they know are wrong for different

2:15:57.480 --> 2:15:58.480
 reasons.

2:15:58.480 --> 2:16:01.640
 And they should know if they did some calculation, they should know they're wrong.

2:16:01.640 --> 2:16:02.640
 Yeah, exactly.

2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:04.880
 That they should know that are wrong.

2:16:04.880 --> 2:16:15.400
 And so much politics is like, it's, you're, you're often asked to do something when you're,

2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:21.640
 when it would be much better to do nothing, like, no, but that happens in chess all the

2:16:21.640 --> 2:16:22.640
 time.

2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:23.640
 Like you have, you have a choice.

2:16:23.640 --> 2:16:29.880
 Like I often tell people that in certain situations, you should not try and win.

2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:33.000
 You should just let your opponent lose.

2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:40.960
 And that happens in politics all the time that, yeah, just let your opponents continue

2:16:40.960 --> 2:16:42.640
 whatever they're doing.

2:16:42.640 --> 2:16:46.080
 And then you'll win, don't try to do something just to do something.

2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:52.480
 Often they say in chess that having a bad plan is better than having no plan.

2:16:52.480 --> 2:16:55.120
 It's absolute nonsense.

2:16:55.120 --> 2:17:00.200
 I forget what general said it, but it was like, don't interrupt your enemy when they're

2:17:00.200 --> 2:17:01.200
 making a mistake.

2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:02.200
 Yeah.

2:17:02.200 --> 2:17:10.600
 I think they're also, Petrosian, the former world champion said, when your opponent wants

2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:13.400
 to play the Dutch defense, don't stop them.

2:17:13.400 --> 2:17:17.440
 I mean, chess players will know that it's the same thing.

2:17:17.440 --> 2:17:22.640
 Actually, this reminds me.

2:17:22.640 --> 2:17:26.240
 Is there something you found really impressive about Queens Gambit, the TV show?

2:17:26.240 --> 2:17:30.440
 You know, that's one of the things that really captivated the public imagination about chess.

2:17:30.440 --> 2:17:35.160
 People don't play chess or became very curious about the game, about the beauty of the game,

2:17:35.160 --> 2:17:37.200
 the drama of the game, all that kind of stuff.

2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:44.520
 Is there, in terms of accuracy, in terms of the actual games played that you found impressive?

2:17:44.520 --> 2:17:48.360
 First of all, they did the chess well, they did it accurately.

2:17:48.360 --> 2:17:54.920
 And also, they found actual games and positions that I'd never seen before, which really captivated

2:17:54.920 --> 2:17:55.920
 me.

2:17:55.920 --> 2:18:02.200
 Like, I would not follow the story at times, I was just trying to, wow, where the hell did

2:18:02.200 --> 2:18:03.200
 I find that game?

2:18:03.200 --> 2:18:06.080
 I was trying to solve the positions.

2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:13.920
 So Beth Harmon, the main character, were you impressed by the play she was doing?

2:18:13.920 --> 2:18:17.320
 Was there a particular style that they developed consistently?

2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:21.040
 She was just, at the end, she was just totally universal.

2:18:21.040 --> 2:18:27.640
 At the start, she was probably a bit too aggressive, but no, she was absolutely universal.

2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:31.680
 Wait, what adjective are you using?

2:18:31.680 --> 2:18:36.480
 Typical in the sense that she could play in any style.

2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:37.480
 Oh, interesting.

2:18:37.480 --> 2:18:38.960
 And was dominant in that way.

2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:42.160
 Wow, so there was a development in style, too, throughout the show.

2:18:42.160 --> 2:18:43.160
 Yeah, for sure.

2:18:43.160 --> 2:18:46.120
 It's really interesting they did that.

2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:49.160
 And it actually happened with me a bit as well.

2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:56.680
 I started out really aggressive, then I became probably too technical at some point, taking

2:18:56.680 --> 2:19:00.200
 a little bit too few risks and not playing dynamic enough.

2:19:00.200 --> 2:19:06.080
 And then I started to get a little bit better at dynamic, so that now I would say definitely

2:19:06.080 --> 2:19:11.120
 the most universal player in terms of style.

2:19:11.120 --> 2:19:14.440
 Are there any skills in chess that are transferable to poker?

2:19:14.440 --> 2:19:18.840
 So as you're playing around with poker a little bit now, how fundamentally different

2:19:18.840 --> 2:19:21.120
 of a game is it?

2:19:21.120 --> 2:19:30.040
 What I find the most transferable probably is not letting past decisions dictate a future

2:19:30.040 --> 2:19:32.480
 thinking.

2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:36.360
 But in terms of the patterns in the betting strategies and all that kind of stuff, what

2:19:36.360 --> 2:19:37.360
 about bluffing?

2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:40.960
 I bluffed way too much.

2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:46.880
 It does seem you enjoy bluffing, and Daniel Negrado was saying you're quite good at it.

2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:49.840
 But yeah, it has very little material to go by.

2:19:49.840 --> 2:19:50.840
 Sample size is small.

2:19:50.840 --> 2:19:51.840
 Yeah.

2:19:51.840 --> 2:19:57.640
 No, I mean, I enjoy bluffing for the more gambling aspects, the thrill of.

2:19:57.640 --> 2:20:02.120
 So not the technical aspect of the bluffing like you would on the chessboard.

2:20:02.120 --> 2:20:06.800
 Not bluffing in the same sense, but there is some element.

2:20:06.800 --> 2:20:09.520
 But I do enjoy it on the chessboard.

2:20:09.520 --> 2:20:14.880
 If I know that, oh, I successfully scared away my opponent for making the best move,

2:20:14.880 --> 2:20:16.720
 that's of course satisfying.

2:20:16.720 --> 2:20:22.520
 In that same way, it might be satisfying in poker, that you represent something, you

2:20:22.520 --> 2:20:25.160
 scare away your opponent in the same kind of way.

2:20:25.160 --> 2:20:30.600
 And also like you tell a story, you try and tell a story, and then they believe it.

2:20:30.600 --> 2:20:36.520
 Yeah, tell a story with your betting, with all the different other cues.

2:20:36.520 --> 2:20:37.520
 Yeah.

2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:40.360
 Do you like the money aspect, the betting strategies?

2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:45.120
 So it's almost like another layer on top of it, right?

2:20:45.120 --> 2:20:53.560
 It's the uncertainty in the cards, but the betting, there's so much freedom to the betting.

2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:58.840
 I'm not very good at that, so I cannot say that I understand it completely.

2:20:58.840 --> 2:21:05.760
 You know, when it comes to different sizing and all that, I just haven't studied it enough.

2:21:05.760 --> 2:21:11.920
 How much of luck is part of poker, would you say, from what you've seen versus skill?

2:21:11.920 --> 2:21:16.200
 I mean, it's so different in the sense that you can be one of the best players in the

2:21:16.200 --> 2:21:23.800
 world and lose two, three years in a row without that being like a massive outlier.

2:21:23.800 --> 2:21:31.200
 The thing that more than one person told me that you're very good at is trash talking.

2:21:31.200 --> 2:21:32.800
 I don't think I am.

2:21:32.800 --> 2:21:39.920
 A lot of people who make those observations about me, I think they just expect very, very

2:21:39.920 --> 2:21:40.920
 little.

2:21:40.920 --> 2:21:48.560
 They expect from the best chess player in the world that just anything that's non robotic

2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:50.800
 is interesting.

2:21:50.800 --> 2:21:54.440
 Also when it comes to trash talking, like I have the biggest advantage in the world

2:21:54.440 --> 2:21:56.320
 that I'm the best at what I'm doing.

2:21:56.320 --> 2:22:00.160
 So trash talking becomes very, very, very easy because I can back it up.

2:22:00.160 --> 2:22:01.160
 Yeah.

2:22:01.160 --> 2:22:05.040
 Yeah, but a lot of people that are extremely good at stuff don't trash talk and they're

2:22:05.040 --> 2:22:06.040
 not good at it.

2:22:06.040 --> 2:22:10.720
 I don't think I'm very good at it, it's just that I can back it up, which makes it seem

2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:12.200
 that I'm better.

2:22:12.200 --> 2:22:18.960
 And also, you're even doing it now, also being non robotic or not completely robotic.

2:22:18.960 --> 2:22:19.960
 Yeah.

2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:20.960
 Yeah.

2:22:20.960 --> 2:22:22.520
 You're not trash talking, you're stating facts.

2:22:22.520 --> 2:22:23.520
 That's right.

2:22:23.520 --> 2:22:29.920
 Have you ever considered that there will be trash talking over the chess board and some

2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:31.640
 of the big tournaments?

2:22:31.640 --> 2:22:35.560
 Like adding that kind of component or even talking, you know?

2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:36.560
 Mm.

2:22:36.560 --> 2:22:38.560
 Would that completely distract from the game of chess?

2:22:38.560 --> 2:22:46.400
 No, I think it could be funny and when people play off fan games, when they play Blitz games,

2:22:46.400 --> 2:22:51.280
 like people trash talk all the time, it's a normal part of the game.

2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:54.600
 So you emphasize fun a lot.

2:22:54.600 --> 2:23:04.080
 Do you think we're living inside of a simulation that is trying to maximize fun?

2:23:04.080 --> 2:23:10.400
 But that's only happened for the last, you know, 100 years or so, no, that's like the

2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:12.680
 fun has always been increasing, I think.

2:23:12.680 --> 2:23:13.680
 Yeah.

2:23:13.680 --> 2:23:14.680
 Okay.

2:23:14.680 --> 2:23:16.680
 It's always been increasing, but I feel like it's been increasing exponentially.

2:23:16.680 --> 2:23:17.680
 Yeah.

2:23:17.680 --> 2:23:24.560
 I mean, the, or at least the importance of fun, but I guess it depends on the society

2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:25.560
 as well.

2:23:25.560 --> 2:23:32.680
 Like in the West, we've had such Christian influence and I mean, Christianity hasn't

2:23:32.680 --> 2:23:35.800
 exactly embraced the concept of fun over time.

2:23:35.800 --> 2:23:42.360
 Well, actually to push back, I think forbidding certain things kind of makes them more fun.

2:23:42.360 --> 2:23:47.440
 So sometimes I think you need to say you're not allowed to do this and then a lot of people

2:23:47.440 --> 2:23:53.440
 start doing it and then they have fun doing that because it's like, it's doing a thing

2:23:53.440 --> 2:23:55.520
 in the face of the resistance of the thing.

2:23:55.520 --> 2:23:59.560
 So whenever there's resistance, that does somehow make it more fun.

2:23:59.560 --> 2:24:04.720
 Creative regimes has always kind of been, been kind of good for comedy, no?

2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:11.440
 Like I heard, supposedly like in the Soviet Union, I don't know about fun, but supposedly

2:24:11.440 --> 2:24:14.240
 comedy like at least underground, it's right.

2:24:14.240 --> 2:24:15.240
 Yeah.

2:24:15.240 --> 2:24:16.920
 There's a, well, no, it permeates the entire culture.

2:24:16.920 --> 2:24:23.120
 There's a dark humor that sort of the cruelty, the absurdity of life really, really brings

2:24:23.120 --> 2:24:26.880
 out the humor amongst the populace plus vodka on top of that.

2:24:26.880 --> 2:24:33.800
 So this idea that, for example, Elon Musk has that the most entertaining outcome was

2:24:33.800 --> 2:24:40.560
 the most likely, that it seems like the most absurd, silly, funny thing seems to be the

2:24:40.560 --> 2:24:41.560
 thing that.

2:24:41.560 --> 2:24:44.840
 So it happens more often than it should.

2:24:44.840 --> 2:24:49.280
 And it somehow becomes viral in our modern connected world.

2:24:49.280 --> 2:24:53.440
 And so the fun stuff, the memes spread.

2:24:53.440 --> 2:24:57.920
 And then we start to optimize for the, for the fun meme that seems to be a fundamental

2:24:57.920 --> 2:25:01.800
 property of, of the reality we live in.

2:25:01.800 --> 2:25:10.480
 And so emerges the, the fun maximizer in all walks of life, like in chess, in, in, in poker

2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:13.360
 and everything.

2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:14.600
 I think you're skeptical.

2:25:14.600 --> 2:25:15.880
 No, I'm not skeptical.

2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:23.000
 I'm just, I'm just taking it all in, but I find, I find it interesting and not at all

2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:24.000
 impossible.

2:25:24.000 --> 2:25:26.120
 Do you ever get lonely?

2:25:26.120 --> 2:25:28.800
 Oh yeah, for sure.

2:25:28.800 --> 2:25:35.160
 Like a chess player's life is, by definition, pretty lonely because you have nobody else

2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:40.320
 to blame but yourself when you lose or you don't achieve the results that you want to

2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:41.320
 achieve.

2:25:41.320 --> 2:25:45.080
 It's difficult for you to find comfort elsewhere.

2:25:45.080 --> 2:25:46.440
 It's in your own mind.

2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:47.440
 Yeah.

2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:48.440
 It's you versus yourself.

2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:49.440
 Really.

2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:50.440
 Yeah, really.

2:25:50.440 --> 2:25:57.800
 But it's, you know, it's, it's part of the profession, but I think any like sport or

2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:04.760
 activity where it's, where it's just you and your own mind is just by definition lonely.

2:26:04.760 --> 2:26:06.720
 Are you worried that it destroys you?

2:26:06.720 --> 2:26:08.160
 Oh, not at all.

2:26:08.160 --> 2:26:10.920
 As long as I'm aware of it, then it's fine.

2:26:10.920 --> 2:26:19.560
 And I don't think the inherent loneliness of my profession really affects the rest of

2:26:19.560 --> 2:26:23.680
 my life in a major way.

2:26:23.680 --> 2:26:31.440
 What role does love play in the human condition in your lonely life of calculation?

2:26:31.440 --> 2:26:41.600
 You know, I'm like everybody else trying, you know, trying to find love.

2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:44.280
 No, not necessarily like trying to find love.

2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:45.280
 Sometimes I am.

2:26:45.280 --> 2:26:46.280
 Sometimes I'm not.

2:26:46.280 --> 2:26:48.280
 I'm just trying to find my way.

2:26:48.280 --> 2:26:49.280
 Yeah.

2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:57.160
 And my love for, for the game, obviously it comes and goes a little bit, but there's like

2:26:57.160 --> 2:26:59.440
 there's always at least some level of love.

2:26:59.440 --> 2:27:01.680
 So that doesn't, doesn't go away.

2:27:01.680 --> 2:27:10.000
 But I think in other parts of life, I think it's just about doing things that make you

2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:16.400
 happy, that give you joy, that, that also makes you more receptive to love in general.

2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:23.040
 So that, that has been my approach to, to love now for quite a while, that I'm just

2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:25.480
 trying to live my best life.

2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:33.640
 And then the love will, will come when it, when it comes in, in terms of romantic love,

2:27:33.640 --> 2:27:35.960
 it has come and gone in my life.

2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:45.040
 It's not there now, but I'm not worried about that I'm more worried about, you know, not

2:27:45.040 --> 2:27:50.920
 worried, but more like trying to just be a good version of, of myself.

2:27:50.920 --> 2:27:54.680
 I cannot always be the best version of myself, but at least try to be good.

2:27:54.680 --> 2:27:55.680
 Yeah.

2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:56.680
 And keep your heart open.

2:27:56.680 --> 2:27:59.600
 What is this Daniel Johnson song?

2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:04.760
 True love will find you in the end, but it may or may not, but it will only find you

2:28:04.760 --> 2:28:10.960
 if, if you're looking, so like you have to be open to it.

2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:11.960
 Yeah.

2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:12.960
 It may or may not.

2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:13.960
 Yeah.

2:28:13.960 --> 2:28:16.840
 But no matter what, you're going to lose it in the end because it all ends.

2:28:16.840 --> 2:28:17.840
 The whole thing ends.

2:28:17.840 --> 2:28:18.840
 Yeah.

2:28:18.840 --> 2:28:19.840
 Yeah.

2:28:19.840 --> 2:28:26.840
 So that's, I don't think stressing over that, like obviously it's so human that you can't

2:28:26.840 --> 2:28:33.520
 help it to some degree, but I feel like stressing over love, that's the blueprint for whether,

2:28:33.520 --> 2:28:41.480
 whether you're looking or you're not looking or you're in a relationship or married or anything

2:28:41.480 --> 2:28:46.520
 like stressing over it is like the blueprint for being unhappy.

2:28:46.520 --> 2:28:50.360
 Just to clarify confusion, I have just a quick question.

2:28:50.360 --> 2:28:53.720
 How does the night move?

2:28:53.720 --> 2:29:02.440
 So the night moves in an L and unlike in Shogi, it can move both forwards and backwards.

2:29:02.440 --> 2:29:05.800
 It is quite a nimble piece.

2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:10.840
 It can jump over everything, but it's less happy in open position where it has to move

2:29:10.840 --> 2:29:14.760
 from side to side quickly.

2:29:14.760 --> 2:29:19.480
 I am generally more of a Bishop's guy myself for the old debate.

2:29:19.480 --> 2:29:27.680
 I just prefer quality over the intangibles, but I can appreciate a good night once in

2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:28.680
 a while.

2:29:28.680 --> 2:29:33.840
 Last simple question, what's the meaning of life, Magnus Carlsen?

2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:36.200
 There is obviously no meaning to life.

2:29:36.200 --> 2:29:37.200
 Is that obvious?

2:29:37.200 --> 2:29:39.680
 I think we're here by accident.

2:29:39.680 --> 2:29:43.680
 There's no meaning, it ends at some point, but it's still a great thing.

2:29:43.680 --> 2:29:47.240
 You can still have fun even if there's no meaning.

2:29:47.240 --> 2:29:48.240
 Yeah, you can still have fun.

2:29:48.240 --> 2:29:54.840
 You can try and pursue your goals, whatever they may be, but I'm pretty sure there's no

2:29:54.840 --> 2:30:01.440
 special meaning and trying to find it also doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me.

2:30:01.440 --> 2:30:09.640
 For me, life is both meaningless and meaningful for just being here, trying to make not necessarily

2:30:09.640 --> 2:30:15.360
 the most of it, but the things that make you happy both short term and also long term.

2:30:15.360 --> 2:30:18.640
 Yeah, it seems to be full of cool stuff to enjoy.

2:30:18.640 --> 2:30:21.080
 It certainly does.

2:30:21.080 --> 2:30:25.280
 One of those is having a conversation with you, Magnus, it's a huge honor to talk to

2:30:25.280 --> 2:30:26.280
 you.

2:30:26.280 --> 2:30:28.080
 Thank you so much for spending this time with me.

2:30:28.080 --> 2:30:32.040
 I can't wait to see what you do in this world, and thank you for creating so much elegance

2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:36.280
 and beauty on the chessboard and beyond, so thanks for talking today, brother.

2:30:36.280 --> 2:30:37.280
 Thank you so much.

2:30:37.280 --> 2:30:43.640
 Thank you for having me, and I wanted to say this at the start, but I never really got

2:30:43.640 --> 2:30:44.640
 the chance.

2:30:44.640 --> 2:30:50.840
 I was always a bit apprehensive about doing this podcast because you are a very smart guy

2:30:50.840 --> 2:31:00.440
 and your audience is very smart, and I always had a bit of imposter syndrome, so I'll tell

2:31:00.440 --> 2:31:07.640
 you this now after the podcast, so please do judge me, but I hope you've enjoyed it.

2:31:07.640 --> 2:31:08.640
 I loved it.

2:31:08.640 --> 2:31:13.440
 You're a brilliant man, and I love the fact that you have an imposter syndrome because

2:31:13.440 --> 2:31:17.840
 a lot of us do, and so that's beautiful to see, even at the very top, but you still

2:31:17.840 --> 2:31:20.640
 feel like an imposter.

2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:21.640
 Thank you, brother.

2:31:21.640 --> 2:31:23.120
 Thanks for talking today.

2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:25.760
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Magnus Carlsen.

2:31:25.760 --> 2:31:29.880
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

2:31:29.880 --> 2:31:32.960
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Bobby Fisher.

2:31:32.960 --> 2:31:36.920
 Chess is a war over the board.

2:31:36.920 --> 2:31:40.840
 The object is to crush the opponent's mind.

2:31:40.840 --> 2:32:00.520
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
