WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.720
 The following is a conversation with Dmitry Korkin.

00:02.720 --> 00:04.560
 He's a professor of bioinformatics

00:04.560 --> 00:07.280
 and computational biology at WPI,

00:07.280 --> 00:09.320
 Worcester Polytechnic Institute,

00:09.320 --> 00:11.400
 where he specializes in bioinformatics

00:11.400 --> 00:14.600
 of complex diseases, computational genomics,

00:14.600 --> 00:18.360
 systems biology, and biomedical data analytics.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.400
 I came across Dmitry's work when in February,

00:21.400 --> 00:25.040
 his group used the viral genome of the COVID 19

00:25.040 --> 00:27.080
 to reconstruct the 3D structure

00:27.080 --> 00:29.040
 of its major viral proteins.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.360
 And their interaction with the human proteins.

00:32.360 --> 00:34.920
 In effect, creating a structural genomics map

00:34.920 --> 00:37.560
 of the coronavirus and making this data open

00:37.560 --> 00:40.160
 and available to researchers everywhere.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.960
 We talked about the biology of COVID 19, SARS,

00:42.960 --> 00:44.480
 and viruses in general,

00:44.480 --> 00:47.720
 and how computational methods can help us understand

00:47.720 --> 00:49.360
 their structure and function

00:49.360 --> 00:52.840
 in order to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines.

00:54.040 --> 00:56.360
 This conversation was recorded recently

00:56.360 --> 00:58.680
 in the time of the coronavirus pandemic

00:58.680 --> 01:01.040
 for everyone feeling the medical, psychological,

01:01.040 --> 01:03.000
 and financial burden of this crisis.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.760
 I'm sending love your way.

01:04.760 --> 01:07.800
 Stay strong, we're in this together, we'll beat this thing.

01:09.080 --> 01:11.520
 This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.

01:11.520 --> 01:13.680
 If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,

01:13.680 --> 01:16.040
 review it with five stars in Apple Podcast,

01:16.040 --> 01:17.360
 support it on Patreon,

01:17.360 --> 01:19.400
 or simply connect with me on Twitter,

01:19.400 --> 01:23.480
 at Lex Freedman, spelled F R I D M A N.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.560
 This show is presented by Cash App,

01:25.560 --> 01:27.720
 the number one finance app in the App Store.

01:27.720 --> 01:30.560
 When you get it, use code Lex Podcast.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.680
 Cash App lets you send money to friends, buy Bitcoin,

01:33.680 --> 01:36.680
 and invest in the stock market with as little as $1.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.880
 Since Cash App allows you to buy Bitcoin,

01:38.880 --> 01:40.840
 let me mention that cryptocurrency

01:40.840 --> 01:44.000
 in the context of the history of money is fascinating.

01:44.000 --> 01:48.200
 I recommend Ascent of Money as a great book on this history.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.000
 Debits and credits on ledgers started around

01:51.000 --> 01:52.760
 30,000 years ago.

01:52.760 --> 01:55.680
 The US dollar created over 200 years ago.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.480
 And Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency,

01:58.480 --> 02:00.600
 released just over 10 years ago.

02:00.600 --> 02:04.160
 So given that history, cryptocurrency is still very much

02:04.160 --> 02:06.040
 in its early days of development,

02:06.040 --> 02:07.600
 but it's still aiming to,

02:07.600 --> 02:10.840
 and just might redefine the nature of money.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.120
 So again, if you get Cash App from the App Store,

02:15.120 --> 02:18.240
 Google Play, and use the code Lex Podcast,

02:18.240 --> 02:22.200
 you get $10, and Cash App will also donate $10 first.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.040
 An organization that is helping to advance robotics

02:25.040 --> 02:28.480
 and STEM education for young people around the world.

02:28.480 --> 02:32.280
 And now here's my conversation with Dmitry Korkin.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.960
 Do you find viruses terrifying or fascinating?

02:38.040 --> 02:42.320
 When I think about viruses, I think about them,

02:42.320 --> 02:47.320
 I mean, I imagine them as those villains

02:47.680 --> 02:52.680
 that do their work so perfectly well.

02:52.680 --> 02:57.600
 That is impossible not to be fascinated with them.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.040
 So what do you imagine when you think about a virus?

03:00.040 --> 03:02.840
 Do you imagine the individual,

03:02.840 --> 03:07.280
 sort of these 100 nanometer particle things?

03:07.280 --> 03:11.000
 Or do you imagine the whole pandemic like society level?

03:11.000 --> 03:15.200
 The, when you say the efficiency at which they do their work,

03:15.200 --> 03:18.920
 do you think of viruses as the millions

03:18.920 --> 03:23.520
 that occupy a human body or a living organism?

03:23.520 --> 03:26.640
 Society level, like spreading as a pandemic?

03:26.640 --> 03:29.200
 Or do you think of the individual little guy?

03:29.200 --> 03:34.200
 Yes, this is, I think this is a unique concept

03:34.640 --> 03:39.640
 that allows you to move from micro scale to the macro scale.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.680
 All right, so the virus itself,

03:41.680 --> 03:45.040
 I mean, it's not a living organism.

03:45.040 --> 03:48.760
 It's a machine to me, it's a machine.

03:48.760 --> 03:51.640
 But it is perfected to the way

03:51.640 --> 03:56.640
 that it essentially has a limited number of functions.

03:56.960 --> 04:00.520
 It needs to do necessary some functions.

04:00.520 --> 04:05.520
 And essentially has enough information

04:05.800 --> 04:07.720
 just to do those functions,

04:07.720 --> 04:11.560
 as well as the ability to modify itself.

04:13.400 --> 04:18.240
 So, you know, it's a machine, it's an intelligent machine.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.200
 So yet, maybe on that point,

04:20.200 --> 04:23.280
 you're in danger of reducing the power of this thing

04:23.280 --> 04:24.920
 by calling it a machine, right?

04:26.840 --> 04:30.480
 But you now mentioned that it's also possibly intelligent.

04:30.480 --> 04:34.320
 It seems that there's these elements of brilliance

04:34.320 --> 04:37.480
 that a virus has, of intelligence,

04:37.480 --> 04:41.520
 of maximizing so many things

04:41.520 --> 04:44.640
 about its behavior and to ensure its survival

04:44.640 --> 04:48.200
 and its success.

04:48.200 --> 04:51.440
 So, do you see it as intelligent?

04:51.440 --> 04:55.880
 So, you know, I think it's a different,

04:55.880 --> 04:58.520
 I understand it differently than, you know,

04:58.520 --> 05:02.760
 I think about, you know, intelligence of a humankind

05:02.760 --> 05:07.760
 or intelligence of the artificial intelligence mechanisms.

05:07.760 --> 05:12.760
 I think the intelligence of a virus

05:13.040 --> 05:15.400
 is in its simplicity.

05:16.760 --> 05:21.760
 The ability to do so much

05:22.520 --> 05:27.520
 with so little material and information.

05:29.600 --> 05:32.400
 But also, I think it's interesting.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.440
 It keeps me thinking about

05:34.440 --> 05:39.360
 you know, it keeps me wondering whether or not

05:39.360 --> 05:44.360
 it's also the, an example of the basic swarm intelligence

05:48.680 --> 05:53.680
 where, you know, essentially the viruses act as the whole

05:55.240 --> 05:58.120
 and they're extremely efficient in that.

05:58.120 --> 06:04.440
 So, what do you attribute the incredible simplicity

06:04.440 --> 06:06.800
 and the efficiency to?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.920
 Is it the evolutionary process?

06:08.920 --> 06:11.440
 So, maybe another way to ask that,

06:11.440 --> 06:13.840
 if you look at the next 100 years,

06:13.840 --> 06:17.840
 are you more worried about the natural pandemics

06:17.840 --> 06:19.880
 or the engineered pandemics?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.640
 So, how hard is it to build a virus?

06:22.640 --> 06:25.720
 Yes, it's a very, very interesting question

06:25.720 --> 06:30.640
 because obviously there's a lot of conversations

06:30.640 --> 06:35.640
 about the, you know, whether we are capable

06:36.160 --> 06:41.160
 of engineering a, you know, an even worse virus.

06:42.800 --> 06:47.680
 I personally expect and am mostly concerned

06:47.680 --> 06:51.320
 with the naturally occurring viruses

06:51.320 --> 06:55.160
 simply because we keep seeing that.

06:55.160 --> 06:59.880
 We keep seeing new strains of influenza emerging.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.200
 Some of them becoming pandemic.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.920
 We keep seeing new strains of coronaviruses emerging.

07:07.800 --> 07:09.840
 This is a natural process

07:09.840 --> 07:14.320
 and I think this is why it's so powerful.

07:17.880 --> 07:21.000
 You know, if you ask me, you know,

07:21.000 --> 07:26.000
 I've read papers about scientists trying to study

07:27.560 --> 07:32.520
 the capacity of the modern, you know,

07:32.520 --> 07:36.640
 biotechnology to alter the viruses.

07:38.680 --> 07:42.000
 But I hope that, you know,

07:42.000 --> 07:47.000
 it won't be our main concern in the near future.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.520
 What do you mean by hope?

07:54.160 --> 07:59.160
 Well, you know, if you look back and look at the history

07:59.160 --> 08:02.600
 of the most dangerous viruses, right?

08:02.600 --> 08:07.600
 So the first thing that comes into mind is a smallpox.

08:09.520 --> 08:14.520
 So right now there is perhaps a handful of places

08:14.520 --> 08:19.240
 where this, you know, the strains of this virus

08:20.240 --> 08:22.080
 are stored, right?

08:22.080 --> 08:26.760
 So this is essentially the effort of the whole society

08:26.760 --> 08:31.760
 to limit the access to those viruses.

08:32.040 --> 08:34.320
 You mean in a lab in a controlled environment

08:34.320 --> 08:37.720
 in order to study and then smallpox is one of the viruses

08:37.720 --> 08:42.720
 for which should be stated, there's a vaccine is developed.

08:42.720 --> 08:47.720
 Yes, yes, and it's, you know, it's, until 70s,

08:48.680 --> 08:53.680
 it, I mean, in my opinion, it was perhaps the most dangerous

08:54.280 --> 08:56.640
 thing that was there.

08:56.640 --> 09:01.640
 Is that a very different virus than the influenza

09:01.960 --> 09:04.120
 and the coronaviruses?

09:04.120 --> 09:09.120
 It is, it is different in several aspects biologically.

09:09.120 --> 09:14.120
 Logically, it's a so called double stranded DNA virus,

09:16.040 --> 09:21.040
 but also in the way that it is much more contagious.

09:24.600 --> 09:29.600
 So the R0 for, so this is, this is the...

09:30.160 --> 09:31.000
 What's R0?

09:31.000 --> 09:36.000
 R0 is essentially an average number as person infected

09:36.000 --> 09:41.000
 by the virus can spread to other people.

09:41.480 --> 09:46.480
 So then the average number of people that he or she can

09:47.240 --> 09:48.560
 spread it to.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.560
 And, you know, the, there is still some, you know,

09:53.560 --> 09:58.560
 discussion about the estimates of the current virus.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.600
 You know, the estimations vary between, you know,

10:02.600 --> 10:07.600
 1.5 and 3, in case of smallpox, it was 5 to 7.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.080
 And we're talking about the exponential growth, right?

10:17.080 --> 10:20.600
 So that's a very big difference.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.080
 It's not the most contagious one.

10:25.080 --> 10:30.080
 Mizzles, for example, it's, I think, 15 and up.

10:30.080 --> 10:35.080
 So it's, you know, but it's definitely more contagious

10:38.560 --> 10:43.560
 that the seasonal flu than the current coronavirus

10:45.520 --> 10:47.600
 or SARS for that matter.

10:48.880 --> 10:52.320
 What makes the virus more contagious?

10:52.320 --> 10:55.320
 I'm sure there's a lot of variables that come into play,

10:55.320 --> 10:58.920
 but is it that whole discussion of aerosol

10:58.920 --> 11:02.280
 and like the size of droplets, if it's airborne

11:02.280 --> 11:05.120
 or is there some other stuff that's more biology centered?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.680
 I mean, there are a lot of components

11:06.680 --> 11:09.800
 and there are biological components

11:09.800 --> 11:13.360
 that there are also, you know, social components.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.920
 The ability of the virus to, you know,

11:17.920 --> 11:22.280
 so the ways in which the virus is spread is definitely one.

11:22.280 --> 11:27.280
 The ability to virus to stay on the surfaces to survive.

11:29.320 --> 11:34.320
 The ability of the virus to replicate fast or so, you know.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.440
 Or once it's in the cell or whatever.

11:37.440 --> 11:39.960
 Once it's inside the host.

11:39.960 --> 11:44.120
 And interestingly enough, something that I think

11:44.120 --> 11:48.120
 we didn't pay that much attention to

11:48.120 --> 11:51.120
 is the incubation period.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.760
 They were, you know, hosts are symptomatic.

11:53.760 --> 11:57.000
 And now it turns out that another thing that we,

11:57.000 --> 11:59.720
 one really needs to take into account

12:01.640 --> 12:04.840
 the percentage of the symptomatic population

12:05.680 --> 12:09.920
 because those people still shed this virus

12:09.920 --> 12:13.560
 and still are, you know, they still are contagious.

12:13.560 --> 12:15.520
 I saw there's an, the Iceland study,

12:15.520 --> 12:18.480
 which I think is probably the most impressive size wise

12:18.480 --> 12:23.480
 shows 50% asymptomatic of this virus.

12:23.600 --> 12:27.720
 I also recently learned the swine flu

12:28.720 --> 12:33.720
 is like the, just the number of people who got infected

12:34.120 --> 12:36.160
 was in the billions.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.520
 It was some crazy number.

12:37.520 --> 12:42.040
 It was like, it was like 20% of the population,

12:42.040 --> 12:44.320
 30% of the population, something crazy like that.

12:44.320 --> 12:48.840
 So the lucky thing there is the fatality rate is low.

12:49.720 --> 12:52.360
 But the fact that a virus can just take over

12:52.360 --> 12:57.000
 an entire population so quickly is terrifying.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.160
 I think, I mean, this is, you know,

13:00.160 --> 13:03.600
 that's perhaps my favorite example of a butterfly effect

13:04.760 --> 13:09.600
 because it's really, I mean, it's even tinier than a butterfly

13:09.600 --> 13:11.760
 and look at, you know, and we're, you know,

13:11.760 --> 13:13.160
 if you think about it, right?

13:13.160 --> 13:18.160
 So it used to be in those bad species.

13:19.440 --> 13:23.280
 And perhaps because of, you know,

13:23.280 --> 13:28.280
 a couple of small changes in the viral genome,

13:29.040 --> 13:33.160
 it first had, you know, become capable of jumping

13:33.160 --> 13:34.840
 from bats to human.

13:34.840 --> 13:39.240
 And then it became capable of jumping from human to human.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.080
 Right?

13:40.080 --> 13:40.920
 So this is, this is, I mean,

13:40.920 --> 13:42.720
 it's not even the size of a virus.

13:42.720 --> 13:44.600
 It's the size of several, you know,

13:45.960 --> 13:50.640
 several atoms or says, you know, a few atoms.

13:50.640 --> 13:55.640
 And over time, this change has such a major impact.

13:58.240 --> 14:01.600
 So is that a mutation like on a single virus?

14:01.600 --> 14:04.640
 Is that like, so if we talk about those,

14:04.640 --> 14:09.360
 the flap of a butterfly wing, like what's the first flap?

14:09.360 --> 14:12.880
 Well, I think this is the mutations that make,

14:12.880 --> 14:17.880
 that made this virus capable of jumping

14:17.880 --> 14:20.360
 from bad species to human.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.560
 Of course, there's, you know,

14:22.560 --> 14:24.720
 the scientists are still trying to find,

14:24.720 --> 14:27.080
 I mean, they're still even trying to find the,

14:27.080 --> 14:29.680
 who was the first infected, right?

14:29.680 --> 14:31.240
 The patient zero.

14:31.240 --> 14:32.320
 The first human.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.920
 The first human infected, right?

14:34.920 --> 14:38.160
 I mean, the fact that there are coronaviruses,

14:38.160 --> 14:42.040
 different strains of coronaviruses in various bad species.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.480
 I mean, we know that.

14:43.480 --> 14:47.360
 So, so we, you know, virologists absurd them.

14:47.360 --> 14:48.920
 They studied them.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.680
 They look at their genomic sequences.

14:51.680 --> 14:54.320
 They're trying, of course, to understand

14:54.320 --> 14:58.200
 what make this viruses to jump from,

14:59.040 --> 15:01.120
 from bats to human.

15:01.120 --> 15:04.840
 There was, you know, similar to that in, you know,

15:04.840 --> 15:07.480
 in influenza, there was, I think a few years ago,

15:07.480 --> 15:12.480
 there was this, you know, interesting story

15:13.760 --> 15:18.760
 where several groups of scientists studying influenza virus

15:19.480 --> 15:23.800
 essentially, you know, made experiments to show

15:23.800 --> 15:28.040
 that this virus can jump from one species to another,

15:29.400 --> 15:34.400
 you know, by changing, I think just a couple of residues.

15:34.400 --> 15:38.960
 And, and, and of course it was very controversial.

15:38.960 --> 15:43.560
 I think there was a moratorium on this study for a while,

15:43.560 --> 15:45.560
 but then the study was released.

15:45.560 --> 15:47.400
 It was published.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.880
 So that, why was there a moratorium?

15:49.880 --> 15:53.000
 Cause it shows through engineering it,

15:53.000 --> 15:56.120
 through modifying it, you can make it jump.

15:56.120 --> 15:56.960
 Yes.

15:58.960 --> 16:02.680
 I personally think it is important to study this.

16:02.680 --> 16:05.960
 I mean, we should be informed.

16:05.960 --> 16:09.200
 We should try to understand as much as possible

16:09.200 --> 16:10.440
 in order to prevent it.

16:12.080 --> 16:15.080
 But, so then the engineering aspect there is,

16:16.560 --> 16:18.400
 can't you then just start searching

16:18.400 --> 16:21.480
 because there's so many strands of viruses out there.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.320
 Can't you just search for the ones in bats

16:24.320 --> 16:29.080
 that are the deadliest from the virologist perspective

16:29.080 --> 16:34.080
 and then just try to engineer, try to see how to,

16:34.320 --> 16:38.160
 but see, that's a, there's a nice aspect to it.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.640
 The really nice thing about engineering viruses is

16:41.640 --> 16:45.400
 it has the same problem as nuclear weapons is,

16:45.400 --> 16:49.640
 it's hard for it to not lead to mutual self destruction.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.360
 So you can't control a virus.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.800
 It can't be used as a weapon, right?

16:53.800 --> 16:56.240
 Yeah, that's why I, you know, in the beginning I said,

16:56.240 --> 17:00.280
 you know, I'm hopeful because that definitely,

17:00.280 --> 17:05.280
 that definitely regulations to be needed to be introduced.

17:05.800 --> 17:10.800
 And I mean, as the scientific society is,

17:10.960 --> 17:14.160
 we are in charge of, you know,

17:14.160 --> 17:18.920
 making the right actions, making the right decisions.

17:20.160 --> 17:24.200
 But I think we will benefit tremendously

17:24.200 --> 17:27.000
 by understanding the mechanisms

17:28.520 --> 17:31.480
 by which the virus can jump,

17:31.480 --> 17:36.000
 by which the virus can become more, you know,

17:36.000 --> 17:40.080
 more dangerous to humans.

17:41.160 --> 17:45.480
 Because all these answers will, you know,

17:45.480 --> 17:48.120
 eventually lead to designing better vaccines,

17:48.120 --> 17:50.560
 hopefully universal vaccines, right?

17:50.560 --> 17:55.560
 And that would be a triumph of the, of, you know, science.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.560
 So what's the universal vaccine?

17:58.560 --> 18:02.160
 So is that something that, how universal is universal?

18:02.160 --> 18:03.920
 Well, I mean, you know, so.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.920
 What's the dream, I guess?

18:04.920 --> 18:07.000
 Cause you kind of mentioned the dream of this.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.120
 I would be extremely happy if, you know,

18:11.120 --> 18:14.800
 we designed the vaccine that is able,

18:14.800 --> 18:16.680
 I mean, I'll give you an example, right?

18:16.680 --> 18:21.560
 So, so every year we do a seasonal flu shot.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.200
 The reason we do it is because, you know,

18:24.200 --> 18:26.440
 we are in the arms race, you know,

18:26.440 --> 18:28.240
 our vaccines are in the arms race

18:28.240 --> 18:32.480
 with constantly changing virus, right?

18:32.480 --> 18:37.480
 Now, if the next pandemic, influenza pandemic

18:38.280 --> 18:43.280
 will occur, most likely this vaccine would not save us, right?

18:43.280 --> 18:47.680
 Although it's, it's, you know, it's the same virus

18:47.680 --> 18:49.440
 might be different strain.

18:51.840 --> 18:56.840
 So if we're able to essentially design a vaccine

18:56.840 --> 19:00.480
 against, you know, influenza A virus,

19:00.480 --> 19:01.840
 no matter what's the strain,

19:01.840 --> 19:06.840
 no matter which species did it jump from,

19:07.280 --> 19:09.720
 that would be, I think that would be

19:09.720 --> 19:14.000
 a huge, huge progress and advancement.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.200
 You mentioned smallpox until the seventies

19:17.200 --> 19:19.280
 might have been something that you would be worried

19:19.280 --> 19:20.720
 the most about.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.640
 What about these days?

19:22.640 --> 19:27.640
 Well, we're sitting here in the middle of a COVID 19 pandemic,

19:28.480 --> 19:30.960
 but these days, nevertheless,

19:30.960 --> 19:33.480
 what is your biggest worry virus wise?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.680
 What are you keeping your eye out on?

19:36.680 --> 19:41.680
 It looks like, you know, based on the past several years

19:43.760 --> 19:48.240
 of the new viruses emerging,

19:48.240 --> 19:53.240
 I think we're still dealing with

19:53.280 --> 19:55.400
 different types of influenza.

19:55.400 --> 20:00.400
 I mean, so the H7N9 avian flu that emerged,

20:00.400 --> 20:03.280
 I think a couple of years ago in China,

20:03.280 --> 20:08.280
 I think the mortality rate was incredible.

20:08.680 --> 20:13.680
 I mean, it was, you know, I think above 30%, you know,

20:13.960 --> 20:15.400
 so this is huge.

20:15.400 --> 20:20.400
 I mean, luckily for us, this strain was not pandemic.

20:21.360 --> 20:25.040
 All right, so it was jumping from birds to human

20:25.040 --> 20:29.040
 and then it was jumping from birds to humans

20:29.040 --> 20:33.680
 to human, but I don't think it was actually transmittable

20:33.680 --> 20:35.240
 between the humans.

20:35.240 --> 20:38.720
 And, you know, this is actually a very interesting question

20:38.720 --> 20:42.640
 which scientists try to understand, right?

20:42.640 --> 20:44.640
 So the balance, the delicate balance

20:44.640 --> 20:48.240
 between the virus being very contagious, right?

20:48.240 --> 20:53.240
 So efficient in spreading and virus to be very pathogenic,

20:53.240 --> 20:58.240
 you know, causing, you know, harms, you know,

21:01.960 --> 21:05.320
 and deaths to their hosts.

21:05.320 --> 21:10.320
 So it looks like that the more pathogenic the virus is,

21:11.560 --> 21:13.120
 the less contagious it is.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.720
 Is that a property of biology or what is it?

21:17.720 --> 21:19.560
 I don't have an answer to that.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.880
 And I think this is still an open question,

21:22.880 --> 21:25.920
 but, you know, if you look at, you know,

21:26.760 --> 21:29.680
 with the coronavirus, for example, if you look at,

21:29.680 --> 21:34.400
 you know, the deadlier relative, MERS,

21:34.400 --> 21:38.080
 MERS was never a pandemic virus.

21:39.840 --> 21:40.680
 Right.

21:40.680 --> 21:44.800
 But the, you know, again, the mortality rate from MERS

21:44.800 --> 21:49.800
 is far above, you know, I think 20 or 30%, so.

21:49.800 --> 21:54.800
 So whatever is making this all happen,

21:55.360 --> 21:59.920
 doesn't want us dead because it's balancing out nicely.

21:59.920 --> 22:03.560
 I mean, how do you explain that we're not dead yet?

22:06.320 --> 22:08.840
 Like, because there's so many viruses

22:08.840 --> 22:11.480
 and they're so good at what they do.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.440
 Why do they keep us alive?

22:14.520 --> 22:18.760
 I mean, we also have, you know, a lot of protection, right?

22:18.760 --> 22:22.080
 So with the immune system, and so,

22:24.000 --> 22:29.000
 I mean, we do have, you know, ways to fight

22:29.640 --> 22:31.680
 against those viruses.

22:31.680 --> 22:36.000
 And I think with the, now we're much better equipped, right?

22:36.000 --> 22:39.880
 So with the discoveries of vaccines and, you know,

22:39.880 --> 22:44.120
 there are vaccines against the viruses

22:44.120 --> 22:49.120
 that maybe 200 years ago would wipe us out completely.

22:50.440 --> 22:53.040
 But because of these vaccines, we are actually,

22:53.040 --> 22:56.400
 we are capable of eradicating pretty much fully

22:56.400 --> 22:58.880
 as is the case with smallpox.

22:58.880 --> 23:02.040
 So if we could, can we go to the basics a little bit

23:02.040 --> 23:05.000
 of the biology of the virus?

23:05.000 --> 23:08.120
 How does a virus infect the body?

23:08.120 --> 23:11.840
 So I think there are some key steps

23:11.840 --> 23:13.800
 that the virus needs to perform.

23:13.800 --> 23:16.080
 And of course, the first one,

23:16.080 --> 23:21.080
 the viral particle needs to get attached to the host cell.

23:22.360 --> 23:26.320
 In the case of coronavirus, there is a lot of evidence

23:26.320 --> 23:29.720
 that it actually interacts in the same way

23:30.840 --> 23:34.320
 of the, as the SARS coronavirus.

23:34.320 --> 23:39.400
 So it gets attached to AC2 human receptor.

23:39.400 --> 23:42.280
 And so there is, I mean, as we speak,

23:42.280 --> 23:45.720
 there is a growing number of papers suggesting it.

23:46.920 --> 23:51.120
 Moreover, most recent, I think most recent results

23:51.120 --> 23:56.120
 suggest that this virus attaches more efficiently

23:56.960 --> 24:00.680
 to this human receptor than SARS.

24:00.680 --> 24:02.920
 So just to sort of back off,

24:02.920 --> 24:07.000
 so there is a family viruses, the coronaviruses,

24:07.000 --> 24:09.440
 and SARS, whatever the heck, forgot,

24:09.440 --> 24:12.760
 this respiratory, whatever that stands for.

24:12.760 --> 24:17.240
 So SARS actually stands for the disease that you get

24:17.240 --> 24:19.560
 is the syndrome of acute respiratory.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.160
 So SARS is the first strand and then there's MERS.

24:25.160 --> 24:27.360
 MERS is also that family.

24:27.360 --> 24:31.360
 And there is, yes, people, scientists actually know

24:31.360 --> 24:32.520
 more than three strands.

24:32.520 --> 24:37.520
 I mean, so there is the MHV strain,

24:37.520 --> 24:42.520
 which is considered to be a canonical model,

24:43.560 --> 24:46.240
 disease model in mice.

24:47.160 --> 24:50.640
 And so there is a lot of work done on this virus

24:50.640 --> 24:52.480
 because it's...

24:52.480 --> 24:54.000
 But it hasn't jumped to humans yet?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.600
 No, no, it's fascinating.

24:57.800 --> 25:01.240
 So, and then you mentioned AC2.

25:01.240 --> 25:06.240
 So when you say attach, proteins are involved on both sides.

25:06.240 --> 25:07.080
 Both sides.

25:07.080 --> 25:11.560
 Yes, so we have this infamous spike protein

25:11.560 --> 25:15.280
 on the surface of the virion particle

25:15.280 --> 25:16.920
 and it does look like a spike.

25:16.920 --> 25:20.880
 And I mean, that's essentially because of this protein,

25:20.880 --> 25:22.880
 we call the coronaviruses, coronaviruses,

25:22.880 --> 25:27.200
 so that what makes corona on top of the surface.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.640
 So this protein, it actually acts,

25:34.040 --> 25:35.400
 so it doesn't act alone.

25:35.400 --> 25:40.000
 But actually it makes a three copies

25:40.000 --> 25:42.840
 and it makes so called trimer.

25:42.840 --> 25:45.760
 So this trimer is essentially a functional unit,

25:45.760 --> 25:50.400
 a single functional unit that starts interacting

25:51.480 --> 25:54.800
 with the AC2 receptor.

25:54.800 --> 25:57.880
 So this is again, another protein that now sits

25:57.880 --> 26:02.880
 on the surface of a human cell or host cell, I would say.

26:02.880 --> 26:07.880
 And that's essentially, in that way,

26:08.560 --> 26:13.400
 the virus anchors itself to the host cell.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.920
 Because then it needs to actually,

26:16.920 --> 26:21.920
 it needs to get inside, it fuses its membrane

26:22.240 --> 26:27.240
 with the host membrane, it releases the key components,

26:27.720 --> 26:32.480
 it releases its RNA.

26:32.480 --> 26:37.480
 And then essentially hijacks the machinery of the cell

26:37.880 --> 26:42.880
 because none of the viruses that we know of

26:44.000 --> 26:48.080
 have ribosome, the machinery that allows us

26:48.080 --> 26:50.960
 to print out proteins.

26:50.960 --> 26:53.600
 So in order to print out proteins

26:53.600 --> 26:55.920
 that are necessary for functioning of this virus,

26:55.920 --> 27:00.320
 it actually needs to hijack the host ribosomes.

27:00.320 --> 27:04.400
 So virus is an RNA wrapped in a bunch of proteins,

27:04.400 --> 27:06.520
 one of which is this functional mechanism

27:06.520 --> 27:09.600
 of a spike protein that does the attachment in there.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.280
 So yeah, so if you look at this virus,

27:12.280 --> 27:15.360
 there are several basic components, right?

27:15.360 --> 27:18.280
 So we start with the spike protein.

27:18.280 --> 27:20.520
 This is not the only surface protein,

27:20.520 --> 27:22.560
 the protein that lives on the surface

27:22.560 --> 27:24.320
 of the viral particle.

27:24.320 --> 27:27.320
 So there is also perhaps the protein

27:27.320 --> 27:32.320
 with the highest number of copies is the membrane protein.

27:33.840 --> 27:38.320
 So it's essentially, it forms the capsule,

27:38.320 --> 27:43.320
 sorry, the envelope of the protein or of the viral particle

27:44.000 --> 27:49.000
 and essentially helps to maintain a certain curvature,

27:52.280 --> 27:54.720
 helps to make a certain curvature.

27:54.720 --> 27:59.680
 Then there is another protein called envelope protein

27:59.680 --> 28:01.160
 or E protein.

28:01.160 --> 28:05.960
 And it actually occurs in far less quantities.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.400
 And still there is an ongoing research

28:09.400 --> 28:13.840
 what exactly does this protein do?

28:13.840 --> 28:17.360
 So these are sort of the three major surface proteins

28:17.360 --> 28:22.240
 that make the viral envelope.

28:22.240 --> 28:24.760
 And when we go inside,

28:24.760 --> 28:28.080
 then we have another structural protein

28:28.080 --> 28:29.760
 called nuclear protein.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.240
 And the purpose of this protein

28:32.240 --> 28:34.840
 is to protect the viral RNA.

28:34.840 --> 28:38.240
 So it actually binds to the viral RNA, creates a capsid.

28:40.360 --> 28:43.600
 And so the rest of the viral information

28:43.600 --> 28:47.000
 is inside of this RNA.

28:47.000 --> 28:52.000
 And if you compare the amount of the genes

28:54.200 --> 28:57.920
 or proteins that are made of these genes,

28:58.800 --> 29:03.800
 it's significantly higher than of influenza virus,

29:04.120 --> 29:04.960
 for example.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.720
 Influenza virus has I think around eight or nine proteins

29:08.720 --> 29:13.160
 where this one has at least 29.

29:13.160 --> 29:16.800
 Wow, that has to do with the length of the RNA strand.

29:16.800 --> 29:17.640
 I mean, what?

29:17.640 --> 29:21.200
 So I mean, so it affects the length of the RNA strand,

29:21.200 --> 29:22.040
 right?

29:22.040 --> 29:24.920
 So because you essentially need to have

29:24.920 --> 29:27.320
 sort of the minimum amount of information

29:27.320 --> 29:29.440
 to encode those genes.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.000
 How many proteins did you say?

29:31.000 --> 29:31.840
 29.

29:31.840 --> 29:34.080
 29 proteins.

29:34.080 --> 29:34.920
 Yes.

29:34.920 --> 29:39.400
 So this is something definitely interesting

29:39.400 --> 29:42.160
 because believe it or not,

29:42.160 --> 29:47.160
 we've been studying coronaviruses for over two decades.

29:47.320 --> 29:52.320
 We've yet to uncover all functionalities of its proteins.

29:52.360 --> 29:54.520
 Could we maybe take a small tangent

29:54.520 --> 29:59.520
 and can you say how one would try to figure out

29:59.640 --> 30:02.160
 what a function of a particular protein is?

30:03.360 --> 30:06.880
 So you've mentioned people are still trying to figure out

30:06.880 --> 30:09.320
 what the function of the envelope protein might be

30:09.320 --> 30:11.920
 or what's the process?

30:11.920 --> 30:15.280
 So this is where the research

30:15.280 --> 30:19.360
 that computational scientists do might be of help

30:19.360 --> 30:24.200
 because in the past several decades

30:24.200 --> 30:28.960
 we actually have collected pretty decent amount of knowledge

30:28.960 --> 30:33.360
 about different proteins in different viruses.

30:34.440 --> 30:37.800
 So what we can actually try to do,

30:37.800 --> 30:42.800
 and this could be our first lead to a possible function,

30:45.200 --> 30:47.160
 is to see whether those,

30:47.160 --> 30:50.640
 say we have this genome of the coronavirus

30:50.640 --> 30:52.880
 or of the novel coronavirus

30:52.880 --> 30:57.320
 and we identify the potential proteins.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.960
 Then in order to infer the function,

30:58.960 --> 31:01.080
 what we can do we can actually see

31:01.080 --> 31:04.320
 whether those proteins are similar

31:04.320 --> 31:08.960
 to those ones that we already know, okay?

31:08.960 --> 31:11.880
 In such a way we can, for example,

31:11.880 --> 31:15.640
 clearly identify some critical components

31:15.640 --> 31:19.480
 that RNA polymerase or different types of proteases,

31:19.480 --> 31:22.000
 these are the proteins that essentially

31:23.560 --> 31:26.200
 clip the protein sequences.

31:27.760 --> 31:31.640
 And so this works in many cases.

31:31.640 --> 31:36.520
 However, in some cases you have truly novel proteins

31:36.520 --> 31:41.040
 and this is a much more difficult task.

31:41.040 --> 31:45.000
 Now as a small pause, when you say similar,

31:45.000 --> 31:46.800
 like what if some parts are different

31:46.800 --> 31:48.800
 and some parts are similar?

31:48.800 --> 31:51.360
 Like how do you disentangle that?

31:52.280 --> 31:53.960
 You know, it's a big question.

31:53.960 --> 31:57.480
 Of course, you know, what bioinformatics does,

31:58.400 --> 32:00.000
 it does predictions, right?

32:00.000 --> 32:04.400
 So those predictions, they have to be validated

32:04.400 --> 32:05.560
 by experiments.

32:05.560 --> 32:08.120
 Functional or structural predictions?

32:08.120 --> 32:10.800
 Both, I mean, we do structural predictions,

32:10.800 --> 32:12.080
 we do functional predictions,

32:12.080 --> 32:14.840
 we do interactions predictions.

32:14.840 --> 32:15.680
 Oh, so this is interesting.

32:15.680 --> 32:18.640
 So you just generate a lot of predictions,

32:18.640 --> 32:21.120
 like reasonable predictions based on structure

32:21.120 --> 32:23.560
 and function interaction, like you said.

32:23.560 --> 32:25.880
 And then here you go.

32:25.880 --> 32:30.360
 That's the power of bioinformatics is data grounded,

32:30.360 --> 32:33.040
 good predictions of what should happen.

32:33.040 --> 32:38.040
 So in the way I see it, we're helping

32:38.160 --> 32:40.560
 experimental scientists to streamline

32:40.560 --> 32:42.040
 their discovery process.

32:43.160 --> 32:44.960
 And the experimental scientists,

32:44.960 --> 32:47.360
 is that what a virologist is?

32:47.360 --> 32:51.200
 So virology is one of the experimental sciences

32:51.200 --> 32:53.720
 that focus on viruses.

32:53.720 --> 32:57.960
 They often work with other experimental scientists.

32:57.960 --> 33:02.080
 For example, the molecular imaging scientists, right?

33:02.080 --> 33:07.080
 So the viruses often can be viewed and reconstructed

33:08.960 --> 33:12.200
 through electron microscopy techniques.

33:12.200 --> 33:14.200
 So but these are, you know, specialists

33:14.200 --> 33:16.960
 that are not necessary virologists,

33:16.960 --> 33:21.960
 they work with small particles,

33:21.960 --> 33:26.960
 whether it's viruses or it's an organelle

33:27.320 --> 33:32.320
 of a human cell, whether it's a complex molecular machinery.

33:33.880 --> 33:37.800
 So the techniques that are used are very similar

33:37.800 --> 33:42.320
 in their essence.

33:42.320 --> 33:47.280
 And so yeah, so typically we see it now,

33:47.280 --> 33:52.280
 the research on, you know,

33:53.600 --> 33:58.280
 that is emerging and that is needed,

33:58.280 --> 34:03.280
 often involves the collaborations between virologists,

34:03.280 --> 34:06.960
 you know, biochemists,

34:10.280 --> 34:14.160
 people from pharmaceutical sciences,

34:14.160 --> 34:16.240
 computational sciences.

34:16.240 --> 34:19.400
 So we have to work, you know, together.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.440
 So from my perspective, just to step back,

34:21.440 --> 34:23.640
 sometimes I look at this stuff,

34:23.640 --> 34:27.400
 just how much we understand about RNA and DNA,

34:27.400 --> 34:28.680
 how much we understand about protein,

34:28.680 --> 34:32.280
 like your work, the amount of proteins

34:32.280 --> 34:33.840
 that you're exploring,

34:34.720 --> 34:38.000
 is it surprising to you that we were able,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.720
 we descendants of apes were able to figure all of this out?

34:41.720 --> 34:46.520
 Like how, so you're a computer scientist.

34:46.520 --> 34:49.520
 So for me, from computer science perspective,

34:49.520 --> 34:52.120
 I know how to write a Python program, things are clear,

34:52.120 --> 34:54.480
 but biology is a giant mess.

34:55.480 --> 34:58.600
 It feels like to me, from an outsider's perspective,

34:58.600 --> 35:01.680
 is how surprising is it, amazing is it,

35:01.680 --> 35:04.600
 that we were able to figure this stuff out?

35:04.600 --> 35:06.720
 You know, if you look at the, you know,

35:06.720 --> 35:11.080
 how computational science and computer science

35:11.080 --> 35:12.680
 was evolving, right?

35:12.680 --> 35:14.560
 I think it was just a matter of time

35:14.560 --> 35:16.920
 that we would approach biology.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.240
 So we started from, you know,

35:19.240 --> 35:24.240
 applications to much more fundamental systems, physics,

35:24.880 --> 35:29.240
 you know, and now we are, or, you know,

35:29.240 --> 35:32.560
 small chemical compounds, right?

35:32.560 --> 35:36.240
 So now we are approaching

35:36.240 --> 35:39.800
 the more complex biological systems.

35:39.800 --> 35:43.240
 And I think it's a natural evolution

35:43.240 --> 35:48.240
 of, you know, of the computer science, of mathematics.

35:48.520 --> 35:50.200
 So sure, that's the computer science side.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.520
 I just meant, even in higher levels,

35:52.520 --> 35:54.120
 so that to me is surprising,

35:54.120 --> 35:57.560
 that computer science can offer help in this messy world,

35:57.560 --> 35:59.440
 but it just means it's incredible

35:59.440 --> 36:02.000
 that the biologists and the chemists

36:02.000 --> 36:03.200
 can figure all this out,

36:03.200 --> 36:04.720
 or is that just something ridiculous to you,

36:04.720 --> 36:07.800
 that of course they would.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.360
 It just seems like a very complicated set of problems,

36:10.360 --> 36:13.720
 like the variety of the kinds of things

36:13.720 --> 36:15.880
 that could be produced in the body.

36:15.880 --> 36:19.320
 The, just like you said, 29, I mean,

36:19.320 --> 36:24.320
 just getting a hand of, a hang of it so quickly,

36:24.560 --> 36:27.240
 it just seems impossible to me.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.720
 I agree, I mean, it's, and I have to say,

36:29.720 --> 36:33.840
 we are, you know, in the very, very beginning of this journey.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.280
 I mean, we've yet to, I mean,

36:37.280 --> 36:39.280
 we've yet to comprehend,

36:39.280 --> 36:44.280
 not even try to understand and figure out all the details,

36:44.960 --> 36:49.960
 but we've yet to comprehend the complexity of the cell.

36:51.360 --> 36:55.080
 We know that neuroscience is not even

36:55.080 --> 36:57.920
 at the beginning of understanding the human mind.

36:59.560 --> 37:03.360
 So where's biology set in terms of understanding

37:03.360 --> 37:08.360
 the function, deeply understanding the function of viruses

37:08.600 --> 37:10.320
 and cells?

37:10.320 --> 37:12.800
 So there, sometimes it's easy to say,

37:12.800 --> 37:14.360
 when you talk about function,

37:14.360 --> 37:18.520
 what you really refer to is perhaps not a deep understanding,

37:18.520 --> 37:22.080
 but more of a understanding sufficient to be able

37:22.080 --> 37:25.000
 to mess with it using a antivirus,

37:25.000 --> 37:29.680
 like mess with it chemically to prevent some of its function.

37:29.680 --> 37:31.400
 Or do you understand the function?

37:31.400 --> 37:34.560
 Well, I think, I think we are much further

37:34.560 --> 37:39.480
 in terms of understanding of the complex genetic disorder,

37:39.480 --> 37:42.680
 such as cancer, where you have layers of complexity.

37:42.680 --> 37:45.640
 And we, you know, as in my laboratory,

37:45.640 --> 37:47.680
 we're trying to contribute to that research,

37:47.680 --> 37:50.200
 but we're also, you know, we're overwhelmed

37:50.200 --> 37:53.200
 with how many different layers of complexity,

37:53.200 --> 37:56.560
 different layers of mechanisms

37:56.560 --> 38:00.160
 that can be hijacked by cancer simultaneously.

38:00.160 --> 38:05.160
 And so, you know, I think biology in the past 20 years,

38:07.680 --> 38:11.160
 again, from the perspective of the outsider,

38:11.160 --> 38:12.920
 because I'm not a biologist,

38:12.920 --> 38:17.920
 but I think it has advanced tremendously.

38:17.920 --> 38:22.920
 And one thing that where computational scientists

38:22.920 --> 38:27.920
 and data scientists are now becoming very,

38:27.920 --> 38:32.920
 very helpful is in the fact,

38:33.960 --> 38:37.320
 it's coming from the fact that we are now able

38:37.320 --> 38:42.320
 to generate a lot of information about the cell,

38:43.920 --> 38:48.200
 whether it's next generation sequencing or transcriptomics,

38:48.200 --> 38:53.200
 whether it's life imaging information where it is,

38:53.560 --> 38:56.760
 you know, complex interactions

38:56.760 --> 38:59.080
 between proteins or between proteins

38:59.080 --> 39:02.080
 and small molecules, such as drugs.

39:02.080 --> 39:07.080
 We are becoming very efficient in generating this information.

39:07.920 --> 39:12.280
 And now the next step is to become equally efficient

39:12.280 --> 39:16.440
 in processing this information

39:16.440 --> 39:19.760
 and extracting the key knowledge from that.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.080
 That could then be validated with experiment back.

39:24.080 --> 39:24.920
 Yes.

39:24.920 --> 39:26.680
 So maybe then going all the way back,

39:26.680 --> 39:30.600
 we were talking, you said the first step is seeing

39:30.600 --> 39:34.080
 if we can match the new proteins you found in the virus

39:34.080 --> 39:35.480
 against something we've seen before

39:35.480 --> 39:37.600
 to figure out its function.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.400
 And then you also mentioned that,

39:39.400 --> 39:42.680
 but there could be cases where it's a totally new protein.

39:42.680 --> 39:45.360
 Is there something bioinformatics can offer

39:45.360 --> 39:47.160
 when it's a totally new protein?

39:48.360 --> 39:50.480
 This is where many of the methods,

39:50.480 --> 39:52.440
 and you're probably aware of, you know,

39:52.440 --> 39:54.400
 the case of machine learning,

39:54.400 --> 39:59.400
 many of these methods rely on the previous knowledge, right?

40:00.560 --> 40:05.320
 So things that where we try to do from scratch

40:05.320 --> 40:08.360
 are incredibly difficult, you know,

40:08.360 --> 40:10.480
 something that we call ab initio.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.920
 And this is, I mean, it's not just the function.

40:12.920 --> 40:16.960
 I mean, you know, we have yet to have a robust method

40:16.960 --> 40:21.240
 to predict the structures of these proteins in ab initio.

40:21.240 --> 40:26.240
 You know, by not using any templates

40:29.000 --> 40:32.040
 of other related proteins.

40:32.040 --> 40:36.200
 So protein is a chain of amino acids.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.600
 It's residues.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.200
 Residues, yeah.

40:39.200 --> 40:44.200
 And then somehow, magically, maybe you can tell me,

40:44.720 --> 40:47.560
 they seem to fold in incredibly weird

40:47.560 --> 40:49.320
 and complicated 3D shapes.

40:49.320 --> 40:50.800
 Yes.

40:50.800 --> 40:51.640
 So,

40:53.640 --> 40:57.080
 and that's where actually the idea of protein folding,

40:57.080 --> 40:58.880
 or just not the idea, but the problem

40:58.880 --> 41:01.840
 of figuring out how the concept, yeah,

41:01.840 --> 41:05.120
 how they fold into those weird shapes comes in.

41:05.120 --> 41:09.240
 So that's another side of computational work.

41:09.240 --> 41:11.720
 So can you describe what protein folding

41:11.720 --> 41:13.680
 from the computational side is,

41:13.680 --> 41:16.800
 and maybe your thoughts on the folding at home efforts

41:16.800 --> 41:20.680
 that a lot of people know that you can use your machine to...

41:20.680 --> 41:21.520
 Oh, yeah.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.640
 To do protein folding.

41:22.640 --> 41:25.080
 So yeah, protein folding is, you know,

41:25.080 --> 41:30.080
 one of those $1 million price challenges, right?

41:30.720 --> 41:35.400
 So the reason for that is we've yet to understand

41:35.400 --> 41:40.400
 precisely how the protein gets folded so efficiently

41:42.600 --> 41:46.520
 to the point that in many cases where you, you know,

41:46.520 --> 41:50.160
 where you try to unfold it due to the high temperature,

41:50.160 --> 41:54.200
 it actually folds back into its original state, right?

41:54.200 --> 41:59.200
 So we know a lot about the mechanisms, right?

41:59.360 --> 42:03.200
 But putting those mechanisms together

42:04.680 --> 42:09.680
 and making sense, it's a computationly very expensive task.

42:11.280 --> 42:14.240
 In general, do proteins fold,

42:14.240 --> 42:16.880
 can they fold in arbitrary large number of ways

42:16.880 --> 42:19.400
 or do they usually fold in a very small number of ways?

42:19.400 --> 42:23.080
 It's typically, I mean, we tend to think that, you know,

42:23.080 --> 42:26.880
 there is a one sort of canonical fold for a protein.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.320
 Although there are many cases where the proteins,

42:30.320 --> 42:32.400
 you know, upon destabilization,

42:32.400 --> 42:35.720
 it can be folded into a different confirmation.

42:36.680 --> 42:41.120
 And this is especially true when you look at sort of

42:41.120 --> 42:46.120
 proteins that include more than one structural unit.

42:46.160 --> 42:49.240
 So those structural units, we call them protein domains.

42:49.240 --> 42:53.680
 Essentially, protein domain is a single unit

42:53.680 --> 42:56.920
 that typically is evolutionary preserved,

42:56.920 --> 42:59.640
 that typically carries out a single function

42:59.640 --> 43:04.480
 and typically has a very distinct fold, right?

43:04.480 --> 43:07.200
 The structure, 3D structure organization.

43:07.200 --> 43:09.680
 But turns out that if you look at human,

43:09.680 --> 43:12.600
 an average protein in a human cell

43:12.600 --> 43:19.600
 would have a bit of two or three such subunits.

43:19.600 --> 43:25.560
 And how they are trying to fold into the sort of,

43:25.560 --> 43:30.440
 you know, next level fold, right?

43:30.440 --> 43:33.840
 So within subunit, there's folding and then...

43:33.840 --> 43:39.000
 And then they fold into the larger 3D structure, right?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.040
 And all of that, there's some understanding

43:41.040 --> 43:43.520
 of the basic mechanisms, but not to put together

43:43.520 --> 43:44.880
 to be able to fold it.

43:44.880 --> 43:47.280
 We're still, I mean, we're still struggling.

43:47.280 --> 43:51.160
 I mean, we're getting pretty good about folding

43:51.160 --> 43:55.920
 relatively small proteins up to 100 residues.

43:55.920 --> 44:00.560
 Yes, I mean, but we're still far away from folding,

44:00.560 --> 44:02.360
 you know, larger proteins.

44:02.360 --> 44:06.080
 And some of them are notoriously difficult.

44:06.080 --> 44:07.840
 For example, transmembrane proteins,

44:07.840 --> 44:13.280
 these proteins that sit in the membranes of the cell,

44:13.280 --> 44:16.360
 they're incredibly important,

44:16.360 --> 44:19.640
 but they are incredibly difficult to solve.

44:19.640 --> 44:23.000
 And so basically, there's a lot of degrees of freedom,

44:23.000 --> 44:26.120
 how it folds, and so it's a combinatorial problem

44:26.120 --> 44:27.360
 where it just explodes.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.920
 There's so many dimensions.

44:28.920 --> 44:31.280
 Well, it is a combinatorial problem,

44:31.280 --> 44:34.200
 but it doesn't mean that we cannot approach it

44:34.200 --> 44:39.760
 from the not from the brute force approach.

44:39.760 --> 44:43.840
 And so the machine learning approaches,

44:43.840 --> 44:47.440
 you know, have been emerged that try to tackle it.

44:47.440 --> 44:51.560
 So folding at home, I don't know how familiar you are with it,

44:51.560 --> 44:55.120
 but is that use machine learning or is it more brute force?

44:55.120 --> 44:57.360
 No, so folding at home, it was originally,

44:57.360 --> 45:00.960
 and I remember I was a, I mean, it was a long time ago,

45:00.960 --> 45:05.840
 I was a postdoc, and we learned about this, you know,

45:05.840 --> 45:10.960
 this game, because it was originally designed as the game.

45:10.960 --> 45:15.200
 And we, you know, I took a look at it,

45:15.200 --> 45:19.240
 and it's interesting because it's really, you know,

45:19.240 --> 45:22.520
 it's very transparent, very intuitive.

45:22.520 --> 45:27.440
 So, and from what I heard, I've yet to introduce it to my son,

45:27.440 --> 45:33.080
 but, you know, kids are actually getting very good at folding the proteins.

45:33.080 --> 45:39.680
 And it was, you know, it came to me as the,

45:39.680 --> 45:45.640
 not as a surprise, but actually as the sort of manifest of,

45:45.640 --> 45:50.760
 you know, our capacity to do this kind of,

45:50.760 --> 45:56.960
 to solve this kind of problems when a paper was published,

45:56.960 --> 46:01.600
 published in one of these top journals,

46:01.600 --> 46:07.440
 with the authors being the actual players of this game.

46:07.440 --> 46:15.360
 So, and what happened is, was that they managed to get better structures

46:15.360 --> 46:18.560
 than the scientists themselves.

46:18.560 --> 46:23.680
 So, so that, you know, that was very, I mean,

46:23.680 --> 46:29.360
 it was kind of profound, you know, revelation that

46:29.360 --> 46:35.600
 problems that are so challenging for a computational science,

46:35.600 --> 46:38.080
 maybe not that challenging for a human brain.

46:38.080 --> 46:43.040
 Well, that's a really good, that's a hopeful message always when

46:43.040 --> 46:48.640
 there's a, the proof of existence,

46:48.640 --> 46:52.400
 the existence proof that it's possible, that's really interesting.

46:52.400 --> 46:58.240
 But it seems, what are the best ways to do protein folding now?

46:58.240 --> 47:02.640
 So, if you look at what DeepMind does with AlphaFold.

47:02.640 --> 47:03.920
 AlphaFold, yes.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.480
 So, they kind of, is that a learning approach?

47:06.480 --> 47:07.840
 What's your sense?

47:07.840 --> 47:10.080
 I mean, your background is in machine learning,

47:10.080 --> 47:12.960
 but is this a learnable problem?

47:12.960 --> 47:14.320
 Is this still a brute force?

47:14.320 --> 47:19.200
 Are we in the, Gary Kasparov, Deep Blue Days?

47:19.200 --> 47:24.480
 Are we in the AlphaGo playing the game of go days of folding?

47:24.480 --> 47:28.880
 Well, I think we are, we are advancing towards this direction.

47:28.880 --> 47:32.480
 I mean, if you look, so there is sort of Olympic game

47:32.480 --> 47:35.600
 for protein folders called CASP.

47:35.600 --> 47:39.760
 And it's essentially, it's, you know, it's a competition where

47:41.200 --> 47:47.440
 different teams are given exactly the same protein sequences

47:47.440 --> 47:50.640
 and they try to predict their structures, right?

47:50.640 --> 47:54.960
 And of course, there are different sort of sub tasks,

47:55.680 --> 48:01.920
 but in the recent competition, AlphaFold was among the top performing teams,

48:01.920 --> 48:03.920
 if not the top performing team.

48:04.960 --> 48:12.960
 So, there is definitely a benefit from the data that have been generated,

48:13.760 --> 48:17.200
 you know, in the past several decades, the structural data.

48:17.200 --> 48:23.120
 And certainly, you know, we are now at the capacity

48:24.000 --> 48:28.160
 to summarize this data, to generalize this data,

48:28.160 --> 48:34.000
 and to use those principles, you know, in order to predict protein structures.

48:34.000 --> 48:38.480
 That's one of the really cool things here is there's, maybe you can comment on it.

48:38.480 --> 48:41.440
 There seems to be these open data sets of protein.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.560
 How did that, what that?

48:44.560 --> 48:48.240
 Protein data bank? Yeah, protein data bank.

48:48.240 --> 48:49.520
 I mean, that's great.

48:49.520 --> 48:52.320
 Is this a recent thing for just the coronavirus?

48:52.320 --> 48:53.360
 Or has this been a?

48:53.360 --> 48:55.600
 It's been for many, many years.

48:56.160 --> 49:01.360
 I believe the first protein data bank was designed on flashcards.

49:01.360 --> 49:16.400
 So, yes, this is a great example of the community efforts of everyone contributing,

49:16.400 --> 49:23.920
 because every time you solve a protein or a protein complex, this is where you submit it.

49:23.920 --> 49:30.960
 And, you know, the scientists get access to it.

49:30.960 --> 49:33.040
 Scientists get to test it.

49:33.840 --> 49:41.600
 And we, by informaticians, use this information to, you know, to make predictions.

49:42.640 --> 49:48.080
 So there's no, there's no culture of like hoarding discoveries here.

49:48.080 --> 49:54.880
 So that's good, I mean, you've, you've released a few or a bunch of proteins that are matching

49:54.880 --> 49:57.280
 with whatever we'll talk about details a little bit.

49:57.280 --> 50:06.480
 But it's kind of amazing that that's the, it's kind of amazing how open the culture here is.

50:07.200 --> 50:08.080
 It is.

50:08.080 --> 50:21.040
 And I think this pandemic actually demonstrated the ability of scientific community to, you know,

50:21.040 --> 50:23.760
 to solve this challenge collaboratively.

50:23.760 --> 50:32.240
 And this is, I think, if anything, it actually moved us to a brand new level of collaborations

50:32.240 --> 50:39.440
 of the efficiency in which people establish new collaborations in, in which people

50:41.120 --> 50:42.720
 offer their help to each other.

50:42.720 --> 50:44.640
 Scientists offer their help to each other.

50:44.640 --> 50:45.760
 And publish results too.

50:45.760 --> 50:47.040
 It's very interesting.

50:47.040 --> 50:51.520
 We're now trying to figure out, as a few journals that are trying to sort of do the very

50:52.080 --> 50:55.920
 accelerated review cycle, but so many preprints.

50:55.920 --> 50:57.920
 So just posting a paper going out.

50:57.920 --> 51:03.360
 I think it's fundamentally changing the way we think about papers.

51:03.360 --> 51:04.160
 Yes.

51:04.160 --> 51:12.320
 I mean, the way we think about knowledge, let's say, yes, because, yes, I completely agree.

51:12.320 --> 51:24.240
 I think now it's, the knowledge is becoming sort of the core value, not the paper or the

51:24.240 --> 51:26.400
 journal where this knowledge is published.

51:26.400 --> 51:36.400
 And I think this is, again, this, we are living in the times where it becomes really

51:36.400 --> 51:42.400
 crystallized, that the idea that the most important value is in the knowledge.

51:42.400 --> 51:46.880
 So maybe you can comment, like, what do you think the future of that knowledge sharing

51:46.880 --> 51:46.880
 looks like?

51:46.880 --> 51:52.000
 So you have this paper that I hope we get a chance to talk about a little bit, but it

51:52.000 --> 51:57.520
 has, like, a really nice abstract and introduction related, like, it has all the usual, I mean,

51:57.520 --> 51:59.680
 probably took a long time to put together.

52:00.720 --> 52:08.160
 So, but is that going to remain, like, you could have communicated a lot of fundamental

52:08.160 --> 52:15.120
 ideas here in much shorter amount that's less traditionally acceptable by the journal context.

52:15.120 --> 52:25.040
 So, so, well, you know, so the first version that we posted, not even on a bio archive,

52:25.040 --> 52:33.520
 because bio archive back then, it was essentially, you know, overwhelmed with the number of

52:33.520 --> 52:34.160
 submissions.

52:34.160 --> 52:40.880
 So our submission, I think it took five or six days to just for it to be screened and

52:41.920 --> 52:43.920
 put online.

52:43.920 --> 52:50.480
 So we, you know, essentially, we put the first preprint on our website.

52:50.480 --> 52:55.440
 And, you know, it was it started getting accessed right away.

52:57.280 --> 53:05.440
 So, and, you know, so this original preprint was in a much rougher shape than this paper.

53:05.440 --> 53:16.480
 And, but we tried, I mean, we honestly tried to be as compact as possible with, you know,

53:16.480 --> 53:25.680
 introducing the, the information that is necessary that to explain our, you know, our results.

53:27.120 --> 53:29.520
 So maybe we can dive right in if it's okay.

53:29.520 --> 53:29.920
 Sure.

53:29.920 --> 53:35.760
 So it's a paper called Structural Genomics of SARS Co, how do you even pronounce?

53:35.760 --> 53:36.960
 SARS Cov2.

53:36.960 --> 53:37.920
 Cov2.

53:37.920 --> 53:38.160
 Yeah.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.840
 By the way, COVID is such a terrible name, but it's stuck.

53:42.480 --> 53:49.440
 Anyway, SARS Cov2 indicates evolutionary conserved functional regions of viral proteins.

53:50.320 --> 53:58.400
 So this is looking at all kinds of proteins that are part of the, this novel coronavirus and

53:58.400 --> 54:02.400
 how they match up against the previous other kinds of coronaviruses.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.080
 I mean, there's a lot of beautiful figures.

54:04.080 --> 54:08.720
 I was wondering if you could, I mean, there's so many questions I could ask her, but maybe at the,

54:09.600 --> 54:11.840
 how do you get started at doing this paper?

54:11.840 --> 54:16.240
 So how do you start to figure out the 3D structure of a novel virus?

54:16.240 --> 54:16.640
 Yes.

54:16.640 --> 54:19.920
 So there is actually a little story behind it.

54:20.640 --> 54:28.160
 And so the story actually dated back in September of 2019.

54:28.160 --> 54:34.480
 And you probably remember that back then we had another dangerous virus, triple E virus.

54:35.280 --> 54:38.720
 It's Eastern, queen encephalitis virus.

54:39.360 --> 54:41.760
 And can you maybe linger on it?

54:41.760 --> 54:45.920
 I have to admit, I was sadly completely unaware.

54:45.920 --> 54:52.800
 So that was actually a virus outbreak that happened in New England only.

54:52.800 --> 54:58.560
 The danger in this virus was that it actually targeted your brain.

54:58.560 --> 55:11.280
 So the word death from this virus, it was transfer, the main vector was mosquitoes.

55:12.240 --> 55:18.800
 And obviously full time is the time where you have a lot of them in New England.

55:18.800 --> 55:26.960
 And on one hand, people realize this is actually a very dangerous thing.

55:26.960 --> 55:31.520
 So it had an impact on the local economy.

55:33.040 --> 55:37.600
 The schools were closed past six o clock.

55:37.600 --> 55:44.000
 No activities outside for the kids because the kids were suffering quite tremendously

55:44.000 --> 55:47.440
 from when infected from this virus.

55:47.440 --> 55:49.840
 How do I not know about this?

55:49.840 --> 55:52.080
 Was the universities impacted?

55:52.080 --> 55:53.280
 It was in the news.

55:53.280 --> 56:00.000
 I mean, it was not impacted to a high degree in Boston necessarily,

56:00.000 --> 56:07.680
 but in the Metro West area and actually spread around, I think, all the way to New Hampshire,

56:07.680 --> 56:08.560
 Connecticut.

56:09.120 --> 56:10.880
 And you mentioned affecting the brain.

56:10.880 --> 56:13.440
 That's one other comment we should make.

56:13.440 --> 56:17.360
 So you mentioned AC2 for the coronavirus.

56:18.080 --> 56:22.560
 So these viruses kind of attached to something in the body.

56:23.680 --> 56:30.640
 So it essentially attaches to these proteins in those cells in the body,

56:30.640 --> 56:35.600
 where those proteins are expressed, where they actually have them in abundance.

56:35.600 --> 56:38.640
 So sometimes that could be in the lungs, that could be in the brain.

56:38.640 --> 56:48.480
 So I think what they, right now, from what I read, they have the epithelial cells

56:49.760 --> 56:50.880
 inside.

56:50.880 --> 56:57.120
 So the cells essentially inside the cells that are covering the surface.

56:58.160 --> 57:06.320
 So inside the nasal surfaces, the throat, the lung cells.

57:06.320 --> 57:13.520
 And I believe liver as a couple of other organs where they are actually expressed in abundance.

57:13.520 --> 57:15.120
 That's for the AC2, you said?

57:15.120 --> 57:16.960
 For the AC2 receptors.

57:16.960 --> 57:18.880
 So okay, so back to the story.

57:18.880 --> 57:20.800
 So yes, in the fall.

57:20.800 --> 57:29.520
 So now the impact of this virus is significant.

57:29.520 --> 57:38.560
 However, it's a pre local problem to the point that, you know, this is something that we would call a neglected disease.

57:39.280 --> 57:52.320
 Because it's not big enough to make, you know, the drug design companies to design a new antiviral or a new vaccine.

57:52.320 --> 58:03.520
 It's not big enough to generate a lot of grants from the nation of funding agencies.

58:04.720 --> 58:08.640
 So, so does it mean we cannot do anything about it?

58:09.440 --> 58:14.480
 And so what I did is I taught a bioinformatics class.

58:14.480 --> 58:26.000
 And it's in Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and we are very much a problem learning institution.

58:26.000 --> 58:31.920
 So I thought that that would be a perfect, you know, perfect project for the class.

58:31.920 --> 58:33.120
 It's an ongoing case study.

58:33.120 --> 58:46.720
 So I asked, you know, so I was essentially designed a study where we tried to use bioinformatics to understand as much as possible about this virus.

58:46.720 --> 59:06.560
 And a very substantial portion of the study was to understand the structures of the proteins, to understand how they interact with each other and with the host proteins, try to understand the evolution of this virus.

59:06.560 --> 59:29.280
 So obviously, you know, a very important question, how, where it will evolve further, how, you know, how it happened here, you know, so, so we did all these, you know, projects, and now I'm trying to put them into a paper where all these undergraduate students will be coauthors.

59:29.280 --> 59:52.560
 But essentially the projects were finished right about mid December and a couple of weeks later, I heard about this mysterious new virus that was discovered in, you know, was reported in Wuhan province and immediately I thought that, well, we just did that.

59:52.560 --> 59:59.040
 Can't we do the same thing with this virus?

59:59.040 --> 1:00:07.520
 And so we started waiting for the genome to be released, because that's essentially the first piece of information that is critical.

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:12.320
 Once you have the genome sequence, you can start doing a lot using bioinformatics.

1:00:12.320 --> 1:00:18.560
 When you say genome sequence, that's referring to the sequence of letters that make up the RNA?

1:00:18.560 --> 1:00:28.560
 Well, the sequence that make up the entire information encoded in the protein, right?

1:00:28.560 --> 1:00:34.560
 So that includes all 29 genes.

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:36.560
 What are genes?

1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:38.560
 What's the encoding of information?

1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:48.560
 So genes essentially is a basic functional unit that we can consider.

1:00:48.560 --> 1:00:52.560
 So each gene in the virus would correspond to a protein.

1:00:52.560 --> 1:00:56.560
 So gene by itself doesn't do it function.

1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:06.560
 It needs to be converted or translated into the protein that will become the actual functional unit.

1:01:06.560 --> 1:01:08.560
 Like you said, the printer.

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:10.560
 So we need the printer for that.

1:01:10.560 --> 1:01:12.560
 We need the printer.

1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:22.560
 So the first step is to figure out the genome, the sequence of things that could be then used for printing the protein.

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:30.560
 So then the next step, so once we have this, and so we use the existing information about SARS,

1:01:30.560 --> 1:01:38.560
 because the SARS genomics has been done in abundance.

1:01:38.560 --> 1:01:48.560
 So we have different strains of SARS and actually other related coronaviruses, MERS, the BAT coronavirus.

1:01:48.560 --> 1:01:56.560
 And we started by identifying the potential genes, because right now it's just a sequence, right?

1:01:56.560 --> 1:02:04.560
 So it's a sequence that is roughly, it's less than 30,000 nucleotide long.

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:06.560
 Just a raw sequence.

1:02:06.560 --> 1:02:08.560
 It's a raw sequence.

1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:10.560
 No other information really.

1:02:10.560 --> 1:02:22.560
 And we now need to define the boundaries of the genes that would then be used to identify the proteins and protein structures.

1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:24.560
 How hard is that problem?

1:02:24.560 --> 1:02:28.560
 I mean, it's pretty straightforward.

1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:36.560
 Because we use the existing information about SARS proteins and SARS genes.

1:02:36.560 --> 1:02:40.560
 So once again, we are relying on the, yes.

1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:54.560
 So, and then once we get there, this is where sort of the first more traditional bioinformatics step begins.

1:02:54.560 --> 1:03:04.560
 We're trying to use these protein sequences and get the 3D information about those proteins.

1:03:04.560 --> 1:03:16.560
 So this is where we are relying heavily on the structure information specifically from the protein data bank that we're talking about.

1:03:16.560 --> 1:03:18.560
 And here you're looking for similar proteins.

1:03:18.560 --> 1:03:20.560
 Yes.

1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:28.560
 So the concept that we are operating when we do this kind of modeling, it's called homology or template based modeling.

1:03:28.560 --> 1:03:44.560
 So essentially, using the concept that if you have two sequences that are similar in terms of the letters, the structures of these sequences are expected to be similar as well.

1:03:44.560 --> 1:03:48.560
 And this is at the micro, at the very local scale?

1:03:48.560 --> 1:03:50.560
 At the scale of the whole protein.

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:52.560
 At the whole protein.

1:03:52.560 --> 1:03:58.560
 Of course, the devil is in the details.

1:03:58.560 --> 1:04:12.560
 And this is why we need actually pre sophisticated modeling tools to do so.

1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:32.560
 If we had these structures of the individual proteins, we tried to see whether or not these proteins act alone, or they have to be forming protein complexes in order to perform this function.

1:04:32.560 --> 1:04:40.560
 And again, so this is sort of the next level of the modeling, because now you need to understand how proteins interact.

1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:54.560
 So in the case that the protein interacts with itself and makes sort of a a multimaric complex, the same protein just repeated multiple times.

1:04:54.560 --> 1:05:09.560
 And we have quite quite a few such proteins in SARS COVID to specifically spike protein needs three copies to function.

1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:14.560
 Envelope protein needs five copies to function.

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:18.560
 And there are some other multimaric complexes.

1:05:18.560 --> 1:05:22.560
 That's what you mean by interacting with itself and you see multiple copies.

1:05:22.560 --> 1:05:27.560
 So how do you make a good guess whether something's going to interact?

1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:29.560
 Well, again, so there are two approaches.

1:05:29.560 --> 1:05:40.560
 The one is look at the previously solved complexes. Now we're looking not at the individual structures, but the structures of the whole complex.

1:05:40.560 --> 1:05:43.560
 Complex is about multiple proteins.

1:05:43.560 --> 1:05:47.560
 Yes. So it's a bunch of proteins essentially glued together.

1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:49.560
 And when you say glue, that's the interaction.

1:05:49.560 --> 1:05:51.560
 That's the interaction.

1:05:51.560 --> 1:05:57.560
 So there are different forces, different sort of physical forces behind this.

1:05:57.560 --> 1:06:02.560
 Sorry to keep asking dumb questions, but is it is the glue?

1:06:02.560 --> 1:06:10.560
 Is that the interaction fundamentally structural or is it functional like in the way you're thinking about it?

1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:19.560
 That's actually a very good way to ask this question because turns out that the interaction is structural.

1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:27.560
 But in the way it forms the structure, it actually also carries out the function.

1:06:27.560 --> 1:06:35.560
 So interaction is often needed to carry out very specific function for a protein.

1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:43.560
 But in terms of on the roadside, figuring out you're really starting at the structure before you figure out the function.

1:06:43.560 --> 1:06:58.560
 So there's a beautiful figure two in the paper of all the different proteins that make up, able to figure out the new, the novel coronavirus.

1:06:58.560 --> 1:07:01.560
 What are we looking at?

1:07:01.560 --> 1:07:12.560
 So these are like, that's through the step two that you mentioned when you try to guess at the possible proteins.

1:07:12.560 --> 1:07:16.560
 That's what you're going to get is these blue cyan blobs.

1:07:16.560 --> 1:07:28.560
 Yes. So those are the individual proteins for which we have at least some information from the previous studies.

1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:31.560
 So there is advantage and disadvantage of using previous studies.

1:07:31.560 --> 1:07:40.560
 The biggest, well, the disadvantage is that we may not necessarily have the coverage of all 29 proteins.

1:07:40.560 --> 1:07:48.560
 However, the biggest advantage is that the accuracy in which we can model these proteins is very high,

1:07:48.560 --> 1:07:56.560
 much higher compared to ab initio methods that do not use any template information.

1:07:56.560 --> 1:08:04.560
 But nevertheless, this figure also has such a beautiful, I love these pictures so much.

1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:07.560
 It has the pink parts.

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.560
 Sure, the parts that are different.

1:08:10.560 --> 1:08:15.560
 So you're highlighting, the difference you find is on the 2D sequence.

1:08:15.560 --> 1:08:18.560
 And then you try to infer what that will look like on the 3D.

1:08:18.560 --> 1:08:22.560
 So the difference actually is on 1D sequence.

1:08:22.560 --> 1:08:32.560
 So this is one of these first questions that we try to answer is that,

1:08:32.560 --> 1:08:38.560
 well, if you take this new virus and you take the closest relatives,

1:08:38.560 --> 1:08:46.560
 which are SARS and a couple of bad coronavirus strains,

1:08:46.560 --> 1:08:51.560
 they are already the closest relatives that we are aware of.

1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:58.560
 Now, what are the differences between this virus and its close relatives?

1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:08.560
 And if you look, typically, when you take a sequence, those differences could be quite far away from each other.

1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:19.560
 So what 3D structure makes those differences to do, very often they tend to cluster together.

1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:28.560
 But all of a sudden, the differences that may look completely unrelated actually relate to each other.

1:09:28.560 --> 1:09:36.560
 And sometimes they are there because they correspond, they attack the functional site.

1:09:36.560 --> 1:09:43.560
 So they are there because this is the functional site that is highly mutated.

1:09:43.560 --> 1:09:49.560
 So that's a computational approach to figuring something out.

1:09:49.560 --> 1:09:54.560
 And when it comes together like that, that's kind of a nice clean indication that there's something,

1:09:54.560 --> 1:09:58.560
 this could be actually indicative of what's happening.

1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:01.560
 Yes, I mean, so we need this information.

1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:12.560
 And the 3D structure gives us just a very intuitive way to look at this information.

1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:23.560
 And then start asking questions such as, so this place of this protein that is highly mutated,

1:10:23.560 --> 1:10:32.560
 is it the functional part of the protein?

1:10:32.560 --> 1:10:42.560
 So does this part of the protein interact with some other proteins or maybe with some other ligands, small molecules?

1:10:42.560 --> 1:10:50.560
 So we will try now to functionally inform this 3D structure.

1:10:50.560 --> 1:11:03.560
 So you have a bunch of these mutated parts. How many are there in the new novel coronavirus compared to SARS?

1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:08.560
 We're talking about hundreds, thousands, these pink regions.

1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:10.560
 No, much less than that.

1:11:10.560 --> 1:11:18.560
 And it's very interesting that if you look at that, so the first thing that you start seeing, you look at patterns.

1:11:18.560 --> 1:11:30.560
 And the first pattern that becomes obvious is that some of the proteins in the new coronavirus are pretty much intact.

1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:42.560
 So they're pretty much exactly the same as SARS as the bad coronavirus, whereas some others are heavily mutated.

1:11:42.560 --> 1:12:01.560
 So it looks like that the evolution is not occurring uniformly across the entire viral genome, but actually target very specific proteins.

1:12:01.560 --> 1:12:05.560
 What do you do with that? Like from the Sherlock Holmes perspective?

1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:29.560
 Well, you know, so one of the most interesting findings we had was the fact that the viral, so the binding sites on the viral surfaces that get targeted by the known small molecules,

1:12:29.560 --> 1:12:50.560
 they were pretty much not affected at all. And so that means that the same small drugs or small drug like compounds can be efficient for the new coronavirus.

1:12:50.560 --> 1:13:07.560
 So this all actually maps to the drug compounds too. So you're actually mapping out what old stuff is going to work on this thing and then possibilities for new stuff to work by mapping out the things that have mutated.

1:13:07.560 --> 1:13:08.560
 Yes.

1:13:08.560 --> 1:13:25.560
 So we essentially know which parts behave differently and which parts are likely to behave similar. And again, of course, all our predictions need to be validated by experiments.

1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:38.560
 But hopefully that sort of helps us to delineate the regions of this virus that can be promising in terms of the drug discovery.

1:13:38.560 --> 1:13:51.560
 You kind of mentioned this already, but maybe you can elaborate. So how different from the structural and functional perspective does the new coronavirus appear to be relative to SARS?

1:13:51.560 --> 1:14:08.560
 We now are trying to understand the overall structural characteristics of this virus, because I mean, that's our next step, trying to model the viral particle of a single viral particle of this virus.

1:14:08.560 --> 1:14:19.560
 So that means you have the individual proteins, like you said, you have to figure out what their interaction is. Is that where this graph kind of interact?

1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:43.560
 So the interactometer is essentially a, so our prediction on the potential interactions, some of them that we already deciphered from the structural knowledge, but some of them that are essentially are deciphered from the knowledge of the existing interactions that people previously

1:14:43.560 --> 1:14:49.560
 obtain for SARS, for MERS, or other related viruses.

1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:54.560
 So is there kind of interactomes? Am I pronouncing that correctly by the way?

1:14:54.560 --> 1:14:55.560
 Yeah, interactome.

1:14:55.560 --> 1:15:01.560
 Yeah. Are those already converged towards for SARS?

1:15:01.560 --> 1:15:25.560
 So I think there are a couple of papers that now investigate the sort of the large scale sets of interactions between the new SARS and its host. And so I think that's an ongoing study, I think.

1:15:25.560 --> 1:15:30.560
 And the success of that, the result would be an interactome, yes.

1:15:30.560 --> 1:15:37.560
 And so when you say not trying to figure out the entire, the particle, the entire thing.

1:15:37.560 --> 1:15:58.560
 The particle, right? So if you look, you know, so structurally, right? So what this viral particle looks like, right? So as I said, it's, you know, the surface of it is an envelope, which is essentially a so called lipid bilayer with proteins integrated into the surface.

1:15:58.560 --> 1:16:20.560
 So how, so an average particle is around 18 nanometers, right? So this particle can have about 50 to 100 spike proteins.

1:16:20.560 --> 1:16:32.560
 So at least we suspect it. And, you know, based on the micrographs images, it's very comparable to MHV virus in mice and SARS virus.

1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:40.560
 Micrographs are actual pictures of the actual virus. Okay. So these are models. This is actually the actual images, right?

1:16:40.560 --> 1:16:52.560
 So what are they? Sorry for the tangents, but what are these things? So when you look on the internet, the models and the pictures are kind of, and the models you have here are just gorgeous and beautiful.

1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:56.560
 When you actually take pictures of them with the micrograph, like what, what do we look?

1:16:56.560 --> 1:17:08.560
 Well, they typically are not perfect. Right. So, so most of the images that you see now is the, is the sphere with those spikes.

1:17:08.560 --> 1:17:22.560
 You actually see the spikes. Yes, you do see the spikes. And now, you know, the, our collaborators for Texas and a and a university, Benjamin Newman.

1:17:22.560 --> 1:17:34.560
 He actually, in the recent paper about SARS, he proposed and there's some actually evidence behind it, that the particle is not a sphere,

1:17:34.560 --> 1:17:48.560
 but is actually is an elongated ellipsoid like particle. So, so that's what we are trying to incorporate into our model.

1:17:48.560 --> 1:18:02.560
 And the, I mean, you know, if you look at the actual micrographs, you see that those particles are, you know, are not symmetric.

1:18:02.560 --> 1:18:10.560
 So they are the sum of them. And of course, you know, it could be due to the treatment of the, of the material.

1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:16.560
 It could be due to the some noise in the imaging. Right. So there's a lot of uncertainty.

1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:26.560
 Yes. So it's okay. So structurally figuring out the entire part, by the way, again, sorry for the tangents, but why the term particle?

1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:35.560
 Or is it just it's a single, you know, so we call it, you know, we call it the virion. So virion particle, it's essentially a single virus.

1:18:35.560 --> 1:18:45.560
 Single virus, but just feels like, because particle to me, from the physics perspective feels like this, the most basic unit.

1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:50.560
 Because there seems to be so much going on inside the virus. Yeah, it doesn't feel like a particle.

1:18:50.560 --> 1:18:57.560
 Yes. Well, yeah, it's probably, I think it's the, you know, virion is a good way to call it.

1:18:57.560 --> 1:19:04.560
 So, okay, so trying to figure out, trying to figure out the entirety of the system.

1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:24.560
 Yes. So, you know, so, you know, so this is so the virion has 50 to 100 spikes, primer spikes, it has roughly 200 to 400 membrane protein dimers.

1:19:24.560 --> 1:19:37.560
 And those are arranged in the very nice lattice. So you can actually see sort of the, it's like a carpet of on the surface again, exactly on the surface.

1:19:37.560 --> 1:19:46.560
 And occasionally you also see this envelope protein inside and something that the one we don't know what it does. Exactly. Exactly.

1:19:46.560 --> 1:20:07.560
 The one that that forms the pentamer, this very nice pentameric ring. And so, you know, so this is what we're trying to, you know, we're trying to put now all our knowledge together and see whether we can actually generate this overall virion model.

1:20:07.560 --> 1:20:20.560
 With an idea to understand, you know, well, first of all, to understand how, how it looks like, how far it is from those images that were generated.

1:20:20.560 --> 1:20:35.560
 But I mean, the implications are, you know, there is a potential for the, you know, nano particle design that will mimic this virion particle.

1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:41.560
 Is the process of nano particle design, meaning artificially designing something that looks similar?

1:20:41.560 --> 1:20:55.560
 Yes. You know, so the one that can potentially compete with the actual virion particles and therefore reduce the effect of the infection.

1:20:55.560 --> 1:20:59.560
 So is this the idea of, like, what is a vaccine?

1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:10.560
 Vaccine. So, yeah, so there are two ways of essentially treating and in the case of vaccine is preventing the infection.

1:21:10.560 --> 1:21:19.560
 So vaccine is, you know, a way to train our immune system.

1:21:19.560 --> 1:21:30.560
 So our immune system becomes aware of this new danger and therefore is capable of generating the antibodies.

1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:47.560
 Then we'll essentially bind to the spike proteins because that's the main target for the, you know, for the vaccines design and block its functioning.

1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:56.560
 If you have the spike with the antibody on top, it can no longer interact with AC2 receptor.

1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:09.560
 So the process of designing a vaccine then is you have to understand enough about the structure of the virus itself to be able to create an artificial, an artificial particle?

1:22:09.560 --> 1:22:25.560
 Well, I mean, so the nano particle is a very exciting and new research. So there are already established ways to, you know, to make vaccines and there are several different ones, right?

1:22:25.560 --> 1:22:51.560
 So there is one where essentially the virus gets through the cell culture multiple times. So it becomes essentially, you know, adjusted to the specific embryonic cell and as a result becomes less, you know, compatible with the, you know, host human cells.

1:22:51.560 --> 1:23:11.560
 So therefore it's sort of the idea of the life vaccine where the particles are there, but they are not so efficient, you know, so they cannot replicate, you know, as rapidly as, you know, before the vaccine.

1:23:11.560 --> 1:23:29.560
 And they can be introduced to the immune system. The immune system will learn and the person who gets this vaccine won't get, you know, sick or, you know, will have mild, you know, mild symptoms.

1:23:29.560 --> 1:23:45.560
 So then there is sort of different types of the way to introduce the nonfunctional parts of this virus or the virus where some of the information is stripped down.

1:23:45.560 --> 1:23:58.560
 For example, the virus with no genetic material. So with no RNA genome exactly. So it cannot replicate. It cannot essentially perform most of its function.

1:23:58.560 --> 1:24:10.560
 That's fascinating. What is the biggest hurdle to design one of these, to arrive at one of these? Is it the work that you're doing in the fundamental understanding of this new virus?

1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:24.560
 Or is it in the, from my perspective, well, complicated world of experimental validation and sort of showing that this like going through the whole process of showing this is actually going to work with FDA approval, all that kind of stuff.

1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:35.560
 I think it's both. I mean, you know, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms will allow us to, you know, to design, to have more efficient designs of the vaccines.

1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:42.560
 However, the ones you design a vaccine, it needs to be tested.

1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:54.560
 But when you look at the 18 months and the different projections, which seems like an exceptionally, historically speaking, maybe you can correct me, but this even 18 months seems like a very accelerated timeline.

1:24:54.560 --> 1:25:11.560
 It is. It is. I mean, I remember reading about the, you know, in a book about some previous vaccines that it could take up to 10 years to design and, you know, properly test a vaccine.

1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:18.560
 Before it's mass production. So yeah, we, you know, everything is accelerated these days.

1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:23.560
 I mean, for better for worse, but, but, you know, we definitely need that.

1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:30.560
 Well, especially with the coronavirus, I mean, the scientific community is really stepping up and working together. The collaborative aspect is really interesting.

1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:35.560
 You mentioned, so the vaccine is one and then there's antiviral antiviral drugs.

1:25:35.560 --> 1:25:41.560
 So antiviral drugs are where, you know, vaccines are typically needed to prevent the infection.

1:25:41.560 --> 1:25:47.560
 Right. But once you have an infection, one, one, you know, so what we tried to do, we tried to stop it.

1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:51.560
 So we tried to stop virus from functioning.

1:25:51.560 --> 1:26:06.560
 And so the antiviral drugs are designed to block some critical functioning of the, of the proteins from the viral, from the virus.

1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:10.560
 So there are a number of interesting candidates.

1:26:10.560 --> 1:26:25.560
 And I think, you know, if you ask me, I, you know, I think Remdesivir is perhaps the most promising.

1:26:25.560 --> 1:26:38.560
 It's, it has been shown to be, you know, an efficient and effective antiviral for SARS.

1:26:38.560 --> 1:26:49.560
 Originally, it was the antiviral drug developed for a completely different virus, I think, for Ebola and Marburg.

1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:51.560
 At high levels, do you know how it works?

1:26:51.560 --> 1:26:59.560
 So it tries to mimic one of the nucleotides in RNA.

1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:04.560
 And essentially that, that stops the replication.

1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:11.560
 So it messes, I guess that's what, so antiviral drugs mess with some aspect of this process.

1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:17.560
 So, you know, so essentially we tried to stop certain functions of the virus.

1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:31.560
 There are some other ones, you know, that are designed to inhibit the protease, the thing that clips protein sequences.

1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:40.560
 There is one that was originally designed for malaria, which is a bacterial, you know, bacterial disease.

1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:42.560
 So this is so cool.

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:50.560
 So, but that's exactly where your work steps in is you're figuring out the functional and the structure of these differences.

1:27:50.560 --> 1:27:54.560
 So like providing candidates for where drugs can plug in.

1:27:54.560 --> 1:28:01.560
 Well, yes, because, you know, one thing that we don't know is whether or not.

1:28:01.560 --> 1:28:08.560
 So let's say we have a perfect drug candidate that is efficient against SARS and against MERS.

1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:14.560
 Now, is it going to be efficient against new SARS COVID 2?

1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:16.560
 We don't know that.

1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:22.560
 And there are multiple aspects that can affect this efficiency.

1:28:22.560 --> 1:28:34.560
 So, for instance, if the binding site, so the part of the protein where this ligand gets attached, if this site is mutated,

1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:40.560
 then the ligand may not be attachable to this part any longer.

1:28:40.560 --> 1:28:54.560
 And, you know, our work and the work of other bioinformatics groups, you know, essentially are trying to understand whether or not that will be the case.

1:28:54.560 --> 1:29:07.560
 And it looks like for the ligands that we looked at, the ligand binding sites are pretty much intact, which is very promising.

1:29:07.560 --> 1:29:15.560
 So if we can just like zoom out for a second, what are you optimistic?

1:29:15.560 --> 1:29:21.560
 So there's two, well, there's three possible ends to the coronavirus pandemic.

1:29:21.560 --> 1:29:30.560
 So one is there's or drugs or vaccines get figured out very quickly, probably drugs first.

1:29:30.560 --> 1:29:37.560
 The other is the pandemic runs its course for this wave, at least.

1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:47.560
 And then the third is, you know, things go much worse in some dark, bad, very bad direction.

1:29:47.560 --> 1:29:50.560
 Do you see, let's focus on the first two.

1:29:50.560 --> 1:30:03.560
 Do you see the anti drugs or the work you're doing being relevant for us right now in stopping the pandemic?

1:30:03.560 --> 1:30:06.560
 Or do you hope that the pandemic will run its course?

1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:19.560
 So the social distancing, things like wearing masks, all those discussions that people are having will be the method with which we fight coronavirus

1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:25.560
 in the short term, or do you think that it will have to be anti viral drugs?

1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:36.560
 I think, I think antivirals would be, I would view that as the, at least the short term solution.

1:30:36.560 --> 1:30:48.560
 I see more and more cases in the news of those new drug candidates being administered in hospitals.

1:30:48.560 --> 1:30:55.560
 And I mean, this is right now the best what we have.

1:30:55.560 --> 1:30:56.560
 Or do we need it?

1:30:56.560 --> 1:30:58.560
 I would do reopen the economy.

1:30:58.560 --> 1:31:01.560
 I mean, we definitely need it.

1:31:01.560 --> 1:31:16.560
 I cannot sort of speculate on how that will affect reopening of the economy because we are, you know, we are kind of deep in into the pandemic.

1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:18.560
 And it's not just the states.

1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:29.560
 It's also, you know, worldwide, you know, of course, you know, there is also the possibility of the second wave.

1:31:29.560 --> 1:31:41.560
 As we, you know, as you mentioned, and this is why, you know, we need to be super careful.

1:31:41.560 --> 1:31:49.560
 We need to follow all the precautions that the doctors tell us to do.

1:31:49.560 --> 1:31:53.560
 Are you worried about the mutation of the virus?

1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:58.560
 So it's, of course, a real possibility.

1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:04.560
 Now, how, to what extent this virus can mutate?

1:32:04.560 --> 1:32:06.560
 It's an open question.

1:32:06.560 --> 1:32:18.560
 I mean, we know that it is able to mutate to jump from one species to another and to become transmittable between humans.

1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:19.560
 Right.

1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:25.560
 So will it, you know, so let's imagine that we have the new antiviral.

1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:32.560
 Will this virus become eventually resistant to this antiviral?

1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:33.560
 We don't know.

1:32:33.560 --> 1:32:36.560
 I mean, this is what needs to be studied.

1:32:36.560 --> 1:32:51.560
 It's such a beautiful and terrifying process that a virus, some viruses may be able to mutate to respond to the, to mutate around the thing we've put before it.

1:32:51.560 --> 1:32:53.560
 Can you explain that process?

1:32:53.560 --> 1:32:54.560
 Like, how does that happen?

1:32:54.560 --> 1:32:57.560
 Is that just the way of evolution?

1:32:57.560 --> 1:32:59.560
 I would say so, yes.

1:32:59.560 --> 1:33:02.560
 I mean, it's the evolutionary mechanisms.

1:33:02.560 --> 1:33:12.560
 There is nothing imprinted into this virus that makes it, you know, it just the way it evolves.

1:33:12.560 --> 1:33:18.560
 And actually, it's the way it core evolves with its host.

1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:19.560
 It's just amazing.

1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:27.560
 It's especially the evolutionary mechanisms, especially amazing given how simple the virus is.

1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:32.560
 It's incredible that it's, I mean, it's beautiful.

1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:38.560
 It's beautiful because it's one of the cleanest examples of evolution working.

1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:53.560
 Well, I think, I mean, the one of the sort of the reasons for its simplicity is because it does not require all the necessary functions to be stored.

1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:54.560
 Right.

1:33:54.560 --> 1:34:01.560
 It actually can hijack the majority of the necessary functions from the host cell.

1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:11.560
 So the ability to do so, in my view, reduces the complexity of this machine drastically.

1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:16.560
 Although, if you look at the, you know, most recent discoveries, right?

1:34:16.560 --> 1:34:22.560
 So the scientists discovered viruses that are as large as bacteria, right?

1:34:22.560 --> 1:34:26.560
 Mimim viruses and mama viruses.

1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:46.560
 It actually, those discoveries made sciences to reconsider the origins of the virus, you know, and what are the mechanisms and how, you know, what are the mechanisms, the evolutionary mechanisms that leads to the appearance of the viruses.

1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:49.560
 By the way, I mean, you did mention that viruses are.

1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:52.560
 I think you mentioned that they're not living.

1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:54.560
 Yes, they're not living organisms.

1:34:54.560 --> 1:34:56.560
 Let me ask that question again.

1:34:56.560 --> 1:35:00.560
 Why do you think they're not living organisms?

1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:04.560
 Well, because they, they are dependent.

1:35:04.560 --> 1:35:12.560
 The majority of the functions of the virus are dependent on the, on the host.

1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:15.560
 So let me do the devil's advocate.

1:35:15.560 --> 1:35:27.560
 Maybe the philosophical devil's advocate here and say, well, humans, which we would say are living, need our host planet to survive.

1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:34.560
 So you can basically take every living organism that we think of as definitively living.

1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:42.560
 It's always going to have some aspects of its host that it needs of its environment.

1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:49.560
 So is that really the key aspect of why a virus is that dependence?

1:35:49.560 --> 1:35:57.560
 Because it seems to be very good at doing so many things that we consider to be intelligent.

1:35:57.560 --> 1:36:00.560
 It's just that dependence part.

1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:10.560
 Well, I mean, it, yeah, it's, it's difficult to answer in this way.

1:36:10.560 --> 1:36:31.560
 I mean, I, the way I think about the virus is, you know, in order for it to function, it needs to have the critical component, the critical tools that it doesn't have.

1:36:31.560 --> 1:36:42.560
 So, I mean, that's, that's, you know, in my way, you know, the, the, it's not autonomous.

1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:48.560
 That's how I separate the, the idea of the living organism on a very high level.

1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:49.560
 Yes.

1:36:49.560 --> 1:36:51.560
 Between the living organism and.

1:36:51.560 --> 1:37:00.560
 And you have some, we have, I mean, these are just terms and perhaps they don't mean much, but we have some kind of sense of what autonomous means.

1:37:00.560 --> 1:37:05.560
 And that humans are autonomous.

1:37:05.560 --> 1:37:15.560
 You've also done excellent work in the epidemiological modeling, the simulation of these things.

1:37:15.560 --> 1:37:19.560
 So the zooming out outside of the body, doing the agent based simulation.

1:37:19.560 --> 1:37:24.560
 So that's where you actually simulate individual human beings.

1:37:24.560 --> 1:37:28.560
 And then the spread of viruses from one to the other.

1:37:28.560 --> 1:37:33.560
 How does at a high level agent based simulation work?

1:37:33.560 --> 1:37:34.560
 All right.

1:37:34.560 --> 1:37:46.560
 So it's, it's also one of this irony of timing because I mean, we, we, we've worked on this project for the past five years.

1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:57.560
 And the New Year's Eve, I got an email from my PhD student that, you know, the last experiments were completed.

1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:09.560
 And, you know, three weeks after that, we get, we get this diamond princess story and emailing each other with the same, you know, the same news saying like.

1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:12.560
 So the damn business is a cruise ship.

1:38:12.560 --> 1:38:13.560
 Yes.

1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:15.560
 And what was the project that you work on?

1:38:15.560 --> 1:38:22.560
 So the project, I mean, it's, you know, the code name, it started with a bunch of undergraduates.

1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:26.560
 The code name was a zombies on a cruise ship.

1:38:26.560 --> 1:38:34.560
 So they, they wanted to essentially model the, the, you know, zombie apocalypse, apocalypses on a cruise ship.

1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:53.560
 And, and, you know, after having, you know, some fun, we then thought about the fact that, you know, if you look at the cruise ships, I mean, the infectious outbreak is, has been one of the biggest threats, you know, threats to the cruise ship economy.

1:38:53.560 --> 1:39:01.560
 So perhaps the most, you know, frequently occurring virus is the Norwalk virus.

1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:07.560
 And this is essentially one of these stomach flus that you have.

1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:12.560
 And, you know, it, it can be quite devastating.

1:39:12.560 --> 1:39:24.560
 You know, so there are occasionally there are cruise ships get, you know, they, they, they get canceled, they get returned to the back to the, to the origin.

1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:34.560
 And so we wanted to study, and this is very different from the traditional epidemiological studies where the scale is much larger.

1:39:34.560 --> 1:39:54.560
 So we wanted to study this in a confined environment, which is a cruise ship, it could be a school, it could be other, you know, other places such as, you know, the large, large company where people are in interaction.

1:39:54.560 --> 1:40:21.560
 And the benefit of this model is we can actually track that in the real time. So we can actually see the whole course of the evolution, the whole course of the interaction between the infected, infected, infected host and, you know, the host and the pathogen, etc.

1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:47.560
 So, so agent based system or multi agent system to be precisely is a good way to approach this problem, because we can introduce the behavior of the, of the passengers of the cruise.

1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:59.560
 And what we did for the first time, that's where, you know, we introduce some novelty is we introduce a pathogen agent explicitly.

1:40:59.560 --> 1:41:23.560
 So that allowed us to essentially model the behavior on the host side, as well on the pathogen side. And over sudden we can, we can have a flexible model that allows us to integrate all the key parameters about the infections.

1:41:23.560 --> 1:41:47.560
 So, for example, the virus, right, so the ways of, of transmitting the virus between the, the host, how long does virus survive on the surface for might.

1:41:47.560 --> 1:42:02.560
 What is, you know, how much of the viral particles does a host shed when he or she is a symptomatic versus symptomatic.

1:42:02.560 --> 1:42:18.560
 And you can encode all of that into this pathogen. It's just for people who don't know. So agent based simulation, usually the agent represents a single human being. And then there's some graphs, like contact graphs that represent the interaction between those human beings.

1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:45.560
 So, yes, so we, so essentially, you know, so agents are, you know, individual programs that are run in parallel. And we're saying we can provide instructions for these agents how to interact with each other, how to exchange information in this case exchange the infection.

1:42:45.560 --> 1:43:04.560
 But in this case, in your case, you've added a pathogen as an agent. I mean, that's kind of fascinating. It's kind of a brilliant, like a brilliant way to condense the parameters to aggregate, to bring the parameters together that represent the pathogen, the virus.

1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:05.560
 Yes.

1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:07.560
 That's fascinating, actually.

1:43:07.560 --> 1:43:24.560
 Yeah, it was a, you know, we realized that, you know, by bringing in the virus, we can actually start modeling. I mean, we are not no longer bounded by very specific sort of aspects of the specific virus.

1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:51.560
 We end up, we started with, you know, Norwalk virus and of course, zombies, but we continue to modeling Ebola virus outbreak flu SARS. And because I felt that we need to add a little bit more sort of excitement for our undergraduate students.

1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:56.560
 So we actually modeled the virus from the contagion movie.

1:43:56.560 --> 1:43:57.560
 Yes.

1:43:57.560 --> 1:44:26.560
 And, you know, unfortunately, that virus and we, we tried to extract as much information. Luckily, the, this movie was the scientific consultant was young Deepkin, a virologist from Columbia University, who is actually who provided, I think he designed this virus for this movie based on Nipah virus.

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:43.560
 And I think with some ideas behind SARS or flu like airborne viruses. And, you know, the, the movie surprisingly contained enough details for us to extract and to model it.

1:44:43.560 --> 1:44:47.560
 I was hoping he would like publish a paper of how this virus works.

1:44:47.560 --> 1:45:01.560
 Yeah, we are planning to publish. I would love it if you did. But it would be nice if the, you know, of the, the, the origin of the virus, but you're now actually being a scientist and studying the virus from that perspective.

1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:13.560
 But the origin of the virus, you know, you know, the first time I actually saw this movie is assignment number one in my bioinformatics class that they give.

1:45:13.560 --> 1:45:23.560
 Because it, it also tell, it tells you that, you know, bioinformatics can be of use because if, if, I don't know, you watched it, have you watched it?

1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:24.560
 A long time ago.

1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:46.560
 So, so there is, you know, approximately a week from the, you know, virus detection, we see a screenshot of scientists looking at the structure of the surface protein. And this is where I tell my students that, you know, if you ask experimental biologists, they will tell you that it's

1:45:46.560 --> 1:46:01.560
 impossible because it takes months, maybe years to get the crystal structure of this, you know, the structure that is represented. If you ask a bioinformatician, they tell you, sure, why not?

1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:23.560
 We'll just get it modeled. And, and yes, but, but it was very interesting to, to see that there's actually, you know, and if you do it, do screenshots, you actually see the phylogenetic tree, the evolutionary tree that relate this virus with other viruses.

1:46:23.560 --> 1:46:47.560
 So it was a lot of scientific thought put into the movie. And one thing that I was actually, you know, it was interesting to learn is that the origin of this virus was, there were two animals that led to the, you know, the, the, you know, the zoonotic origin of this virus were fruit,

1:46:47.560 --> 1:47:02.560
 fruit, bat, and a pig. So, you know, so, so, so this doesn't feel like we're this, this definitely feels like we're living in a simulation. Okay.

1:47:02.560 --> 1:47:24.560
 But maybe a big picture, aging based simulation now largest scale, sort of not focused on a cruise ship, a larger scale are used now to drive some policy. So politicians using to tell stories and narratives and try to figure out how, how to move forward under so much, so much uncertainty.

1:47:24.560 --> 1:47:37.560
 In your sense, are aging based simulation useful for actually predicting the future? Or are they useful mostly for comparing relative comparison of different intervention methods?

1:47:37.560 --> 1:48:06.560
 Well, I think both because, you know, in the case of new coronavirus, we, we essentially learning that the current intervention methods may not be efficient enough. One thing that one important aspect that I find to be so critical.

1:48:06.560 --> 1:48:33.560
 And yet, something that was overlooked, you know, during the past pandemics is the effect of the symptomatic period. This virus is different because it has such a long symptomatic period. And over sudden, that creates a completely new game when trying to contain this virus.

1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:54.560
 In terms of the dynamics of the infection. Exactly. Do you also, I don't know how close you're tracking this, but do you also think that there's a different like rate of infection for when you're asymptomatic like that, that aspect or does a virus not care?

1:48:54.560 --> 1:49:21.560
 So there were a couple of works. So one important parameter that tells us how contagious the person with asymptomatic virus versus asymptomatic is looking at the number of viral particles this person sheds, you know, as a function of time.

1:49:21.560 --> 1:49:47.560
 So, so far, what I saw is the study that tells us that the, you know, the person during the asymptomatic period is already contagious, and it sheds, the person sheds enough viruses to infect another host.

1:49:47.560 --> 1:50:08.560
 And I think there's so many excellent papers coming out. But I think I just saw some, maybe a nature paper that said the first week is when you're symptomatic or asymptomatic, you're the most contagious. So the highest level of the, like the plots are in the 14 day period, they collected a bunch of subjects.

1:50:08.560 --> 1:50:21.560
 And I think the first week is when it's the most. Yeah, I think, I mean, I'm waiting, I'm waiting to see sort of more, more populated studies.

1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:40.560
 Like I said, it was kind of numbers. My, one of my favorite studies was again, very recent one where scientists determined that tears are not contagious.

1:50:40.560 --> 1:50:46.560
 So, so there is, you know, so there is no viral shedding done through, through tears.

1:50:46.560 --> 1:51:01.560
 So they found one moist thing that's not contagious. And I mean, there's a lot of, I'm personally been, because I'm on a survey paper, somehow that's looking at masks.

1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:13.560
 And there's been so much interesting debates on the efficacy of masks. And there's a lot of work. And there's a lot of interesting work on whether this virus is airborne.

1:51:13.560 --> 1:51:22.560
 It's a totally open question. It's leaning one way right now, but it's a totally open question whether it can travel in aerosols long distances.

1:51:22.560 --> 1:51:36.560
 I mean, do you have a, do you think about the stuff? Do you track the stuff? Are you focused on the, you know, I mean, this is, this is a very important aspect for our epidemiology study.

1:51:36.560 --> 1:51:55.560
 I think the, I mean, and it's sort of a very simple sort of idea, but I agree with people who say that the mask, the masks work in both ways.

1:51:55.560 --> 1:52:11.560
 So it not only protects you from the, you know, incoming viral particles, but also, you know, it, it, you know, makes the potentially contagious person not to spread the viral particles.

1:52:11.560 --> 1:52:28.560
 When they're asymptomatic may not even know that they're, in fact, it seems to be there's evidence that they don't surgical and certainly homemade masks, which is what's needed now actually, because there's a huge shortage of, they don't work as to protect you that well.

1:52:28.560 --> 1:52:36.560
 They work much better to protect others. So it's, it's, it's a motivation for us to all wear one.

1:52:36.560 --> 1:52:49.560
 Exactly. Cause I mean, you know, you don't know where, you know, and, you know, about 30% as far as I remember, at least 30% of the asymptomatic cases are completely asymptomatic.

1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:58.560
 Yeah. Right. So you don't really cough. You don't, I mean, you don't have any symptoms yet. You shed viruses.

1:52:58.560 --> 1:53:07.560
 Do you think it's possible that we'll all wear masks? So I wore a mask at a grocery store and you just, you get looks. I mean, this was like a week ago.

1:53:07.560 --> 1:53:17.560
 Maybe it's already changed because I think CDC or somebody's, I think the CDC has said that we should be wearing masks like LA, they're starting to happen.

1:53:17.560 --> 1:53:24.560
 But do you, it just seems like something that this country will really struggle doing or no.

1:53:24.560 --> 1:53:34.560
 I hope not. I mean, you know, it, it was interesting. I was looking through the, through the old pictures during the Spanish flu.

1:53:34.560 --> 1:53:44.560
 And you could see that the, you know, pretty much everyone was wearing masks with some exceptions.

1:53:44.560 --> 1:53:58.560
 And there were like, you know, sort of iconic photograph of the, I think it was San Francisco, this tram who was refusing to let in a, you know, someone without the mask.

1:53:58.560 --> 1:54:09.560
 So I think, well, you know, it's also, you know, it's related to the fact of, you know, how much we are scared.

1:54:09.560 --> 1:54:17.560
 Right. So how much do we treat this problem seriously?

1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:28.560
 And, you know, my take on it is we should, because it is very serious.

1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:41.560
 Yeah, I, from a psychology perspective, just worry about the entirety, the entire big mess of a psychology experiment that this is, whether a mask will help it or hurt it.

1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:50.560
 You know, the masks have a way of distancing us from others by removing the emotional expression and all that kind of stuff.

1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:57.560
 But at the same time mask also signal that I care about your well being.

1:54:57.560 --> 1:54:58.560
 Exactly.

1:54:58.560 --> 1:55:01.560
 So it's a really interesting trade off that's just a...

1:55:01.560 --> 1:55:07.560
 Yeah, it's interesting, right? About distancing. Aren't we distanced enough?

1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:09.560
 Right, exactly.

1:55:09.560 --> 1:55:24.560
 And when we try to come closer together when they do reopen the economy, that's going to be a long road of rebuilding trust and not all being huge germaphobes.

1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:32.560
 Let me ask sort of, you have a bit of a Russian accent? Russian or no? Russian accent?

1:55:32.560 --> 1:55:35.560
 Were you born in Russia?

1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:41.560
 Yes. And you're too kind. I have a pretty thick Russian accent.

1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:44.560
 What are your favorite memories of Russia?

1:55:44.560 --> 1:55:54.560
 So I moved first to Canada and then to the United States back in 1999.

1:55:54.560 --> 1:56:06.560
 So by that time I was 22, so whatever Russian accent I got back then, that was me for the rest of my life.

1:56:06.560 --> 1:56:26.560
 By the time the Soviet Union collapsed, I was a kid, but sort of old enough to realize that there are changes.

1:56:26.560 --> 1:56:30.560
 Did you want to be a scientist back then?

1:56:30.560 --> 1:56:50.560
 Oh yes. I mean, the first sort of 10 years of my sort of juvenile life, I wanted to be a pilot of a passenger jet plane.

1:56:50.560 --> 1:56:51.560
 Wow.

1:56:51.560 --> 1:57:06.560
 So yes, it was like, I was getting ready to go to a college to get the degree, but I've been always fascinated by science.

1:57:06.560 --> 1:57:22.560
 And so not just by math, of course, math was one of my favorite subjects, but biology, chemistry, physics, somehow I liked those four subjects together.

1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:42.560
 And yes, so essentially after a certain period of time, I wanted to actually, back then it was a very popular sort of area of science called cybernetics.

1:57:42.560 --> 1:57:50.560
 So it's not really computer science, but it was like computational robotics in this sense.

1:57:50.560 --> 1:57:53.560
 And so I really wanted to do that.

1:57:53.560 --> 1:58:06.560
 But then I realized that my biggest passion was in mathematics.

1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:20.560
 And later when studying in Moscow State University, I also realized that I really want to apply the knowledge.

1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:31.560
 So I really wanted to mix the mathematical knowledge that I get with real life problems.

1:58:31.560 --> 1:58:37.560
 And that could be you mentioned chemistry and now biology.

1:58:37.560 --> 1:58:41.560
 And I sort of, does it make you sad?

1:58:41.560 --> 1:58:54.560
 Maybe I'm wrong on this, but it seems like it's difficult to be in collaboration to do open big science in Russia.

1:58:54.560 --> 1:59:02.560
 From my distant perspective in computer science, we can go to conferences in Russia.

1:59:02.560 --> 1:59:05.560
 I sadly don't have many collaborators in Russia.

1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:10.560
 I don't know many people doing great AI work in Russia.

1:59:10.560 --> 1:59:12.560
 Does that make you sad?

1:59:12.560 --> 1:59:15.560
 Am I wrong in seeing it this way?

1:59:15.560 --> 1:59:24.560
 I have to tell you, I'm privileged to have collaborators in bioinformatics in Russia.

1:59:24.560 --> 1:59:29.560
 And I think this is the bioinformatics school in Russia is very strong.

1:59:29.560 --> 1:59:30.560
 In Moscow?

1:59:30.560 --> 1:59:41.560
 In Moscow, in Novosibirsk, in St. Petersburg have great collaborators in Kazan.

1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:52.560
 And so at least in terms of my area of research, there are strong people there.

1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:57.560
 Yeah, strong people, a lot of great ideas, very open to collaborations.

1:59:57.560 --> 2:00:12.560
 So I perhaps, it's my luck, but I haven't experienced any difficulties in establishing collaborations.

2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:14.560
 That's bioinformatics, though.

2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:23.560
 It could be bioinformatics too, and it could be person by person related, but I just don't feel the warmth and love that I would...

2:00:23.560 --> 2:00:29.560
 You talk about the Seminole people who are French in artificial intelligence.

2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:34.560
 France welcomes them with open arms in so many ways.

2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:36.560
 I just don't feel the love from Russia.

2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:44.560
 I do on the human beings, like people in general, like friends and just cool, interesting people.

2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:49.560
 But from the scientific community, no conferences, no big conferences.

2:00:49.560 --> 2:00:54.560
 Yeah, it's actually, you know, I'm trying to think.

2:00:54.560 --> 2:01:01.560
 I cannot recall any big AI conferences in Russia.

2:01:01.560 --> 2:01:07.560
 It has an effect on, for me, I haven't sadly been back to Russia, so I should.

2:01:07.560 --> 2:01:13.560
 But my problem is it's very difficult, so now I have to renounce citizenship.

2:01:13.560 --> 2:01:14.560
 Oh, is that right?

2:01:14.560 --> 2:01:19.560
 I mean, I'm a citizen in the United States, and it makes it very difficult, there's a mess now, right?

2:01:19.560 --> 2:01:25.560
 So I want to be able to travel, like, you know, legitimately.

2:01:25.560 --> 2:01:29.560
 And it's not an obvious process, they don't make it super easy.

2:01:29.560 --> 2:01:34.560
 I mean, that's part of that, like, you know, it should be super easy for me to travel there.

2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:48.560
 Well, you know, hopefully, this unfortunate circumstances that we are in will actually promote the remote collaborations.

2:01:48.560 --> 2:02:00.560
 And I think what we are experiencing right now is that you still can do science, you know, being current in your own homes,

2:02:00.560 --> 2:02:06.560
 especially when it comes, I mean, you know, I certainly understand there is a very challenging time for experimental sciences.

2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:13.560
 I mean, I have many collaborators who are, you know, who are affected by that, but for computational sciences.

2:02:13.560 --> 2:02:16.560
 Yeah, we're really leaning into the remote communication.

2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:25.560
 Nevertheless, I had to force you to talk to you in person because there's something that you just can't do in terms of conversation like this.

2:02:25.560 --> 2:02:28.560
 I don't know why, but in person, it's very much needed.

2:02:28.560 --> 2:02:31.560
 So I really appreciate you doing it.

2:02:31.560 --> 2:02:34.560
 You have a collection of science bobbleheads.

2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:35.560
 Yes.

2:02:35.560 --> 2:02:37.560
 Which look amazing.

2:02:37.560 --> 2:02:40.560
 Which bobblehead is your favorite?

2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:43.560
 And which real world version?

2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:46.560
 Which scientist is your favorite?

2:02:46.560 --> 2:02:53.560
 So yeah, by the way, I was trying to bring it in, but they're current in now in my office.

2:02:53.560 --> 2:03:01.560
 They sort of demonstrate the social distance so they're nicely spaced away from each other.

2:03:01.560 --> 2:03:04.560
 But so, you know, it's interesting.

2:03:04.560 --> 2:03:10.560
 So I've been collecting those bobbleheads for the past maybe 12 or 13 years.

2:03:10.560 --> 2:03:18.560
 And it, you know, interestingly enough, it started with the two bobbleheads of Watson and Creek.

2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:33.560
 And interestingly enough, my last bobblehead in this collection for now, and my favorite one, because I felt so good when I got it, was the Rosalind Franklin.

2:03:33.560 --> 2:03:38.560
 And so, you know, when I got...

2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:39.560
 Who is the full group?

2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:57.560
 So I have Watson, Creek, Newton, Einstein, Marie Curie, Tesla, of course Charles Darwin, sorry, Charles Darwin, and Rosalind Franklin.

2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:04.560
 I am definitely missing quite a few of my favorite scientists.

2:04:04.560 --> 2:04:15.560
 And so, you know, if I were to add to this collection, so I would add, of course, Kolomogorov.

2:04:15.560 --> 2:04:16.560
 Interesting.

2:04:16.560 --> 2:04:33.560
 That's, you know, I've been always fascinated by his, well, his dedication to science, but also his dedication to educating young people the next generation.

2:04:33.560 --> 2:04:35.560
 So it's very inspiring.

2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:36.560
 He's one of the...

2:04:36.560 --> 2:04:37.560
 Okay.

2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:38.560
 Yeah.

2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:40.560
 He's one of the Russia's greats.

2:04:40.560 --> 2:04:41.560
 Yes.

2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:42.560
 Yeah.

2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:49.560
 So he also, you know, the school, the high school that I attended was named after him.

2:04:49.560 --> 2:04:57.560
 And he was great, you know, so he founded the school, and he actually taught there.

2:04:57.560 --> 2:04:59.560
 Is this Moscow?

2:04:59.560 --> 2:05:01.560
 Yes.

2:05:01.560 --> 2:05:18.560
 So, but then, I mean, you know, other people that I would definitely like to see in my collections would be Alan Turing, would be John von Neumann.

2:05:18.560 --> 2:05:21.560
 Yeah, you're a little bit late on the computer scientists.

2:05:21.560 --> 2:05:22.560
 Yes.

2:05:22.560 --> 2:05:24.560
 Well, I mean, they don't make them.

2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:30.560
 You know, I still am amazed they haven't made Alan Turing yet.

2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:35.560
 And I would also add Linus Pauling.

2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:38.560
 Linus Pauling.

2:05:38.560 --> 2:05:40.560
 Who is Linus Pauling?

2:05:40.560 --> 2:05:59.560
 So this is, to me, is one of the greatest chemists and the person who actually discovered the secondary structure of proteins, who was very close to solving the DNA structure.

2:05:59.560 --> 2:06:20.560
 And, you know, people argue, but some of them were pretty sure that if not for this, you know, photograph 51 by Rosalind Franklin, that, you know, Watson and Cree got access to.

2:06:20.560 --> 2:06:26.560
 He would be, he would be the one who would solve it.

2:06:26.560 --> 2:06:29.560
 Science is a funny race.

2:06:29.560 --> 2:06:31.560
 It is.

2:06:31.560 --> 2:06:34.560
 Let me ask the biggest and the most ridiculous question.

2:06:34.560 --> 2:06:51.560
 So you've kind of studied the human body and its defenses and these enemies that are about from a biological perspective, a bioinformatics perspective, a computer science perspective.

2:06:51.560 --> 2:07:04.560
 How has that made you see your own life, sort of the meaning of it, or just even seeing what it means to be human?

2:07:04.560 --> 2:07:12.560
 Well, it certainly makes me realize how fragile the human life is.

2:07:12.560 --> 2:07:25.560
 If you think about this little tiny thing can impact the life of the whole human kind to such extent.

2:07:25.560 --> 2:07:51.560
 So, you know, it's something to appreciate and to remember that, you know, we are fragile, we have to bond together as a society.

2:07:51.560 --> 2:08:05.560
 And, you know, it also gives me sort of hope that what we do as scientists is useful.

2:08:05.560 --> 2:08:07.560
 Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it.

2:08:07.560 --> 2:08:32.560
 I appreciate you. Thank you so much for talking today. It was an honor.

2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:39.560
 And now let me leave you with some words from Edward Osborn Wilson, E.O. Wilson.

2:08:39.560 --> 2:08:49.560
 The variety of genes on the planet in viruses exceeds or is likely to exceed that in all of the rest of life combined.

2:08:49.560 --> 2:09:02.560
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
