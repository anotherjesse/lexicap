00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
 The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein, the second time we've spoken on this podcast.

00:06.000 --> 00:11.600
 He's a mathematician with a bold and piercing intelligence, unafraid to explore the biggest

00:11.600 --> 00:18.160
 questions in the universe and shine a light on the darkest corners of our society. He is the host

00:18.160 --> 00:25.520
 of the Portal podcast, a part of which he recently released his 2013 Oxford lecture

00:25.520 --> 00:31.120
 on his theory of geometric unity that is at the center of his lifelong efforts

00:31.120 --> 00:35.600
 to arrive at a theory of everything that unifies the fundamental laws of physics.

00:36.320 --> 00:40.960
 This conversation was recorded recently in the time of the coronavirus pandemic.

00:40.960 --> 00:45.120
 For everyone feeling the medical, psychological, and financial burden of this crisis,

00:45.120 --> 00:49.840
 I'm sending love your way. Stay strong. We're in this together. We'll beat this thing.

00:50.640 --> 00:55.200

00:59.840 --> 01:07.120
 on Twitter at Lex Freedman, spelled F R I D M A N. This show is presented by Cash App,

01:07.120 --> 01:13.200
 the number one finance app in the App Store. When you get it, use code LexPodcast. Cash App

01:13.200 --> 01:17.760
 lets you send money to friends by Bitcoin and invest in the stock market with as little as one

01:17.760 --> 01:23.280
 dollar. Since Cash App does fractional share trading, let me mention that the order execution

01:23.280 --> 01:28.320
 algorithm that works behind the scenes to create the abstraction of the fractional orders

01:28.320 --> 01:33.920
 is an algorithmic marvel. So big props to the Cash App engineers for solving a hard problem

01:33.920 --> 01:39.520
 that in the end provides an easy interface that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction

01:39.520 --> 01:45.760
 of the stock market, making trading more accessible to new investors and diversification

01:45.760 --> 01:52.160
 much easier. So again, if you get cash out from the App Store or Google Play and use code Lex

01:52.160 --> 01:58.160
 Podcast, you get $10 and Cash App will also donate $10 to first, an organization that is

01:58.160 --> 02:04.160
 helping to advance robotics and STEM education for young people around the world. And now,

02:04.160 --> 02:11.280
 here's my conversation with Eric Weinstein. Do you see a connection between World War II

02:11.280 --> 02:16.480
 and the crisis we're living through right now? Sure. The need for collective action,

02:16.480 --> 02:23.280
 reminding ourselves of the fact that all of these abstractions, like everyone should just do

02:23.280 --> 02:28.960
 exactly what he or she wants to do for himself and leave everyone else alone, none of these

02:28.960 --> 02:34.960
 abstractions work in a global crisis. And this is just a reminder that we didn't somehow put

02:34.960 --> 02:41.200
 all that behind us. When I hear stories about my grandfather who was in the army, and so the

02:41.200 --> 02:46.080
 Soviet Union where most people die when you're in the army, there's a brotherhood that happens.

02:46.080 --> 02:49.840
 There's a love that happens. Do you think that's something we're going to see here,

02:50.480 --> 02:54.320
 a sense of community? We're not there. I mean, what the Soviet Union went through.

02:54.880 --> 03:03.600
 I mean, the enormity of the war on the Russian doorstep, this is different. What we're going

03:03.600 --> 03:08.880
 through now is not, we can't talk about Stalingrad and COVID in the same breath yet. We're not ready.

03:08.880 --> 03:18.640
 And the sense of like the great patriotic war and the way in which I was very moved by the

03:18.640 --> 03:23.520
 Soviet custom of newlyweds going and visiting war memorials on their wedding day, like the

03:23.520 --> 03:26.880
 happiest day of your life, you have to say, thank you to the people who made it possible.

03:27.600 --> 03:35.440
 We're not there. We're just restarting history. I've called this, on the Rogan program,

03:35.440 --> 03:42.320
 I called it the Great Knapp, the 75 years with very little by historical standards

03:43.360 --> 03:47.840
 in terms of really profound disruption. And so when you call it the Great Knapp,

03:47.840 --> 03:54.480
 meaning lack of deep global tragedy. Well, lack of realized global tragedy.

03:54.480 --> 04:00.000
 So I think that the development, for example, of the hydrogen bomb was something that happened

04:00.000 --> 04:08.160
 during the Great Knapp. And that doesn't mean that people who lived during that time didn't

04:08.160 --> 04:14.000
 feel fear, didn't know anxiety. But it was to say that most of the violent potential of human

04:14.000 --> 04:19.680
 species was not realized. It was in the form of potential energy. And this is the thing that I've

04:19.680 --> 04:24.480
 sort of taken issue with with the description of Stephen Pinker's optimism is that if you

04:24.480 --> 04:28.720
 look at the realized kinetic variables, things have been getting much better for a long time,

04:28.720 --> 04:34.400
 which is the Great Knapp. But it's not as if our fragility has not grown,

04:34.400 --> 04:40.240
 our dependence on electronic systems, our vulnerability to disruption. And so all sorts

04:40.240 --> 04:45.600
 of things have gotten much better. Other things have gotten much worse. And the destructive

04:45.600 --> 04:51.840
 potential is skyrocketed. Is tragedy the only way we wake up from the Big Knapp?

04:51.840 --> 04:57.920
 Well, no, you could also have, you know, jubilation about positive things. But it's harder

04:57.920 --> 05:03.520
 to get people's attention. Can you give an example of a big global positive thing that could happen?

05:03.520 --> 05:10.240
 I think that when, for example, just historically speaking, HIV went from being a death sentence

05:10.240 --> 05:15.200
 to something that people could live with for a very long period of time, it would be great if

05:15.200 --> 05:20.480
 that had happened on a Wednesday, right? Like all at once, like you knew that things had changed.

05:20.480 --> 05:26.240
 And so the bleed in somewhat kills the sort of the Wednesday effect where it all happens on a

05:26.240 --> 05:32.000
 particular day at a particular moment. I think if you look at the stock market here, you know,

05:32.000 --> 05:38.160
 there's a very clear moment where you can see that the market absorbs the idea of the coronavirus.

05:38.160 --> 05:45.680
 I think that with respect to positives, the moon landing was the best example of a positive

05:45.680 --> 05:54.800
 that happened at a particular time or recapitulating the Soviet American link up in terms of

05:54.800 --> 06:02.400
 Skylab and Soyuz, right? Like that was a huge moment when you actually had these two nations

06:02.400 --> 06:08.320
 connecting in orbit. And so, yeah, there are great moments where something beautiful and

06:08.320 --> 06:14.320
 wonderful and amazing happens, you know, but it's just, they're fewer. That's why as much

06:14.320 --> 06:20.880
 as I can't imagine proposing to somebody at a sporting event, when you have like 30,000 people

06:20.880 --> 06:27.040
 waiting and, you know, like she says, yes, it's pretty exciting. So I think that we shouldn't

06:27.040 --> 06:35.600
 discount that. So how bad do you think it's going to get in terms of the global suffering that we're

06:35.600 --> 06:41.280
 going to experience with this crisis? I can't figure this one out. I'm just not smart enough.

06:41.280 --> 06:47.760
 Something is going weirdly wrong. They're almost like two separate storylines. In one storyline,

06:47.760 --> 06:57.040
 we aren't taking things nearly seriously enough. We see people using food packaging lids as masks

06:57.040 --> 07:04.880
 who are doctors or nurses. We hear horrible stories about people dying needlessly due to triage.

07:05.840 --> 07:13.120
 And that's a very terrifying story. On the other hand, there's this other story which says there

07:13.120 --> 07:19.040
 are tons of ventilators someplace. We've got lots of masks, but they haven't been released.

07:19.040 --> 07:25.280
 We've got hospital ships where none of the beds are being used. And it's very confusing to me

07:25.280 --> 07:32.480
 that somehow these two stories give me the feeling that they both must be true simultaneously and

07:32.480 --> 07:37.040
 they can't both be true in any kind of standard way. And I don't know whether it's just that I'm

07:37.040 --> 07:43.360
 dumb, but I can't get one or the other story to quiet down. So I think weirdly, this is much more

07:43.360 --> 07:49.440
 serious than we had understood it. And it's not nearly as serious as some people are making it

07:49.440 --> 07:55.040
 out to be at the same time. And that we're not being given the tools to actually understand,

07:55.040 --> 08:00.000
 oh, here's how to interpret the data. The issue with the personal protective equipment

08:00.000 --> 08:05.440
 is actually a jurisdictional battle or a question of who pays for it rather than a question of

08:05.440 --> 08:10.800
 whether it's present or absent. I don't understand the details of it, but something is wildly off

08:10.800 --> 08:16.320
 in our ability to understand where we are. So that's policy, that's institutions. What about,

08:16.320 --> 08:22.960
 do you think about the quiet suffering of millions of people that have lost their job? Is this a

08:22.960 --> 08:30.080
 temporary thing? I mean, what I'm, my ears not to the suffering of those people who've lost their

08:30.080 --> 08:36.480
 job or the 50% possibly of small businesses that are going to go bankrupt. Do you think about that

08:37.600 --> 08:43.360
 quiet suffering? Well, and how that might arise itself? Could be not quiet too. I mean,

08:43.360 --> 08:48.880
 right, that's the, could be a depression. This could go from recession to depression. And depression

08:48.880 --> 08:56.880
 could go to armed conflict and then to war. So it's not a very abstract causal chain that gets us

08:56.880 --> 09:02.640
 to the point where we can begin with quiet suffering and anxiety and all of these sorts of

09:02.640 --> 09:08.320
 things and people losing their jobs and people dying from stress and all sorts of things. But

09:10.320 --> 09:17.680
 look, anything powerful enough to put us all indoors in a, I mean, think about this as an

09:17.680 --> 09:24.880
 incredible experiment. Imagine that you proposed, Hey, I want to do a bunch of research. Let's figure

09:24.880 --> 09:30.640
 out what changes in our emissions, emissions profiles for our carbon footprints when we're all

09:30.640 --> 09:36.400
 indoors or what happens to traffic patterns or what happens to the vulnerability of retail sales

09:37.440 --> 09:44.640
 as Amazon gets stronger, you know, et cetera, et cetera. I believe that in many of those situations,

09:46.640 --> 09:51.760
 we're running an incredible experiment. And am I worried for us all? Yes, there are some bright

09:51.760 --> 09:57.520
 spots, one of which is that when you're ordered to stay indoors, people are going to feel entitled.

09:57.520 --> 10:03.280
 And the usual thing that people are going to hit when they hear that they've lost your job, you know,

10:05.360 --> 10:12.880
 there's this kind of tough, tough love attitude that you see, particularly in the United States.

10:12.880 --> 10:18.560
 Oh, you lost your job, poor baby. Well, go retrain, get another one. I think there's going

10:18.560 --> 10:26.080
 to be a lot less appetite for that because we've been asked to sacrifice, to risk, to act collectively.

10:26.880 --> 10:32.080
 And that's the interesting thing. What does that reawaken in us? Maybe the idea that we actually

10:32.080 --> 10:38.160
 are nations and that, you know, your fellow countrymen may start to mean something to more

10:38.160 --> 10:43.440
 people, certainly mean something to people in the military. But I wonder how many people who

10:43.440 --> 10:47.920
 aren't in the military start to think about this as like, Oh, yeah, we are kind of running separate

10:47.920 --> 10:54.160
 experiments and we are not China. So you think this is kind of a period that might be studied for

10:54.160 --> 11:01.360
 years to come? From my perspective, we are a part of experiment, but I don't feel like we have access

11:01.360 --> 11:07.360
 to the full data, the full data of the experiment. We're just like little mice in a large...

11:08.240 --> 11:14.080
 Does this one make sense to you, Lex? I'm romanticizing it, and I keep connecting it to World

11:14.080 --> 11:19.520
 War II. So I keep connecting to historical events and making sense of them through that way,

11:19.520 --> 11:28.240
 or reading the plague by Camus. Like almost kind of telling narratives and stories, but it might...

11:29.040 --> 11:36.400
 I'm not hearing the suffering that people are going through, because I think that's quiet.

11:36.400 --> 11:41.760
 Everybody's numb currently. They're not realizing what it means to have lost your job

11:41.760 --> 11:52.640
 and to have lost your business. There's kind of a... I'm afraid how that fear will materialize

11:52.640 --> 11:59.520
 itself once the numbness wears out. And especially if this lasts for many months,

12:00.080 --> 12:05.760
 and if it's connected to the incompetence of the CDC and the WHO and our government

12:05.760 --> 12:14.000
 and perhaps the election process, my biggest fear is that the elections get delayed or something

12:14.000 --> 12:24.480
 like that. So the basic mechanisms of our democracy get slowed or damaged in some way

12:24.480 --> 12:29.360
 that then mixes with the fear that people have that turns to panic, that turns to anger.

12:29.360 --> 12:34.960
 That anger. Can I just play with that for a little bit? Sure. What if, in fact,

12:36.480 --> 12:42.720
 all of that structure that you grew up thinking about, and again, you grew up in two places,

12:42.720 --> 12:50.480
 right? So when you were inside the US, we tend to look at all of these things as museum pieces.

12:50.480 --> 12:56.240
 Like how often do we amend the Constitution anymore? And in some sense, if you think about

12:56.240 --> 13:02.400
 the Jewish tradition of Simba Torah, you've got this beautiful scroll that has been lovingly

13:03.040 --> 13:11.920
 hand drawn in calligraphy that's very valuable. And it's very important that you not treat it

13:12.480 --> 13:20.480
 as a relic to be revered. And so one day a year, we dance with the Torah and we hold this incredibly

13:20.480 --> 13:29.280
 vulnerable document up and we treat it as if it was Ginger Rogers being led by Fred Astaire.

13:29.280 --> 13:36.960
 Well, that is how you become part of your country. In fact, maybe the election will be delayed,

13:36.960 --> 13:42.240
 maybe extraordinary powers will be used, maybe any one of a number of things will indicate

13:42.240 --> 13:46.240
 that you're actually living through history. This isn't a museum piece that you were handed by

13:46.240 --> 13:52.880
 your great great grandparents. But you're kind of suggesting that there might be like a community

13:52.880 --> 14:01.680
 thing that pops up, like as opposed to an angry revolution, it might have a positive effect.

14:01.680 --> 14:09.040
 Well, for example, are you telling me that if the right person stood up and called for us to

14:09.040 --> 14:18.880
 sacrifice PPE for our nurses and our MDs who are on the front lines, that people wouldn't

14:19.600 --> 14:23.760
 reach down deep in their own supply that they've been stocking and carefully

14:23.760 --> 14:32.160
 storing there and just say, here, take it. Right now, an actual leader would use this time

14:32.160 --> 14:38.880
 to bring out the heroic character. And I'm going to just go wildly patriotic because I

14:38.880 --> 14:46.400
 friggin love this country. We've got this dormant population in the US that loves leadership and

14:46.400 --> 14:53.440
 country and pride in our freedom and not being told what to do. And we still have this thing

14:53.440 --> 15:00.960
 that binds us together and all of them, the merchants of division just be gone. I totally

15:00.960 --> 15:05.760
 agree with you. There's a, I think there is a deep hunger for that leadership. Why hasn't that,

15:06.640 --> 15:10.000
 why hasn't won a reason? Because we don't have the right surgeon general.

15:11.280 --> 15:16.080
 We have a guy saying, come on, guys, don't buy masks. They don't really work for you. Save them

15:16.080 --> 15:22.400
 for our healthcare professionals. No, you can't do that. You have to say, you know what, these

15:22.400 --> 15:28.000
 masks actually do work and they more work to protect other people from you. But they would

15:28.000 --> 15:32.720
 work for you. They'll keep you somewhat safer if you wear them. Here's the deal. You've got somebody

15:32.720 --> 15:37.280
 who's taking huge amounts of viral load all the time because the patients are shedding. Do you

15:37.280 --> 15:41.280
 want to protect that person who's volunteered to be in the front line, who's up sleepless nights?

15:42.640 --> 15:49.120
 You just change the message. You stop lying to people. You level with them. It's bad.

15:49.120 --> 15:54.720
 Absolutely. But that's a little bit specific. So you have to be just honest about the facts

15:54.720 --> 15:58.960
 of the situation. Yes. But I think you were referring to something bigger than just that.

15:59.760 --> 16:07.200
 Inspiring, rewriting the constitution, sort of rethinking how we work as a nation.

16:07.760 --> 16:12.640
 Yeah. I think you should probably amend the constitution once or twice in a lifetime

16:13.360 --> 16:18.880
 so that you don't get this distance from the foundational documents. And part of the problem

16:18.880 --> 16:25.680
 is that we've got two generations on top that feel very connected to the US. They feel bought in

16:25.680 --> 16:31.760
 and we've got three generations below. It's a little bit like watching your parents riding

16:31.760 --> 16:37.360
 the tricycle that they were supposed to pass on to you. And it's like, you're now too old to ride

16:37.360 --> 16:41.360
 a tricycle and they're still whooping it up, ringing the bell with the streamers coming off

16:41.360 --> 16:46.800
 the handlebars and you're just thinking, do you guys never get bored? Do you never pass a torch?

16:46.800 --> 16:52.640
 Do you really want it? We had five septicinarians, all born in the 40s, running for president of

16:52.640 --> 16:57.920
 the United States when Klobuchar dropped out. The youngest was Warren. We had Warren, Biden,

16:57.920 --> 17:05.920
 Sanders, Bloomberg, and Trump from like 1949 to 1941. All who have been the oldest president at

17:05.920 --> 17:10.960
 inauguration. And nobody says, grandma and grandpa, you're embarrassing us.

17:10.960 --> 17:18.880
 Except Joe Rogan. Let me put it on you. You have a big platform. You're somewhat of an

17:18.880 --> 17:28.400
 intelligent, eloquent guy. What role do you play? Why aren't you that leader? I would argue that

17:28.400 --> 17:36.320
 you're in ways becoming that leader. So I haven't taken enough risk. Is that your idea? What should

17:36.320 --> 17:43.040
 I do or say at the moment? No, you have taken quite a big risks and we'll talk about it.

17:43.760 --> 17:56.560
 But you're also on the outside shooting in, meaning you're dismantling the institution

17:57.280 --> 18:01.520
 from the outside as opposed to becoming the institution. Do you remember that thing you

18:01.520 --> 18:06.880
 brought up when you were on the view? The view? I'm sorry. When you were on Oprah?

18:07.840 --> 18:12.720
 I didn't get the invite. I'm sorry. When you were on Bill Maher's program,

18:12.720 --> 18:19.920
 what was that thing you were saying? They don't know we're here. They may watch us.

18:20.640 --> 18:28.880
 Yeah. They may quietly slip us a direct message, but they pretend that this internet thing is

18:28.880 --> 18:36.560
 some dangerous place where only lunatics play. Who has the bigger platform? The portal or Bill

18:36.560 --> 18:43.360
 Maher's program or the view? Bill Maher in the view. In terms of viewership or in terms of what's

18:43.360 --> 18:51.120
 the metric of size? Well, first of all, the key thing is take a newspaper and even imagine that

18:51.120 --> 18:58.480
 it's completely fake and then it has very little in the way of circulation. Yet imagine that it's

18:58.480 --> 19:03.520
 a 100 year old paper and that it's still part of this game, this internal game of media.

19:05.040 --> 19:08.640
 The key point is that those sources that have that kind of

19:11.280 --> 19:18.400
 mark of respectability to the institutional structures matter in a way that even if I say

19:18.400 --> 19:23.280
 something on a very large platform that makes a lot of sense, if it's outside of what I've called

19:23.280 --> 19:29.920
 the gated institutional narrative or gin, it doesn't matter to the institutions. The game is

19:30.560 --> 19:34.960
 if it happens outside of the club, we can pretend that it never happened.

19:36.080 --> 19:43.040
 How can you get the credibility and the authority from outside the gated institutional narrative?

19:43.040 --> 19:53.600
 Well, first of all, you and I both share institutional credibility coming from our associations. So

19:53.600 --> 20:00.720
 we were both at MIT. Were you at Harvard at any point? Nope. Okay. Well, and lived in Harvard

20:00.720 --> 20:08.480
 Square. So did I. But at some level, the issue isn't whether you have credentials in that sense.

20:08.480 --> 20:14.160
 The key question is, can you be trusted to file a flight plan and not deviate from that flight

20:14.160 --> 20:19.680
 plan when you are in an interview situation? Will you stick to the talking points? I will not.

20:20.960 --> 20:27.280
 And that's why you're not going to be allowed in the general conversation, which amplifies these

20:27.280 --> 20:32.160
 sentiments. But I'm still trying to. So your point, it would be, is that we're, let's say, both.

20:32.160 --> 20:37.920
 So you've done, how many Joe Rogan? Four. I've done four too, right? So both of us are somewhat

20:37.920 --> 20:43.440
 frequent guests. The show is huge. You know the power as well as I do. And people are going to

20:43.440 --> 20:48.000
 watch this conversation. Huge number watched our last one. By the way, I want to thank you for

20:48.000 --> 20:52.400
 that one. That was a terrific, terrific conversation. Really did change my life. Lex, you're a

20:52.400 --> 20:59.600
 brilliant interviewer. So thank you. Thank you. That was that you changed my life too. That you

20:59.600 --> 21:04.960
 gave me a chance. So I was. No, no, no. I'm so glad I did that one. What I would say is, is that we

21:04.960 --> 21:09.920
 keep mistaking how big the audience is for whether or not you have the kiss. And the kiss is a

21:09.920 --> 21:14.720
 different thing. Kiss? What does that stand for? Well, it doesn't, it's not an acronym yet. Okay.

21:14.720 --> 21:23.200
 It's a, thank you for asking. It's a question of, are you part of the interoperable institution

21:23.200 --> 21:28.160
 friendly discussion? And that's the discussion which we ultimately have to break into.

21:28.160 --> 21:34.480
 But that's what I'm trying to get at, is how do we, how does Eric Weinstein become the president

21:34.480 --> 21:39.120
 of the United States? I shouldn't become the president of the United States. Not interested.

21:39.120 --> 21:44.320
 Thank you very much for asking. Okay. Get into a leadership position where, I guess I don't know

21:44.320 --> 21:51.200
 what that means, but where you can inspire millions of people to inspire the sense of

21:51.200 --> 21:58.400
 community, inspire the, the kind of actions required to overcome hardship, the kind of hardship that

21:58.400 --> 22:06.320
 we may be experiencing, to inspire people to work hard and face the difficult, hard facts of the

22:06.320 --> 22:11.120
 realities we're living through, all those kinds of things that you're talking about. That leader,

22:12.720 --> 22:19.200
 you know, can that leader emerge from the current institutions? Or alternatively,

22:19.200 --> 22:22.800
 can it also emerge from the outside? I guess that's what I was asking.

22:22.800 --> 22:29.040
 So my belief is, is that this is the last hurrah for the elderly centerist kleptocrats.

22:31.680 --> 22:38.320
 Can you define each of those terms? Okay. Elderly. I mean, people who were born at least a year

22:39.360 --> 22:46.240
 before I was, that's a joke, you can laugh. No, because I'm born at the cusp of the Gen X boomer

22:46.240 --> 22:53.520
 divide. So centerist, they're pretending, you know, there are two parties, Democrat and Republican

22:53.520 --> 22:57.920
 party in the United States. I think it's easier to think of the mainstream of both of them as part

22:57.920 --> 23:03.360
 of a, an aggregate party that I sometimes call the looting party, which gets us to kleptocracy,

23:03.360 --> 23:09.840
 which is ruled by thieves. And the great temptation has been to treat the US like a trough. And you

23:09.840 --> 23:14.240
 just have to get yours because it's not like we're doing anything productive. So everybody's

23:14.240 --> 23:18.400
 sort of looting the family mansion and somebody stole the silver and somebody's cutting the

23:18.400 --> 23:23.280
 pictures out of the frames. And, you know, roughly speaking, we're watching our elders

23:25.120 --> 23:27.920
 live it up in a way that doesn't make sense to the rest of us.

23:28.800 --> 23:34.160
 Okay. So if it's the last hurrah, this is the time for leaders to step up.

23:34.160 --> 23:41.760
 Like, no, we're not ready yet. We're not ready. I call out, you know, the head of the CDC should

23:41.760 --> 23:48.480
 resign. Should resign. The head, the surgeon general should resign. Trump should resign. Pelosi

23:48.480 --> 23:52.880
 should resign. De Blasio should resign. They're not going to resign. I understand that. So that's

23:52.880 --> 23:58.960
 why, so we'll wait. No, but that's not how revolutions work. You don't wait for people to

23:58.960 --> 24:06.080
 resign. You step up and inspire the alternative. Do you remember the Russian revolution of 1907?

24:06.080 --> 24:12.160
 It's before my time. But there wasn't a Russian revolution of 1907.

24:12.160 --> 24:15.840
 So you're thinking we're in 1907, not 1907. I'm saying we're too early.

24:15.840 --> 24:22.800
 But we got this, you know, Spanish flu came in 17, 18. So I would argue that there's a lot of

24:22.800 --> 24:30.880
 parallels there or there were one. I think it's not time yet. Like John Prine, the songwriter,

24:30.880 --> 24:37.440
 just died of COVID. That was a pretty big. Really? Yeah. By the way, yes, of course, I,

24:40.000 --> 24:47.360
 every time we do this, we discover our mutual appreciation of obscure, brilliant, witty songwriter.

24:47.360 --> 24:51.920
 Well, he's really, he's really quite good, right? He's really good. Yeah. He died.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.720
 My understanding is that he passed recently due to complications of corona.

24:56.720 --> 25:04.240
 So we haven't had large enough, enough large, large enough shocking deaths yet,

25:05.280 --> 25:08.960
 picturesque deaths, deaths of a family that couldn't get treatment.

25:10.080 --> 25:15.040
 There are stories that will come and break our hearts. And we have not had enough of those.

25:15.040 --> 25:19.280
 The visuals haven't come in. But I think they're coming. Well, we'll find out.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.720
 But that you got to, you have to be there. He has to be there when they come. I mean,

25:22.720 --> 25:29.280
 but we didn't get the visual, for example, of falling man from 911. Right. So the outside world

25:29.280 --> 25:34.880
 did, but Americans were not, it was thought that we would be too delicate. So just the way you

25:34.880 --> 25:40.160
 remember Pulitzer Prize winning photographs from the Vietnam era, you don't easily remember

25:41.040 --> 25:45.600
 the photographs from all sorts of things that have happened since because something changed in

25:45.600 --> 25:52.880
 our media. We are in sense that we cannot feel or experience our own lives and the tragedy that

25:52.880 --> 25:58.720
 would animate us to action. Yeah. But I think there, again, I think there's going to be that

25:58.720 --> 26:05.280
 suffering that's going to build and build and build in terms of businesses, mom and pop shops that

26:05.280 --> 26:17.760
 close. And I think for myself, I think often that I'm being weak and I feel like I should be doing

26:17.760 --> 26:24.560
 something. I should be becoming a leader on a small scale. You can't. This is not World War II

26:24.560 --> 26:32.400
 and this is not Soviet Russia. Why not? Why not? Because our internal programming, the malware

26:32.400 --> 26:42.080
 that sits between our ears is much different than the propagandized malware of the Soviet era.

26:42.080 --> 26:49.200
 I mean, people were both very indoctrinated and also knew that some level it was BS.

26:49.920 --> 26:54.960
 They had a double mind. I don't know. There must be a great word in Russian for being able to think

26:54.960 --> 27:03.360
 both of those things simultaneously. You don't think people are actually sick of the partisanship,

27:04.080 --> 27:09.280
 sick of incompetence? Yeah, but I called for revolt the other day on Joe Rogan and people

27:09.280 --> 27:20.240
 found it quixotic. Well, because I think revolt is different. I'm really angry. I'm furious.

27:20.240 --> 27:25.840
 I cannot stand that this is my country at the moment. I'm embarrassed. So let's build a better

27:25.840 --> 27:35.280
 one. Yeah. I'm in. Okay, so let's take over a few universities. Let's start running a different

27:35.280 --> 27:42.560
 experiment at some of our better universities. When I did this experiment, I said, if this

27:42.560 --> 27:48.640
 were 40 years ago, the median age I believe of a university president was 51, that would have the

27:48.640 --> 27:55.040
 person in Gen X and we'd have a bunch of millennial presidents, a bunch of more than half Gen X.

27:56.080 --> 28:03.520
 It's almost 100% baby boom at this moment. How did that happen? We can get into how they changed

28:03.520 --> 28:12.320
 retirement, but this generation above us does not feel, or even the older generation,

28:12.320 --> 28:19.760
 the silent generation. I had Roger Penrose on my program. Thank you. I really appreciate that.

28:19.760 --> 28:23.840
 And I asked him a question that was very important to me. I said, look, you're in your late 80s.

28:24.800 --> 28:29.520
 Is there anyone you could point to as a successor that we should be watching? We can get excited.

28:30.960 --> 28:34.400
 Here's an opportunity to pass the baton. He said, well, let me hold off on that.

28:36.320 --> 28:41.440
 Is it ever the right moment to point to somebody younger than you to keep your flame alive after

28:41.440 --> 28:46.320
 you're gone? And also, I don't know whether I'm just going to admit to this. People treat me like

28:46.320 --> 28:53.120
 I'm crazy for caring about the world after I'm dead, or wanting to be remembered after you're

28:53.120 --> 28:58.320
 gone. Well, what does it matter to you? You're gone. It's this deeply secular, somatic perspective

28:58.320 --> 29:07.360
 on everything. You know that phrase in, as time goes by, he says, it's still the same old story,

29:07.360 --> 29:16.320
 a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die. I don't think people imagined then that there

29:16.320 --> 29:23.840
 wouldn't be a story about fighting for love and glory. And like we are so out of practice about

29:23.840 --> 29:31.520
 fighting rivals for love and fighting for glory and something bigger than yourself.

29:31.520 --> 29:38.880
 But the hunger is there. Well, that was the point then, right? The whole idea is that Rick was,

29:39.600 --> 29:44.640
 you know, he was like Han Solo of his time. He's just like, I stick my neck out for nobody. You

29:44.640 --> 29:49.360
 know, it's like, oh, come on, Rick, you're just pretending you actually have a big soul, right?

29:49.360 --> 29:53.920
 And so at some level, that's the question. Do we have a big soul or is it just all bullshit?

29:53.920 --> 30:00.480
 See, I think there's huge Manhattan project style projects, whether you talk about physical

30:00.480 --> 30:09.600
 infrastructure or going to Mars, you know, the SpaceX, NASA efforts or huge, huge scientific

30:09.600 --> 30:13.280
 efforts. Well, we need to get back into the institutions and we need to remove the weak

30:13.280 --> 30:17.280
 leadership that we have weak leaders and the weak leaders need to be removed and they need

30:17.280 --> 30:22.400
 to seat people more dangerous than the people who are currently sitting in a lot of those chairs.

30:22.400 --> 30:31.600
 Or build new institutions. Good luck. Well, so one of the nice things from the internet is,

30:31.600 --> 30:38.320
 for example, somebody like you can have a bigger voice than almost anybody at the particular

30:38.320 --> 30:42.640
 institutions we're talking about. That's true. But the thing is, I might say something.

30:43.440 --> 30:48.240
 You can count on the fact that the, you know, provost at Princeton isn't going to say anything.

30:48.240 --> 30:53.920
 What do you mean? To afraid? Well, if that person were to give an interview,

30:55.040 --> 31:00.160
 how are things going in research at Princeton? Well, I'm hesitant to say it, but they're

31:00.160 --> 31:04.720
 perhaps as good as they've ever been and I think they're going to get better. Oh, is that right?

31:04.720 --> 31:12.720
 All fields? Yep. I don't see a weak one. It's just like, okay, great. Who are you and what are you even saying?

31:12.720 --> 31:20.640
 We're just used to total nonsense 24 seven. Yeah. What do you think might be a beautiful

31:21.520 --> 31:27.360
 thing that comes out of this? Is there a hope, like a little inkling,

31:27.360 --> 31:30.160
 a little fire of hope you have about our time right now?

31:31.360 --> 31:38.480
 Yeah, I think one thing is coming to understand that the freaks, weirdos, mutants, and other

31:38.480 --> 31:47.360
 nair duels, sometimes referred to as grifters. I like that one. Grifters and Gadflies were

31:48.240 --> 31:53.440
 very often the earliest people on the coronavirus. That's a really interesting question. Why was that?

31:54.000 --> 32:02.000
 And it seems to be that they had already paid such a social price that they weren't going to be

32:02.000 --> 32:08.720
 beaten up by being told that, oh my God, you're xenophobic. You just hate China.

32:10.000 --> 32:16.160
 Or, wow, you sound like a conspiracy theorist. So if you'd already paid those prices, you were

32:16.160 --> 32:21.040
 free to think about this and everyone in an institutional framework was terrified that

32:21.040 --> 32:29.280
 they didn't want to be seen as the alarmist, the chicken little. And so that's why you have this

32:29.280 --> 32:35.920
 confidence where De Blasio says, get on with your lives, get back in there and celebrate

32:35.920 --> 32:42.800
 Chinese New Year in Chinatown despite coronavirus. It's like, okay, really? So you just always thought

32:42.800 --> 32:48.240
 everything would automatically be okay if you adopted that posture.

32:48.880 --> 32:54.880
 So you think this time reveals the weakness of our institutions and reveals the strength

32:54.880 --> 33:01.680
 of our Gadflies and the weirdos and the... No, not necessarily the strength, but the value of

33:01.680 --> 33:06.720
 freedom, like a different way of saying it would be, wow, even your Gadflies and your grifters

33:06.720 --> 33:11.040
 were able to beat your institutional folks because your institutional folks were playing

33:11.040 --> 33:17.040
 with a giant mental handicap. So just imagine like we were in the story of Harrison Bergeron

33:17.040 --> 33:25.120
 by Vonnegut and our smartest people were all subjected to distracting noises every seven

33:25.120 --> 33:31.760
 seconds. Well, they would be functionally much dumber because they couldn't continue a thought

33:31.760 --> 33:36.240
 through all the disturbance. So in some sense, that's a little bit like what belonging to an

33:36.240 --> 33:40.160
 institution is, is that if you have to make a public statement, of course the surgeon general

33:40.160 --> 33:44.480
 is going to be the worst because they're just playing with too much of a handicap. There are

33:44.480 --> 33:49.680
 too many institutional players are like, don't screw us up. And so the person has to say something

33:49.680 --> 33:55.360
 wrong. We're going to back propagate a falsehood. And this is very interesting. Some of my socially

33:55.360 --> 33:59.920
 oriented friends say, Eric, I don't understand what you're on about. Of course masks work,

33:59.920 --> 34:03.520
 but you know what they're trying to do? They're trying to get us not to buy up the masks for

34:03.520 --> 34:09.360
 the doctors. And I think, okay, so you imagine that we can just create scientific fiction at will

34:09.360 --> 34:14.560
 so that you can run whatever social program you want. This is what I, you know, my point is get

34:14.560 --> 34:19.040
 out of my lab, get out of the lab. You don't belong in the lab. You're not meant for the lab.

34:19.040 --> 34:23.200
 You're constitutionally incapable of being around the lab. You need to leave the lab.

34:23.760 --> 34:32.320
 You think the CEC and WHO knew that masks work? And we're trying to sort of imagine that people

34:32.320 --> 34:40.320
 are kind of stupid and they would buy masks in excess if they were told that masks work. Is that,

34:40.320 --> 34:47.600
 like, because this does seem to be a particularly clear example of mistakes made.

34:48.720 --> 34:53.200
 You're asking me this question? Yeah. No, you're not. What do you think, Lex?

34:54.080 --> 34:57.040
 Well, I actually probably disagree with you a little bit. Great. Let's do it.

34:57.040 --> 35:01.920
 But I think it's not so easy to be honest with the populace

35:03.760 --> 35:13.200
 when the danger of panic is always around the corner. So I think the kind of honesty you exhibit

35:14.560 --> 35:23.920
 appeals to a certain class of brave intellectual minds that appeals to me, but I don't know

35:23.920 --> 35:30.480
 from the perspective of WHO, I don't know if it's so obvious that they should

35:32.640 --> 35:38.880
 be honest 100% of the time with people. I'm not saying you should be perfectly

35:38.880 --> 35:44.160
 transparent and 100% honest. I'm saying that the quality of your lies has to be very high

35:44.160 --> 35:50.080
 and it has to be public spirited. There's a big difference between... So I'm not a child about

35:50.080 --> 35:54.880
 this. I'm not saying that when you're at war, for example, you turn over all of your plans

35:54.880 --> 36:00.640
 to the enemy because it's important that you're transparent with 360 degree visibility far from

36:00.640 --> 36:06.720
 it. What I'm saying is something has been forgotten and I forgot who it was who told it to me,

36:06.720 --> 36:12.240
 but it was a fellow graduate student in the Harvard Math Department and he said,

36:12.800 --> 36:16.560
 you know, I learned one thing being out in the workforce because he was one of the few people

36:16.560 --> 36:23.040
 who had had a work life in the department as a graduate and he said, you can be friends with

36:23.040 --> 36:27.680
 your boss, but if you're going to be friends with your boss, you have to be doing a good job at work.

36:29.760 --> 36:35.920
 And there's an analog here, which is if you're going to be reasonably honest with the population,

36:36.640 --> 36:40.720
 you have to be doing a good job at work as the surgeon general or as the head of the CDC.

36:40.720 --> 36:48.480
 So if you're doing a terrible job, you're supposed to resign. And then the next person is supposed

36:48.480 --> 36:53.760
 to say, look, I'm not going to lie to you. I inherited the situation. It was in a bit of disarray,

36:54.800 --> 36:59.120
 but I had several requirements before I agreed to step in and take the job because I needed to

36:59.120 --> 37:02.720
 know I could turn it around. I needed to know that I had clear lines of authority. I needed to

37:02.720 --> 37:06.960
 know that I had the resources available in order to rectify the problem and I needed to know that

37:06.960 --> 37:11.120
 I had the ability and the freedom to level with the American people directly as I saw fit. All of

37:11.120 --> 37:16.720
 my wishes were granted and that's why I'm happy here on Monday morning. I've got my sleeves rolled

37:16.720 --> 37:20.880
 up. Boy, do we got a lot to do. So please come back in two weeks and then ask me how I'm doing

37:20.880 --> 37:26.160
 then and I hope to have something to show you. That's how you do it. So why is that excellence

37:26.160 --> 37:34.320
 and basic competence missing? The big net. You see, you come from multiple traditions where it

37:34.320 --> 37:40.240
 was very important to remember things. The Soviet tradition made sure that you remembered the

37:40.240 --> 37:47.200
 sacrifices that came in that war. And the Jewish tradition, we're doing this on Passover, right?

37:47.920 --> 37:53.920
 Okay. Well, every year we tell one simple story. Well, why can't it be different every year? Maybe

37:53.920 --> 37:59.920
 we could have a rotating series of seven story because it's the one story that you need. It's

37:59.920 --> 38:04.480
 like, you work with the men in black group, right? And it's the last suit that you'll ever need. This

38:04.480 --> 38:11.840
 is the last story that you ever need. Don't think I fell for your neuralyzer last time. In any event,

38:12.480 --> 38:17.040
 we tell one story because it's the get out of dodge story. There's a time when you need to not

38:17.040 --> 38:23.280
 wait for the bread to rise. And that's the thing, which is even if you live through a great nap,

38:23.280 --> 38:29.920
 you deserve to know what it feels like to have to leave everything that has become comfortable and

38:29.920 --> 38:40.320
 unworkable. It's sad that you need that tragedy. I imagine to have the tradition of remembering.

38:41.520 --> 38:49.120
 It's sad to think that because things have been nice and comfortable means that we can't have

38:49.120 --> 38:58.960
 great competent leaders, which is kind of the implied statement. Can we have great leaders

38:58.960 --> 39:07.040
 who take big risks, who inspire hard work, who deal with difficult truth, even though things

39:07.040 --> 39:13.680
 have been comfortable? Well, we know what those people sound like. I mean, if for example,

39:13.680 --> 39:19.520
 Jaco Willink suddenly threw his hat into the ring, everyone would say, okay,

39:21.920 --> 39:27.760
 right, party's over. It's time to get up at 4.30 and really work hard. And we've got to get back

39:27.760 --> 39:37.520
 into fighting shape. And yeah, but Jaco is a very special, I think that whole group of people

39:37.520 --> 39:46.960
 by profession put themselves into hardship on a daily basis. And he's not, well, I don't know,

39:46.960 --> 39:52.480
 but he's probably not going to be, well, could Jaco be president?

39:52.480 --> 39:56.960
 Okay, but it doesn't have to be Jaco, right? In other words, if it was Kai Lenny or if it was

39:59.360 --> 40:05.600
 Alex Honnold from rock climbing. They're just serious people. They're serious people

40:05.600 --> 40:13.520
 who can't afford your BS. Yeah, but why do we have serious people that do rock climbing

40:14.480 --> 40:23.120
 and don't have serious people who lead the nation? Because that was a, those skills

40:23.120 --> 40:29.840
 needed in rock climbing are not good during the big nap. And at the tail end of the big nap,

40:29.840 --> 40:34.880
 they would get you fired. But I don't, don't you think there's a fundamental part of human

40:34.880 --> 40:39.040
 nature that desires to, to excel to be exceptionally good at your job?

40:39.680 --> 40:45.840
 Yeah, but what is your job? I mean, in other words, my point to you is if you, if you're a

40:45.840 --> 40:52.240
 general in a peacetime army and your major activity is playing war games, what if the

40:52.240 --> 40:56.960
 skills needed to win war games are very different than the skills needed to win wars because you

40:56.960 --> 41:02.560
 know how the war games are scored and you've, you've done moneyball, for example, with war games.

41:02.560 --> 41:08.640
 And you figured out how to win games on paper. So then the advancement skill becomes divergent

41:08.640 --> 41:16.320
 from the ultimate skill that it was proxying for. Yeah, but you create, we're good as human

41:16.320 --> 41:24.000
 beings to, I mean, at least me, I can't do a big nap. So at any one moment when I finish something,

41:24.000 --> 41:30.400
 a new dream pops up. So go into Mars. What do you like to do? You like to do Brazilian jujitsu?

41:30.400 --> 41:33.200
 Well, first of all, I like to do everything. You like to play guitar?

41:33.200 --> 41:38.480
 Guitar. You do this podcast, you do theory. You're always, you're constantly taking risks

41:38.480 --> 41:44.800
 and exposing yourself, right? Why? Because you got one of those crazy, I'm sorry to say it,

41:44.800 --> 41:49.440
 you got an Eastern European Jewish personality, which I'm still tied to. And I'm a couple of

41:49.440 --> 41:56.400
 generations more distant than you are. And I've held on to that thing because it's valuable to me.

41:56.400 --> 42:01.440
 You don't think there's a huge percent of the populace, even in the United States, that's

42:01.440 --> 42:07.360
 that might be a little bit dormant. But do you know Anna Hachin from the Red Scare podcast?

42:07.360 --> 42:10.880
 Did you interview her? Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I listened. Yeah, yeah, yeah. She was great.

42:10.880 --> 42:15.520
 She was great, right? Yeah, she's fun. She's terrific. But she also has the same thing going

42:15.520 --> 42:22.000
 on. And I made a joke in the liner notes for that episode, which is somewhere on the road from

42:22.000 --> 42:27.760
 Stalingrad to Forever 21, something was lost. How can Stalingrad and Forever 21 be in the same

42:27.760 --> 42:34.720
 sentence? And in part, it's that weird thing. It's like trying to remember. Even words, like,

42:34.720 --> 42:40.400
 I mean, Russian and Hebrew, things like, it's like, but Pomyat and Lyskor, these words have

42:40.400 --> 42:50.240
 much more potency about memory. And I don't know. I think there's still a dormant populace

42:50.240 --> 42:58.000
 that craves leaders on a small scale and large scale. And I hope to be that leader on a small

42:58.000 --> 43:06.160
 scale. And I think you, sir, have a role to be a leader. You kids go ahead without me. I'm just

43:06.160 --> 43:12.000
 going to, I'm going to do a little bit of weird podcast. See, now you're, you're putting on your

43:12.000 --> 43:17.760
 Joe Rogan hat. He says, I'm just a comedian. Oh, no, I'm not. You say I'm just, that's not that.

43:17.760 --> 43:24.080
 If I say I want to lead too much because of the big nap, there's like a group, a chorus of automated

43:24.080 --> 43:29.600
 idiots. And their first thought is like, ah, I knew it. This was a power grab all along. Why

43:29.600 --> 43:34.320
 should you lead? You know, just like, and so the, the idea is you're just trying to skirt around,

43:34.320 --> 43:39.120
 not stepping on all of the idiot landmines. It's like, okay. So now I'm going to hear

43:39.120 --> 43:44.160
 that in my inbox for the next three days. Okay. So lead by example, just live. No, I mean,

43:44.160 --> 43:48.160
 large platform. Look, we should take over the institutions. There are institutions,

43:48.160 --> 43:54.560
 we've got bad leadership, we should mutiny, and we should inject a, I don't know, 15%, 20%,

43:56.160 --> 44:01.760
 disagreeable, dissident, very aggressive, loner, individual, mutant freaks, all the people that

44:01.760 --> 44:06.800
 you go to see Avengers movies about, or the X men or whatever it is, and stop pretending that

44:06.800 --> 44:15.200
 everything good comes out of some great giant inclusive communal 12 hour meeting. It's like,

44:15.200 --> 44:23.120
 stop it. That's not how shit happens. You recently published the video of a lecture,

44:23.120 --> 44:29.520
 you gave it Oxford presenting some aspects of a theory, theory of everything called geometric

44:29.520 --> 44:39.200
 unity. So this was a work of 30, 30 plus years. This is life's work. Let me ask you the, the

44:39.200 --> 44:46.720
 silly old question. How do you feel as a human, excited, scared, the experience of posting it?

44:47.840 --> 44:51.840
 You know, it's funny. One of the, one of the things that you, you learn to feel as an academic

44:51.840 --> 45:01.040
 is the great sins you can commit in academics is to show yourself to be a non serious person,

45:01.040 --> 45:09.440
 to show yourself to have delusions, to avoid the standard practices, which everyone has signed

45:09.440 --> 45:18.800
 up for. And, you know, it's weird because like, you know that those people are going to be angry.

45:18.800 --> 45:25.920
 He did what? You know, why would he do that? And, and what we're referring to, for example,

45:26.480 --> 45:32.320
 the traditions of sort of publishing incrementally, certainly not trying to have a theory of everything,

45:33.360 --> 45:38.640
 perhaps working within the academic departments. Yep. All those things. That's true.

45:39.680 --> 45:45.120
 And so you're going outside of all of that. Well, I mean, I was going inside of all of that.

45:45.120 --> 45:52.720
 And we did not come to terms when I was inside. And what they did was so outside to me was so

45:52.720 --> 45:59.600
 weird, so freakish. Like the most senior respectable people at the most senior respectable places

45:59.600 --> 46:05.040
 were functionally insane, as far as I could tell. And again, it's like being functionally stupid

46:05.040 --> 46:10.560
 if you're the head of the CDC or something where, you know, you're giving recommendations out that

46:10.560 --> 46:14.160
 aren't based on what you actually believe, they're based on what you think you have to be doing.

46:14.160 --> 46:19.680
 Well, in some sense, I think that that's a lot of how I saw the math and physics world as

46:21.520 --> 46:25.600
 the physics world was really crazy. And the math world was considerably less crazy,

46:25.600 --> 46:31.920
 just very strict and kind of dogmatic. We'll psychoanalyze those folks, but I really want to

46:33.200 --> 46:38.640
 maybe linger on it a little bit longer of how you feel because this is such a, such a special

46:38.640 --> 46:41.840
 moment in your life. Well, I really appreciate it. It's a great question. So that if we can

46:41.840 --> 46:54.320
 pair off some of those other issues, it's new being able to say what the observer is,

46:54.320 --> 46:59.440
 which is my attempt to replace space time with something that is both closely related to space

46:59.440 --> 47:06.720
 time and not space time. So I used to carry the number 14 as a closely guarded secret in my life.

47:06.720 --> 47:14.720
 And where 14 is really four dimensions of space and time plus 10 extra dimensions of rulers

47:14.720 --> 47:20.000
 and protractors or for the cool kids out there, symmetric two tensors.

47:20.960 --> 47:26.640
 So you had a geometric, a complicated, beautiful geometric view of the world that you carried

47:26.640 --> 47:32.560
 with you for a long time. Yeah. Did you, did you have friends that you colleagues that you

47:32.560 --> 47:38.320
 essentially know? Talked? No. In fact, part of these, part of some of these stories are me coming

47:38.320 --> 47:46.000
 out to my friends. And I use the phrase coming out because I think that gays have monopolized

47:46.000 --> 47:50.320
 the concept of the closet. Many of us are in closets and having nothing to do with their

47:50.320 --> 47:56.880
 sexual orientation. Yeah, I didn't really feel comfortable talking to almost anyone. So this

47:56.880 --> 48:03.600
 was a closely guarded secret. And I think that I let on in some ways that I was up to something and

48:03.600 --> 48:09.360
 probably, but it was a very weird life. So I had to have a series of things that I pretended to care

48:09.360 --> 48:14.160
 about so that I could use that as the stalking horse for what I really cared about. And to your

48:14.160 --> 48:19.760
 point, I never understood this whole thing about theories of everything. Like if you were going

48:19.760 --> 48:25.280
 to go into something like theoretical physics, isn't that what you would normally pursue?

48:25.280 --> 48:30.400
 Like, wouldn't it be crazy to do something that difficult and that poorly paid if you were going

48:30.400 --> 48:36.240
 to try to do something other than figure out what this is all about? Now I have to reveal my cards,

48:36.240 --> 48:42.080
 my sort of weaknesses and lack and understanding of the music of the physics and math departments.

48:42.640 --> 48:50.400
 But there's an analogy here to artificial intelligence. And often folks come in and say,

48:50.400 --> 48:56.560
 okay, so there's a giant department working on quote unquote artificial intelligence. But why is

48:56.560 --> 49:04.880
 nobody actually working on intelligence? Like you're all just building little toys. You're not

49:04.880 --> 49:11.840
 actually trying to understand and that breaks a lot of people. It confuses them because like,

49:11.840 --> 49:17.920
 okay, so I'm at MIT, I'm at Stanford, I'm at Harvard, I'm here, I dreamed of being working on

49:17.920 --> 49:24.240
 artificial intelligence. Why is everybody not actually working on intelligence? And I have the

49:24.240 --> 49:30.160
 same kind of sense that that's what working on the theory of everything is. That strangely,

49:30.160 --> 49:34.320
 you somehow become an outcast for even. But we know why this is, right?

49:35.840 --> 49:40.000
 Why? Well, it's because let's take the artificial, let's play with AGI, for example.

49:40.000 --> 49:45.680
 Yeah. I think that the idea starts off with nobody really knows how to work on that.

49:45.680 --> 49:51.200
 And so if we don't know how to work on it, we choose instead to work on a program that is

49:51.200 --> 49:57.600
 tangentially related to it. So we do a component of a program that is related to that big question

49:57.600 --> 50:03.840
 because it's felt like, at least I can make progress there. And that wasn't where I was.

50:03.840 --> 50:10.240
 Where I was in, it's funny, there was this book called Frieden Uhlenbeck and it had this weird

50:10.240 --> 50:16.560
 mysterious line in the beginning of it. And I tried to get clarification of this weird mysterious

50:16.560 --> 50:22.080
 line and everyone said wrong things. And then I said, okay, well, so I can tell that nobody's

50:22.080 --> 50:27.280
 thinking properly because I just asked the entire department and nobody has a correct

50:27.280 --> 50:32.800
 interpretation of this. And so, you know, it's a little bit like you see a crime scene photo

50:33.840 --> 50:37.920
 and you have a different idea. Like there's a smoking gun and you figure,

50:37.920 --> 50:41.760
 that's actually a cigarette lighter. I don't really believe that. And then there's like a

50:41.760 --> 50:46.160
 pack of cards and you think, oh, that looks like the blunt instrument that the person was beaten

50:46.160 --> 50:51.680
 with. So you have a very different idea about how things go and very quickly you realize that

50:51.680 --> 50:58.320
 there's no one thinking about that. There's a few human sides to this and technical sides,

50:58.320 --> 51:04.640
 both of which I'd love to try to get down to. So the human side, I can tell from my perspective,

51:04.640 --> 51:10.560
 I think it was before April 1st, April Fools, maybe the day before, I forget. But I was laying in

51:10.560 --> 51:19.440
 bed in the middle of the night and somehow it popped up, you know, on my feed somewhere that

51:20.080 --> 51:27.520
 your beautiful face is speaking live. And I clicked and, you know, it's kind of weird how

51:27.520 --> 51:32.800
 the universe just brings things together in this kind of way. And all of a sudden I realized that

51:32.800 --> 51:39.040
 there's something big happening at this particular moment. It's strange, on a day like any day.

51:40.320 --> 51:46.480
 And all of a sudden you were thinking of, you had this somber tone, like you were serious,

51:46.480 --> 51:54.800
 like you were going through some difficult decision. And it seems strange, I almost thought you were

51:54.800 --> 51:59.520
 maybe joking, but there was a serious decision being made and it was a wonderful experience to

51:59.520 --> 52:03.840
 go through with you. I really appreciate it. I mean, it was April 1st. Yeah, it was kind of

52:03.840 --> 52:12.000
 fascinating. I mean, it's just a whole experience. And so I want to ask, I mean, thank you for letting

52:12.000 --> 52:20.080
 me be part of that kind of journey of decision making that took 30 years. But why now? Why did

52:20.080 --> 52:26.640
 you think, why did you struggle so long not to release it and decide to release it now?

52:26.640 --> 52:34.320
 On a, while the whole world is on lockdown, on April Fool's, is it just because you like the

52:34.320 --> 52:42.160
 comedy of absurd ways that the universe comes together? I don't think so. I think that the

52:42.160 --> 52:50.400
 COVID epidemic is the end of the big nap. And I think that I actually tried this seven years earlier

52:50.400 --> 52:59.360
 in Oxford. So I, and it was too early. Which part was too early? Is it the platform? Because

52:59.360 --> 53:04.640
 your platform is quite different now, actually, the internet. I remember you, I read several

53:04.640 --> 53:08.880
 your brilliant answers that people should read for the Edge questions. One of them was related to

53:08.880 --> 53:14.160
 the internet. And it was the first one. Was it the first one? Yeah. An essay called Go Virtual

53:14.160 --> 53:19.440
 Young Man. Yeah. Yeah, that seemed, that's like forever ago now. Well, that was 10 years ago.

53:19.440 --> 53:23.760
 And that's exactly what I did is I decamped to the internet, which is where the portal lives,

53:23.760 --> 53:30.560
 the portal, the portal, the portal. Yeah. Well, we'll insert the theme, the ominous theme music

53:30.560 --> 53:36.160
 which you can just listen to forever. I actually started recording a tiny guitar licks

53:37.360 --> 53:42.560
 for the audio portion, not for the video portion. You've kind of inspired me with

53:42.560 --> 53:47.840
 bringing your guitar into the story, but keep going. So you thought, so the Oxford was like

53:47.840 --> 53:53.920
 step one and you kind of, you put your foot into the, in the water to sample it, but it was too

53:53.920 --> 53:58.640
 cold at the time. So you didn't want to step in. I was just really disappointed. What was

53:58.640 --> 54:03.040
 disappointing about that experience? It's a hard thing to talk about. It has to do with the fact

54:03.040 --> 54:10.320
 that, and I can see this, you know, this mirrors a disappointment within myself. There are two

54:10.320 --> 54:16.720
 separate issues. One is the issue of making sure that the idea is actually heard and explored.

54:16.720 --> 54:22.960
 And the other is the, is the question about will I become disconnected from my work

54:24.000 --> 54:29.040
 because it will be ridiculed. It will be immediately improved. It will be found to be

54:29.040 --> 54:34.240
 derivative of something that occurred in some paper in 1957. When the community does not want

54:34.240 --> 54:41.840
 you to gain a voice, it's a little bit like a policeman deciding to weirdly enforce all of

54:41.840 --> 54:49.760
 these little known regulations against you and, you know, sometimes nobody else. And I think that's

54:49.760 --> 54:58.960
 kind of, you know, this weird thing where I just don't believe that we can reach the final theory

54:59.520 --> 55:05.280
 necessarily within the political economy of academics. So if you think about how academics

55:05.280 --> 55:11.040
 are tortured by each other and how they're paid and where they have freedom and where they don't,

55:11.040 --> 55:15.680
 I actually weirdly think that that system of selective pressures is going to eliminate anybody

55:15.680 --> 55:17.440
 who's going to make real progress.

55:17.440 --> 55:21.840
 So that's interesting. So if you look at the story of Andrew Wiles, for example,

55:21.840 --> 55:29.360
 with, from my last theorem, I mean, he, as far as I understand, he pretty much isolated himself

55:29.360 --> 55:35.520
 from the world of academics in terms of the big, the bulk of the work he did. And it, from my

55:35.520 --> 55:41.760
 perspective, is dramatic and fun to read about, but it seemed exceptionally stressful. The first

55:41.760 --> 55:47.040
 step he took, the first steps he took when actually making the work public, that seemed, to me,

55:47.040 --> 55:47.680
 would be hell.

55:48.400 --> 55:54.560
 Yeah, but it's like so artificially dramatic. You know, he leads up to it at a series of lectures.

55:55.280 --> 56:00.640
 He doesn't want to say it. And then he finally says it at the end, because obviously this comes

56:00.640 --> 56:05.600
 out of a body of work where, I mean, the funny part about, for my last theorem is it wasn't

56:05.600 --> 56:10.480
 originally thought to be a deep and meaningful problem. It was just an easy to state one that

56:10.480 --> 56:16.800
 had gone unsolved. But if you think about it, it became attached to the body of regular theory.

56:17.360 --> 56:21.760
 So he built up this body of regular theory, gets all the way up to the end, announces.

56:22.560 --> 56:27.120
 And then like, there's this whole drama about, okay, somebody's checking the proof. I don't

56:27.120 --> 56:32.000
 understand what's going on in line 37. You know, and like, oh, is this serious? It seems a little

56:32.000 --> 56:33.200
 bit more serious than we knew.

56:33.200 --> 56:37.680
 I mean, do you see parallels? Do you share the concern that your experience might be something

56:37.680 --> 56:38.080
 similar?

56:38.080 --> 56:42.560
 Well, in his case, I think that if I recall correctly, his original proof was unsalvageable.

56:43.600 --> 56:49.920
 He actually came up with a second proof with a colleague, Richard Taylor,

56:50.800 --> 56:55.040
 and it was that second proof which carried the day. So it was a little bit that he got

56:55.040 --> 57:00.640
 put under incredible pressure and then had to succeed in a new way having failed the first

57:00.640 --> 57:03.360
 time, which is like, even a weirder and stranger story.

57:03.360 --> 57:08.720
 That's an incredible story in some sense. But I mean, are you, I'm trying to get a sense of the

57:08.720 --> 57:09.520
 kind of stress you're on.

57:09.520 --> 57:15.040
 I think that this is okay, but I'm rejecting. What I don't think people understand with me

57:15.040 --> 57:22.720
 is the scale of the critique. It's like, I don't, people say, well, you must implicitly agree with

57:22.720 --> 57:28.800
 this and implicitly agree. And it's like, no, try me. Ask before you decide that I am mostly

57:28.800 --> 57:33.120
 in agreement with the community about how these things should be handled or what these things

57:33.120 --> 57:33.520
 mean.

57:33.520 --> 57:42.640
 Can you elaborate? And also, just why this criticism matter so much here? So you seem to

57:43.280 --> 57:48.560
 dislike the burden of criticism that it will choke away all.

57:48.560 --> 57:53.680
 There's different kinds of criticism. There's constructive criticism and there's destructive

57:53.680 --> 58:02.080
 criticism. And what I don't like is I don't like a community that can't, first of all,

58:02.080 --> 58:07.360
 like if you take the physics community, just the way we screwed up on masks and PPE,

58:08.560 --> 58:12.240
 just the way we screwed up in the financial crisis and mortgage back securities, we screwed

58:12.240 --> 58:13.120
 up on string theory.

58:13.680 --> 58:15.840
 Can we just forget the string theory happened or?

58:15.840 --> 58:21.280
 Sure. But then somebody should say that, right? Somebody should say, you know, it didn't work

58:21.280 --> 58:21.440
 out.

58:22.160 --> 58:22.480
 Yeah.

58:24.320 --> 58:28.640
 But okay, but you're asking this, like, why do you guys get to keep the prestige after

58:28.640 --> 58:32.000
 failing for 35 years? That's an interesting question.

58:32.000 --> 58:33.920
 Who is the you guys? Because to me,

58:33.920 --> 58:38.560
 Whoever the profession, look, these things, if there is a theory of everything to be had,

58:38.560 --> 58:43.600
 right, it's going to be a relatively small group of people where this will be sorted out.

58:43.600 --> 58:44.080
 Absolutely.

58:44.080 --> 58:49.200
 It's not tens of thousands. It's probably hundreds at the top.

58:50.320 --> 59:00.240
 But within that community, there's the assholes. There's the, I mean, you have,

59:00.240 --> 59:04.560
 you always in this world have people who are kind, open minded.

59:04.560 --> 59:09.920
 It's not a question about kind. It's a question about, okay, let's imagine, for example,

59:09.920 --> 59:15.440
 that you have a story where you believe that ulcers are definitely caused by stress.

59:17.440 --> 59:21.120
 And you've never questioned it, or maybe you felt like the Japanese came out of the blue

59:21.120 --> 59:26.480
 and attacked us at Pearl Harbor, right? And now somebody introduces a new idea to you,

59:26.480 --> 59:31.280
 which is like, what if it isn't stress at all? Or what if we actually tried to make resource

59:31.280 --> 59:36.320
 star of Japan attack us somewhere in the Pacific so we could have Cassus Belli to enter the Asian

59:36.320 --> 59:42.160
 theater? And the person's original idea is like, what? What are you even saying? You know, it's

59:42.160 --> 59:51.680
 like too crazy. Well, when Dirac in 1963 talked about the importance of beauty as a guiding

59:51.680 --> 59:57.760
 principle in physics, and he wasn't talking about the scientific method. That was crazy talk.

59:58.880 --> 1:00:02.960
 But he was actually making a great point. And he was using Schrodinger. And I think it was,

1:00:02.960 --> 1:00:07.920
 Schrodinger was standing in for him. And he said that if your equations don't agree with

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:13.440
 experiment, that's kind of a minor detail. If they have true beauty in them, you should explore them

1:00:13.440 --> 1:00:20.000
 because very often the agreement with experiment is an issue of fine tuning of your model,

1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:25.920
 of the instantiation. And so it doesn't really tell you that your model is wrong. And of course,

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:31.840
 Heisenberg told Dirac that his model was wrong, because that the proton and the electron should

1:00:31.840 --> 1:00:37.520
 be the same mass if they are each other's antiparticles. And that was an irrelevant

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:42.880
 kind of silliness rather than a real threat to the Dirac theory.

1:00:42.880 --> 1:00:49.200
 But okay, so amidst all this silliness, I'm hoping that we could talk about the journey

1:00:49.200 --> 1:00:55.040
 that geometric unity has taken and will take as an idea and an idea that will see the light.

1:00:55.040 --> 1:01:02.800
 Yeah. So first of all, I'm thinking of writing a book called Geometric Unity for Idiots.

1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:06.480
 And I need you as a consultant. So can we...

1:01:06.480 --> 1:01:09.200
 First of all, I hope I have the trademark on geometric unit.

1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:10.320
 You do. Good.

1:01:10.320 --> 1:01:20.320
 Can you give a basic introduction of the goals of geometric unity, the basic tools of mathematics

1:01:20.320 --> 1:01:26.080
 use the viewpoints in general for idiots like me? Okay. Great. Fun.

1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:28.720
 So what's the goal of geometric unity?

1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:33.680
 The goal of geometric unity is to start with something so completely bland

1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:41.280
 that you can simply say, well, that's something that begins the game is as close to a mathematical

1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:45.120
 nothing as possible. In other words, I can't answer the question, why is there something

1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:48.480
 rather than nothing? But if there has to be a something that we begin from,

1:01:48.480 --> 1:01:52.080
 let it begin from something that's like a blank canvas.

1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:58.000
 That's even more basic. So what is something? What are we trying to describe here?

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:04.640
 Okay. Right now, we have a model of our world and it's got two sectors.

1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:09.680
 One of the sectors is called general relativity. The other is called the standard model.

1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:15.840
 So we'll call it GR for general relativity and SM for standard model.

1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:17.120
 What's the difference between the two?

1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:24.240
 What are the two described? So general relativity gives pride of place to gravity

1:02:25.280 --> 1:02:30.640
 and everything else is acting as a sort of a backup singer.

1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:34.000
 Gravity is the star of the show. Gravity is the star of general relativity.

1:02:35.040 --> 1:02:42.000
 And in the standard model, the other three non gravitational forces. So if there are four

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:47.360
 forces that we know about three of the four non gravitational, that's where they get to shine.

1:02:48.160 --> 1:02:52.320
 Great. So tiny little particles and how they interact with each other.

1:02:52.320 --> 1:02:58.800
 So photons, gluons and so called intermediate vector bosons. Those are the things that the

1:02:58.800 --> 1:03:04.720
 standard model showcases and general relativity showcases gravity. And then you have matter

1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:11.120
 which is accommodated in both theories, but much more beautifully inside of the standard model.

1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:14.800
 So what does a theory of everything do?

1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:20.320
 So first of all, I think that that's the first place where we haven't talked enough.

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:25.600
 We assume that we know what it means, but we don't actually have any idea what it means.

1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:32.560
 And what I claim it is, is that it's a theory where the questions beyond that theory are no

1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:44.480
 longer of a mathematical nature. In other words, if I say, let us take X to be a four dimensional

1:03:44.480 --> 1:03:50.800
 manifold. To a mathematician or a physicist, I've said very little. I've simply said,

1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:56.320
 there's some place for calculus and linear algebra to dance together and to play.

1:03:56.320 --> 1:04:02.640
 And that's what manifolds are. They're the most natural place where our two greatest math theories

1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:10.400
 can really intertwine. Which are the two? Oh, you mean the calculus and linear algebra.

1:04:12.080 --> 1:04:17.520
 Okay. Now the question is beyond that. So it's sort of like saying, I'm an artist and I want to

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:28.880
 order a canvas. Now the question is, does the canvas paint itself? Does the canvas come up with an

1:04:28.880 --> 1:04:38.640
 artist and paint an ink, which then paint the canvas? Like that's the hard part about theories

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:43.200
 of everything, which I don't think people talk enough about. So can we just, you bring up that

1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:48.480
 Escher and the hand that draws itself? The fire that lights itself or drawing hands?

1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:55.440
 The drawing hands. Yeah. And every time I start to think about that, my mind like shuts down.

1:04:55.440 --> 1:05:00.800
 No, don't do that. There's a spark. No, but this is the most beautiful part. We should do this

1:05:00.800 --> 1:05:10.320
 together. No, it's beautiful, but this robot's brain sparks fly. So can we try to say the same

1:05:10.320 --> 1:05:16.560
 thing over and over in different ways about what you mean by that having to be a thing we have to

1:05:16.560 --> 1:05:24.080
 contend with? Sure. Like why do you think that creating a theory of everything, as you call the

1:05:24.080 --> 1:05:30.880
 source code, our understanding our source code, require a view like the hand that draws itself?

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:36.560
 Okay. Well, here's what goes on in the regular physics picture. We've got these two main theories,

1:05:36.560 --> 1:05:44.960
 general relativity and the standard model, right? Think of general relativity as more or less the

1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:52.640
 theory of the canvas. Okay. And maybe you, you have the canvas in a particularly rigid shape.

1:05:52.640 --> 1:05:57.040
 Maybe you've measured it. So it's got length and it's got angle, but more or less, it's just canvas

1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:03.680
 and length and angle. And that's all that really general relativity is, but it allows the canvas

1:06:03.680 --> 1:06:13.600
 to warp a bit. Then we have the second thing, which is this import of foreign libraries where,

1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:22.640
 which aren't tied to space and time. So we've got this crazy set of symmetries called SU3 cross SU2

1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:28.800
 cross U1. We've got this collection of 16 particles in a generation, which are these sort of twisted

1:06:28.800 --> 1:06:35.200
 spinners. And we've got three copies of them. Then we've got this weird Higgs field that comes in

1:06:35.200 --> 1:06:40.800
 and like Deus Ex Machina solves all the problems that have been created in the play that can't be

1:06:40.800 --> 1:06:45.840
 resolved otherwise. So that's the standard model, quantum field theory just plopped on top of this.

1:06:45.840 --> 1:06:51.440
 It's a problem of the double origin story. One origin story is about space and time.

1:06:51.440 --> 1:06:57.200
 The other origin story is about what we would call internal quantum numbers and internal symmetries.

1:06:57.200 --> 1:07:03.600
 And then there was an attempt to get one to follow from the other called Kaluza Klein theory,

1:07:03.600 --> 1:07:13.840
 which didn't work out. And this is sort of in that vein. So you said origin story. So in the

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:21.120
 hand that draws itself, what is it? So it's as if you had the canvas and then you ordered up,

1:07:21.120 --> 1:07:26.800
 also give me paint brushes, paints, pigments, pencils and artists. But you're saying that's

1:07:26.800 --> 1:07:32.560
 like, if you want to create a universe from scratch, the canvas should be generating the paint

1:07:32.560 --> 1:07:36.880
 brushes and the paint brushes in the canvas. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Like you should who's the

1:07:36.880 --> 1:07:41.600
 artist in this analogy? Well, this is sorry, then we're going to get into a religious thing. And

1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:47.840
 I don't want to do that. Okay. Well, you know my shtick, which is that we are the AI. We have

1:07:47.840 --> 1:07:53.280
 two great stories about the simulation and artificial general intelligence. In one story,

1:07:54.400 --> 1:08:00.640
 man fears that some program we've given birth to will become self aware, smarter than us,

1:08:00.640 --> 1:08:08.160
 and we'll take over. In another story, there are genius simulators and we live in their simulation.

1:08:09.120 --> 1:08:14.160
 And we haven't realized that those two stories are the same story. In one case,

1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:23.360
 we are the simulator. In another case, we are the simulated. And if you buy those and you put them

1:08:23.360 --> 1:08:28.960
 together, we are the AGI and whether or not we have simulators, we may be trying to wake up by

1:08:28.960 --> 1:08:32.800
 learning our own source code. So this could be our Skynet moment, which is one of the reasons I

1:08:32.800 --> 1:08:37.760
 have some issues around it. I think we'll talk about that because I... Well, that's the issue

1:08:37.760 --> 1:08:44.080
 of the emergent artist within the story just to get back to the point. Okay. So now the key point is

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:49.680
 the standard way we tell the story is that Einstein sets the canvas and then we order all the stuff

1:08:49.680 --> 1:08:57.840
 that we want. And then that paints the picture that is our universe. So you order the paint,

1:08:57.840 --> 1:09:06.000
 you order the artist, you order the brushes, and that then when you collide the two,

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:11.520
 gives you two separate origin stories. The canvas came from one place and everything else came from

1:09:11.520 --> 1:09:21.200
 somewhere else. So what are the mathematical tools required to construct consistent geometric theory?

1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:30.880
 You know, make this concrete? Well, somehow you need to get three copies, for example,

1:09:30.880 --> 1:09:39.120
 of generations with 16 particles each. Right? And so the question would be like, well,

1:09:39.920 --> 1:09:45.440
 there's a lot of special personality in those symmetries. Where would they come from?

1:09:46.880 --> 1:09:51.760
 So for example, you've got what would be called grand unified theories that sound like

1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:58.240
 SU5, the George I. Glashow theory, there's something that should be called spin 10,

1:09:58.240 --> 1:10:04.400
 but physicists insist on calling it SO10. There's something called the petit salon theory that

1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:10.160
 tends to be called SU4 cross SU2 cross SU2, which should be called spin six cross spin four.

1:10:10.160 --> 1:10:13.840
 I can get into all of these. What are they all accomplishing?

1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:21.200
 They're all taking the known forces that we see and packaging them up to say we can't get rid of

1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:27.440
 the second origin story, but we can at least make that origin story more unified. So they're trying

1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:30.880
 grand unification is the attempt. And that's a mistake in your in you.

1:10:30.880 --> 1:10:37.360
 It's not a mistake. The problem is, is it was born lifeless. When George I. Glashow first came out

1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:44.080
 with the SU5 theory, it was very exciting because it could be tested in a South Dakota

1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:48.880
 mine filled up with like, I don't know, cleaning fluid or something like that.

1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:54.160
 And they looked for proton decay and didn't see it. And then they gave up, because in that day,

1:10:54.160 --> 1:11:00.480
 when your experiment didn't work, you gave up on the theory. It didn't come to us born of a fusion

1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:08.320
 between Einstein and, and, and Boer, you know, and that was kind of the problem is it had this

1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:12.640
 weird parenting where it was just on the Boer side. There was no Einsteinian contribution.

1:11:15.840 --> 1:11:21.360
 Lex, how can I help you most? I'm trying to figure out what questions you want to ask

1:11:21.360 --> 1:11:25.920
 so that you get the most satisfying answers. There's, there's a, there's a bunch,

1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:30.240
 there's a bunch of questions I want to ask. I mean, one, and I'm trying to sneak up on you

1:11:31.280 --> 1:11:39.120
 somehow to reveal in a accessible way than the nature of our universe.

1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:44.800
 So I can just give you a guess, right? Like I, we have to be very careful that we're not claiming

1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:51.840
 that this has been accepted. This is a speculation, but I will, I will make the speculation that what

1:11:51.840 --> 1:11:56.160
 I think what you would want to ask me is how can the canvas generate all the stuff that usually

1:11:56.160 --> 1:12:00.240
 has to be ordered separately? All right, should we do that? Let's go there. Okay.

1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:07.520
 So the first thing is, is that you have a concept in computers called technical debt.

1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:12.240
 You're coding and you cut corners and you know, you're going to have to do it right

1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:20.960
 before the thing is safe for the world, but you're piling up some series of IOUs to yourself and your

1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:28.720
 project as you're going along. So the first thing is we can't figure out if you have only four degrees

1:12:28.720 --> 1:12:35.280
 of freedom and that's what your canvas is. How do you get at least Einstein's world? Einstein says,

1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:39.840
 look, it's not just four degrees of freedom, but there need to be rulers and protractors to measure

1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:47.120
 length and angle in the world. You can't just have a flabby four degrees of freedom. So the first

1:12:47.120 --> 1:12:52.000
 thing you do is you create 10 extra variables, which is like, if we can't choose any particular

1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:58.720
 set of rulers and protractors to measure length and angle, let's take the set of all possible

1:12:58.720 --> 1:13:04.320
 rulers and protractors and that would be called symmetric, non degenerate two tensors on the

1:13:04.320 --> 1:13:10.880
 tangent space of the four manifold X4. Now, because there are four degrees of freedom,

1:13:10.880 --> 1:13:17.040
 you start off with four dimensions, then you need four rulers for each of those different

1:13:17.040 --> 1:13:21.920
 directions. So that's four, that gets us up to eight variables. And then between four original

1:13:21.920 --> 1:13:28.240
 variables, there are six possible angles. So four plus four plus six is equal to 14.

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:34.560
 So now you've replaced X4 with another space, which in the lecture, I think I called you 14,

1:13:34.560 --> 1:13:38.080
 but I'm now calling Y 14. This is one of the big problems of working on something

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:42.000
 in private is every time you pull it out, you sort of can't remember it, you name something

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:47.200
 something new. Okay, so you've got a 14 dimensional world, which is the original four dimensional

1:13:47.200 --> 1:13:54.880
 world, plus a lot of extra gadgetry for measurement. And because you're not in the four dimensional

1:13:54.880 --> 1:13:58.800
 world, you don't have the technical debt. No, now you've got a lot of technical debt, because now

1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:03.360
 you have to explain the way a 14 dimensional world, which is a big, you're taking a huge

1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:10.480
 advance on your payday check, right? But aren't more dimensions allow you more freedom? Maybe

1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:14.640
 you have to get rid of them somehow because we don't perceive them. So eventually you have to

1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:20.880
 collapse it down to the thing that we perceive. Or you have to sample a four dimensional filament

1:14:20.880 --> 1:14:27.760
 within that 14 dimensional world known as a section of a bundle. Okay, so how do we get from

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:33.760
 the four 14 dimensional world where I imagine a lot of, wait, wait, wait, yep. You're cheating. The

1:14:33.760 --> 1:14:39.680
 first question was, how do we get something from almost nothing? Like how do we get the

1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:46.560
 if I've said that the who and the what in the newspaper story that is a theory of everything

1:14:46.560 --> 1:14:53.200
 are bosons and fermions. So let's make the who the fermions and the what the bosons think of

1:14:53.200 --> 1:14:58.560
 as the players and the equipment for a game. Are we supposed to be thinking of actual physical

1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:05.520
 things with mass or energy? Yep. Okay. So think about everything you see in this room. So from

1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:11.600
 chemistry, you know, it's all protons, neutrons and electrons, but from a little bit of late 1960s

1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:17.520
 physics, we know that the protons and neutrons are all made of upcorks and downcorks. So everything

1:15:17.520 --> 1:15:23.200
 in this room is basically upcorks, downcorks and electrons stuck together with, with the,

1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:31.680
 the what the equipment. Okay. Now, the way we see it currently is we see that there are

1:15:31.680 --> 1:15:38.480
 space time indices, which we would call spinners that correspond to the who that is the fermions,

1:15:38.480 --> 1:15:44.320
 the matter, the stuff, the upcorks, the downcorks, the electrons. And there are also

1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:52.000
 16 degrees of freedom that come from this in this space of internal quantum numbers.

1:15:53.280 --> 1:16:02.000
 So in my theory, in 14 dimensions, there's no internal quantum number space that figures in.

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:10.080
 It's all just spinorial. So spinners in 14 dimensions without any

1:16:11.840 --> 1:16:19.920
 festooning with extra linear algebraic information. There's a concept of a, of, of spinners,

1:16:20.880 --> 1:16:28.560
 which is natural if you have a manifold with length and angle and why 14 is almost a manifold

1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:37.120
 with length and angle. It's, it's so close. It's in other words, because you're looking at the

1:16:37.120 --> 1:16:42.320
 space of all rulers and protractors, maybe it's not that surprising that a space of rulers and

1:16:42.320 --> 1:16:47.360
 protractors might come very close to having rulers and protractors on it itself. Like,

1:16:47.360 --> 1:16:53.280
 can you measure the space of measurements? And you almost can. And in a space that has length and

1:16:53.280 --> 1:16:58.960
 angle, if it doesn't have a topological obstruction comes with these objects called spinners.

1:17:00.240 --> 1:17:08.320
 Now, spinners are the stuff of, of our world. We are made of spinners. They are the most important,

1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:12.560
 really deep object that I can tell you about. They were very surprising. What is a spinner?

1:17:13.360 --> 1:17:20.880
 So famously, there are these weird things that require 720 degrees of rotation

1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:28.320
 in order to come back to normal. And that doesn't make sense. And the reason for this is that there's

1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:35.360
 a knottedness in our three dimensional world that people don't observe. And you know, you can famously

1:17:35.360 --> 1:17:41.600
 see it by this Dirac string trick. So if you take a glass of water, imagine that this was a tumbler

1:17:41.600 --> 1:17:48.000
 and I didn't want to spill any of it. And the question is, if I rotate the cup without losing

1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:56.320
 my grip on the base 360 degrees, and I can't go backwards, is there any way I can take a sip?

1:17:56.320 --> 1:18:06.000
 And the answer is this weird motion, which is go over first and under second, and that's 720

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.800
 degrees of rotation to come back to normal so that I can take a sip. Well, that weird principle,

1:18:10.800 --> 1:18:15.600
 which sometimes is known as the Philippine wine glass dance, because waitresses in the Philippines

1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:25.760
 apparently learned how to do this. That move defines, if you will, this hidden space that

1:18:25.760 --> 1:18:32.080
 nobody knew was there of spinners, which Dirac figured out when he took the square root of

1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:40.240
 something called the Klein Gorton equation, which I think had earlier work incorporated from

1:18:40.240 --> 1:18:45.600
 Cartan and Killing & Company in mathematics. So spinners are one of the most profound aspects of

1:18:45.600 --> 1:18:50.480
 human existence. I mean, forgive me for the perhaps dumb questions, but would a spinner

1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:58.960
 be the mathematical objects that's the basic unit of our universe? When you start with a manifold,

1:19:01.440 --> 1:19:06.400
 which is just like something like a donut or a sphere or a circle or a mobius band,

1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:12.880
 a spinner is usually the first wildly surprising thing that you found was hidden in your original

1:19:12.880 --> 1:19:21.280
 purchase. So you order a manifold and you didn't even realize, it's like buying a house and finding

1:19:21.280 --> 1:19:26.720
 a panic room inside that you hadn't counted on. It's very surprising when you understand that

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:32.800
 spinners are running around in your spaces. Again, perhaps a dumb question, but we're talking

1:19:32.800 --> 1:19:39.120
 about 14 dimensions and four dimensions. What is the manifold we're operating under?

1:19:39.120 --> 1:19:47.200
 So in my case, it's proto spacetime. It's before Einstein can slap rulers and protractors on

1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:52.960
 spacetime. What do you mean by that? Sorry to interrupt. Space time is the 4D manifold.

1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:58.000
 Space time is a four dimensional manifold with extra structure.

1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:05.040
 What's the extra structure? It's called a semi Ramanian or pseudo Ramanian metric.

1:20:05.920 --> 1:20:12.160
 In essence, there is something akin to a four by four symmetric matrix,

1:20:12.880 --> 1:20:17.360
 which is equivalent to length and angle. So when I talk about rulers and protractors,

1:20:17.360 --> 1:20:23.280
 or I talk about length and angle, or I talk about Ramanian or pseudo Ramanian or semi Ramanian

1:20:23.280 --> 1:20:28.400
 manifolds, I'm usually talking about the same thing. Can you measure how long something is

1:20:28.400 --> 1:20:36.000
 and what the angle is between two different rays or vectors? So that's what Einstein gave us as

1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:45.920
 his arena, his place to play, his canvas. There's a bunch of questions I can ask here,

1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:54.240
 but like I said, I'm working on this book, Geometric Unity for Idiots. And I think what

1:20:54.240 --> 1:21:03.840
 would be really nice as your editor to have like beautiful, maybe even visualizations

1:21:04.880 --> 1:21:09.920
 that people could try to play with, try to try to reveal small little beauties about the way

1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:13.680
 you're thinking about this world. Well, I usually use the Joe Rogan program for that.

1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:18.240
 Sometimes I have him doing the Philippine wine glass dance. I had the hop vibration.

1:21:18.880 --> 1:21:25.200
 The part of the problem is that most people don't know this language about spinners, bundles,

1:21:25.200 --> 1:21:31.360
 metrics, gauge fields. And they're very curious about the theory of everything,

1:21:31.360 --> 1:21:34.720
 but they have no understanding of even what we know about our own world.

1:21:34.720 --> 1:21:38.560
 Is it a hopeless pursuit? No.

1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:44.640
 Like even gauge theory, just this, I mean, it seems to be very inaccessible. Is there some

1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:48.400
 aspect of it that could be made accessible? I mean, I could go to the board right there

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:52.240
 and give you a five minute lecture on gauge theory that would be better than

1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:57.280
 the official lecture on gauge theory. You would know what gauge theory was.

1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:02.800
 So it is possible to make it accessible. Yeah. But nobody does, like in other words,

1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:08.320
 you're going to watch over the next year lots of different discussions about quantum entanglement

1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:12.160
 or the multiverse. Where are we now? Right.

1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:15.840
 Or many worlds, are they all equally real? Yeah.

1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:21.360
 Right? I mean, yeah. But you're not going to hear anything about the hop

1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:26.640
 vibration except if it's from me and I hate that. Why can't you be the one?

1:22:26.640 --> 1:22:30.400
 Well, because I'm going a different path. I think that we've made a huge mistake,

1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:33.920
 which is we have things we can show people about the actual models.

1:22:33.920 --> 1:22:38.000
 We can push out visualizations where they, they're not listening by analogy.

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:42.080
 They're watching the same thing that we're seeing. And as I've said to you before,

1:22:42.080 --> 1:22:47.760
 this is like choosing to perform sheet music that hasn't been performed in a long time or,

1:22:47.760 --> 1:22:52.000
 you know, the experts can't afford orchestras. So they just trade Beethoven symphonies and

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:56.960
 has sheet music and they go, Oh, wow, that was beautiful. But it's like nobody heard anything.

1:22:57.680 --> 1:23:02.080
 They just looked at the score. Well, that's how mathematicians and physicists trade papers

1:23:02.080 --> 1:23:06.800
 and ideas is that they, they write down the things that represent stuff.

1:23:08.080 --> 1:23:12.160
 I want to at least close out the thought line that you started.

1:23:12.160 --> 1:23:12.800
 Yes.

1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:19.440
 Which is how does the canvas order all of this other stuff into being?

1:23:19.440 --> 1:23:25.520
 So I at least want to say some incomprehensible things about that and then we'll have that much

1:23:25.520 --> 1:23:32.160
 done. All right. And that just point, does it have to be incomprehensible?

1:23:32.720 --> 1:23:34.720
 Do you know what the Schrodinger equation is?

1:23:34.720 --> 1:23:35.440
 Yes.

1:23:35.440 --> 1:23:37.120
 Do you know what the Dirac equation is?

1:23:38.560 --> 1:23:39.920
 What does no mean?

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:44.400
 Well, my point is you're going to have some feeling that you know what the Schrodinger equation is.

1:23:45.040 --> 1:23:50.000
 As soon as we get to the Dirac equation, your eyes are going to get a little bit glazed, right?

1:23:50.000 --> 1:24:00.160
 Right. So now why is that? Well, the answer to me is that you, you want to ask me about the theory

1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:07.440
 of everything, but you haven't even digested the theory of everything as we've had it since 1928

1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:15.840
 when Dirac came out with his equation. So for whatever reason, and this isn't a hit on you.

1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:21.360
 Yeah. You haven't been motivated enough in all the time that you've been on earth

1:24:22.080 --> 1:24:26.080
 to at least get as far as the Dirac equation. And this was very interesting to me after I gave

1:24:26.080 --> 1:24:32.880
 the talk in Oxford. New scientist who had done kind of a hatchet job on me to begin with sent a

1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:38.320
 reporter to come to the third version of the talk that I gave. And that person had never heard of

1:24:38.320 --> 1:24:46.960
 the Dirac equation. So you have a person who is completely professionally not qualified to ask

1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:54.080
 these questions wanting to know, well, how does, how does your theory solve new problems? And like,

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:57.840
 well, in the case of the Dirac equation, well, tell me about that. I don't know what that is.

1:24:57.840 --> 1:25:04.880
 So then the point is, okay, I got it. You're not even caught up minimally to where we are now.

1:25:04.880 --> 1:25:12.000
 And that's not a knock on you. Almost nobody is. But then how does it become my job to digest

1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:20.480
 what has been available for like over 90 years? Well, to me, the open question is whether what's

1:25:20.480 --> 1:25:29.760
 been available for over 90 years can be, there could be a blueprint of a journey that one takes

1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:35.200
 to understand it. Oh, I want to do that with you. And I, one of the things I think I've been

1:25:35.200 --> 1:25:40.960
 relatively successful at, for example, you know, when you ask other people what gauge theory is,

1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:46.880
 you get these very confusing responses. And my response is much simpler. It's, oh, it's a theory

1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:53.680
 of differentiation, where when you calculate the instantaneous rise over run, you measure the rise

1:25:53.680 --> 1:26:00.080
 not from a flat horizontal, but from a custom endogenous reference level. What do you mean by that?

1:26:00.080 --> 1:26:05.200
 It's like, okay, and then I do this thing with Mount Everest, which is Mount Everest is how high?

1:26:05.200 --> 1:26:08.320
 Then they give the height, I say above what? Then they say sea level. And I say,

1:26:08.960 --> 1:26:12.800
 which sea is that in Nepal? Like, oh, I guess there isn't a sea because it's landlocked. It's

1:26:12.800 --> 1:26:16.880
 like, okay, well, what do you mean by sea level? Oh, there's this thing called the geoid I'd never

1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:21.520
 heard of. Oh, that's the reference level. That's a custom reference level that we imported.

1:26:21.520 --> 1:26:29.280
 So you, all sorts of people have remembered the exact height of Mount Everest without ever knowing

1:26:29.280 --> 1:26:35.600
 what it's a height from. Well, in this case, in gauge theory, there's a hidden reference level

1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:41.760
 where you measure the rise in rise over run to give the slope on the line. What if you have

1:26:41.760 --> 1:26:48.720
 different concepts of what, of where that rise should be measured from that vary within the

1:26:48.720 --> 1:26:55.120
 theory that are endogenous to the theory. That's what gauge theory is. Okay, we have a video here,

1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:03.200
 right? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to use my phone. If I want to measure my hand and its slope,

1:27:03.840 --> 1:27:09.280
 this is my attempt to measure it using standard calculus. In other words, the reference level

1:27:09.280 --> 1:27:16.000
 is apparently flat. And I measure the rise above that phone using my hand. Okay. If I want to use

1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:21.360
 gauge theory, it means I can do this, or I can do that, or I can do this, or I can do this,

1:27:21.360 --> 1:27:26.560
 or I could do what I did from the beginning. Okay. At some level, that's what gauge theory is.

1:27:27.120 --> 1:27:32.720
 Now that is an act. No, I've never heard anyone describe it that way. So while the community

1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:36.480
 may say, well, who is this guy and why does he have the right to talk in public? I'm waiting

1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:41.520
 for somebody to jump out of the woodwork and say, you know, Eric's whole shtick about rulers and

1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:47.120
 protractors, uh, leading to a derivative. Derivatives are measured as rise of a run above

1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:50.480
 reference level. The reference levels don't fit together. Like I go through this whole shtick

1:27:50.480 --> 1:27:55.760
 in order to make it accessible. I've never heard anyone say it. I'm trying to make,

1:27:55.760 --> 1:28:00.880
 Prometheus would like to discuss fire with everybody else. All right. I'm going to just

1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:05.360
 say one thing to close out the earlier line, which is what I think we should have continued with.

1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:12.240
 When you take the naturally occurring spinners, the unadorned spinners, the naked spinners,

1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:19.120
 not on, on this 14 dimensional manifold, but on something very closely tied to it,

1:28:19.120 --> 1:28:25.840
 which I've called the chimeric tangent bundle. That is the, the object which stands in for

1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:31.840
 the thing that should have had length and angle on it, but just missed. Okay. When you take that

1:28:31.840 --> 1:28:36.320
 object and you form spinners on that and you don't adorn them, so you're still in the single origin

1:28:36.320 --> 1:28:45.440
 story, you get very large spinorial objects upstairs on this 14 dimensional world, Y 14,

1:28:45.440 --> 1:28:53.440
 which is part of the observers. When you pull that information back from Y 14 down to X four,

1:28:53.440 --> 1:29:05.200
 it miraculously looks like the adorned spinners, the festoon spinners, the spinners that we play

1:29:05.200 --> 1:29:11.680
 with in ordinary reality. In other words, the 14 dimensional world looks like a four dimensional

1:29:11.680 --> 1:29:18.960
 world plus a 10 dimensional compliment. So 10 plus four equals 14. That 10 dimensional compliment,

1:29:18.960 --> 1:29:25.360
 which is called a normal bundle, generates spin properties, internal quantum numbers that look

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:31.280
 like the things that give our particles, our particles personality that make, let's say,

1:29:31.280 --> 1:29:38.240
 up quarks and down quarks charged by negative one third or plus two thirds, that kind of stuff,

1:29:38.240 --> 1:29:45.360
 or whether or not some quarks feel the weak force and other quarks do not.

1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:53.360
 So the X four generates Y 14, Y 14 generates something called the chimeric tangent bundle.

1:29:53.360 --> 1:29:58.400
 Chimeric tangent bundle generates unadorned spinners. The unadorned spinners get pulled back

1:29:58.400 --> 1:30:05.200
 from 14 down to four, where they look like adorned spinners. And we have the right number of them.

1:30:05.200 --> 1:30:10.320
 You thought you needed three, you only got two, but then something else that you'd never seen

1:30:10.320 --> 1:30:16.000
 before broke apart on this journey. And it broke into another copy of the thing that you already

1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:21.920
 have two copies of one piece of that thing broke off. So now you have two generations plus an

1:30:21.920 --> 1:30:27.440
 imposter third generation, which is, I don't know why we never talk about this possibility

1:30:27.440 --> 1:30:32.000
 in regular physics. And then you got a bunch of stuff that we haven't seen, which has descriptions.

1:30:32.000 --> 1:30:35.360
 So people always say, does it make any falsifiable predictions? Yes, it does.

1:30:35.360 --> 1:30:43.440
 It says that the matter that you should be seeing next has particular properties that can be read

1:30:43.440 --> 1:30:52.000
 off like weak isospin, weak hypercharge, like the responsiveness to the strong force. The one

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:59.600
 I can't tell you is what energy scale it would happen at. So you can't say if those characteristics

1:30:59.600 --> 1:31:04.080
 can be detected with the current. But it may be that somebody else can. I'm not a physicist.

1:31:04.080 --> 1:31:08.880
 I'm not a quantum field theorist. I can't. I don't know how you would do that.

1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:16.640
 The hope for me is that there's some simple explanations for all of it.

1:31:16.640 --> 1:31:17.840
 Lex, should we have a drink?

1:31:19.120 --> 1:31:21.920
 You're having fun. No, I'm trying to have fun with you.

1:31:21.920 --> 1:31:28.000
 Yeah. There's a bunch of fun things to talk about here.

1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:36.640
 Anyway, that was how I got what I thought you wanted, which is if you think about the fermions

1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:45.200
 as the artists and the bosons as the brushes and the paint, what I told you is that's how we get

1:31:45.200 --> 1:31:52.400
 the artists. What are the open questions for you in this? Where are the challenges? So you're not

1:31:52.400 --> 1:31:59.280
 done. Well, there's things that I would like to have in better order. So a lot of people will say,

1:32:01.280 --> 1:32:04.800
 the reason I hesitate on this is I just have a totally different view than the community.

1:32:04.800 --> 1:32:12.640
 So for example, I believe that general relativity began in 1913 with Einstein and Grossman.

1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:21.040
 Now, that was the first of like four major papers in this line of thinking. To most physicists,

1:32:21.040 --> 1:32:31.680
 this general relativity happened when Einstein produced a divergence free gradient,

1:32:31.680 --> 1:32:36.480
 which turned out to be the gradient of the so called Hilbert or Einstein Hilbert action.

1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:42.000
 And from my perspective, that wasn't true. This is that it began when Einstein said,

1:32:42.000 --> 1:32:48.480
 look, this is about differential geometry. And the final answer is going to look like

1:32:48.480 --> 1:32:55.040
 like a curvature tensor on one side and matter and energy on the other side. And that was enough.

1:32:55.040 --> 1:33:00.480
 And then he published a wrong version of it, where it was the Ricci tensor, not the Einstein tensor,

1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:05.760
 then he corrected the Ricci tensor to make it into the Einstein tensor, then he corrected that to add

1:33:05.760 --> 1:33:13.040
 a cosmological constant. I can't stand that the community thinks in those terms. There's some

1:33:13.040 --> 1:33:18.560
 things about which like there's a question about which contraction do I use? There's an Einstein

1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:24.160
 contraction, there's a Ricci contraction, they both go between the same spaces. I'm not sure

1:33:24.160 --> 1:33:30.240
 what I should do. I'm not sure which contraction I should choose. This is called a Shia operator for

1:33:30.240 --> 1:33:40.560
 ship in a bottle and my stuff. You have this big platform in many ways that inspires people's

1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:47.120
 curiosity about physics and mathematics. Right. Now, and I'm one of those people.

1:33:47.840 --> 1:33:52.960
 Well, great. But then you start using a lot of words that I don't understand.

1:33:54.640 --> 1:34:02.160
 And I might know them, but I don't understand. And what's unclear to me if I'm supposed to

1:34:02.160 --> 1:34:08.800
 be listening to those words, or if it's just if this is one of those technical things that's

1:34:08.800 --> 1:34:14.480
 intended for a very small community, or if I'm supposed to actually take those words and start,

1:34:15.360 --> 1:34:21.760
 you know, a multi year study, not not a serious study, but the kind of study when you

1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:26.480
 you're interested in learning about machine learning, for example, or any kind of discipline.

1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:33.680
 That's where I'm a little bit confused. So you you speak beautifully about ideas. You often reveal

1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:41.280
 the beauty in mathematics and geometry. And I'm unclear on what are the steps I should be taking.

1:34:43.120 --> 1:34:47.920
 I'm curious, how can I explore? How can I play with something? How can I play with these ideas?

1:34:48.960 --> 1:34:53.840
 And enjoy the beauty of not necessarily understanding the depth of the theory that you're

1:34:53.840 --> 1:35:00.560
 presenting, but start to share in the beauty, as opposed to sharing and enjoying the beauty of

1:35:00.560 --> 1:35:08.800
 just the way the passion with which you speak, which is in itself fun to listen to, but also

1:35:09.440 --> 1:35:17.360
 starting to be able to understand some aspects of this theory that I can enjoy it to and start

1:35:17.360 --> 1:35:21.440
 to build an intuition, what the heck we're even talking about, because you're basically saying

1:35:21.440 --> 1:35:32.800
 we need to throw a lot of our ideas of views of the universe out. And I'm trying to find accessible

1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:38.560
 ways and along not in this conversation. No, I appreciate that. So one of the things that

1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:45.520
 I've done is I've I've picked on one paragraph from Edward Whitten. And I said, this is the

1:35:45.520 --> 1:35:50.080
 paragraph. If I could only take one paragraph with me, this is the one I'd take. And it's

1:35:50.080 --> 1:35:55.360
 almost all in prose, not in equations. And he says, look, this is this is our knowledge of the

1:35:55.360 --> 1:36:01.440
 universe at its deepest level. And he was writing this during the 1980s. And he has three separate

1:36:01.440 --> 1:36:06.960
 points that constitute our deepest knowledge. And those three points refer to equations,

1:36:07.600 --> 1:36:12.240
 one to the Einstein field equation, one to the Dirac equation, and one to the Yang Mills Maxwell

1:36:12.240 --> 1:36:21.440
 equation. Now, one thing I would do is take a look at that paragraph and say, okay, what do these

1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:25.840
 three lines mean? Like it's a finite amount of verbiage, you can write down every word that you

1:36:25.840 --> 1:36:35.680
 don't know. And you can say, what do I think? Done. Now, young man, yes, there's a beautiful wall

1:36:35.680 --> 1:36:42.240
 in Stony Brook, New York, built by someone who I know you will interview named Jim Simons.

1:36:44.160 --> 1:36:49.200
 And Jim Simons, he's not the artist, but he's the guy who funded it. World's greatest hedge fund

1:36:49.200 --> 1:36:57.200
 manager. And on that wall contain the three equations that Whitten refers to in that paragraph.

1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:04.080
 And so that is the transmission from the paragraph or graph to the wall. Now that wall

1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:10.720
 needs an owner's manual, which Roger Penrose has written called the road to reality. Let's call

1:37:10.720 --> 1:37:18.480
 that the tome. So this is the subject of the so called graph wall tome project that is going on

1:37:18.480 --> 1:37:24.720
 in our Discord server and our general group around the portal community, which is how do you take

1:37:24.720 --> 1:37:31.440
 something that purports in one paragraph to say what the deepest understanding man has of the

1:37:31.440 --> 1:37:38.960
 universe in which he lives. It's memorialized on a wall, which nobody knows about, which is an

1:37:38.960 --> 1:37:46.880
 incredibly gorgeous piece of art. And that was written up in a book, which has been written

1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:52.480
 for no man, right? Maybe it's for a woman, I don't know. But no one should be able to read

1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:57.200
 this book because either you're a professional, and you know a lot of this book, in which case

1:37:57.200 --> 1:38:01.920
 it's kind of a refresher to see how Roger thinks about these things. Or you don't even know that

1:38:01.920 --> 1:38:08.480
 this book is a self contained invitation to understanding our deepest nature. So I would

1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:14.080
 say find yourself in the graph wall tome transmission sequence and join the graph wall

1:38:14.080 --> 1:38:20.320
 tome project if that's of interest. Okay, beautiful. Now just to linger on a little longer,

1:38:20.320 --> 1:38:25.680
 what kind of journey do you see geometric unity taking? I don't know. I mean, that's the thing

1:38:25.680 --> 1:38:29.920
 is that first of all, the professional community has to get very angry and outraged, and they have

1:38:29.920 --> 1:38:35.120
 to work through their feeling that this is nonsense, this is bullshit, or like, no, wait a minute,

1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:38.960
 this is really cool. Actually, I need some clarification over here. So there's going to be

1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:46.640
 some sort of weird coming back together process. Are you already hearing murmurings of that?

1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:53.440
 That's very funny. Officially, I've seen very little. So it's perhaps happening quietly. Yeah.

1:38:53.440 --> 1:38:58.720
 Yeah. You often talk about we need to get off this planet. Yep.

1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:06.160
 Can I try to sneak up on that by asking, what in your kind of view is the difference,

1:39:06.160 --> 1:39:12.720
 the gap between the science of it, the theory, and the actual engineering of building something

1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:18.240
 that leverages the theory to do something? Like how big is that? We don't know. Gap. I mean,

1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:23.920
 if you have 10 extra dimensions to play with that are the rulers and protractors of the world

1:39:23.920 --> 1:39:32.080
 themselves, can you gain access to those dimensions? Do you have a hunch? So I don't know. I don't want

1:39:32.080 --> 1:39:37.360
 to get ahead of myself because you have to appreciate I can have hunches and I can, I can draw off.

1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:46.240
 But one of the ways that I'm succeeding in this world is to not bow down to my professional

1:39:46.240 --> 1:39:51.200
 communities nor to ignore them. Like I'm actually interested in the criticism. I just want to

1:39:51.200 --> 1:39:59.840
 denature it so that it's not mostly interpersonal and irrelevant. I believe that they don't want

1:39:59.840 --> 1:40:05.360
 me to speculate and I don't need to speculate about this. I can simply say I'm open to the

1:40:05.360 --> 1:40:10.240
 idea that it may have engineering prospects and it may be a death sentence. We may find out that

1:40:10.240 --> 1:40:16.480
 there's not enough new here that even if it were right that there would be nothing new to do. I can't

1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:21.520
 tell you. That's what you mean by death sentences. There would not be exciting breakthroughs that

1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:26.480
 follow on. Wouldn't it be terrible if you couldn't, like you can do new things in an Einsteinian world

1:40:26.480 --> 1:40:31.280
 that you couldn't do in a Newtonian world. You know, like you have twin paradoxes or

1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:36.400
 Lorentz contraction of length or any one of a number of new cool things happen in relativity

1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:42.240
 theory that didn't happen for Newton. What if there wasn't new stuff to do at the next and

1:40:42.240 --> 1:40:52.480
 final level? That would be quite sad. Let me ask a silly question. We'll say it with a straight face.

1:40:52.480 --> 1:41:03.920
 Impossible. So let me mention Elon Musk. What are your thoughts about he's more,

1:41:04.560 --> 1:41:10.240
 you're more on the physics theory side of things. He's more on the physics engineering side of

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:17.840
 things in terms of SpaceX efforts. What do you think of his efforts to get off this planet?

1:41:17.840 --> 1:41:25.200
 Well, I think he's the other guy who's semi serious about getting off this planet.

1:41:26.560 --> 1:41:29.360
 I think there are two of us who are semi serious about getting off the planet.

1:41:30.080 --> 1:41:33.840
 What do you think about his methodology and yours when you look at them?

1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:37.920
 I don't want to be against Elon because like I was so excited that

1:41:38.560 --> 1:41:43.920
 like your top video was Ray Kurzweil and then I did your podcast and we had some chemistry. So it

1:41:43.920 --> 1:41:47.920
 zoomed up and I thought, okay, I'm going to beat Ray Kurzweil. So just as I'm coming up on Ray

1:41:47.920 --> 1:41:53.680
 Kurzweil, you're like, and now Alex Friedman special Elon Musk and he blew me out of the water.

1:41:53.680 --> 1:41:59.680
 So I don't want to be petty about it. I want to say that I don't, but I am. Okay, but here's the

1:41:59.680 --> 1:42:07.040
 funny part. He's not taking enough risk. Like he's trying to get us to Mars. Imagine that he got us

1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:15.600
 to Mars, the moon, and we'll throw in Titan and nowhere good enough. The diversification level

1:42:15.600 --> 1:42:21.680
 is too low. Now there's a compatibility. First of all, I don't think Elon is serious about Mars.

1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:30.880
 I think Elon is using Mars. As a narrative, as a story, as a dream. No, to make the moon jealous.

1:42:30.880 --> 1:42:40.400
 No. I think he's using it as a story to organize us, to reacquaint ourselves with our need for

1:42:40.400 --> 1:42:47.440
 space, our need to get off this planet. It's a concrete thing. He's shown that many people

1:42:47.440 --> 1:42:51.200
 think that he's shown that he's the most brilliant and capable person on the planet. I don't think

1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:55.440
 that's what he showed. I think he showed that the rest of us have forgotten our capabilities.

1:42:55.440 --> 1:43:00.480
 And so he's the only guy who has still kept the faith and is like, what's wrong with you people?

1:43:01.360 --> 1:43:07.520
 So you think the lesson we should draw from Elon Musk is there's a capable person within a lot of

1:43:07.520 --> 1:43:13.840
 us? Elon makes sense to me. In what way? He's doing what any sensible person should do. He's

1:43:13.840 --> 1:43:19.120
 trying incredible things and he's partially succeeding, partially failing. To try to solve

1:43:19.120 --> 1:43:25.600
 the obvious problems before us. But he comes up with things like, I got it. We'll come up with

1:43:25.600 --> 1:43:30.160
 a battery company, but batteries aren't sexy. So we'll make a car around it. It's like, great.

1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:40.000
 Anyone of a number of things, Elon is behaving like a sane person and I view everyone else as

1:43:40.000 --> 1:43:47.040
 insane. And my feeling is that we really have to get off this planet. We have to get out of this.

1:43:47.040 --> 1:43:51.920
 We have to get out of the neighborhood. Dillingan, a little bit. Do you think that's a

1:43:51.920 --> 1:43:57.760
 physics problem or an engineering problem? I think it's a cowardice problem. I think that we're

1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:05.760
 afraid that we had 400 hitters of the mind like Einstein and Dirac and that that era is done. And

1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:13.920
 now we're just sort of copy editors. So is some of it money? Like if we become brave enough

1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:18.800
 to go outside the solar system, can we afford to financially?

1:44:18.800 --> 1:44:26.560
 Well, I think that that's not really the issue. The issue is look what Elon did well. He amassed

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:33.760
 a lot of money. And then he plowed it back in and he spun the wheel and he made more money.

1:44:34.400 --> 1:44:42.160
 And now he's got FU money. Now the problem is, is that a lot of the people who have FU money

1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:47.200
 are not people whose middle finger you ever want to see. I want to see Elon's middle finger.

1:44:48.240 --> 1:44:50.720
 I want to see what he's got. What do you mean by that? Or like when you say,

1:44:50.720 --> 1:44:53.360
 fuck it, I'm going to do the biggest possible thing. He's going to do whatever the fuck he

1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:58.000
 wants. Yeah. Right? Fuck you. Fuck anything that gets in his way that he can afford to

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:03.040
 push out of his way. And you're saying he's not actually even doing that enough? No. He's not

1:45:03.040 --> 1:45:08.480
 going. Please. I'm going to go. Elon's doing fine with his money. I just want him to enjoy himself,

1:45:08.480 --> 1:45:15.040
 have the most, you know, Dionysian. But you're saying Mars is playing it safe.

1:45:16.080 --> 1:45:24.080
 He doesn't know how to do anything else. He knows rockets. Yeah. And he might know some physics

1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:32.480
 at a fundamental level. Yeah. I guess, okay, just let me just go right back to it. How much

1:45:32.480 --> 1:45:39.280
 physics do you really, how much brilliant breakthrough ideas on the physics side do you need to get off

1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:44.480
 this planet? I don't know. And I don't know whether, like in my most optimistic dream,

1:45:44.480 --> 1:45:49.600
 I don't know whether my stuff gets us off the planet, but it's hope. It's hope that there's

1:45:49.600 --> 1:45:57.200
 a more fundamental theory that we can access, that we don't need, you know, whose elegance and beauty

1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:02.800
 will suggest that this is probably the way the universe goes. Like you have to say this weird

1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:09.680
 thing, which is this I believe. And this I believe is a very dangerous statement. But this I believe,

1:46:09.680 --> 1:46:18.240
 I believe that my theory points the way. Now, Elon might or might not be able to access my

1:46:18.240 --> 1:46:25.600
 theory. I don't know. I don't know what he knows. But keep in mind, why are we also focused on Elon?

1:46:25.600 --> 1:46:31.760
 It's really weird. It's kind of creepy too. Why? He's just the person who's just asking the obvious

1:46:31.760 --> 1:46:36.720
 questions and doing whatever he can. But he makes sense to me. You see, Craig Venter makes sense

1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:43.520
 to me. Jim Watson makes sense to me. But we're focusing on Elon because he's somehow is rare.

1:46:44.400 --> 1:46:48.960
 Well, that's the weird thing. Like we've come up with a system that eliminates all Elon

1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:57.280
 from our pipeline. And Elon somehow snuck through when they weren't quality adjusting everything,

1:46:57.280 --> 1:47:04.640
 you know? And this idea of disk, right? Distributed idea suppression complex.

1:47:04.640 --> 1:47:09.040
 Yeah. Is that what's bringing the Elons of the world down?

1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:14.560
 You know, it's so funny. Like he's asking Joe Rogan, like, is that a joint? You know,

1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.160
 it's like, well, what will happen if I smoke it? What will happen to the stock price?

1:47:18.160 --> 1:47:23.120
 What will happen if I scratch myself in public? What will happen if I say what I think about

1:47:23.920 --> 1:47:29.280
 Thailand or COVID or who knows what? And everybody's like, don't say that. Say this.

1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:35.520
 Go do this. Go do that. Well, it's crazy making. It's absolutely crazy making. And if you think

1:47:35.520 --> 1:47:45.440
 about what we put through people through, we need to get people who can use FU money, the FU

1:47:45.440 --> 1:47:52.640
 money they need to insulate themselves from all of the people who know better because my nightmare

1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:58.480
 is that why did we only get one Elon? What if we were supposed to have thousands and thousands of

1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:06.240
 Elons? And the weird thing is like, this is all that remains. You're looking at like Obi Wan and

1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:13.920
 Yoda. And it's like, this is the only, this is all that's left after order 66 has been executed.

1:48:13.920 --> 1:48:19.120
 And that's the thing that's really upsetting to me is we used to have Elons five deep. And then

1:48:19.120 --> 1:48:25.360
 we could talk about Elon in the context of his cohort. But this is like, if you were to see a

1:48:25.360 --> 1:48:31.120
 giraffe in the Arctic with no trees around, you'd think, why the long neck? What a strange site,

1:48:31.680 --> 1:48:40.400
 you know? How do we get more Elons? How do we change this? So I think they use, so we know MIT

1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:47.760
 and Harvard. So maybe returning to our previous conversation, my sense is that the Elons of

1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:53.040
 the world are supposed to come from MIT and Harvard. Right. And how do you change?

1:48:53.040 --> 1:49:01.760
 Let's think of one that MIT sort of killed. Have any names in mind? Aaron Schwartz leaps to my

1:49:01.760 --> 1:49:13.120
 mind. Yeah. Okay. Are we MIT supposed to shield the Aaron Schwartz's from, I don't know, journal

1:49:13.120 --> 1:49:18.000
 publishers? Or are we supposed to help the journal publishers so that we can throw 35 year

1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.280
 sentences in his face or whatever it is that we did that depressed him? Okay. So here's my point.

1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:32.160
 Yeah. I want MIT to go back to being the home of Aaron Schwartz. And if you want to send Aaron

1:49:32.160 --> 1:49:40.160
 Schwartz to a state where he's looking at 35 years in prison or something like that, you are my sworn

1:49:40.160 --> 1:49:53.440
 enemy. You are not MIT. You are the traitorous, irresponsible, middle brow, pencil pushing,

1:49:53.440 --> 1:50:00.160
 green eye shade fool that needs to not be in the seat at the presidency of MIT. Period the end. Get

1:50:00.160 --> 1:50:04.720
 the fuck out of there and let one of our people sit in that chair. And the thing that you've

1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:11.680
 articulated is that the people in those chairs are not the way they are because they're evil or

1:50:11.680 --> 1:50:18.160
 somehow morally compromised is that it's just that that's the distributed nature. Is that there's

1:50:18.160 --> 1:50:22.400
 some kind of aspect of the system that just... These are people who wed themselves to the system.

1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:29.840
 They adapt every instinct. And the fact is, is that they're not going to be on Joe Rogan

1:50:29.840 --> 1:50:35.600
 smoking a blunt. Let me ask a silly question. Do you think institutions generally just tend to

1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:43.120
 become that? No. We get some of the institutions. We get Caltech. Here's what we're supposed to

1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:47.680
 have. We're supposed to have Caltech. We're supposed to have read. We're supposed to have deep

1:50:47.680 --> 1:50:55.040
 springs. We're supposed to have MIT. We're supposed to have a part of Harvard. And when the sharp

1:50:55.040 --> 1:51:01.120
 elbow crowd comes after the sharp mind crowd, we're supposed to break those sharp elbows and say,

1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:05.840
 don't come around here again. So what are the weapons that the sharp mind is supposed to use

1:51:05.840 --> 1:51:14.000
 in our modern day? So to reclaim MIT. What's the future? Are you kidding me? First of all,

1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:22.320
 assume that this is being seen at MIT. Definitely is. Okay. Hey, everybody. Try to remember who you

1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:27.680
 are. You're the guys who put the police car on top of the great dump. You guys came up with the

1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:34.240
 great breast of knowledge. You created a Tetris game in the green building. Now, what is your

1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:41.680
 problem? They killed one of your own. You should make their life a living hell. You should be the

1:51:41.680 --> 1:51:47.920
 ones who keep the memory of Aaron Schwartz alive and all of those hackers and all of those mutants.

1:51:47.920 --> 1:51:58.160
 You know, it's like, it's either our place or it isn't. And if we have to throw 12 more pianos

1:51:58.160 --> 1:52:05.040
 off of the roof, right? If Harold Edgerton was taking those photographs, you know,

1:52:06.160 --> 1:52:15.200
 with slo mo back in the 40s. If Noam Chomsky is on your faculty, what the hell is wrong with you

1:52:15.200 --> 1:52:20.160
 kids? You are the most creative and insightful people and you can't figure out how to defend

1:52:20.160 --> 1:52:25.440
 Aaron Schwartz. That's on you guys. So some of that is giving more power to the young, like you

1:52:25.440 --> 1:52:31.520
 said, the brave. No, it's taking power from the feeble and the middle brown. Yeah, but what is

1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:37.040
 the mechanism to me? I don't know. You have some nine volt batteries. No, it's a copper wire.

1:52:37.040 --> 1:52:44.400
 I tend to. Do you have a capacitor? I tend to believe you have to create an alternative

1:52:45.680 --> 1:52:51.760
 and make the alternative so much better that it makes MIT absolutely unless they change.

1:52:52.560 --> 1:52:58.080
 And that's what forces change. So as opposed to somehow. Okay, so use projection mapping.

1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:04.160
 What's projection mapping? Where you take some complicated edifice and you map all of its planes

1:53:04.160 --> 1:53:08.880
 and then you actually project some unbelievable graphics, reskinning a building, let's say at

1:53:08.880 --> 1:53:12.400
 night. That's right. Yeah. Okay, so you want to do some graffiti art with light. You basically

1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:17.760
 want to hack the system. No, I'm saying, look, listen to me, look, we're smarter than they are.

1:53:18.480 --> 1:53:25.360
 And they, you know what they say? They say things like, I think we need some geeks. Get me two PhDs.

1:53:26.560 --> 1:53:32.400
 Right. You treat PhDs like that. That's a bad move because PhDs are capable.

1:53:32.400 --> 1:53:38.720
 And we act like our job is to peel grapes for our betters. Yeah, that's a strange thing.

1:53:38.720 --> 1:53:46.320
 And you speak about it very eloquently is how we treat basically the greatest minds in the world,

1:53:46.320 --> 1:53:52.640
 which is like at the prime, which is PhD students, like that we pay them nothing.

1:53:54.720 --> 1:53:57.680
 I'm done with it. Yeah. Right. We got to take what's ours.

1:53:57.680 --> 1:54:05.280
 So, yeah, take back MIT, become ungovernable, become ungovernable.

1:54:06.800 --> 1:54:10.400
 And by the way, when you become ungovernable, don't do it by throwing food.

1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:18.000
 Don't do it by pouring salt on the lawn like a jerk. Do it through brilliance because what

1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:23.920
 you Caltech and MIT can do and maybe Rensselaer Polytechnic or Worcester Polytechnic, I don't

1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:29.360
 know, Lehigh. God damn it. What's wrong with you, technical people? You act like you're a servant

1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:34.720
 class. It's unclear to me how you reclaim it, except with brilliance, like you said.

1:54:35.920 --> 1:54:39.920
 But to me, that the way you reclaim it with brilliance is to go outside the system.

1:54:39.920 --> 1:54:44.080
 Aaron Schwartz came from the Elon Musk class. What are you guys going to do about it?

1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:51.920
 Right. The super capable people need to flex, need to be individual. They need to stop giving

1:54:51.920 --> 1:54:58.080
 away all their power to a zeitgeist or a community or this or that. You're not indoor cats. You're

1:54:58.080 --> 1:55:01.920
 outdoor cats. Go be outdoor cats. Do you think we're going to see this kind of change happen?

1:55:01.920 --> 1:55:05.600
 You were the one asking me before, like, what about the World War II generation?

1:55:06.160 --> 1:55:08.960
 Oh, and what I'm trying to say is that there's a technical revolt coming.

1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:13.360
 Here's, you want to talk about this. But I'm trying to lead it, right? I'm trying to see.

1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:15.600
 No, you're not trying to lead it. I'm trying to get a blueprint here.

1:55:15.600 --> 1:55:22.480
 All right. Lex, how angry are you about our country pretending that you and I can't actually do

1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:29.120
 technical subjects so that they need an army of kids coming in from four countries in Asia?

1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:34.000
 It's not about the four countries in Asia. It's not about those kids. It's about lying about us,

1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:38.240
 that we don't care enough about science and technology, that we're incapable of it,

1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:45.200
 as if we don't have Chinese and Russians and Koreans and Croatians. Like, we've got everybody

1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:50.480
 here. The only reason you're looking outside is that you want to hire cheap people from

1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:54.960
 the family business because you don't want to pass the family business on. And you know what?

1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:01.200
 You didn't really build the family business. It's not yours to decide. You, the boomers,

1:56:01.200 --> 1:56:05.360
 and you, the silent generation, you did your bit, but you also fouled a lot of stuff up.

1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:12.000
 And you're custodians. You are caretakers. You were supposed to hand something. What you did

1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:18.800
 instead was to gorge yourself on cheap foreign labor, which you then held up as being much more

1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:24.000
 brilliant than your own children, which was never true. See, but I'm trying to understand how we

1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:35.280
 create a better system without anger, without revolution, not by kissing and hugs. I don't

1:56:35.280 --> 1:56:40.240
 understand within MIT what the mechanism of building a better MIT is. We're not going to

1:56:40.240 --> 1:56:47.200
 pay Elsevier. Aaron Schwartz was right. JSTOR is an abomination. But why, who within MIT,

1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:53.040
 who within institutions is going to do that when, just like you said, the people who are running the

1:56:53.040 --> 1:56:59.440
 show are more senior. I don't know if Frank will check to speak out. So you hear, it's basically

1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:04.080
 individuals that step up. I mean, one of the surprising things about Elon is that one person

1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:12.560
 can inspire so much. He's got academic freedom. It just comes from money. I don't agree with

1:57:12.560 --> 1:57:21.680
 that. Do you think money? Okay. So yes, certainly. Sorry, and testicles. Yes, but I think the test

1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:28.640
 is more important than money or guts. I think I do agree with you. You speak about this a lot that

1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:34.480
 because the money in the academic institutions has been so constrained that people are misbehaving

1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:40.960
 and horrible. Yes. But I don't think that if we reverse that and give a huge amount of money,

1:57:40.960 --> 1:57:44.720
 people will all of a sudden behave well. I think it also takes guts. You need to give people

1:57:44.720 --> 1:57:52.480
 security. Security, yes. You need to know that you have a job on Monday when on Friday you say,

1:57:52.480 --> 1:57:58.480
 I'm not so sure I really love diversity and inclusion. And somebody's like, wait, what? You didn't

1:57:58.480 --> 1:58:03.520
 love diversity? We had a statement on diversity and you wouldn't sign? Are you against the inclusion

1:58:03.520 --> 1:58:08.960
 part or are you against diversity? Do you just not like people like you? Actually, that has nothing

1:58:08.960 --> 1:58:12.560
 to do with anything. You're making this into something that it isn't. I don't want to sign

1:58:12.560 --> 1:58:19.120
 your goddamn stupid statement and get out of my lab. Get out of my lab. It all begins from the

1:58:19.120 --> 1:58:24.960
 middle finger. Get out of my lab. The administrators need to find other work.

1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:34.640
 Yeah. Listen, I agree with you and I hope to seek your advice and wisdom as we change this

1:58:34.640 --> 1:58:38.000
 because I'd love to see. I will visit you in prison if that's what you're asking.

1:58:39.280 --> 1:58:45.680
 I have no, I think prison is great. You get a lot of reading done and good working out.

1:58:45.680 --> 1:58:52.080
 Well, let me ask something I brought up before is the Nietzsche quote of,

1:58:52.880 --> 1:58:58.000
 beware that when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster. For when you gaze long

1:58:58.000 --> 1:59:04.720
 into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you. Are you worried that your focus on the flaws in the

1:59:04.720 --> 1:59:10.720
 system that we've just been talking about has damaged your mind or the part of the mind of

1:59:10.720 --> 1:59:17.760
 your mind that's able to see the beauty in the world, in the system that because you have so

1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:24.640
 sharply been able to see the flaws in the system, you can no longer step back and appreciate its

1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:31.520
 beauty. Look, I'm the one who's trying to get the institutions to save themselves by getting

1:59:31.520 --> 1:59:36.400
 rid of their inhabitants, but leaving the institution like a neutron bomb that removes

1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:44.560
 the unworkable leadership class but leaves the structures. So the leadership class is really

1:59:44.560 --> 1:59:47.680
 the problem. The leadership class is the problem. The individual like the professors,

1:59:47.680 --> 1:59:52.160
 the individual scholars. Well, the professors are going to have to go back into training to

1:59:52.160 --> 1:59:57.840
 remember how to be professors. People are cowards at the moment because if they're not cowards,

1:59:57.840 --> 2:00:04.320
 they're unemployed. Yeah, that's one of the disappointing things I've encountered is to me,

2:00:04.320 --> 2:00:14.240
 tenure. Nobody has tenure now. Whether they do or not, they certainly don't have

2:00:17.840 --> 2:00:23.520
 the kind of character and fortitude that I was hoping to see to me. But they'd be gone.

2:00:23.520 --> 2:00:34.080
 You're dreaming about the people who used to live at MIT. You're dreaming about the

2:00:34.080 --> 2:00:38.880
 previous inhabitants of your university. And if you looked at somebody like

2:00:40.560 --> 2:00:45.680
 Isidore Singer is very old. I don't know what state he's in, but that guy was absolutely

2:00:45.680 --> 2:00:50.480
 the real deal. And if you look at Noam Chomsky, tell me that Noam Chomsky has been muzzled.

2:00:50.480 --> 2:00:58.000
 Right? Yeah. Now, what I'm trying to get at is you're talking about younger energetic people,

2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:05.920
 but those people, like when I say something like, I'm against, I'm for inclusion and I'm for diversity,

2:01:05.920 --> 2:01:13.760
 but I'm against diversity and inclusion TM, like the movement. Well, I couldn't say that if I was a

2:01:13.760 --> 2:01:21.600
 professor. Oh my God, he's against our sacred document. Okay. Well, in that kind of a world,

2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:25.680
 do you want to know how many things I don't agree with you on? Like we could go on for days and

2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:31.920
 days and days, all of the nonsense that you've parroted inside of the institution. Any sane person

2:01:31.920 --> 2:01:39.040
 like has no need for it. They have no want for desire. Do you think you have to have some

2:01:39.040 --> 2:01:45.200
 patience for nonsense when many people work together in a system? How long has string theory

2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:50.160
 gone on for and how long have I been patient? Okay. So you're talking about limit to patience.

2:01:50.160 --> 2:01:55.840
 You're talking about like 36 years of modern nonsense and string theory. So you can do like

2:01:55.840 --> 2:02:02.960
 eight to 10 years, but not more. I can do 40 minutes. This is 36 years. Well, you've done that over

2:02:02.960 --> 2:02:09.200
 two hours. No, but I appreciate it. But it's been 36 years of nonsense since the anomaly cancellation

2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:14.480
 in string theory. It's like, what are you talking about about patience? I mean, Lex,

2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:21.200
 you're not even acting like yourself. Well, you're trying to stay in the system. I'm not sure. I'm

2:02:21.200 --> 2:02:29.520
 not. I'm trying to see if perhaps, so my hope is that the system just has a few assholes in it,

2:02:29.520 --> 2:02:37.040
 which you highlight. And the fundamentals of the system are broken. Because if the fundamentals

2:02:37.040 --> 2:02:45.840
 of the systems are broken, then I just don't see a way for MIT to succeed. I don't see how young

2:02:45.840 --> 2:02:53.520
 people take over MIT. I don't see how... By inspiring us. You know, the great part about

2:02:53.520 --> 2:03:01.040
 being at MIT, like when you saw the genius in these pranks, the heart, the irreverence.

2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:08.480
 We were talking about Tom Lehrer the last time. Tom Lehrer was as naughty as the day is long.

2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:13.840
 Agreed? Agreed. Was he also a genius? Was he well spoken? Was he highly cultured?

2:03:14.720 --> 2:03:19.600
 He was so talented, so intellectual that he could just make fart jokes morning, noon, and night.

2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:25.520
 Yeah. Okay. Well, in part, the right to make fart jokes, the right to, for example,

2:03:25.520 --> 2:03:30.960
 put a functioning phone booth that was ringing on top of the great dome at MIT has to do with,

2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:36.560
 we are such bad asses that we can actually do this stuff. Well, don't tell me about it anymore.

2:03:36.560 --> 2:03:42.720
 Go break the law. Go break the law in a way that inspires us and makes us not want to prosecute

2:03:42.720 --> 2:03:47.840
 you. Break the law in a way that lets us know that you're calling us out on our bullshit,

2:03:47.840 --> 2:03:54.320
 that you're filled with love, and that our technical talent has not gone to sleep. It's

2:03:54.320 --> 2:04:00.320
 not incapable. And if the idea is that you're going to dig a moat around the university and

2:04:00.320 --> 2:04:06.240
 fill it with tiger sharks, that's awesome because I don't know how you're going to do it. But if

2:04:06.240 --> 2:04:11.520
 you actually manage to do that, I'm not going to prosecute you under a reckless endangerment.

2:04:11.520 --> 2:04:18.240
 Yeah. That's beautifully put. I hope those, first of all, they'll listen. I hope young

2:04:18.240 --> 2:04:23.840
 people at MIT will take over in this, in this kind of way. In the introduction to your podcast

2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:33.280
 episode on Jeff Epstein, you give to me a really moving story, but unfortunately for me too brief

2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:39.040
 about your experience with a therapist and the lasting terror that permeated your mind.

2:04:39.040 --> 2:04:44.400
 Can you go there? Can you tell?

2:04:44.960 --> 2:04:49.440
 No, thanks. I mean, I appreciate what you're saying. I said it obliquely. I said enough.

2:04:51.600 --> 2:04:58.960
 There are bad people who cross our paths. And the current vogue is to say, oh, I'm a survivor.

2:05:00.880 --> 2:05:08.640
 I'm a victim. I can do anything I want. This is a broken person. And I don't know why I was

2:05:08.640 --> 2:05:14.560
 sent to a broken person as a kid. And to be honest with you, I also felt like in that story, I say

2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:22.720
 that I was able to say no. And this was like the entire weight of authority. And he was misusing

2:05:22.720 --> 2:05:31.600
 his position. And I was also able to say no. What I couldn't say no to was having him reinflicted in

2:05:31.600 --> 2:05:38.000
 my life. You were sent back a second time. I tried to complain about what had happened.

2:05:38.000 --> 2:05:45.920
 And I tried to do it in a way that did not immediately cause horrific consequences to both

2:05:45.920 --> 2:05:54.560
 this person and myself because we don't have the tools to deal with sexual misbehavior.

2:05:55.120 --> 2:06:02.160
 We have nuclear weapons. We don't have any way of saying this is probably not a good place

2:06:02.160 --> 2:06:08.560
 or a role for you at this moment as an authority figure and something needs to be worked on.

2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:15.920
 So in general, when we see somebody who is misbehaving in that way, our immediate instinct

2:06:15.920 --> 2:06:25.280
 is to treat the person as Satan. And we understand why. We don't want our children to be at risk.

2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:31.600
 Now, I personally believe that I fell down on the job and did not call out the Jeffrey Epstein thing

2:06:31.600 --> 2:06:36.480
 early enough because I was terrified of what Jeffrey Epstein represents. And this recapitulated

2:06:37.440 --> 2:06:43.600
 the old terror trying to tell the world this therapist is out of control. And when I said

2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:48.960
 that, the world responded by saying, well, you have two appointments booked and you have to go

2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:55.280
 for the second one. So I got reinflicted into this office on this person who was now convinced

2:06:55.280 --> 2:06:58.480
 that I was about to tear down his career and his reputation. It might have been on the verge

2:06:58.480 --> 2:07:04.240
 of suicide for all I know. I don't know. But he was very, very angry. And he was furious with me

2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:07.280
 that I had breached a sacred confidence of his office.

2:07:08.480 --> 2:07:12.880
 What kind of ripple effects does that have? Has that had to the rest of your life?

2:07:12.880 --> 2:07:20.160
 Has that had to the rest of your life, the absurdity and the cruelty of that? I mean,

2:07:20.160 --> 2:07:26.480
 there's no sense to it. Well, see, this is the thing people don't really grasp, I think.

2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:37.360
 There's an academic who I got to know many years ago named Jennifer Fried, who has a theory of

2:07:37.360 --> 2:07:43.760
 betrayal, which she calls institutional betrayal. And her gambit is that when you are betrayed by

2:07:43.760 --> 2:07:50.400
 an institution that is sort of like a fiduciary or parental obligation to take care of you,

2:07:51.520 --> 2:07:57.360
 that you find yourself in a far different situation with respect to trauma than if you

2:07:57.360 --> 2:08:08.400
 were betrayed by somebody who's a peer. And so I think that in my situation, I kind of repeat

2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:16.720
 a particular dynamic with authority. I come in not following all the rules,

2:08:17.920 --> 2:08:23.920
 trying to do some things, not trying to do others, blah, blah, blah. And then I get into a weird

2:08:23.920 --> 2:08:28.720
 relationship with authority. And so I have more experience with what I would call institutional

2:08:28.720 --> 2:08:38.560
 betrayal. Now, the funny part about it is that when you don't have masks or PPE in a influenza like

2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:45.920
 pandemic and you're missing ICU beds and ventilators, that is ubiquitous institutional betrayal.

2:08:46.800 --> 2:08:53.600
 So I believe that in a weird way, I was very early. The idea of, and this is like the really hard

2:08:53.600 --> 2:09:00.320
 concept, pervasive or otherwise universal institutional betrayal, where all of the

2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:06.160
 institutions, you can count on any hospital to not charge you properly for what their services are.

2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:12.400
 You can count on no pharmaceutical company to produce the drug that will be maximally beneficial

2:09:12.400 --> 2:09:18.320
 to the people who take it. You know that your financial professionals are not simply working

2:09:18.320 --> 2:09:24.160
 in your best interest. And that issue had to do with the way in which growth left our system.

2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:29.600
 So I think that the weird thing is, is that this first institutional betrayal by a therapist

2:09:30.560 --> 2:09:35.280
 left me very open to the idea of, okay, well, maybe the schools are bad, maybe the hospitals

2:09:35.280 --> 2:09:40.240
 are bad, maybe the drug companies are bad, maybe our food is off, maybe our journalists are not

2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:45.840
 serving journalistic ends. And that was what allowed me to sort of go all the distance and say,

2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:52.720
 huh, I wonder if our problem is that something is causing all of our sense making institutions to

2:09:52.720 --> 2:10:00.160
 be off. That was the big insight. And that tying that to a single etiology, what if it's just about

2:10:00.160 --> 2:10:05.600
 growth? They were all built on growth. And now we've promoted people who are capable of keeping

2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:12.800
 quiet that their institutions aren't working. So we've the privileged, silent aristocracy,

2:10:12.800 --> 2:10:17.600
 the people who can be counted upon, not to mention a fire when a raging fire is tearing

2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:24.720
 through a building. But nevertheless, it's how big of a psychological burden is that?

2:10:25.360 --> 2:10:31.360
 It's huge. It's terrible. I mean, crushing. It's very, it's very comforting to be the parental.

2:10:33.200 --> 2:10:39.920
 I mean, I don't know, I treasure, I mean, we were just talking about MIT, we can until I can

2:10:39.920 --> 2:10:44.480
 intellectualize and agree with everything you're saying, but there's a comfort, a warm blanket

2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:51.520
 of being within the institution. And up until Aaron Schwartz, let's say. In other words,

2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:57.680
 now if I look at the provost and the president as mommy and daddy, you did what to my big brother?

2:11:00.320 --> 2:11:08.160
 You did what to our family? You sold us out in which way? What secrets left for China?

2:11:08.160 --> 2:11:14.720
 China? You hired which workforce? You did what to my wages? You took this portion of my grant

2:11:14.720 --> 2:11:19.040
 for what purpose? You just stole my retirement through a fringe rate. What did you do?

2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:26.880
 But can you still, I mean, the thing is about this view you have, is it often turns out to be

2:11:26.880 --> 2:11:33.360
 sadly correct? Well, this is the thing. And but let me just, in this silly hopeful thing,

2:11:33.360 --> 2:11:38.960
 do you still have hope in institutions? Can you within your, psychologically?

2:11:38.960 --> 2:11:44.400
 Yes. I'm referring not intellectually, because you have to carry this burden. Can you still have

2:11:44.400 --> 2:11:52.000
 a hope like within you? When you sit at home alone, and as opposed to seeing the darkness

2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:57.120
 within these institutions, seeing a hope. Well, but this is the thing I want to confront,

2:11:57.120 --> 2:12:05.120
 not for the purpose of a dustup. I believe, for example, if you've heard episode 19,

2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:12.640
 that the best outcome is for Carol Greider to come forward as we discussed in episode 19.

2:12:12.640 --> 2:12:18.480
 Would your brother, Brett, and say, you know what? I screwed up. He did call,

2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:24.000
 he did suggest the experiment. I didn't understand that it was his theory that was producing it.

2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:32.800
 Maybe I was slow to grasp it. But my bad, and I don't want to pay for this bad

2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:41.280
 choice on my part, let's say, for the rest of my career, I want to own up and I want to help make

2:12:41.280 --> 2:12:47.440
 sure that we do what's right with what's left. And that's one little case within the institution

2:12:47.440 --> 2:12:52.800
 that you would like to see made? I would like to see MIT very clearly come out and say, you know,

2:12:52.800 --> 2:13:01.360
 Margot O'Toole was right when she said, David Baltimore's lab here produced some stuff that

2:13:01.360 --> 2:13:08.640
 was not reproducible with Teresa Minishikari's research. I want to see the courageous people.

2:13:08.640 --> 2:13:14.960
 I would like to see the Aaron Schwartz wing of the computer science department. Yeah,

2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:19.040
 wouldn't know. Let's think about it. Wouldn't that be great if they said, you know,

2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:24.400
 an injustice was done and we're going to write that wrong just as if this was Alan Turing?

2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:31.200
 Which I don't think they've righted that wrong. Well, then let's have the Turing Schwartz wing.

2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:35.840
 The Turing Schwartz, they're starting a new college of computing. It wouldn't be wonderful

2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:40.800
 to call it the Turing Schwartz. I would like to have the Madame Wu wing of the physics department,

2:13:40.800 --> 2:13:45.520
 and I'd love to have the Emmy Nerder statue in front of the math department. I mean,

2:13:45.520 --> 2:13:49.360
 like you want to get excited about actual diversity and inclusion? Yeah.

2:13:49.360 --> 2:13:53.680
 Well, let's go with our absolute best people who never got theirs because there is structural

2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:59.840
 bigotry, you know? But if we don't actually start celebrating the beautiful stuff that

2:13:59.840 --> 2:14:05.440
 we're capable of when we're handed heroes and we fumble them into the trash, what the hell? I mean,

2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:17.360
 Lex, this is such nonsense. We just, just pulling our head out. You know, on everyone's

2:14:17.360 --> 2:14:21.120
 secombe should be tattooed. If you can read this, you're too close.

2:14:25.280 --> 2:14:32.160
 Beautifully put, and I'm a dreamer just like you. So I don't see as much of the darkness

2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:41.280
 genetically or due to my life experience, but I do share the hope. From IT, the institution

2:14:41.280 --> 2:14:46.240
 that we care a lot about. We both do. Yeah. And Harvard, the institution I don't give a damn

2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:51.680
 about, but you do. I love Harvard. I'm just kidding. I love Harvard, but Harvard and I

2:14:51.680 --> 2:14:56.160
 have a very difficult relationship. And part of what, you know, when you love a family that isn't

2:14:56.160 --> 2:15:02.800
 working, I don't want to trash. I didn't bring up the name of the president of MIT during the

2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:09.840
 Air and Schwartz period. It's not vengeance. I want the rot cleared out. I don't need to go

2:15:09.840 --> 2:15:16.880
 after human beings. Yeah. Just like you said, with the, with the disk formulation, the individual

2:15:16.880 --> 2:15:25.040
 human beings don't necessarily carry them. It's those chairs that are so powerful that,

2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:29.120
 in which they sit. It's the chairs, not the humans. It's not the humans.

2:15:31.120 --> 2:15:38.720
 Without naming names, can you tell the story of your struggle during your time at Harvard?

2:15:40.160 --> 2:15:43.840
 Maybe in a way that tells the bigger story of the struggle of young,

2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:52.160
 bright minds that are trying to come up with big, bold ideas within the institutions that

2:15:52.160 --> 2:16:05.280
 we're talking about. You can start. I mean, in part, it starts with coffee with a couple of

2:16:05.280 --> 2:16:16.320
 Croatians in the math department at MIT. And we used to talk about music and dance and math

2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:23.200
 and physics and love and all this kind of stuff as Eastern Europeans love to. And I ate it up.

2:16:23.920 --> 2:16:30.240
 And my friend, Gordana, who was an instructor in the MIT math department when I was a graduate

2:16:30.240 --> 2:16:36.080
 student at Harvard, said to me, I'm probably going to do a bad version of her accent.

2:16:36.080 --> 2:16:46.800
 Here we go. Erick, will I see you tomorrow at the secret seminar? And I said, what secret seminar?

2:16:46.800 --> 2:16:53.440
 Erick, don't joke. I said, I'm not used to this style of humor, Gordana. I said,

2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:59.600
 Erick, the secret seminar that your advisor is running. I said, what are you talking about?

2:16:59.600 --> 2:17:06.800
 Ha, ha, ha. Your advisor is running a secret seminar on this aspect. I think it was like

2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:13.520
 the churned Simon's invariant. I'm not sure what the topic was again, but she gave me the room

2:17:13.520 --> 2:17:17.840
 number and the time, and she was not cracking a smile. I've never known her to make this kind

2:17:17.840 --> 2:17:22.480
 of a joke. And I thought this was crazy. And I was trying to have an advisor. I didn't want

2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:30.560
 an advisor, but people said you have to have one, so I took one. And I went to this room like 15

2:17:30.560 --> 2:17:34.720
 minutes early, and there was not a soul inside it. It was outside of the math department.

2:17:36.320 --> 2:17:42.800
 And it was still in the same building, the science center at Harvard. And I sat there and I let five

2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:47.760
 minutes go by. I let seven minutes go by. Ten minutes go by. There's nobody. I thought, okay,

2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:54.960
 so this was all an elaborate joke. And then like three minutes to the hour, this graduate student

2:17:54.960 --> 2:18:01.760
 walks in and like sees me and does a double take. And then I start to see the professors in geometry

2:18:01.760 --> 2:18:09.200
 and topology start to file in. And everybody's like very disconcerted that I'm in this room.

2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:18.640
 And finally, the person who was supposed to be my advisor walks in to the seminar and sees

2:18:18.640 --> 2:18:27.520
 me and goes, why does it go? And I realized that the secret seminar is true, that the department

2:18:27.520 --> 2:18:35.120
 is conducting a secret seminar on the exact topic that I'm interested in, not telling me about it,

2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:41.680
 and that these are the reindeer games that the Rudolphs of the department are not invited to.

2:18:42.640 --> 2:18:47.280
 And so then I realized, okay, I did not understand it. There's a parallel department.

2:18:49.040 --> 2:19:01.040
 And that became the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which I came to understand that the

2:19:01.040 --> 2:19:10.480
 game that I had been sold about publication, about blind refereeing, about openness and

2:19:12.240 --> 2:19:15.520
 scientific transmission of information was all a lie.

2:19:18.080 --> 2:19:25.040
 I came to understand that at the very top, there's a second system that's about closed meetings

2:19:25.040 --> 2:19:34.000
 and private communications and agreements about citation and publication that the rest of us

2:19:34.000 --> 2:19:41.200
 don't understand. And that in large measure, that is the thing that I won't submit to. And so when

2:19:41.200 --> 2:19:46.000
 you ask me questions like, well, why wouldn't you feel good about talking to your critics? Or

2:19:46.000 --> 2:19:50.480
 why wouldn't you feel? The answer is, oh, you don't know. Like if you stay in a nice hotel,

2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:55.680
 you don't realize that there is an entire second structure inside of that hotel,

2:19:56.320 --> 2:20:02.480
 where like there's usually a workers cafe in a resort complex that isn't available to the people

2:20:02.480 --> 2:20:10.400
 who are staying in the hotel. And then there are private hallways inside the same hotel that are

2:20:10.400 --> 2:20:16.240
 parallel structures. So that's what I found, which was in essence, just the way you can stay hotels

2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:20.720
 your whole life and not realize that inside of every hotel is a second structure that you're

2:20:20.720 --> 2:20:26.640
 not supposed to see as the guest. There is a second structure inside of academics that behaves

2:20:26.640 --> 2:20:32.000
 totally differently with respect to how people get dinged, how people get their grants taken away,

2:20:32.000 --> 2:20:40.320
 how this person comes to have that thing named after them. And by pretending that we're not

2:20:40.320 --> 2:20:48.160
 running a parallel structure, I have no patience for that anymore. So I got a chance to see how

2:20:48.160 --> 2:20:54.720
 the game, how hardball is really played at Harvard. And I'm now eager to play hardball

2:20:56.640 --> 2:20:59.040
 back with the same people who played hardball with me.

2:21:00.800 --> 2:21:07.680
 Let me ask two questions on this. So one, do you think it's possible? So I call those people

2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:14.240
 assholes. That's the technical term. Do you think it's possible that that's just not the entire

2:21:14.240 --> 2:21:21.600
 system, but a part of the system? Sort of that there's, you can navigate, you can swim in the

2:21:21.600 --> 2:21:28.160
 waters and find the groups of people who do aspire to the openness. The guy who rescued my PhD

2:21:28.720 --> 2:21:32.480
 was one of the people who filed in to the secret seminar.

2:21:32.480 --> 2:21:38.880
 Right. But are there people outside of this? Is he an asshole?

2:21:40.000 --> 2:21:45.840
 Yes. I was a bad... No, but I'm trying to make this point, which is this isn't my failure to

2:21:45.840 --> 2:21:52.560
 correctly map these people. It's yours. You have a simplification that isn't going to work.

2:21:53.120 --> 2:21:59.360
 I think, okay, asshole is the wrong term. I would say lacking of character and...

2:21:59.360 --> 2:22:04.800
 What would you have had these people do? Why did they do this? Why have a secret seminar?

2:22:06.000 --> 2:22:10.240
 I don't understand the exact dynamics of a secret seminar, but I think the right thing to do

2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:16.720
 is to, I mean, to see individuals like you. There might be a reason to have a secret seminar,

2:22:16.720 --> 2:22:23.600
 but they should detect that an individual like you, a brilliant mind who's thinking about certain

2:22:23.600 --> 2:22:28.960
 ideas could be damaged by this. I don't think that they see it that way. The idea is we're

2:22:28.960 --> 2:22:34.800
 going to sneak food to the children we want to survive. Yeah, so that's highly problematic,

2:22:34.800 --> 2:22:39.040
 and there should be people within that room. I'm trying to say this is the thing,

2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:45.120
 the ball that can't, is Thrombeck won't be caught. The problem is they know that most of their

2:22:45.120 --> 2:22:56.400
 children won't survive, and they can't say that. I see. Sorry to interrupt. You mean that the fact

2:22:56.400 --> 2:23:01.120
 that the whole system is underfunded, that they naturally have to pick favorites?

2:23:02.080 --> 2:23:09.360
 They live in a world which reached steady state at some level, let's say, in the early 70s,

2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:17.920
 and in that world, before that time, you have a professor like Norman Steenrod, and you'd have

2:23:17.920 --> 2:23:21.760
 20 children that is graduate students, and all of them would go on to be professors,

2:23:21.760 --> 2:23:28.320
 and all of them would want to have 20 children. You start taking higher and higher powers of 20,

2:23:28.960 --> 2:23:34.320
 and you see that the system could not, it's not just about money. The system couldn't survive,

2:23:34.320 --> 2:23:41.120
 so the way it's supposed to work now is that we should shut down the vast majority of PhD programs,

2:23:41.680 --> 2:23:49.760
 and we should let the small number of truly top places populate mostly teaching and research

2:23:49.760 --> 2:23:56.000
 departments that aren't PhD producing. We don't want to do that because we use PhD students as a

2:23:56.000 --> 2:24:03.680
 labor force. The whole thing has to do with growth, resources, dishonesty, and in that world,

2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:09.920
 you see all of these adaptations to a ruthless world where the key question is, where are we

2:24:09.920 --> 2:24:16.560
 going to bury this huge number of bodies of people who don't work out? My problem was I wasn't

2:24:16.560 --> 2:24:22.960
 interested in dying. You clearly highlight that there's aspects of the system that are broken,

2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:32.000
 but as an individual, is your role to exit the system or just acknowledge that it's a game and

2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:40.800
 win it? My role is to survive and thrive in the public eye. In other words, when you have an escapee

2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:47.920
 of the system, like yourself, such as, and that person says, you know, I wasn't exactly finished.

2:24:47.920 --> 2:24:54.880
 Let me show you a bunch of stuff. Let me show you that the theory of telomeres never got reported

2:24:54.880 --> 2:25:00.960
 properly. Let me show you that all of marginal economics is supposed to be redone with a

2:25:00.960 --> 2:25:05.040
 different version of the differential calculus. Let me show you that you didn't understand the

2:25:05.040 --> 2:25:11.120
 self dual Yang Mills equations correctly in topology and physics, because they're in fact

2:25:13.520 --> 2:25:18.080
 much more broadly found, and it's only the mutations that happen in special dimensions.

2:25:18.080 --> 2:25:24.640
 There are lots of things to say, but this particular group of people, like if you just take,

2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:29.680
 where are all the Gen X and millennial university presidents?

2:25:29.680 --> 2:25:42.240
 All right. They're all in a holding pattern. Now, why in the story of telomeres was it an

2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:48.480
 older professor and a younger graduate student? It's this issue of what would be called interference

2:25:48.480 --> 2:25:55.200
 competition. For example, orcas try to drown minke whales by covering their blow holes so

2:25:55.200 --> 2:26:01.440
 that they suffocate because the needed resource is air. Okay. Well, what do the universities do?

2:26:01.440 --> 2:26:07.920
 They try to make sure that you can't be viable, that you need them, that you need their grants,

2:26:07.920 --> 2:26:15.920
 you need to be zinged with overhead charges or fringe rates or all of the games that the locals

2:26:15.920 --> 2:26:22.720
 love to play. Well, my point is, okay, what's the cost of this? How many people died as a result of

2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:28.480
 these interference competition games? When you take somebody like Douglas Prasher who did green

2:26:28.480 --> 2:26:34.640
 fluorescent protein and he drives a shuttle bus because his grant runs out and he has to give

2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:38.640
 away all of his research and all of that research gets a Nobel Prize and he gets to drive a shuttle

2:26:38.640 --> 2:26:43.200
 bus for $35,000 a year. What do you mean by died? Do you mean their career, their dreams,

2:26:43.200 --> 2:26:48.400
 their passions? Yeah, as an academic, Doug Prasher was dead for a long period of time.

2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:58.560
 Okay, so as a person who's escaped the system, can't you at this, because you also have in

2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:05.200
 your mind a powerful theory that may turn out to be useful, maybe not. Let's hope.

2:27:06.320 --> 2:27:14.480
 Can't you also play the game enough like with the children? So like publish and but also...

2:27:14.480 --> 2:27:19.600
 If you told me that this would work, really what I want to do, you see, is I would love to

2:27:19.600 --> 2:27:30.240
 revolutionize a field with an H index of zero. We have these proxies that count how many papers

2:27:30.240 --> 2:27:35.520
 you've written, how cited are the papers you've written. All this is nonsense.

2:27:35.520 --> 2:27:39.360
 That's interesting. Sorry, what do you mean by a field with an H index? So I told you

2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:44.400
 you feel... H index is count somehow how many papers have you gotten that get so many citations.

2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:54.880
 Let's say H index undefined. Like for example, I don't have an advisor for my PhD,

2:27:55.840 --> 2:28:01.440
 but I have to have an advisor as far as something called the math genealogy project that tracks

2:28:01.440 --> 2:28:10.640
 who advised whom down the line. So I am my own advisor, which sets up a loop, right? How many

2:28:10.640 --> 2:28:17.280
 students do I have an infinite number or descendants? They don't want to have that story. So I have to

2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:22.080
 be... I have to have formal advisor Raoul Botte and my Wikipedia entry, for example, says that I

2:28:22.080 --> 2:28:29.120
 was advised by Raoul Botte, which is not true. So you get fit into a system that says, well,

2:28:29.120 --> 2:28:34.720
 we have to know what your H index is. We have to know where are you a professor if you want to

2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:40.800
 apply for a grant. It makes all of these assumptions. What I'm trying to do is in part to show all of

2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:46.320
 this is nonsense. This is proxy BS that came up in the institutional setting. And right now,

2:28:46.320 --> 2:28:51.440
 it's important for those of us who are still vital like Elon, it would be great to have Elon as a

2:28:51.440 --> 2:28:56.880
 professor of physics and engineering, right? It seems ridiculous to say, but...

2:28:56.880 --> 2:29:05.440
 Just as a shot in the arm. It would be great to have Elon at Caltech, even one day a week.

2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:11.600
 One day a month. Okay. Well, why can't we be in there? It's the same reason. Well,

2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:15.680
 why can't you be on the view? Why can't you be on Bill Maher? We need to know what you're going

2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:19.440
 to do before we take you on the show. Well, I don't want to tell you what I'm going to do.

2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:24.240
 Do you think you need to be able to dance the dance a little bit?

2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:29.600
 I can dance the dance fun. To be on the view. Oh, come on. So you can. Yeah, you do. You're not.

2:29:29.600 --> 2:29:33.680
 I can do that fine. Here's where it's... Sure. The place that it goes south is

2:29:35.200 --> 2:29:40.080
 there's like a set of questions that gets you into this more adversarial stuff. And you've in

2:29:40.080 --> 2:29:45.280
 fact asked some of those more adversarial questions this setting. And they're not things

2:29:45.280 --> 2:29:49.040
 that are necessarily aggressive, but they're things that are making assumptions.

2:29:49.040 --> 2:29:54.080
 Right. So when you have a question, it's like, Lex,

2:29:54.080 --> 2:29:59.600
 are you avoiding your critics? It's just like, okay, why did you frame that that way? Or the

2:29:59.600 --> 2:30:04.800
 next question would be, do you think that you should have a special exemption and that you

2:30:04.800 --> 2:30:07.360
 should have the right to break rules and everyone else should have to follow them?

2:30:08.080 --> 2:30:12.320
 That question I find innervating. It doesn't really come out of anything meaningful. It's

2:30:12.320 --> 2:30:16.800
 just like we feel we're supposed to ask that of the other person to show that we're not captured

2:30:16.800 --> 2:30:21.360
 by their madness. That's not the real question you want to ask me. If you want to get really excited

2:30:21.360 --> 2:30:27.920
 about this, you want to ask, do you think this thing is right? Yeah, weirdly, I do. Do you think

2:30:27.920 --> 2:30:32.960
 that it's going to be immediately seen to be right? I don't. I think it's going to have an

2:30:32.960 --> 2:30:37.280
 interesting fight and it's going to have an interesting evolution. And what do you hope to

2:30:37.280 --> 2:30:45.440
 do with it in nonphysical terms? Gosh, I hope it revolutionizes our relationship of, well,

2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:49.920
 with people outside of the institutional framework and it reinflicts us into the institutional

2:30:49.920 --> 2:30:54.000
 framework where we can do the most good to bring the institutions back to health.

2:30:55.360 --> 2:31:00.960
 It's like, these are positive uplifting questions. If you had Frank Wilczek, you wouldn't say,

2:31:00.960 --> 2:31:06.800
 Frank, let's be honest, you have done very little with your life after the original huge

2:31:07.760 --> 2:31:12.960
 show that you used to break under the physics scene. We weirdly ask people different questions

2:31:12.960 --> 2:31:20.960
 based upon how they sit down. Yeah, that's very strange, right? So here's the thing. I get

2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:28.000
 these days a large number of emails from people with the equivalent of a theory of everything

2:31:28.000 --> 2:31:40.400
 for AGI. And I use my own BS radar to detect unfairly, perhaps, whether they're full of

2:31:40.400 --> 2:31:44.880
 shit or not. Right. I love where you're going with this, by the way.

2:31:48.880 --> 2:31:54.640
 My concern I often think about is there's elements of brilliance in what people write to me.

2:31:56.400 --> 2:32:01.840
 And I'm trying to, right now, as you made it clear, the kind of judgments and assumptions

2:32:01.840 --> 2:32:08.160
 would make, how am I supposed to deal with you who are not an outsider of the system

2:32:08.160 --> 2:32:14.080
 and think about what you're doing, because my radar is saying you're not full of shit.

2:32:15.360 --> 2:32:17.920
 But I'm also not completely outside of the system.

2:32:17.920 --> 2:32:23.280
 That's right. You've danced beautifully. You've actually got all the credibility

2:32:24.080 --> 2:32:30.320
 that you're supposed to get, all the nice little stamps of approval, not all, but a large enough

2:32:30.320 --> 2:32:41.120
 amount. I mean, it's hard to put into words exactly why you sound, whether your theory

2:32:41.120 --> 2:32:48.080
 turns out to be good or not, you sound like a special human being. I appreciate that and thank

2:32:48.080 --> 2:32:53.200
 you very much. In a good way. No, no, no. But what am I supposed to do with that flood of emails

2:32:53.200 --> 2:33:00.000
 from AGI folks? Why do I sound different? I don't know. And I would like to systemize that. I don't know.

2:33:01.200 --> 2:33:10.240
 Look, when you're talking to people, you very quickly can surmise. Am I claiming to be a physicist?

2:33:10.240 --> 2:33:16.960
 No, I say it every turn. I'm not a physicist. When you say something about bundles, you say,

2:33:16.960 --> 2:33:24.240
 well, can you explain it differently? I'm pushing around on this area, that lever over there.

2:33:24.960 --> 2:33:28.880
 I'm trying to find something that we can play with and engage.

2:33:29.840 --> 2:33:36.080
 And another thing is that I'll say something at scale. So if I was saying completely wrong

2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:40.960
 things about bundles on the Joe Rogan program, you don't think that we wouldn't hear a crushing

2:33:40.960 --> 2:33:50.080
 chorus and the same thing with geometric unity. So I put up this video from this Oxford lecture.

2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:57.520
 I understand that it's not a standard lecture, but you haven't heard the most brilliant people

2:33:57.520 --> 2:34:01.760
 in the field say, well, this is obviously nonsense. They don't know what to make of it.

2:34:03.920 --> 2:34:07.520
 They're going to hide behind, well, he hasn't said enough details. Where's the paper?

2:34:07.520 --> 2:34:12.400
 Where's the paper? I've seen the criticism. I've gotten the same kind of criticism. I've

2:34:12.400 --> 2:34:20.080
 published a few things, especially stuff related to Tesla. We did studies on Tesla vehicles. And

2:34:20.080 --> 2:34:26.240
 the kind of criticism I've gotten showed that they're completely... Oh, right. The guy who had

2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:29.920
 Elon Musk on his program twice is going to give us an accurate assessment. Next.

2:34:29.920 --> 2:34:37.120
 Exactly. Exactly. It's just very low level without actually ever addressing the content.

2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:45.760
 You know, Lex, I think that in part you're trying to solve a puzzle that isn't really your puzzle.

2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:49.840
 I think you know that I'm sincere. You don't know whether the theory is going to work or not.

2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:54.080
 And you know that it's not coming out of somebody who's coming out of left field.

2:34:54.080 --> 2:35:00.240
 Like the story makes sense. There's enough that's new and creative and different in other aspects

2:35:00.240 --> 2:35:06.880
 where you can check me that your real concern is, are you really telling me that when you start

2:35:06.880 --> 2:35:12.240
 breaking the rules, you see the system for what it is and it's become really vicious and aggressive?

2:35:12.240 --> 2:35:18.080
 And the answer is yes. And I had to break the rules in part because of learning issues, because I

2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:24.560
 came into this field with a totally different set of attributes. My profile just doesn't look

2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:30.720
 like anybody else's remotely. But as a result, what that did is it showed me what is the system

2:35:30.720 --> 2:35:36.640
 true to its own ideals or does it just follow these weird procedures and then when you take it

2:35:36.640 --> 2:35:43.360
 off the rails, it behaves terribly. And that's really what my story, I think, does. Is it just

2:35:43.360 --> 2:35:49.120
 says, well, he completely takes the system into new territory where it's not expecting to have to

2:35:49.120 --> 2:35:54.320
 deal with somebody with these confusing sets of attributes. And I think what he's telling us is

2:35:54.320 --> 2:36:01.040
 he believes it behaves terribly. Now, if you take somebody with perfect standardized tests

2:36:01.680 --> 2:36:08.480
 and a winner of math competitions and you put them in a PhD program, they're probably going to be okay.

2:36:08.480 --> 2:36:17.600
 Okay. I'm not saying that the system breaks down for everybody under all circumstances.

2:36:17.600 --> 2:36:23.280
 I'm saying when you present the system with a novel situation, at the moment, it will almost

2:36:23.280 --> 2:36:31.040
 certainly break down with probability approaching 100%. But to me, the painful and the tragic thing

2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:39.520
 is it sorry to bring out my motherly instinct. But it feels like it's too much. It could be

2:36:39.520 --> 2:36:45.680
 too much of a burden to exist outside the system. Maybe by psychologically. First of all, I've got

2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:53.840
 a podcast that I kind of like. I've got amazing friends. I have a life which has more interesting

2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:58.480
 people passing through it than I know what to do with. And they haven't managed to kill me off yet.

2:36:58.480 --> 2:37:05.200
 So far, so good. Speaking of which, you host an amazing podcast that we've mentioned several

2:37:05.200 --> 2:37:12.560
 times, but should mention over and over the portal where you somehow manage every single

2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:19.680
 conversation is a surprise. You go, I mean, not just the guests, but just the places you take

2:37:19.680 --> 2:37:26.000
 them, the kind of ways they become challenging and how you recover from that. I mean, it's

2:37:26.000 --> 2:37:33.920
 a full of genuine human moments. So I really appreciate what you're, it's a fun podcast

2:37:33.920 --> 2:37:40.720
 to listen to. Let me ask some silly questions about it. What have you learned about conversation,

2:37:41.440 --> 2:37:46.560
 about human to human conversation? Well, I have a problem that I haven't solved on the portal,

2:37:47.200 --> 2:37:54.480
 which is that in general, when I ask people questions, they usually find their deeply

2:37:54.480 --> 2:37:59.600
 grooved answers. And I'm not so interested in all of the deeply grooved answers. And so there's a

2:37:59.600 --> 2:38:04.720
 complaint, which I'm very sympathetic to actually, that I talk over people that I won't sit still for

2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:11.120
 the answer. And I think that that's weirdly sort of correct. It's not that I'm not interested in

2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:16.240
 hearing other voices. It's that I'm not interested in hearing the same voice on my program that I

2:38:16.240 --> 2:38:20.400
 could have gotten than somebody else's. And I haven't solved that well. So I've learned that I need

2:38:20.400 --> 2:38:26.240
 a new conversational technique where I can keep somebody from finding their comfortable place

2:38:27.200 --> 2:38:31.840
 and yet not be the voice talking over that person. Yeah, it's funny. I get in a sense like your

2:38:31.840 --> 2:38:39.600
 conversation with Brett, I can sense you detect that the line he's going under down is, you know

2:38:39.600 --> 2:38:44.640
 how it's going to end. And you know, you think it's a useless line. So you'll just stop it right

2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:49.280
 there and you take them into the direction that you think it should go. But that requires interruption.

2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:54.000
 Well, and it does so far. I haven't found a better way. I'm looking for a better way. It's not,

2:38:54.000 --> 2:39:00.720
 it's not like I don't hear the problem. I do hear the problem. I just, I haven't solved the problem.

2:39:01.360 --> 2:39:08.000
 And, you know, on the, on the Brett episode, I was insufferable. It was very difficult to

2:39:08.000 --> 2:39:13.760
 listen to. It was so overbearing. But on the other hand, I was right. You know, it's like funny.

2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:19.680
 You keep saying that, but I didn't find it, maybe because I heard brothers, like I heard a big

2:39:19.680 --> 2:39:24.240
 brother. Yeah, it was pretty bad. Really? I think so. I didn't think it was bad at all. Well,

2:39:24.240 --> 2:39:28.400
 a lot of people found it insufferable. Interesting. And I think it also has to do with the fact that

2:39:29.520 --> 2:39:33.200
 this has become a frequent experience. I have several shows where somebody who I very much

2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:39.200
 admire and think of as courageous, you know, I'm talking with them, maybe we're friends,

2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:45.440
 and they sit down on the show and they immediately become this fake person. Like two seconds in,

2:39:45.440 --> 2:39:50.160
 they're, they're sort of saying, well, I don't want to be too critical or too harsh. I don't want

2:39:50.160 --> 2:39:54.640
 to name any names. I don't want to this. Don't want, he's like, okay, I'm going to put my listeners

2:39:54.640 --> 2:40:01.280
 through three hours of you being sweetness and light. Yeah. Like at least give me some

2:40:02.080 --> 2:40:08.560
 reality and then we can decide to shelve the show and never let it hear, you know, the call of

2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:12.880
 freedom in the, in the bigger world. But I've seen you break out of that a few times. I've

2:40:12.880 --> 2:40:16.880
 seen you be successful with it. I forgot to guess, but she was dressed with

2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:24.160
 where you at the end of the episode, you had to nod your head about Brett.

2:40:25.200 --> 2:40:30.000
 Agnes Collar. Agnes Collar, the philosopher at the University of Chicago.

2:40:30.000 --> 2:40:37.280
 Yeah. You've continuously broken out of her. You guys went, you know, you didn't seem pretty genuine.

2:40:37.280 --> 2:40:42.160
 And I like her. I'm completely ethically opposed to what she's ethically for.

2:40:43.200 --> 2:40:47.440
 Well, she was great. And she wasn't like, you're both going hard.

2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:48.720
 She's a grown up. Yeah, exactly.

2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:50.960
 And she doesn't like care about her. So she's awesome. Yeah.

2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:55.120
 But you're saying that some people are difficult to break out.

2:40:55.120 --> 2:40:59.600
 Well, it's just that, you know, she was bringing the courage of her conviction.

2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:02.640
 She was sort of defending the system. And I thought, wow,

2:41:04.000 --> 2:41:05.920
 that's a pretty indefensible system that you're,

2:41:05.920 --> 2:41:07.600
 but that's great though. She's doing that, isn't it?

2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:10.080
 I mean, it made for an awesome.

2:41:11.360 --> 2:41:14.240
 It's very informative for the world. Yes.

2:41:14.240 --> 2:41:15.680
 You just hated.

2:41:15.680 --> 2:41:18.480
 I just can't stand the idea that somebody says, well,

2:41:18.480 --> 2:41:21.680
 we don't care who gets paid or who gets the credit as long as we get the goodies,

2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:24.160
 because that seems like insane.

2:41:24.160 --> 2:41:28.000
 Have you ever been afraid leading into a conversation?

2:41:30.560 --> 2:41:31.440
 Gary Kasparov.

2:41:31.440 --> 2:41:38.880
 Really? By the way, I mean, I know I'm just a fan taking requests.

2:41:38.880 --> 2:41:41.120
 But I started, I started the beginning in Russian.

2:41:41.120 --> 2:41:45.200
 And in fact, I used one word incorrectly. Is that terrible?

2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:47.280
 You know, it was, it was pretty good. It's pretty good Russian.

2:41:47.280 --> 2:41:50.560
 What was terrible is I think he complimented you, right? No.

2:41:50.560 --> 2:41:52.080
 Did he compliment you? He was like me.

2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:54.640
 Did he compliment you on your Russian?

2:41:54.640 --> 2:41:57.120
 Well, he said almost perfect Russian.

2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:01.760
 Yeah, like he was full shit. That was, that was not great Russian.

2:42:01.760 --> 2:42:02.880
 But that was not great Russian.

2:42:02.880 --> 2:42:04.320
 Yeah, that was great. That was hard.

2:42:04.320 --> 2:42:07.040
 That was, you tried hard, which is what matters.

2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:08.720
 That is so insulting.

2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:11.760
 I hope so. But I do hope you continue.

2:42:11.760 --> 2:42:14.080
 I felt like, I don't know how long it went.

2:42:14.080 --> 2:42:15.760
 It might have been like a two hour conversation,

2:42:15.760 --> 2:42:18.400
 but it felt, I hope it continues.

2:42:18.400 --> 2:42:21.200
 Like I feel like you have many conversations with Gary.

2:42:21.200 --> 2:42:23.440
 Yeah. I would love to hear.

2:42:23.440 --> 2:42:25.440
 There's certain conversation I would just love to hear.

2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:28.320
 Well, it's just, you know, he's coming from a very,

2:42:29.600 --> 2:42:33.680
 it's this issue about needing to overpower people in a very dangerous world.

2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:35.280
 And so Gary has that need.

2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:39.040
 Yeah, he wasn't, he was interrupting you.

2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:40.320
 Sure. It's an interesting dynamic.

2:42:41.040 --> 2:42:42.960
 It was, it was an interesting dynamic.

2:42:42.960 --> 2:42:44.160
 Two Weinstein's going on.

2:42:44.160 --> 2:42:47.520
 Two, I mean, two powerhouse egos, brilliant.

2:42:47.520 --> 2:42:49.120
 No, you just don't say egos.

2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:49.840
 Mines.

2:42:49.840 --> 2:42:50.080
 Mines.

2:42:50.080 --> 2:42:50.800
 Spirits.

2:42:50.800 --> 2:42:52.160
 Mines. You don't have an ego.

2:42:52.160 --> 2:42:53.680
 You're the most humble person I know.

2:42:54.320 --> 2:42:55.200
 Is that true?

2:42:55.200 --> 2:42:56.720
 No, that's a complete lie.

2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:01.360
 Do you think about your own mortality death?

2:43:01.360 --> 2:43:01.600
 Sure.

2:43:02.160 --> 2:43:02.880
 Are you afraid?

2:43:03.520 --> 2:43:07.520
 Well, I released a theory during something that can kill older people.

2:43:07.520 --> 2:43:07.760
 Sure.

2:43:09.600 --> 2:43:12.400
 Oh, is there a little bit of a parallel there?

2:43:12.400 --> 2:43:13.280
 Of course, of course.

2:43:13.280 --> 2:43:14.400
 I don't want it to die with me.

2:43:16.560 --> 2:43:18.160
 What do you hope your legacy is?

2:43:18.160 --> 2:43:24.160
 Oh, I hope my legacy is accurate.

2:43:28.720 --> 2:43:31.360
 I'd like to write on my accomplishments rather than

2:43:31.360 --> 2:43:34.000
 how my community decided to ding me while I was alive.

2:43:34.000 --> 2:43:34.880
 That would be great.

2:43:34.880 --> 2:43:37.280
 What about if it was significantly exaggerated?

2:43:38.080 --> 2:43:38.720
 I don't want it.

2:43:39.600 --> 2:43:40.640
 You want it to be accurate?

2:43:42.480 --> 2:43:44.960
 I've got some pretty terrific stuff.

2:43:44.960 --> 2:43:46.960
 And whether it works out or doesn't,

2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:50.000
 that I would like it to reflect what I actually was.

2:43:52.800 --> 2:43:53.920
 I'll settle for accurate.

2:43:56.240 --> 2:44:00.000
 What would you say, what is the greatest element of

2:44:01.360 --> 2:44:04.240
 Erich Weinstein's accomplishment in life,

2:44:06.480 --> 2:44:07.600
 in terms of being accurate?

2:44:07.600 --> 2:44:10.240
 Like, what are you most proud of?

2:44:10.240 --> 2:44:14.160
 Trying.

2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:22.080
 The idea that we were stalled out in the hardest field

2:44:23.040 --> 2:44:30.480
 at the most difficult juncture, and then I didn't listen to that voice

2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:34.320
 ever that said, stop.

2:44:35.040 --> 2:44:35.920
 You're hurting yourself.

2:44:35.920 --> 2:44:36.720
 You're hurting your family.

2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:37.440
 You're hurting everybody.

2:44:37.440 --> 2:44:38.560
 You're embarrassing yourself.

2:44:38.560 --> 2:44:39.760
 You're screwing up.

2:44:39.760 --> 2:44:40.720
 You can't do this.

2:44:40.720 --> 2:44:41.520
 You're a failure.

2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:42.240
 You're a fraud.

2:44:43.280 --> 2:44:44.160
 Turn back.

2:44:44.160 --> 2:44:44.880
 Save yourself.

2:44:46.240 --> 2:44:51.440
 Like that voice, I didn't ultimately listen to it,

2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:55.840
 and it was going for 35, 37 years.

2:44:58.480 --> 2:44:59.120
 Very hard.

2:45:02.160 --> 2:45:05.120
 And I hope you never listen to that voice.

2:45:05.840 --> 2:45:07.440
 That's why you're an inspiration.

2:45:07.440 --> 2:45:08.240
 Thank you.

2:45:08.240 --> 2:45:09.360
 I appreciate that.

2:45:09.360 --> 2:45:15.440
 You're the, I'm just infinitely honored that you would spend time with me.

2:45:15.440 --> 2:45:21.120
 You've been a mentor to me, almost a friend.

2:45:21.120 --> 2:45:23.440
 I can't imagine a better person to talk to in this world,

2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:24.800
 so thank you so much for talking to me.

2:45:24.800 --> 2:45:26.160
 I can't wait till we do it again.

2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:27.840
 Lex, thanks for sticking with me,

2:45:27.840 --> 2:45:32.960
 and thanks for being the most singular guy in the podcasting space.

2:45:32.960 --> 2:45:34.640
 In terms of all of my interviews,

2:45:34.640 --> 2:45:36.720
 I would say that the last one I did with you,

2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:42.080
 many people feel was my best, and it was a nonconventional one.

2:45:43.600 --> 2:45:45.360
 So whatever it is that you're bringing to the game,

2:45:45.360 --> 2:45:47.200
 I think everyone's noticing, and keep at it.

2:45:47.200 --> 2:46:13.920
 And now, let me leave you with some words of wisdom

2:46:13.920 --> 2:46:17.200
 from Eric Weinstein's first appearance on this podcast.

2:46:18.640 --> 2:46:22.320
 Everything is great about war, except all the destruction.

2:46:22.320 --> 2:46:42.960
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
