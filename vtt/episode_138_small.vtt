00:00.000 --> 00:05.600
 The following is a conversation with Iran Brook, one of the best known objectivist philosophers

00:05.600 --> 00:11.760
 and thinkers in the world. Objectivism is the philosophical system developed by Ayn Rand that

00:11.760 --> 00:17.440
 she first expressed in her fiction books, The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, and later

00:17.440 --> 00:23.600
 in nonfiction essays and books. Yaron is the current chairman of the board at the Ayn Rand

00:23.600 --> 00:31.680
 Institute, host of the Yaron Brook show, and the coauthor of Free Market Revolution, Equal is Unfair,

00:31.680 --> 00:38.000
 and several other books where he analyzes systems of government, human behavior, and the human

00:38.000 --> 00:43.760
 condition from the perspective of objectivism. Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by

01:09.120 --> 01:15.360
 first read Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead early in college, along with many other literary

01:15.360 --> 01:23.200
 and philosophical works from Nietzsche, Heidegger, Kant, Locke, Foucault, Wittgenstein, and of course,

01:23.200 --> 01:29.760
 all the great existentialists, from Kierkegaard to Camus. I always had an open mind, curious to

01:29.760 --> 01:36.800
 learn and explore the ideas of thinkers throughout history, no matter how mundane or radical or

01:36.800 --> 01:44.400
 even dangerous they were considered to be. Ayn Rand was, and I think still is, a divisive figure.

01:44.400 --> 01:50.960
 Some people love her, some people dislike or even dismiss her. I prefer to look past what some may

01:50.960 --> 01:57.760
 consider to be the flaws of the person and consider with an open mind the ideas she presents,

01:57.760 --> 02:04.080
 and Yaron now describes and applies in his philosophical discussions. In general, I hope

02:04.080 --> 02:10.160
 that you will be patient and understanding as I venture out across the space of ideas and the

02:10.160 --> 02:16.240
 ever widening Orverton window, pulling at the thread of curiosity, sometimes saying stupid

02:16.240 --> 02:22.320
 things, but always striving to understand how we can better build a better world together.

02:33.520 --> 02:41.200
 And now, here's my conversation with Yaron Rook. Let me ask the biggest possible question

02:41.760 --> 02:45.920
 first. Sure. What are the principles of a life well lived?

02:47.120 --> 02:56.080
 I think it's to live with thought, that is, to live a rational life, to think it through. I think

02:56.080 --> 03:01.920
 so many people, in a sense, zombies out there, they're alive, but they're not really alive because

03:01.920 --> 03:08.560
 their mind is not focused. Their mind is not focused on what do I need to do in order to live a

03:08.560 --> 03:15.920
 great life. So too many people just go through the motions of living rather than really embrace life.

03:16.640 --> 03:23.600
 So I think the secret to living a great life is to take it seriously. And what it means to take

03:23.600 --> 03:28.480
 it seriously is to use the one tool that makes us human, the one tool that provides us with all the

03:28.480 --> 03:35.680
 values that we have, our mind, our reason, and to use it, apply it to living. People apply it to

03:35.680 --> 03:42.480
 their work. They apply it to their math problems, to science, to programming. But imagine if they

03:42.480 --> 03:47.840
 use that same energy, that same focus, that same concentration to actually living life and choosing

03:47.840 --> 03:55.200
 values that they should pursue, that would change the world. And it would change their lives.

03:55.200 --> 04:02.640
 Yeah, actually, you know, I wear the silly suit and tie. It symbolizes, to me always, it makes me

04:02.640 --> 04:09.280
 feel like I'm taking the moment really seriously. I think that's really, that's right. And each one

04:09.280 --> 04:16.160
 of us has different ways to kind of condition our consciousness. I'm serious now. And for you,

04:16.160 --> 04:21.120
 it's a suit and tie. It's a conditioning of your consciousness too. Now I'm focused. Now I'm at

04:21.120 --> 04:27.920
 work. Now I'm doing my thing. And I think that's, that's terrific. And I wish everybody took that.

04:27.920 --> 04:33.360
 Look, I mean, it's a cliche, but we only live once. Every minute of your life, you never can

04:33.360 --> 04:40.880
 ever live again. This is really valuable. And when people, people don't have that deep respect

04:40.880 --> 04:47.840
 for their own life or their own time for their own mind. And if they did, again, you know,

04:47.840 --> 04:52.000
 one could only imagine, look at how productive people are, look at the amazing things they

04:52.000 --> 04:57.600
 produce and they do in their work. And if they apply that to everything, wow.

04:58.320 --> 05:07.360
 So you kind of talk about reason. Where does the kind of existentialist idea of experience maybe,

05:07.920 --> 05:13.280
 you know, fully experiencing all the moments versus fully thinking through?

05:13.280 --> 05:19.680
 Is there an interesting line to separate the two? Like why such an emphasis on reason

05:20.240 --> 05:25.760
 for life while lived versus just enjoy like experience?

05:25.760 --> 05:32.240
 Well, because I think experience in a sense is the easy part. I'm not saying it's,

05:33.760 --> 05:40.000
 it's how we experience the life that we live. And yes, I'm all with the take time to

05:40.000 --> 05:46.320
 to, to, to value what you value. But I think I don't think that's the problem of people out

05:46.320 --> 05:49.680
 there. I don't think the problem is they're not taking time to appreciate where they are

05:49.680 --> 05:55.040
 and what they do. I think it's that they don't use their mind in this one respect

05:55.760 --> 06:02.160
 in planning their life and thinking about how to live. So the focus is on reason is because

06:02.160 --> 06:06.400
 it's our only source of knowledge. There's no other source of knowledge. We don't know anything

06:06.400 --> 06:13.520
 with, you know, that does not come from our senses and in our mind, the integration of the,

06:13.520 --> 06:17.200
 of the evidence of our senses. Now, we know stuff about ourselves. And I think it's important

06:17.200 --> 06:22.640
 to know oneself through introspection. And I can't consider that part of reasoning is to,

06:22.640 --> 06:29.680
 is to, is to introspect. But I think reason is undervalued, which is funny to say,

06:29.680 --> 06:34.960
 because it's our means of survival. It's how human beings survive. We cannot see this is

06:34.960 --> 06:39.280
 where I disagree with so many scientists and people like Sam Harris, you mentioned Sam Harris

06:39.280 --> 06:48.880
 before the show. We're not programmed to know how to hunt. We're not programmed to do agriculture.

06:48.880 --> 06:54.400
 We're not programmed to build computers and build networks on which we can podcast and do our shows.

06:55.200 --> 07:03.360
 All of that requires effort. It requires focus. It requires energy and it requires will. It

07:03.360 --> 07:10.400
 requires somebody to will it. It requires somebody to choose it. And once you make that choice,

07:11.040 --> 07:16.720
 you have to engage that choice means that you're choosing to engage your reason in discovery,

07:17.440 --> 07:23.840
 in integration, and then in work to change the world in which we live. And, you know,

07:23.840 --> 07:29.920
 human beings had to discover, figure out, solve the problem of hunting, hunting. You know,

07:29.920 --> 07:35.280
 everybody thinks, oh, that's easy. I've seen the movie. But human beings had to figure out

07:35.280 --> 07:40.960
 how to do it, right? You can't run down a bison and bite into it, right? You're not going to

07:40.960 --> 07:45.440
 catch it. You're not going to, you have no fangs to bite into it. You have to build weapons. You

07:45.440 --> 07:50.240
 have to build tools. You have to create traps. You have to have a strategy. All of that requires

07:50.240 --> 07:58.160
 reason. So the most important thing that allows human beings to survive and to thrive in every

07:58.160 --> 08:03.280
 value from the most simple to the most sophisticated, from the most material to, I believe, the most

08:03.280 --> 08:11.920
 spiritual requires thinking. So stopping and appreciating the moment is, is something that I

08:11.920 --> 08:18.080
 think is relatively easy. Once you have a plan, once you've thought it through, once you know what

08:18.080 --> 08:23.680
 your values are, there is a mistake people make, they attain their values and they just, and they

08:23.680 --> 08:28.960
 just, they don't take a moment to savor that and to appreciate that and to even pat themselves on

08:28.960 --> 08:33.520
 the back that they did it, right? But that's not what's screwing up the world. What's screwing

08:33.520 --> 08:37.680
 up the world is that people have the wrong values and they don't think about them and they don't

08:37.680 --> 08:42.400
 really focus on them and they don't have a plan for their own life and how to live it.

08:42.400 --> 08:47.680
 If we look at human nature, you're saying the fundamental big thing that we need to consider

08:47.680 --> 08:56.400
 is our capacity, like a capability to reason. So to me, reason is this massive evolutionary

08:56.400 --> 09:02.400
 achievement, right? In quotes, right? If you think about any other sophisticated animal,

09:03.200 --> 09:09.120
 everything has to be coded. Everything has to be written in, in the hard way. It has to be there.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.960
 Yeah. And they have to have a solution for the outcome. And if there's no solution,

09:12.960 --> 09:18.400
 the animal dies typically, the animal suffers in some way. Human beings have this capacity,

09:18.400 --> 09:25.680
 self program. They have this capacity. It's not, it's not a tabula rasa in the sense that there's

09:25.680 --> 09:30.800
 nothing there. Obviously we have a nature. Obviously our minds, our brains are structured in

09:30.800 --> 09:39.280
 particular way. But given that we have the ability to turn it on or turn it off. We have the ability

09:39.280 --> 09:47.680
 to commit suicide, to reject our nature, to work against our interests, not to use the tool that

09:47.680 --> 09:53.280
 evolution has provided us with, which is this mind, which is reason. So that choice, that

09:53.280 --> 09:59.360
 fundamental choice, you know, Hamlet says it, right? To be or not to be. But to be or not to be

09:59.360 --> 10:05.120
 is to think or not to think, to engage or not to engage, to focus or not to focus.

10:05.120 --> 10:09.760
 You know, in the morning, when you get up, you kind of, you know, you're not, you're not really

10:09.760 --> 10:14.800
 completely there. You're kind of out of focus and stuff. It requires an act of will to say,

10:14.800 --> 10:20.640
 okay, I'm awake. I've got stuff to do. Some people never do that. Some people live in that haze.

10:21.440 --> 10:26.640
 And they never engage that mind. And when you're, when you're sitting and try to solve a complex

10:26.640 --> 10:33.200
 computer problem or math problem, you have to turn something on. You have to, in a sense,

10:33.200 --> 10:41.040
 it exerts certain energy to focus on the problem, to do it. And that is not determined in a sense

10:41.040 --> 10:46.000
 that you have to focus. You choose to focus and you could choose not to focus.

10:46.000 --> 10:51.520
 And that choice is more powerful than any other, like parts of our brain that we've borrowed from

10:51.520 --> 10:57.920
 fish and from our evolutionary origins, like this, whatever this crazy little leap in evolution is

10:57.920 --> 11:03.120
 that allowed us to think is more powerful than anything else. So I think neuroscientists

11:04.240 --> 11:06.720
 pretend they know a lot more about the brain than they really do.

11:08.960 --> 11:16.400
 And that we know, and we don't know that much yet about how the brain functions and what's

11:16.400 --> 11:22.880
 efficient, you know, all this stuff. So I think what, what exists there is a lot of potentialities.

11:22.880 --> 11:30.960
 But the beauty of the human brain is it's, it's potentialities that we have to manifest through

11:30.960 --> 11:37.040
 our choices. It's there, it's sitting there. And yes, there's certain things that can evoke

11:38.000 --> 11:44.560
 certain senses, certain feelings. I'm not even saying emotions, because I think emotions are

11:44.560 --> 11:49.840
 too complex to have been programmed into our mind. But I don't think so. You know,

11:49.840 --> 11:54.320
 there's this big issue of evolutionary psychology is huge right now. And it's a big issue.

11:55.600 --> 12:05.280
 You know, I find it, to a large extent, as way too early and in storytelling about expo

12:05.280 --> 12:10.960
 storytelling about, about stuff, we still don't, you know, so for example, I would like to say

12:10.960 --> 12:18.080
 for evolutionary psychology, differentiate between things like inclinations, feelings,

12:18.080 --> 12:26.160
 emotions, sensations, thoughts, concepts, ideas. What of those, the programmed and what of those

12:26.160 --> 12:32.800
 are developed and chosen and a product of reason? I think anything from emotion to abstract ideas

12:32.800 --> 12:41.120
 is all chosen is all a product of reason. And everything before that, we might have

12:41.120 --> 12:46.160
 been programmed for. But the fact is, so clearly a sensation is not a product of, you know,

12:46.160 --> 12:53.280
 is something that we feel because that's how our biology works. So until we have these categories,

12:54.080 --> 13:02.080
 and until we can clearly specify what is what and where do they come from, the whole discussion

13:02.080 --> 13:07.120
 in evolutionary psychology seems to be rambling. It doesn't seem to be scientific. So we have to

13:07.120 --> 13:11.440
 define our terms, you know, which is the basis of science, you have to have some, some clear

13:11.440 --> 13:17.200
 definitions about what we're talking about. When you ask them these questions, there's never really

13:17.200 --> 13:22.640
 a coherent answer about what is it exactly. And everybody is afraid of the issue of free will.

13:22.640 --> 13:27.760
 And I think, I think to some extent, I mean, Harris has this, and I don't want to misrepresent

13:27.760 --> 13:33.680
 anything Harris has, because I, you know, I'm a fan and I like a lot of his stuff. But on the one

13:33.680 --> 13:39.520
 hand, he is obviously intellectually active and wants to change our minds. So he believes that

13:39.520 --> 13:44.720
 we have some capacity to choose. On the other hand, he's undermining that capacity to choose by

13:44.720 --> 13:48.560
 saying it's just determined, so you're going to choose what you choose. You have no say in it,

13:48.560 --> 13:55.760
 there's actually no you. So it's, you know, so the, and that's to me completely unscientific,

13:55.760 --> 14:01.920
 that's completely him, you know, pulling it out of nowhere, we all experience the fact that we have

14:01.920 --> 14:08.160
 an eye. That kind of certainty saying that we do not have that fundamental choice that reason

14:08.160 --> 14:14.080
 provides is unfounded currently. Look, there's a sense in which it can never be

14:14.880 --> 14:21.840
 contradicted, because it's a product of your experience. It's not a product of your experience,

14:21.840 --> 14:28.000
 you can experience it directly. So no science will ever prove that this table isn't here.

14:28.960 --> 14:35.200
 I can see it, it's here, right? I can feel it. I know I have free will because I can

14:35.200 --> 14:44.720
 introspect it. In a sense, I can see it. I can see myself engaging it. And that is as valid

14:45.520 --> 14:50.640
 as the evidence of my senses. Now, I can't point at it so that you can see the same thing I'm seeing,

14:51.280 --> 14:54.640
 but you can do the same thing in your own consciousness and you can identify the same

14:54.640 --> 15:01.440
 thing. And to deny that in the name of science is to get things upside down. You start with that.

15:01.440 --> 15:06.640
 And that's the beginning of science. The beginning of science is the identification

15:07.200 --> 15:13.200
 that I choose and that I can reason. And now I need to figure out the mechanism,

15:13.200 --> 15:18.720
 the rules of reasoning, the rules of logic, how does this work, and that's where science comes from.

15:19.440 --> 15:24.080
 Of course, it's possible that science, from my place of AI, would be able to,

15:24.080 --> 15:31.920
 if we were able to engineer consciousness or understand, I mean, it's very difficult

15:31.920 --> 15:36.880
 because we're so far away from it now, but understand how the actual mechanism of that

15:36.880 --> 15:41.920
 consciousness emerges. And in fact, this table is not real, that we can determine that

15:44.960 --> 15:50.320
 exactly how our mind constructs the reality that we perceive, then you can start to make

15:50.320 --> 15:55.360
 interesting. But our mind doesn't construct the reality that we perceive. The reality we perceive

15:55.360 --> 16:02.400
 is there. We perceive a reality that exists. Now, we perceive it in particular ways given

16:03.040 --> 16:07.840
 the nature of our senses, right? A bat perceives this table differently, but it's still the same

16:07.840 --> 16:15.600
 table with the same characteristics and the same identity. It's just a matter of we use

16:15.600 --> 16:20.720
 eyes, they use a radar system, they use sound waves to perceive it, but it's still there.

16:20.720 --> 16:26.960
 Existence exists whether we exist or not. And so you could create, I mean, I don't know how,

16:26.960 --> 16:30.880
 and I don't know if it's possible, but let's say you could create a consciousness, right?

16:30.880 --> 16:36.400
 And I suspect that to do that, you would have to use biology, not just electronics,

16:36.960 --> 16:43.120
 but the way outside my expertise. Because consciousness, as far as we know, is a phenomenon

16:43.120 --> 16:47.120
 of life. And you would have to figure out how to create life before you created consciousness,

16:47.120 --> 16:52.720
 I think. But if you did that, then that wouldn't change anything. All it would say is we have

16:52.720 --> 16:57.440
 another conscious being cool. That's great. But it wouldn't change the nature of our

16:57.440 --> 17:02.720
 consciousness. Our consciousness is what it is. But respect. So that's very interesting. I think

17:02.720 --> 17:10.240
 this is a good way to set the table for discussion of objectivism is let me at least

17:10.240 --> 17:15.040
 challenge a thought experiment, which is, I don't know if you're familiar with Donald

17:15.040 --> 17:22.000
 Hoffman's work about reality. So his idea is that we're just our perception is just an interface

17:22.000 --> 17:27.760
 to reality. So Donald Hoffman is the is the guy you see, Irvine? Yeah. Yes, I've met Donald,

17:27.760 --> 17:33.280
 and I've seen his video. And look, Donald is not invented anything new. This goes back to ancient

17:33.280 --> 17:39.120
 philosophy. Let me just stating. Yes. In case people aren't familiar. I mean, it's a fascinating

17:39.120 --> 17:44.400
 thought experiment to me, like out of the box thinking, perhaps literally, is that,

17:45.680 --> 17:50.560
 you know, there's a different there's a gap between the world as we perceive it and the

17:50.560 --> 17:56.080
 world as it actually exists. And I think that's for the philosophy of objectivism is a really

17:56.080 --> 18:03.680
 important gap to close. So can you maybe at least try to entertain the idea that

18:03.680 --> 18:12.400
 that there is more to reality than our minds can perceive? Well, I don't understand what more means,

18:12.400 --> 18:17.760
 right? Of course, there's more to reality than what our senses perceive. That is, for example,

18:18.640 --> 18:25.440
 I don't know, certain certain elements have radiation, right? Uranium has ready. I can't

18:25.440 --> 18:32.960
 perceive radiation. The beauty of human reason is I can, I can through experimentation discover

18:32.960 --> 18:38.080
 the phenomena of radiation, then actually measure radiation. And I don't worry about it. I can't

18:38.080 --> 18:41.760
 perceive the world the way a bat perceives the world. And I might not be able to see certain

18:41.760 --> 18:47.680
 things that, but I can, we've created radar. So a way understand how a bat perceives the world.

18:47.680 --> 18:53.920
 And I can mimic it through a radar screen and create an images like the bat. It's consciousness

18:53.920 --> 19:01.200
 somehow perceives it, right? So the beauty of human reason is our capacity to understand the

19:01.200 --> 19:07.760
 world beyond what our senses give us directly. At the end, everything comes in through our senses,

19:07.760 --> 19:12.800
 but we can understand things that our senses don't provide us. But what he's doing is he's

19:12.800 --> 19:18.640
 doing something very different. He is saying what our senses provides us might have nothing to do

19:18.640 --> 19:26.640
 with the reality out there. That is just a random arbitrary nonsensical statement. And he actually

19:26.640 --> 19:31.680
 has a whole evolutionary explanation for it. He runs some simulations, the simulations seem,

19:31.680 --> 19:36.720
 I mean, I'm not an expert in this field, but they seem silly to me. They don't seem to reflect.

19:36.720 --> 19:42.640
 And look, all he's doing is taking Immanuel Kant's philosophy, which articulate exactly the same

19:42.640 --> 19:50.480
 cause. And he's giving it a venue of evolutionary ideas. I'm not an expert in evolution and I'm

19:50.480 --> 19:57.840
 an unexplored on epistemology, which is what this is. So to me, as a semi layman, it doesn't make

19:57.840 --> 20:04.560
 any sense. And you know, I'm actually, you know, I have this year on book show. I don't know if

20:04.560 --> 20:09.120
 I'm allowed to pitch it, but I've got this year on book show. Let me pause on YouTube. I'm a huge fan.

20:10.960 --> 20:18.800
 I listen to it very often as a small aside. The cool thing about reason, which you practice,

20:18.800 --> 20:26.720
 is you have a systematic way of thinking through basically anything. And that's so fun to listen

20:26.720 --> 20:34.800
 to. I mean, it's rare that I think there's flaws in your logic, but even then it's fun. Cause I'm

20:34.800 --> 20:39.680
 like disagreeing with the screen. And it's great when somebody disagrees with me and they give

20:39.680 --> 20:45.680
 good arguments because that makes it challenging. So one of the shows I want to do in the next few

20:45.680 --> 20:50.800
 weeks is one of my philosophers, bring one of my philosopher friends to discuss the video that

20:50.800 --> 20:59.120
 Hoffman, where he presents his theory, because it surprises me how seductive it is. And it seems to

20:59.120 --> 21:05.120
 be so, first of all, completely counterintuitive, but because, you know, somehow we managed to

21:05.120 --> 21:09.920
 cross the road and not get hit by the car. And if our sensors did not provide us any information

21:09.920 --> 21:15.840
 about what's actually going on in reality, how do we do that? And not to mention build computers,

21:15.840 --> 21:20.400
 not to mention flight to the moon and actually land on the moon. And if reality is not giving us

21:20.400 --> 21:24.400
 information about the moon, if our sensors are not giving us information about the moon,

21:24.400 --> 21:28.000
 how did we get there? You know, and where did we go? Maybe we didn't go anyway.

21:28.720 --> 21:36.240
 It's just, it's nonsensical to me. And it's a very bad place philosophically,

21:36.240 --> 21:41.440
 because it basically says there is no objective standard for anything. There's no objective

21:41.440 --> 21:45.920
 reality. You can come up with anything, you could argue anything, and there's no methodology, right?

21:45.920 --> 21:50.720
 My I believe that at the end of the day, what reason allows us to do is provides us with a

21:50.720 --> 21:55.600
 methodology for truth. And at the end of the day, for every claim that I make, I should be able to

21:56.560 --> 22:03.760
 boil it down to C. Yeah, look, the evidence of the senses is right then once you take that away,

22:03.760 --> 22:09.520
 knowledge is gone. And truth is gone. And that opens it up to, you know, complete disaster.

22:09.520 --> 22:16.400
 So, you know, to me, why it's compelling to at least entertain this idea, first of all,

22:16.400 --> 22:24.800
 it shakes up the mind a little bit to force you to go back to first principles and, you know,

22:24.800 --> 22:30.560
 ask the question, what do I really know? And the second part of that that I really enjoy

22:30.560 --> 22:38.640
 is it's a reminder that we know very little to be a little bit more humble. So if reality doesn't

22:38.640 --> 22:46.240
 exist at all, is before you start thinking about it, I think it's a really nice wake up call to

22:46.240 --> 22:53.360
 think wait a minute. I don't really know much about this universe, that humbleness. I think

22:53.360 --> 23:00.960
 something I'd like to ask you about in terms of reason, when you you can become very confident in

23:00.960 --> 23:06.160
 your ability to understand the world, if you practice reason often, and I feel like it can

23:06.160 --> 23:14.240
 lead you astray, because you can start to think it's so I love psychology. And psychologists have

23:14.240 --> 23:19.600
 the certainty about understanding the human condition, which is undeserved. You know,

23:19.600 --> 23:24.560
 you run a study with 50 people, and you think you can understand the source of all these

23:24.560 --> 23:29.520
 psychiatric disorders, all these kinds of things. That's similar kind of trouble. I feel like you

23:29.520 --> 23:36.640
 can get into when you overreach with reason. So I don't think there is such a thing as

23:36.640 --> 23:41.520
 overreaching with reason, but there are bad applications of reason. They're bad uses of

23:41.520 --> 23:46.640
 reason or the pretense of using reason. I think a lot of these psychological studies

23:46.640 --> 23:52.000
 are pretense of using reason. And these psychologists have never really taken a serious stat class,

23:52.000 --> 23:56.320
 or a serious econometrics class, or they use statistics in weird ways. They just don't make

23:56.320 --> 24:04.160
 any sense. And that's not reason. That's just bad thinking. So I don't think you can do too much

24:04.160 --> 24:11.760
 good thinking. And that's what reason is. It's good thinking. Now, the fact that you

24:11.760 --> 24:18.320
 try to use reason does not guarantee you won't make mistakes. It doesn't guarantee you won't be

24:18.320 --> 24:24.720
 wrong. It doesn't guarantee you won't go down a rabbit hole and completely get it wrong. But it

24:24.720 --> 24:30.240
 does give you the only existing mechanism to fix it, which is going back to reality,

24:30.240 --> 24:35.040
 going back to facts, going back to reason, and getting out of the rabbit hole and getting

24:35.040 --> 24:41.840
 out back to reality. So I agree with you that it's interesting to think about these,

24:42.960 --> 24:48.320
 what I consider crazy ideas, because it, oh wait, what is my argument about them? If I don't really

24:48.320 --> 24:52.960
 have a good argument about them, then do I know what I know? So in that sense, it's always nice

24:52.960 --> 24:58.720
 to be challenged and pushed. And you know, the nice thing about objectivism is everybody's

24:58.720 --> 25:03.200
 doing that to me all the time, right? Because nobody agrees with me on anything. So I'm constantly

25:03.200 --> 25:08.560
 being challenged, whether it's by Hoffman on metaphysics and epistemology, right, on the

25:08.560 --> 25:14.160
 very foundations of analogy and ethics, everybody constantly, and in politics all the time. So

25:16.080 --> 25:20.720
 I find that it's part of, you know, I prefer that everybody, there's a sense in which I prefer

25:20.720 --> 25:24.800
 that everybody agreed with me, right? Because I think we live in a better world. But there's a

25:24.800 --> 25:30.400
 sense in which that disagreement makes it, at least up to a point, makes it interesting and

25:30.400 --> 25:37.840
 challenging and forces you to be able to rethink or to confirm your own thinking and to challenge

25:37.840 --> 25:44.640
 their thinking. Can you try to do the impossible task and give a whirlwind introduction to

25:44.640 --> 25:52.720
 Ayn Rand, the many sides of Ayn Rand? So Ayn Rand, the human being, Ayn Rand, the novelist,

25:52.720 --> 26:02.480
 and Ayn Rand, the philosopher. So who was Ayn Rand? Sure. So her life story is one that I

26:02.480 --> 26:08.160
 think is fascinating, but it also lends itself to this integration of all of these things.

26:08.720 --> 26:16.320
 She was born in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905, to kind of a middle class family, Jewish family,

26:16.320 --> 26:25.200
 they owned a pharmacy, her father owned a pharmacy. And, you know, she grew up, she grew up, she was

26:25.200 --> 26:31.280
 a very, she knew what she wanted to do and what she wanted to be from a very young age. I think

26:31.280 --> 26:35.120
 from the age of nine, she knew she wanted to be a writer. She wanted to write stories. That was

26:35.120 --> 26:43.040
 the thing she wanted to do. And, you know, she focused her life after that on this goal of I

26:43.040 --> 26:49.840
 want to be a novelist, I want to write. And the philosophy was incidental to that, in a sense,

26:49.840 --> 26:55.920
 at least until some point in her life. She witnessed the Russian revolution. Literally,

26:55.920 --> 27:02.240
 it happened outside. They lived in St. Petersburg, where the first kind of demonstrations and of

27:02.240 --> 27:08.640
 the revolution happened. So she witnessed it. She lived through it as a teenager, went to school

27:08.640 --> 27:16.960
 under the Soviets. For a while, they were under kind of the, on the Black Sea, where the opposition

27:16.960 --> 27:21.280
 government was ruling, and then they would go back and forth between the communes and the whites.

27:21.280 --> 27:26.560
 But she experienced what communism was like. She saw the pharmacy being taken away from a family.

27:26.560 --> 27:31.040
 She saw their apartment being taken away or other families being brought into the

27:31.040 --> 27:39.760
 apartment they already lived in. And it was very clear, given her nature, given her views,

27:39.760 --> 27:45.760
 even at a very young age, that she would not survive the system. So a lot of effort was put

27:45.760 --> 27:50.320
 into how do we get, how does she get out? And her family was really helpful in this.

27:51.040 --> 27:56.240
 And she had a cousin in, a cousin in Chicago, and she had been studying kind of film

27:56.240 --> 28:05.680
 at the university. And this is in her 20s? This is in her 20s, early 20s. And Lenin, there was a

28:05.680 --> 28:12.800
 small window where Lenin was allowing some people to leave under certain circumstances. And she

28:12.800 --> 28:18.240
 managed to get out to go do research on film in the United States. Everybody knew, everybody who

28:18.240 --> 28:23.280
 knew her knew she would never come back. That this was a one way ticket. And she got out,

28:23.280 --> 28:27.920
 she made it to Chicago, spent a few weeks in Chicago, and then headed to Hollywood.

28:28.720 --> 28:36.960
 She wanted to write scripts. That was the goal. Here's this short woman from Russia with a strong

28:36.960 --> 28:43.440
 accent, learning English, showing up in Hollywood. And I want to be a script writer.

28:43.440 --> 28:51.040
 In English. In English, writing in English. And this is kind of one of these fairy tale stories,

28:51.040 --> 28:58.240
 but it's true. She shows up at the Cecil B. DeMille studios. And she has a letter of introduction

28:58.240 --> 29:05.040
 from her cousin in Chicago, who owns a movie theater. And this is in the 19, the late 1920s.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.680
 And she shows up there with this letter and they say, you know, don't call us, we'll call you kind

29:09.680 --> 29:16.880
 of thing. Right. And she steps out. And there's this massive convertible. And in the convertible

29:16.880 --> 29:21.360
 is Cecil B. DeMille. And he's driving slowly past her right at the entrance of the studio.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.640
 And she stares at him and he stops the car and he says, you know, why are you staring at me?

29:25.600 --> 29:29.360
 And she says, you know, she tells him a story for Russia and you know, I want to want to make it

29:29.360 --> 29:33.280
 in the movies. I want to be a script writer one day. And he says, well, if you want to, if you

29:33.280 --> 29:38.400
 want that, you don't get in the car. She gets in the car and he takes her to the back lot of his

29:38.400 --> 29:44.000
 studio where they're filming The King of Kings, the story of Jesus. And he says he has a pass for

29:44.000 --> 29:48.320
 a week. If you want to be, if you want to write for the movies, you better know how movies are made.

29:49.600 --> 29:53.840
 And she basically spends a week and then she spends more time there. She manages to get an

29:53.840 --> 29:58.320
 extension. She lands up being an extra in the movie. So you can see my man there. And

29:59.200 --> 30:05.520
 it's one of the masses when Jesus is walking by. And she meets her future husband on the set

30:05.520 --> 30:10.800
 of The King of Kings. She lands up getting married, getting her American citizenship that way.

30:10.800 --> 30:17.360
 And she lands up doing odds and ends jobs in Hollywood, living in a tiny little apartment,

30:19.360 --> 30:23.840
 somehow making a living. Her husband was an actor. He was, you know, struggling actors

30:23.840 --> 30:29.920
 were difficult times. And in the evenings, studying English, writing, writing, writing,

30:29.920 --> 30:34.560
 writing and studying and studying and studying. And she finally makes it by writing a play

30:34.560 --> 30:44.800
 that is successful in, in LA and ultimately goes to Broadway. And she writes her first

30:44.800 --> 30:50.720
 novel is a novel called We the Living, which is the most autobiographical of all her novels.

30:50.720 --> 30:58.000
 It's about a young woman in the Soviet Union. It's a powerful story, a very moving story,

30:58.000 --> 31:04.880
 and probably, if not the best, one of the best portrayals of life under communism.

31:04.880 --> 31:06.400
 So you would recommend the book.

31:06.400 --> 31:10.240
 Definitely recommend We the Living. It's her first, first novel. She wrote in the 30s.

31:11.200 --> 31:18.400
 And it didn't go anywhere. Because if you think about the intelligentsia, the people who

31:18.400 --> 31:25.120
 mattered, the people who wrote book reviews, this is a time of Durante, who's the New York Times guy

31:25.120 --> 31:32.800
 in Moscow who's praising Stalin to the hills and the success. So the novel fails, but,

31:32.800 --> 31:37.440
 but she's got a novel out. She writes a small novel let called Anthem. A lot of people have

31:37.440 --> 31:43.520
 read that and it's, it's read in high schools. It's, it's kind of dystopian novel. And it's

31:43.520 --> 31:48.240
 won't, it doesn't get published in the US gets published in the UK. UK is very interested in

31:48.240 --> 31:57.280
 dystopian novels, Animal Farm in 1984. 84 is published a couple of years after, I think,

31:57.280 --> 32:01.200
 after Anthem. There's reason to believe he read, he read Anthem.

32:03.120 --> 32:06.560
 In George Orwell, right? In Animal Farm. Yeah.

32:07.520 --> 32:13.120
 Just the small side, Animal Farm is probably top. I mean, I would, it's weird to say, but I would

32:13.120 --> 32:17.040
 say it's my favorite book. Have you seen this movie out now called Mr. Jones?

32:17.040 --> 32:19.440
 No. Oh, you've got to see Mr. Jones.

32:19.440 --> 32:22.880
 What's Mr. Jones? Sorry for my ignorance.

32:22.880 --> 32:28.080
 No, no, it's a movie. It hasn't got any publicity, which is tragic because it's a really good movie.

32:28.080 --> 32:32.160
 It's both brilliantly made. It's made by a Polish director, but it's in English.

32:32.800 --> 32:38.560
 It's a, it's a true story and, and George Orwell's Animal Farm is featured in it in the sense that

32:38.560 --> 32:46.240
 during the story, George Orwell was writing Animal Farm and, and he's the narrator is reading off

32:46.240 --> 32:49.200
 sections of Animal Farm as the movie is progressing. Yeah.

32:49.200 --> 32:56.080
 And the movie is a true story about the first western journalist to discover and to write

32:56.080 --> 33:01.280
 about the famine in Ukraine. And so he goes to Moscow and then he gets on a train and he finds

33:01.280 --> 33:07.440
 himself in Ukraine and it's, it's, it's beautifully and horrifically made. So the horror of the famine

33:08.320 --> 33:13.520
 is brilliantly conveyed. And then, and it's a true story. It's a very moving story, very powerful

33:13.520 --> 33:19.120
 story. And, and just very well made movie. So it's, it's tragic in my view that not more people

33:19.120 --> 33:24.320
 are seeing it. That's true. I was actually recently just complaining that there's not enough

33:25.120 --> 33:30.240
 content on the, the famine, the thirties of, you know, of, of stuff. There's so much on Hitler.

33:30.240 --> 33:36.640
 Like I love the reading. I'm reading, it's so long. It's been taking me forever. The, the rise and

33:36.640 --> 33:41.920
 falls of Third Reich. Yeah. I love it. I've got the book to compliment that, that you have to read.

33:41.920 --> 33:47.200
 It's called the ominous parallels. It's Leonard Peacock and it's the ominous parallels. And it's

33:47.200 --> 33:55.040
 about, it's about the causes of the rise of, of, of Hitler, but a philosophical causes. So whereas

33:55.040 --> 34:03.600
 the rise and fall is more of a kind of the existential kind of what happened. But really

34:03.600 --> 34:09.440
 delving into the intellectual, intellectual currents that led to the rise of Hitler. And

34:09.440 --> 34:15.680
 maybe highly recommend that. And basically suggesting how it might rise another.

34:15.680 --> 34:20.800
 That's the ominous parallels. So the parallel he draws is to the United States. And he says,

34:20.800 --> 34:25.360
 those same intellectual forces are rising in the United States. And this is, this was published,

34:25.360 --> 34:32.480
 I think in published in 81, 82, it was published in 82. So it's published a long time ago. And yet

34:32.480 --> 34:38.560
 you look around us and it's unbelievably predictive, sadly, about the state of the world.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.280
 So I haven't finished that story. I don't want to, I don't know if you want me to.

34:41.280 --> 34:46.960
 No, no, no. But on that point, I'll have to, let's please return to it. But let's now, for now,

34:46.960 --> 34:50.960
 let's talk. But let me also say just, just because I don't want to forget about Mr. Jones,

34:51.520 --> 34:58.240
 it is true, the point you made, that tons of movies that are anti fascist, anti Nazi.

34:59.120 --> 35:05.360
 And that's good. But they're way too few movies that anti communist, just almost not.

35:05.360 --> 35:09.200
 And it's very interesting. And if you remind me later, I'll tell you a story about that.

35:09.200 --> 35:15.600
 But so she publishes Anthem. And then she starts, and she's doing okay in Hollywood.

35:15.600 --> 35:20.720
 And she's doing okay with, with the play. And then she starts on her, on the book,

35:20.720 --> 35:27.520
 The Fountainhead. And she writes The Fountainhead. And it comes out, she finishes it in 1945.

35:27.520 --> 35:35.200
 And she's, she sends it to publishers. And publisher after publisher after publisher,

35:35.200 --> 35:42.240
 turn it down. And it takes 12 publishers before this, this editor reads it and says,

35:42.240 --> 35:48.080
 I want to publish this book. And he basically tells his bosses, if you don't publish this book,

35:48.800 --> 35:56.320
 I'm leaving. And they don't really believe in the book. So they published just a few copies,

35:56.320 --> 36:00.800
 they don't do a mad look. And the book becomes a bestseller from word of mouth.

36:00.800 --> 36:04.400
 And they land up having to publish more and more and more. And, and it's, you know,

36:04.400 --> 36:09.360
 she's basically gone from this immigrant who comes here with very little command of English,

36:09.920 --> 36:18.160
 and, and to all kinds of odds and ends jobs in Hollywood to, you know, writing one of the

36:18.960 --> 36:25.200
 seminal, I think, book American books, she is an American author. I mean, if you read The Fountainhead,

36:25.200 --> 36:28.480
 it's not Russian. This is not Dostoevsky.

36:28.480 --> 36:35.840
 It feels, it feels like a symbol of what America is in the 20th century. And I mean,

36:35.840 --> 36:42.800
 probably maybe you can, so there's a famous kind of sexual rape scene in there. Is that,

36:42.800 --> 36:47.920
 is that like a lesson you want to throw in some controversial stuff to make your philosophical

36:47.920 --> 36:52.560
 books work out? I mean, is that why, why was it so popular? Do you have a sense?

36:52.560 --> 36:57.280
 Well, because I think it illustrated, first of all, because I think the character is a,

36:58.000 --> 37:03.760
 a fantastic, it's got a real hero. And I think it, the whole book is basically

37:03.760 --> 37:09.280
 illustrating this massive conflict that I think went on in America then is going on today. And

37:09.280 --> 37:15.200
 it goes on in a big scale politics, all the way down to the scale of the choices you make in your

37:15.200 --> 37:22.240
 life. And, and the, the issue is individualism versus collectivism. Should you live for yourself?

37:22.240 --> 37:27.200
 Should you live for your values? Should you pursue your passions? Should you, or should

37:27.200 --> 37:34.080
 you do what your mother tells you? Should you follow your mother's passions? And that's, and it's,

37:34.080 --> 37:42.480
 it's, it's very, very much an individual, a book about individuals and people relate to that.

37:42.480 --> 37:49.440
 But it obviously has this massive implications to the world outside. And at the time of collectivism,

37:49.440 --> 37:56.560
 just having been defeated, communist, well, not fascism and, and, and, and, you know, the United

37:56.560 --> 38:01.920
 States representing individualism, right, as defeated, defeated collectivism. But where

38:01.920 --> 38:07.920
 collectivist ideas are still popular in the form of socialism and communism. And for the individual,

38:07.920 --> 38:11.920
 this constant struggle between what people tell me to do, what society tells me to do,

38:11.920 --> 38:17.360
 what my mother tells me to do, and what I think I should do. I think it's unbelievably appealing,

38:17.360 --> 38:21.280
 particularly to young people who's trying to figure out what they want to do in life,

38:21.280 --> 38:27.120
 trying to figure out what's important in life. It had this enormous appeal, it's romantic,

38:27.120 --> 38:31.680
 it's bigger than life, the characters are big heroes. It's very American in that sense. It's

38:31.680 --> 38:38.720
 about individualism. It's about the triumph of individualism. And so I think that's what related,

38:38.720 --> 38:45.200
 and it had this big romantic element from the, I mean, when I use romantic, I use it kind of in

38:45.200 --> 38:53.040
 the sense of a movement in art. But it also has this romantic element in the sense of a relationship

38:53.040 --> 38:58.240
 between a man and a woman who's, that's very intriguing. It's not only that there's a, I would

38:58.240 --> 39:04.800
 say almost rape scene, right? I would say, but it's also that this woman is hard to understand.

39:04.800 --> 39:09.360
 I mean, I've, I've read it more than once and I still can't quite figure out Dominique, right?

39:09.360 --> 39:13.120
 Because she loves him and she wants to destroy him and she marries other people. I mean,

39:13.120 --> 39:21.600
 think about that too. Here she's writing a book in the 1940s. There's lots of sex. There's a woman

39:21.600 --> 39:27.120
 who marries more than one person, has having sex with more than one person, very unconventional.

39:27.120 --> 39:30.880
 She's having married, she's having sex with work, even though she's not married to work,

39:30.880 --> 39:39.120
 this is 1945. And it's, it's very jarring to people. It's very unexpected, but it's also a book of

39:39.120 --> 39:44.160
 its time. It's about individuals pursuing their passion, pursuing their life and not caring about

39:44.160 --> 39:52.800
 convention and, and what people think, but doing what they think is right. And, and, and so, so I

39:52.800 --> 39:57.760
 think it's, it's, it's, I encourage everybody to read this, obviously. So that was, was that the

39:57.760 --> 40:03.920
 first time she articulated, started, articulated something that sounded like a philosophy of

40:03.920 --> 40:09.840
 individualism? I mean, the philosophy is there in We The Living, right? Because at the end of the day,

40:09.840 --> 40:17.680
 the woman is the hero of We The Living is this individualist stuck in Soviet Union. So she's

40:17.680 --> 40:24.160
 struggling with these things. So the theme is there already. It's not as fleshed out. It's not

40:24.160 --> 40:30.160
 as articulated philosophically. And it's certainly then anthem, which is a dystopian novel, where

40:30.160 --> 40:39.600
 the dystopia in the future has, has, there's no I. Everything is we. And it's about one guy who

40:39.600 --> 40:45.600
 breaks out of that. I don't want to give it away, but, but it breaks out of that. So these themes

40:45.600 --> 40:51.280
 are running. And then we have, and they've been published, some of the early Iron Man stories

40:51.280 --> 40:56.320
 that she was writing in preparation for writing her novel stories, she was writing when she first

40:56.320 --> 41:02.800
 came to America, and you can see these same philosophical elements, even in the male female

41:02.800 --> 41:09.680
 relationships and the passion and the, you know, you, in the conflict, you see them even in those

41:09.680 --> 41:15.360
 early pieces. And she's just developing them. It's same philosophically, she's developing her

41:15.360 --> 41:21.120
 philosophy with her literature. And of course, after the fountainhead, she starts on what turns

41:21.120 --> 41:26.880
 out to be her Magnus Opus, which is Atlas Shrugged, which takes her 12 years to publish by the time,

41:26.880 --> 41:31.200
 of course, she brings that out. Every publisher in New York wants to publish it because the

41:31.200 --> 41:35.760
 fountainhead has been such a huge success. They don't quite understand it. They don't know what

41:35.760 --> 41:40.800
 to do with Atlas Shrugged, but they're eager to get it out there. And indeed, it's when it's

41:40.800 --> 41:45.040
 published, it becomes an instant bestseller. And the thing about the, particularly the

41:45.040 --> 41:50.240
 fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged, but true of even Anthem and Wither Living, she is one of the only

41:51.360 --> 41:57.280
 dead authors that sell more after they've died than when they were alive. Now, you know, that's

41:57.280 --> 42:01.440
 true, maybe music, we listen to more Beethoven than when he was alive, but it's not true typically

42:01.440 --> 42:10.480
 of novelists. And yet here we are, you know, was it 50, you know, 60 years after the 63 years

42:10.480 --> 42:15.600
 after the publication of Atlas Shrugged and it sells probably more today than it sold when

42:15.600 --> 42:20.560
 it was a bestseller when it first came out. Is it true that it's like one of the most

42:20.560 --> 42:27.040
 sold books in history? No. Okay. I've heard this kind of statement. Tom Clancy book comes out,

42:27.040 --> 42:31.600
 sells more than Atlas Shrugged. But I've read it. I've heard statements like this. So there was a

42:31.600 --> 42:37.520
 very, and I shouldn't say this, but it's the truth. I'll say it, a very unscientific study done

42:37.520 --> 42:45.280
 by the Smithsonian Institute, probably in the early 90s, that basically surveyed CEOs

42:46.000 --> 42:52.560
 and asked them, what was the most influential book on you? And Atlas Shrugged came out as number two,

42:53.280 --> 42:58.640
 the second most influential book and CEOs in the country. But there's so many flaws in the study.

42:58.640 --> 43:04.240
 One was, you want to guess what the number one book, Bible, the Bible, but the Bible was like,

43:04.240 --> 43:08.000
 you know, so maybe they surveyed 100 people. I don't know what the exact numbers were,

43:08.000 --> 43:12.880
 but let's say it's 100 people and 60 said the Bible and 10 said Atlas Shrugged and

43:13.440 --> 43:16.640
 there were a bunch of books over it. So, you know, I don't. That's again,

43:16.640 --> 43:21.040
 the psychology discussion we were having. Exactly. Well, and it's one thing I've

43:21.040 --> 43:26.880
 learned and maybe COVID has taught me and nobody, you know, there are very few people

43:26.880 --> 43:33.120
 who know how to do statistics and almost nobody knows how to think probabilistically,

43:33.120 --> 43:37.360
 that is think in terms of probabilities, that it is a skill, it's a hard skill.

43:38.000 --> 43:42.960
 And everybody thinks they know it. I see doctors thinking they're statisticians and giving whole

43:42.960 --> 43:46.800
 analyses of the data on COVID and they don't have a clue what they're talking about,

43:46.800 --> 43:50.160
 not because they're not good doctors, because they're not good statisticians. It's not,

43:51.840 --> 43:55.120
 you know, people think that they have one skill and therefore it translates immediately into

43:55.120 --> 44:03.520
 another skill and it's just not true. So, I've been astounded at how bad people are at that.

44:03.520 --> 44:06.720
 For people who haven't read any of the books that we're just discussing,

44:09.120 --> 44:16.400
 what would you recommend? What book would you recommend they read and maybe also just elaborate

44:17.040 --> 44:21.840
 what mindset should they enter the reading of that book with?

44:21.840 --> 44:28.320
 So, I would recommend everybody read Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and in that order,

44:28.880 --> 44:35.040
 so it would depend on where you are in life, right? So, it depends on who you are and what you

44:35.040 --> 44:39.760
 are. So, Fountainhead is a more personal story. For many people, it's their favorite and for

44:39.760 --> 44:47.760
 many people, it was their first book and they wouldn't replace that, right? If Atlas Shrugged

44:47.760 --> 44:56.080
 is a, it's about the world. It's about what impacts the world, how the world functions, how

44:56.080 --> 45:02.000
 it's a bigger book in the sense of the scope. If you're interested in politics and you're interested

45:02.000 --> 45:07.920
 in the world, read Atlas Shrugged first. If you're mainly focused on your life, your career,

45:07.920 --> 45:11.920
 what you want to do with yourself, start with Fountainhead. I still think you should read both

45:11.920 --> 45:17.680
 because I think they are, I mean, to me, they were life altering and to many, many people,

45:17.680 --> 45:22.080
 they're life altering and you should go into reading them with an open mind, I'd say.

45:22.720 --> 45:29.200
 And with a, put aside everything you've heard about Iron Man, put aside any, even if it's

45:29.200 --> 45:33.920
 true, just put it aside, even what I just said about Iron Man, put it aside. Just read the book

45:33.920 --> 45:43.680
 as a book and let it move you and let, let, let your thoughts, let it shape how you think. And,

45:43.680 --> 45:49.440
 and it'll have, you know, it either have, you'll either have a response to it or you won't. But

45:49.440 --> 45:53.360
 I think most people have a very strong response to it. And then the question is,

45:54.800 --> 45:58.080
 do they, are they willing to respond to the philosophy? Are they willing to integrate

45:58.080 --> 46:02.560
 the philosophy? Are they willing to think through the philosophy or not? Because I know a lot of

46:02.560 --> 46:07.840
 people who completely disagree with the philosophy, philosophy, right here in Hollywood, right? Lots

46:07.840 --> 46:14.880
 of people here in Hollywood love the fountainhead. Interesting. Oliver Stone, who is, I think, a

46:14.880 --> 46:20.000
 avowed Marxist, right? I think he's, I think he's admitted to being a Marxist. He is. His movies

46:20.000 --> 46:28.640
 certainly reflect a Marxist theme. Is a huge fan of the fountainhead and is actually his dream

46:28.640 --> 46:34.880
 project he has set in public. His dream project is to make the fountainhead. Now he would completely

46:34.880 --> 46:40.240
 change it as movie directors do. And he's actually outlined what his script would look like. And

46:40.240 --> 46:46.000
 it would be a disaster for the ideas of the, but he loves the story because to him, the story is

46:46.000 --> 46:51.520
 about autistic integrity. And that's what he catches on. And what he hates about the story is

46:51.520 --> 46:58.560
 the individualism. And I think that his movie ends with Howard Walk joining some kind of commune

46:58.560 --> 47:03.360
 of architects that do it for the love and don't do it for the money. Interesting. But so yeah,

47:03.360 --> 47:08.000
 so you can connect with you without the philosophy. And before we get into the philosophy, staying

47:08.000 --> 47:13.840
 on Iron Rand, I'll tell you sort of my own personal experience. And I think it's one that

47:13.840 --> 47:17.760
 people share. I've experienced this with two people, Iron Rand and Nietzsche.

47:17.760 --> 47:23.040
 Yeah. When I brought up Iron Rand when I was in my early twenties,

47:23.920 --> 47:30.960
 the number of eye rolls I got from sort of, you know, like advisors and so on that

47:33.040 --> 47:38.720
 of dismissal, I've seen that later in life about more, more specific concepts in artificial

47:38.720 --> 47:44.240
 intelligence and technical where people decided this is, this is a set of ideas that are acceptable

47:44.240 --> 47:52.880
 and these sets of ideas are not. And they dismissed Iron Rand without giving me any justification

47:52.880 --> 47:59.200
 of why they dismissed her, except, Oh, that's something you're into when you're

48:00.160 --> 48:04.640
 19 or 20. That's same thing people say about Nietzsche. Well, that's just something you do

48:04.640 --> 48:11.600
 when you're in college and you take an intro to philosophy course. So, and I've never really

48:11.600 --> 48:20.320
 heard anybody cleanly articulate their opposition to Iron Rand in my own private little circles and

48:20.320 --> 48:28.400
 so on. Maybe one question I just want to ask is why is there such an opposition to Iron Rand?

48:28.400 --> 48:34.000
 And maybe another way to ask the same thing is what's misunderstood about Iron Rand.

48:35.120 --> 48:38.800
 So, we haven't talked about the philosophy, so it's hard to answer right now.

48:38.800 --> 48:42.880
 We can return to it if you think that's the right way to go. Well, let me give a broad

48:42.880 --> 48:46.400
 answer and then we'll do the philosophy and then we'll return to it because I think it's

48:46.400 --> 48:54.160
 important to know something about her ideas. I think her philosophy challenges everything.

48:55.520 --> 49:01.440
 It really does. It shakes up the world. It challenges so many of our preconceptions.

49:01.440 --> 49:06.080
 It challenges so many of the things that people take for granted as truth.

49:06.080 --> 49:13.120
 From religion to morality to politics to almost everything, there's never quite been a thinker

49:13.120 --> 49:18.640
 like her in the sense of really challenging everything and doing it systematically and

49:18.640 --> 49:24.080
 having a complete philosophy that is a challenge to everything that has come before her. Now,

49:24.080 --> 49:30.000
 I'm not saying they're on threads that connect. They are in politics. There might be a thread

49:30.000 --> 49:36.880
 in morality that might be thread. But on everything, there's just never been like it. And people are

49:36.880 --> 49:41.600
 afraid of that because it challenges them to the core. She's basically telling you to rethink

49:41.600 --> 49:50.160
 almost everything. And that is that people reject. The other thing that it does, and this goes to

49:50.160 --> 49:56.960
 this point about, oh yeah, that's what you do when you're 14, 15, right? She points out to them

49:56.960 --> 50:05.360
 that they've lost something. They've lost their idealism. They've lost their youthful idealism.

50:06.720 --> 50:12.480
 What makes youthfulness meaningful, other than we're in better physical shape,

50:13.200 --> 50:17.360
 starting to feel because I'm getting older? When we're young,

50:19.360 --> 50:23.360
 sometime in the teen years, there's something that happens to human consciousness.

50:23.360 --> 50:30.000
 We almost awaken anew, right? We suddenly discover that we can think for ourselves.

50:30.640 --> 50:35.040
 We suddenly discover that not everything our parents and our teachers tell us is true.

50:36.000 --> 50:42.560
 We suddenly discover that this tool, our minds, is suddenly available to us to discover the world

50:42.560 --> 50:49.600
 and to discover truth. And it is a time of idealism. It's a time of, whoa, I want to, you know,

50:49.600 --> 50:53.760
 the better teenagers. I want to know about the world. I want to go out there. I don't believe

50:53.760 --> 50:58.720
 my parents. I don't believe my teachers. And this is healthy. This is fantastic. And I want to go out

50:58.720 --> 51:02.400
 there and experiment. And that gets us into trouble, right? We do stupid things when we're

51:02.400 --> 51:07.120
 teenagers. Why? Because we're experimenting. It's the experiential part of it, right? We want to go

51:07.120 --> 51:12.880
 and experience life. But we're learning. It's part of the learning process. And we become risk

51:12.880 --> 51:17.200
 takers because we want to experience. But the risk is something we need to learn because we need

51:17.200 --> 51:21.920
 to learn where the boundaries are. And one of the damages that helicopter parents do is they

51:21.920 --> 51:25.280
 prevent us from taking those risks. So we don't learn about the world and we don't learn about

51:25.280 --> 51:31.200
 where the boundaries are. So the teenage years of these years of wonder, they're depressing when

51:31.200 --> 51:35.280
 you're in them for a variety of reasons, which I think primarily have to do with the culture,

51:35.280 --> 51:44.480
 but also with oneself. But they are exciting, the periods of discovery. And people get excited

51:44.480 --> 51:52.080
 about ideas and good ideas, bad ideas, all kinds of ideas. And then what happens? We settle. We

51:52.080 --> 51:57.520
 compromise. Whether that happens in college, where we're taught that nothing exists and nothing

51:57.520 --> 52:03.360
 matters and stop being, be an idolist, be a cynic, be whatever. Or whether it happens when we get

52:03.360 --> 52:07.280
 married and get a job and have kids and they're too busy and can't think about ideals and forget

52:07.280 --> 52:13.920
 and just get into the norm of conventional life or whether it's because a mother pesters us to

52:13.920 --> 52:19.280
 get married and have kids and do all the things that she wanted us to do. We give up on those ideals.

52:20.240 --> 52:25.680
 And there's a sense in which Ayn Rand reminds them that they gave up.

52:25.680 --> 52:34.400
 That's so beautifully put and so true. It's worth pausing on that

52:36.560 --> 52:42.800
 this dismissal, people forget the beauty of that curiosity. That's true in the scientific field

52:42.800 --> 52:54.560
 too, is the youthful joy of like everything is possible and we can understand it with the tools

52:54.560 --> 52:59.280
 of our mind. Yes. And that's what it's all about. That's what Ayn Rand's ideas at the end of the

52:59.280 --> 53:04.480
 day all blow down to is that confidence and that passion and that curiosity and that interest.

53:05.120 --> 53:12.000
 And if you think about what academia does to so many of us, we go into academia and we're

53:12.000 --> 53:16.800
 excited about, we're going to learn stuff, we're going to discover things. And then they stick

53:16.800 --> 53:22.720
 you into sub sub field and examining some minutiae that's insignificant and unimportant.

53:22.720 --> 53:27.120
 And to get published, you have to be conventional. You have to do what everybody else does. And then

53:27.120 --> 53:32.080
 there's the tenure process of seven years where they put you through this torture to write papers

53:32.080 --> 53:38.240
 that fit into a certain mold. And by the time you're done, you're in your mid 30s and you've

53:38.240 --> 53:44.240
 done nothing, you discovered nothing, you're all in this minutiae in this stuff. And it's destructive

53:44.240 --> 53:51.440
 in whiz, holding on to that passion, holding on to that knowledge and that confidence is hard.

53:52.000 --> 53:57.120
 And when people do away with it, they become cynical and they become part of the system

53:57.120 --> 54:02.640
 and they inflict the same pain on the next guy that they suffered because that's part of how it

54:02.640 --> 54:07.440
 works. Yeah, this happens in artificial intelligence. This happens when like

54:07.440 --> 54:11.360
 a young person shows up and with like fire in their eyes and they say,

54:11.360 --> 54:16.560
 I want to understand the nature of intelligence and everybody rolls their eyes.

54:18.000 --> 54:24.480
 Well, for these same reasons, because they've spent so many years on the very specific set of

54:24.480 --> 54:31.520
 questions that kind of they compete over and they write papers over and they have conferences about,

54:31.520 --> 54:35.200
 and it's true those that incremental research is the way you make progress,

54:35.200 --> 54:38.080
 answering the question of what is intelligence, exceptionally difficult.

54:38.720 --> 54:47.760
 But when you mock it, you actually destroy the realities. When we look like centuries from now,

54:47.760 --> 54:51.600
 we'll look back at this time for this particular field of artificial intelligence,

54:52.480 --> 54:57.840
 it will be the people who will be remembered will be the people who've asked the question

54:57.840 --> 55:03.680
 and made it their life journey of what is intelligence and actually had the chance to

55:03.680 --> 55:08.800
 succeed. Most will fail asking that question, but the ones that like had a chance of succeeding

55:09.360 --> 55:14.960
 and had that throughout their whole life. And I suppose the same is true for philosophy.

55:14.960 --> 55:20.640
 It's in every field. It's asking the big questions and staying curious and staying

55:20.640 --> 55:27.040
 passionate and staying excited and accepting failure, accepting that you're not going to

55:27.040 --> 55:30.960
 get it first time, you're not going to get the whole thing. But and sometimes you have to do

55:30.960 --> 55:35.120
 the minutiae work. And I'm not here to say nobody should specialize and you shouldn't do the minutiae,

55:35.120 --> 55:40.960
 you have to do that. But there has to be a way to do that work and keep the passion and keep it all

55:40.960 --> 55:46.400
 integrated. That's another thing. I mean, we don't live in a culture that integrates, right?

55:46.400 --> 55:51.920
 We live in a culture that is all that is all about, you know, this minutiae and not and,

55:51.920 --> 55:55.840
 you know, medicine is another field where you specialize in the kidney. I mean, the kidneys

55:55.840 --> 56:00.240
 connected to other things, you've got to, and we don't have a holistic view of these things.

56:00.240 --> 56:04.800
 And I'm sure not officially intelligence, you're not going to make the big leaps forward

56:04.800 --> 56:09.680
 without a holistic view of what it is you're trying to achieve. And maybe that's the question,

56:09.680 --> 56:15.360
 what is intelligence? But that's the kind of questions you have to ask to make big leaps

56:15.360 --> 56:20.560
 forward to really move the field in a positive direction. And it's the people who can think

56:20.560 --> 56:27.200
 that way, who move fields and move technology, move anything, anything is, everything is like.

56:27.200 --> 56:31.920
 But just like you said, it's painful because underlying that kind of questioning is,

56:32.560 --> 56:39.440
 well, maybe the work I've done for the past 20 years was a dead end. And you have to kind of

56:39.440 --> 56:45.680
 face that even just, it might not be true, but even just facing that reality is just,

56:45.680 --> 56:50.960
 it's a painful feeling. Absolutely. But it's, that's part of the reason why it's important to

56:50.960 --> 56:54.560
 enjoy the work that you do. Right. So that even if it doesn't completely worked out,

56:54.560 --> 56:58.560
 at least you enjoyed the process, right? It was not a waste because you enjoyed the process.

56:59.120 --> 57:05.360
 And if you learn as any entrepreneur knows this, right? And if you learn from the waste of time,

57:05.360 --> 57:10.160
 from the errors, from the mistakes, then you can build on them and make things even better,

57:10.160 --> 57:15.040
 right? And so the next 20 years, I'm a massive success.

57:16.080 --> 57:21.760
 Can we, another impossible task, so you did wonderfully on talking about Iran,

57:21.760 --> 57:27.760
 and the other impossible task of giving a whirlwind overview of the philosophy of

57:27.760 --> 57:33.040
 objectivism, the philosophy of Iran. Yeah. So luckily she did it in an essay,

57:33.040 --> 57:39.360
 or she talks about doing her philosophy on one foot. But let me integrate it with the literature

57:39.360 --> 57:46.240
 and with her life a little bit. She wanted to be a writer, but her goal, she had a particular

57:46.240 --> 57:52.320
 goal in her writing. She was an idealist, right? She wanted to portray the ideal man.

57:55.120 --> 57:59.200
 So one of the things you do when you want to design is what is an ideal man? You have to

57:59.200 --> 58:03.920
 ask that question. What does that mean? You might have a sense of it. You might have,

58:03.920 --> 58:10.960
 so in glimpses of it in other people's literature, but what is it? So she starts reading philosophy

58:10.960 --> 58:15.600
 to try to figure out what a philosopher say about the ideal man. And what she finds

58:15.600 --> 58:21.840
 horrifies her in terms of the view of most philosophers of man. And she's attracted,

58:21.840 --> 58:25.600
 certainly when she's young, to Nietzsche, because Nietzsche at least has a vision

58:26.560 --> 58:32.000
 of grandeur for man, even though his philosophy is very flawed and has other problems and

58:32.000 --> 58:37.120
 contradicting man in many ways. But at least he has that vision of what is possible to man.

58:37.840 --> 58:43.440
 And she's attracted to that romantic vision, that idealistic vision. So she discovers in writing,

58:43.440 --> 58:47.120
 in particularly in writing Atlas Shrugged, but even in the front in it, that she's going to

58:47.120 --> 58:52.720
 have to develop her own philosophy. She's going to have to discover these ideas for herself,

58:52.720 --> 58:57.920
 because they're not fully articulated anywhere else. The glimpses again of it in Aristotle,

58:58.800 --> 59:05.040
 in Nietzsche, but they're not fully fleshed out. So to a large extent, she develops a philosophy

59:05.680 --> 59:12.000
 for a very practical purpose, to write, to write a novel about the ideal man. And

59:12.000 --> 59:16.160
 Atlas Shrugged is the manifestation of that. By the way, sorry, to interrupt.

59:17.280 --> 59:24.960
 As a little aside, she does, when you say man, you mean human. And because we'll bring this up

59:24.960 --> 59:33.200
 often, she does, maybe you can elaborate of how she specifically uses man and he in the work.

59:33.200 --> 59:39.840
 We live in a time now, with gender and so on. Well, she did that in the sense that everybody

59:39.840 --> 59:46.160
 did it during her period of time. It's only in modern times where we do he slash she. Historically,

59:46.160 --> 59:50.560
 when you said he, human being, unless the particular context implied that it was a...

59:51.360 --> 59:56.960
 But in Iron Man's case, in this case, in this one sentence, she probably meant man.

59:58.720 --> 1:00:02.720
 Not that because she viewed that there are differences between men and women,

1:00:02.720 --> 1:00:12.240
 we're not the same, which I know comes at a shock to many people. But she's working on a character.

1:00:12.240 --> 1:00:20.080
 She was working on a particular vision. She considered herself a man worshiper and a man,

1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:28.880
 not human being, a male. Male. She worshipped manhood, if you will, the hero in man. And she

1:00:28.880 --> 1:00:35.120
 wanted to fully understand what that was. Now, it has massive implications for an ideal woman.

1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:40.000
 And I think she does portray the ideal woman in Atlas Shrugged in the character of Dagny.

1:00:40.880 --> 1:00:48.320
 But her goal is... I think her selfish goal for what she wanted to get out of the novel

1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:57.600
 is that excitement, partially sexual, about seeing your ideal manifest in reality of what you perceive

1:00:57.600 --> 1:01:05.120
 as that which you would be attracted to, fully, intellectually, physically, sexually,

1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:08.000
 in every aspect of your life. That's what she's trying to bring into it.

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:12.880
 So there was no ambiguity of gender. So there was a masculinity and a femininity in her work.

1:01:12.880 --> 1:01:17.920
 Very much so. And if you read the novels, you see that. You see that. Now, remember,

1:01:17.920 --> 1:01:25.360
 this is in the context of, in Atlas Shrugged, she is portraying a woman who runs a railroad,

1:01:25.360 --> 1:01:30.400
 the most masculine of all jobs you could imagine, running a railroad better than any man could run

1:01:30.400 --> 1:01:40.240
 in. And achieving huge success better than any other man out there. But for her, even Dagny

1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:50.080
 needs somebody to... needs a man in some sense to look up to. And that's the character whose name

1:01:50.080 --> 1:01:55.520
 I won't mention because it gives away too much of the plot. But they have to... I like how you do

1:01:55.520 --> 1:02:01.600
 that. You're good. You're not. A lot of practice. A lot of practice. Brilliant. Because you convey

1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:05.840
 all the important things without giving away plot lines. That's beautiful. You're a master.

1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:14.160
 So she's very much... She described herself once as a male chauvinist.

1:02:14.160 --> 1:02:23.040
 Okay. She very... She likes the idea of a man opening a door for her. But more metaphysically,

1:02:23.040 --> 1:02:28.960
 she identifies something in the difference between a way a man relates to a woman and

1:02:28.960 --> 1:02:35.920
 a woman relates to a man. It's not the same. And let's not take too far of a tangent, but I just,

1:02:35.920 --> 1:02:44.320
 as a side comment, to me, she represented... She was a feminist to me. But perhaps there's a...

1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:50.640
 Perhaps technically, you disagree with that, whatever. But the... That to me represented

1:02:51.360 --> 1:02:56.640
 strong... She had some of the strongest female characters in the history of literature.

1:02:56.640 --> 1:03:02.480
 Again, this is a woman running a railroad in 1957. And not just a woman running a railroad.

1:03:02.480 --> 1:03:09.040
 And this is true of The Fountainhead as well. A woman who is sexually, in a sense, assertive,

1:03:09.840 --> 1:03:19.520
 sexually open. This is not a woman who... This is a woman who embraces her sexuality.

1:03:20.320 --> 1:03:27.280
 And sex is important in life. This is why it's coming up. It was important in the novels.

1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:33.120
 It's important in life. And for her, one's attitude towards sex is her reflection. One's

1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:38.240
 attitude towards life and what attitude towards pleasure, which is an important part of life.

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:45.120
 And she thought that was an incredibly important thing. And so she has these assertive, powerful,

1:03:46.480 --> 1:03:56.160
 sexual women who live their lives on their terms 100% who seek a man to look up to.

1:03:56.160 --> 1:04:01.440
 Yeah. Now, there's a psychologically complex... It's more psychology than

1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:06.880
 philosophy. It's psychologically complex and not my area of expertise. But this is...

1:04:07.760 --> 1:04:13.440
 There's something... And she would argue there's something fundamentally different about a male

1:04:13.440 --> 1:04:18.720
 and a woman, about a male and female, psychologically in their attitude towards one another.

1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:25.360
 Yeah. But as a side note, I say that I would say that I don't know, philosophically,

1:04:25.360 --> 1:04:31.200
 if her ideas about gender are interesting, I think her other philosophical ideas are much

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:37.280
 more interesting. But reading wise, the stories it created, the tension it created,

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:43.120
 that was pretty powerful. I mean, that's pretty powerful stuff.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:47.280
 I'll speculate that the reason it's so powerful is because it reflects something in reality.

1:04:47.280 --> 1:04:50.080
 Yeah. That's true. There's a thread that at least...

1:04:50.080 --> 1:04:56.560
 And look, it's really important to say, I think she was the first feminist in a sense. I think,

1:04:56.560 --> 1:05:01.280
 in a sense, the feminist that provoked feminism into something that it shouldn't be. But in the

1:05:01.280 --> 1:05:09.760
 sense of men and women are capable, she was the first one who really put that into a novel and

1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:16.400
 showed it. To me, as a boy, when I was reading Alice Schrag, I think I read that before,

1:05:16.400 --> 1:05:21.920
 Fountainhead. That was one of the early introductions, at least if an American woman had

1:05:21.920 --> 1:05:30.000
 examples of my own life for Russian women, but of a badass lady. I love engineering.

1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:36.080
 I had loved that she could... Here's a lady that's running the show. So that, at least to me, was an

1:05:36.080 --> 1:05:41.920
 example of a really strong woman. But objectivism. Objectivism. So she developed it for a novel.

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:46.080
 She spent the latter part of her life after the publication of Alice Schrag really articulating

1:05:46.080 --> 1:05:50.640
 her philosophy. So that's what she did. She applied it to politics, to life, to gender,

1:05:50.640 --> 1:05:56.640
 to all these issues from 1957 until she died in 1982. So the objectivism was born out of the later

1:05:56.640 --> 1:06:02.240
 parts of Alice Schrag. Yes, definitely. It was there all the time, but it was fleshed out during

1:06:02.240 --> 1:06:05.760
 the latter parts of Alice Schrag and then articulated for the next 20 years. So what is

1:06:05.760 --> 1:06:11.440
 objectivism? So objectivism... So there are five branches in philosophy. And so I'm going to

1:06:11.440 --> 1:06:16.560
 just go through the branches. You start with metaphysics, the nature of reality.

1:06:16.560 --> 1:06:22.640
 And objectivism argues that reality is what it is. It kind of goes... Hawkins back to Aristotle,

1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:29.360
 Law of Identity. A is A. You can wish it to be B, but wishes do not make something real.

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:37.360
 Reality is what it is, and it is the primary. And it's not manipulated, directed by consciousness.

1:06:37.360 --> 1:06:46.640
 Consciousness is there to observe, to give us information about reality. That is the purpose

1:06:46.640 --> 1:06:54.880
 of consciousness. It is the nature of it. So in metaphysics, existence exists. The law of

1:06:54.880 --> 1:07:02.160
 identity, the law of causality, things are... The things act based on their nature, not randomly,

1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:08.320
 not arbitrarily, but based on their nature. And then we have the tool to know reality.

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:15.120
 This is epistemology, the theory of knowledge. Our tool to know reality is reason. It's our

1:07:15.120 --> 1:07:19.200
 senses and our capacity to integrate the information we get from our senses and to

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:24.960
 integrate it into new knowledge and to conceptualize it. And that is uniquely human.

1:07:24.960 --> 1:07:35.040
 We don't know the truth from revelation. We don't know truth from our emotions.

1:07:35.040 --> 1:07:38.640
 Our emotions are interesting. Our emotions tell us something about ourselves,

1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:45.040
 but our emotions are not tools of cognition. They don't tell us the truth about what's out there,

1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:51.520
 about what's in reality. So reason is our means of knowledge, and therefore,

1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:57.920
 reason is our means of survival. Only individuals reason, just in the same way that only individuals

1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:04.640
 can eat. We don't have a collective stomach. Nobody can eat for me. And therefore, nobody can think

1:08:04.640 --> 1:08:10.800
 for me. We don't have a collective mind. There's no collective consciousness. It's bizarre that

1:08:10.800 --> 1:08:16.160
 people talk about these collectivized aspects of the mind. They don't talk about collective

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:21.680
 feats and collective stomachs and collective things. But so we all think for ourselves,

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:29.280
 and it is our fundamental basic responsibility to live our lives, to live, to choose,

1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:37.280
 once we choose to live, to live our lives to the best of our ability. So in morality, she is an

1:08:37.280 --> 1:08:42.400
 egoist. She believes that the purpose of morality is to provide you with a code of values and

1:08:42.400 --> 1:08:49.280
 virtues, to guide your life for the purpose of your own success. Your own survival, your own

1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:55.200
 thriving, your own happiness. Happiness is the moral purpose of your life. The purpose of morality

1:08:55.200 --> 1:09:00.560
 is to guide you towards a happy life. Your own happiness. Your own happiness. Absolutely. Your

1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:05.120
 own happiness. So she rejects the idea that she should live for other people, that she should

1:09:05.120 --> 1:09:09.360
 live for the purpose of other people's happiness. Your purpose is not to make them happier, to

1:09:09.360 --> 1:09:14.640
 make them anything. Your purpose is your own happiness. But she also rejects the idea that

1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:20.640
 you could argue maybe the Nechayana idea of you should use other people for your own purposes.

1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:26.400
 Right? So every person is an end in himself. Every person's moral responsibility is their own

1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:31.040
 happiness. And you shouldn't use other people for your own, shouldn't exploit other people

1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:34.880
 for your own happiness. And you shouldn't allow yourself to be exploited for other people.

1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:40.720
 Every individual is responsible for themselves. And what is it that allows us to be happy?

1:09:40.720 --> 1:09:47.440
 What is it that facilitates human flourishing, human success, human survival? Well, it's the

1:09:47.440 --> 1:09:55.280
 use of our minds, right? It goes back to reason. And what does reason require in order to be

1:09:55.280 --> 1:10:04.320
 successful, in order to work effectively? It requires freedom. So the enemy of reason,

1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:10.160
 the enemy of reason is force. The enemy of reason is coercion. The enemy of reason is

1:10:11.280 --> 1:10:17.760
 authority, right? The Catholic Church doing what they did to Galileo, right? That restricts

1:10:17.760 --> 1:10:20.960
 Galileo's thinking, right? When he's in a house arrest, is he going to come up with

1:10:20.960 --> 1:10:27.440
 a new theory? Is he going to discover new truths? No, it's the punishment is too, you know,

1:10:27.440 --> 1:10:36.640
 it's too dangerous. So force, coercion are enemies of reason. And what reason needs is

1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:44.240
 to be free, to think, to discover, to innovate, to break out of convention.

1:10:46.240 --> 1:10:51.280
 So we need to create an environment in which individuals are free to reason, to free to think.

1:10:52.240 --> 1:10:57.040
 And to do that, we come up with a concept, historically, we've come up with a concept

1:10:57.040 --> 1:11:04.160
 of individual rights. Individual rights define the fact that we should be left alone,

1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:11.600
 free to pursue our values, using our reason, free of what? Free of coercion, force, authority.

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:18.160
 And that the job of government is to make sure that we are free. The whole point of government,

1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:24.160
 the whole point of when we come in a social context, the whole point of establishing

1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:32.720
 government in that context is to secure that freedom. It's to make sure that I don't use

1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:37.680
 coercion on you. The government is supposed to stop me, is supposed to intervene before I can do

1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:45.280
 that, or if I've already done it, to prevent me from doing it again. So the purpose of government

1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:51.440
 is to protect our freedom, to think and to act based on our thoughts. It's to leave individuals

1:11:51.440 --> 1:11:57.920
 free to pursue their values, to pursue their happiness, to pursue their rational thought,

1:11:58.960 --> 1:12:06.320
 and to be left alone to do it. And so she rejects socialism, which basically assumes

1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:10.000
 some kind of collective goal, assumes the sacrifice of the individual to the group,

1:12:10.880 --> 1:12:15.040
 assumes that your moral purpose in life is the well being of other people rather than your own.

1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:25.680
 And she rejects all form of statism, all form of government that is overly,

1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:32.320
 that is involved in any aspect other than to protect us from forced coercion and authority.

1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:38.880
 And she rejects anarchy, and we can talk about that. I think you had a question in the list

1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:41.120
 of questions you sent me about anarchy. So I'm happy to discuss that.

1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:45.600
 I'm just like a malice about anarchy. So I don't know if you're familiar with him.

1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:49.600
 Yes, I'm familiar with him. So, yeah, so she completely rejects anarchy.

1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.920
 Anarchy is completely inconsistent with her point of view, and we can talk about why if you want.

1:12:53.920 --> 1:12:58.160
 So there's some perfect place where freedom is maximized, so systems of government.

1:12:58.800 --> 1:13:03.920
 Absolutely. And she thought that the American system of government came close in its idea,

1:13:03.920 --> 1:13:09.920
 obviously founded with original sin, with the sin of slavery. But in its conception,

1:13:09.920 --> 1:13:14.400
 the declaration of dependence is about as perfect a political document as one could write.

1:13:14.400 --> 1:13:16.880
 I think the greatest political document in human history,

1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:22.720
 but really articulated almost perfectly and beautifully. And that the American system of

1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:27.360
 government with the Texas balances, which is with its emphasis on individual rights,

1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:32.560
 with its emphasis on freedom, with its emphasis on leaving individual freedom, pursue their

1:13:32.560 --> 1:13:37.520
 happiness and explicit recognition of happiness as a goal, individual happiness,

1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:42.960
 was the model. It wasn't perfect. There are a lot of problems to a large extent because the founders

1:13:42.960 --> 1:13:51.200
 had mixed philosophical premises. So there were alien premises introduced into the founding

1:13:51.200 --> 1:13:58.000
 of the country, slavery obviously being the biggest problem. But it was close. And we need

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:05.360
 to build on that to create an ideal political system that will, yes, maximize the freedom

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:12.480
 of individuals to do exactly this. And then of course she had, so that's kind of, that's

1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:17.840
 the manifestation of this individualism in a political realm. And she had a theory of art.

1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:22.960
 She had a theory of aesthetics, which is the fifth branch of she have metaphysics of

1:14:22.960 --> 1:14:28.880
 epistemology, ethics and politics. And the fifth branch is aesthetics. And she viewed art as an

1:14:28.880 --> 1:14:36.160
 essential human need, a fuel for the human spirit. And that just like any human need,

1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:42.800
 it had certain principles that it had to abide by. That is just like there's nutrition, right? So

1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:46.880
 some food is good for you and some food is bad for you, some food, some stuff is poison.

1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:53.360
 She believed the same is true of art, that art had an identity, which is very controversial today,

1:14:53.360 --> 1:15:00.000
 right? Today, if you put a frame around it, it is art, right? If you put a urinal in a museum,

1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:07.440
 it becomes art, which she thought was evil and ludicrous. And she rejected completely that art

1:15:07.440 --> 1:15:13.920
 had an identity and that it served a certain function that human beings needed it. And if it

1:15:13.920 --> 1:15:19.920
 didn't have, not only did it have the identity, but that function was served well by some art

1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:24.800
 and poorly by other art. And then there's a whole realm of stuff that's not art,

1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:30.960
 basically, all of all of what today is considered modern art, she would consider as not being art,

1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:41.680
 you know, splashing paint on a canvas, not art. So she had very clear ideas. She articulated them

1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:48.240
 not. So I would say not in conventional philosophical form. So she didn't write

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:55.200
 philosophical essays using the philosopher's language. It's partially why I think philosophers

1:15:55.200 --> 1:16:00.560
 have never taken it seriously. They're actually accessible to us. We can actually read them.

1:16:01.360 --> 1:16:06.720
 And she integrates the philosophy in what I think are amazing ways with psychology,

1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:11.600
 with history, with economics, with politics, with what's going on in the world.

1:16:11.600 --> 1:16:19.600
 And she has dozens and dozens and dozens of essays that she wrote. Many of them were aggregated into

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:27.280
 books. I particularly recommend books like The Virtue of Selfishness, Capitalism, The Unknown

1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:37.840
 Ideal, and Philosophy Who Needs It. And, you know, I think it's a beautiful philosophy.

1:16:37.840 --> 1:16:42.480
 You know, I know you're big on love. I think it's a philosophy of love. We can talk about that.

1:16:42.480 --> 1:16:46.400
 Essentially, it's about love. That's what the philosophy is all about when it applies,

1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:54.640
 in terms of applying to self. And, you know, I think it's sad that so few people read it,

1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:58.560
 and so few intellectuals take it seriously and are willing to engage with it.

1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:04.720
 Let me ask, that was incredible. But after that beautiful whirlwind overview, let me ask the

1:17:04.720 --> 1:17:13.520
 most shallow of questions, which is the name Objectivism, of where, like, how should people

1:17:13.520 --> 1:17:19.520
 think about the name being rooted? Why not individualism? What are the options? If we're,

1:17:19.520 --> 1:17:24.400
 like, had a branding meeting right now. Sure. So she actually had a branding meeting. So she

1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:28.720
 did this. She went through the exercise. Objectivism, I do not think, I don't know all the details,

1:17:28.720 --> 1:17:33.440
 but I don't think Objectivism was the first name she came with. The problem was that the

1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:38.800
 other names were taken, and they were not positive implications. So, for example,

1:17:38.800 --> 1:17:43.840
 rationalism could have been a good word, because she's an advocate of rational thought,

1:17:43.840 --> 1:17:50.000
 or reasonism. But reasonism sounds weird, right? The ism, because of too many S's, I guess.

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:55.360
 Rationalism, but it was already a philosophy, and it was a philosophy inconsistent with hers,

1:17:55.360 --> 1:18:00.800
 because it was what she considered a false view of reason, of rationality.

1:18:00.800 --> 1:18:08.320
 Realityism, you know, just doesn't work. So she came on Objectivism, and I think, actually,

1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:17.520
 it's a great word. It's a great name, because it has two aspects to it. And this is a unique view

1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:24.640
 of what Objectivity actually means. Inobjectivism, inobjectivity is the idea of an independent

1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:31.680
 reality. There is truth. There's actually something out there, and then there's the

1:18:31.680 --> 1:18:38.160
 role of consciousness. There is the role of figuring out the truth. The truth doesn't just

1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:47.920
 hit you. The truth is not in the thing. You have to discover it. It's that a consciousness

1:18:47.920 --> 1:18:56.960
 applied to, that's what Objectivity is, right? It's you discovering the truth in reality. It's

1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:02.560
 your consciousness interacting. And thereby posing the individual in that sense.

1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:05.360
 And only the individual could do it. Now, the problem with individualism

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:13.040
 is it would have made the philosophy too political. And she always said, so she said,

1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:18.640
 she said, I'm an advocate of capitalism, because I'm really an advocate for rational

1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:25.200
 egoism. But I'm an advocate for rational egoism, really, because I'm an advocate for reason.

1:19:25.920 --> 1:19:34.400
 So she viewed the essential of her philosophy as being this reason and her particular view of

1:19:34.400 --> 1:19:38.560
 reason. And she has a whole book. She has a book called Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology,

1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:44.320
 which I encourage any scientist, mathematician, anybody interested in science to read, because it

1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:56.080
 is a total force on, in a sense, what it means to hold concepts and what it means to discover new

1:19:56.080 --> 1:20:05.840
 discoveries and to use concepts and how we use concepts. And she has a theory of concepts that

1:20:05.840 --> 1:20:13.200
 is completely new, that is completely revolutionary. And I think is essential for the philosophy of

1:20:13.200 --> 1:20:18.480
 science. And therefore, ultimately, for the more abstract we get with scientific discoveries,

1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:24.560
 the easier it is to detach them from reality and to detach them from truth,

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:32.320
 the easier it is to be inside our heads, instead of about what's real. And they're probably examples

1:20:32.320 --> 1:20:39.120
 from metaphysics that fit that. And I think what she teaches in the book is how to ground your

1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:44.480
 concepts and how to bring them into grounding in reality. So Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology

1:20:44.480 --> 1:20:48.320
 and note that it's only an introduction, because one of the things she realized, one of the things

1:20:48.320 --> 1:20:55.200
 that I think a lot of her critics don't give enough credit for, is the philosophy is there's no end,

1:20:55.200 --> 1:20:59.360
 right? It's always growing. There's always new discoveries. There's always it's, you know,

1:20:59.360 --> 1:21:06.000
 it's like science. There's always new things. And there's a ton of work to do in philosophy.

1:21:07.280 --> 1:21:10.160
 And particularly in epistemology and the theory of knowledge that she was actually

1:21:10.720 --> 1:21:16.320
 given your interest in mathematics, she was, she actually saw a lot of parallels between

1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:22.880
 math and concept formation. And she was actually, you know, in the years before she died,

1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:29.680
 she was taking private lessons in mathematics, in algebra, and calculus, because she believed

1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:38.480
 that there was real insight in understanding algebra in calculus to philosophy into epistemology.

1:21:39.280 --> 1:21:44.480
 And she also was very interested in neuroscience, because she believed that that had a lot to tell

1:21:44.480 --> 1:21:53.200
 us about epistemology, but also about music, therefore about aesthetics. So, I mean, she

1:21:53.200 --> 1:21:58.720
 recognized the importance of all these different fields and how in the beauty of philosophy is

1:21:58.720 --> 1:22:02.960
 it should be integrating all of them. And one of the sad things about the world in which we live

1:22:02.960 --> 1:22:08.720
 is again, we view these things as silos. We don't view them as integrating. We don't have teams of

1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:15.280
 people from different arena, you know, different fields, you know, discovering things, we become

1:22:15.280 --> 1:22:22.800
 like ants, specialized. So, she was definitely like that. And she was constantly curious, constantly

1:22:22.800 --> 1:22:29.920
 interested in new discoveries and new ideas and how this could expand the scope of her

1:22:29.920 --> 1:22:33.600
 philosophy and application of her philosophy. There's like a million topics that I can talk

1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:40.800
 to you, but since you mentioned math, I'm almost only got three hours. I'm almost curious. I don't

1:22:40.800 --> 1:22:46.560
 know if you're familiar with Gaol's incompleteness theorem. I'm not, unfortunately. Okay. It was a

1:22:46.560 --> 1:22:54.960
 powerful proof that any axiomatic systems, when you start from a bunch of axioms, that there will,

1:22:56.080 --> 1:23:03.440
 in that system, provably must be an inconsistency. So, that was this painful like stab

1:23:03.440 --> 1:23:10.240
 in the idea of mathematics that, no, if we start with a set of assumptions, kind of like

1:23:10.240 --> 1:23:16.240
 Admiran started with objectivism, there will have to be at least one contradiction.

1:23:17.520 --> 1:23:20.160
 See, I intuitively, I'm going to say that's false.

1:23:20.960 --> 1:23:25.840
 Philosophically, but in math, it's just true. And that's,

1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:30.960
 it's a question about how you define, again, definitions matter, and you have to be careful

1:23:30.960 --> 1:23:35.680
 on how you define axioms. And you have to be careful about what you define as an inconsistency,

1:23:35.680 --> 1:23:39.920
 and what that means to say there's an inconsistency. And I don't know, I'm not going to say more than

1:23:39.920 --> 1:23:46.960
 that, because I don't know. But I'm suspicious that there is some, and this is the power of

1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:51.120
 philosophy, and this is why I said before, concept formation is so important. And understanding

1:23:51.120 --> 1:23:55.120
 concept formation is so important for particularly, again, mathematics, because it's such an abstract

1:23:55.120 --> 1:24:03.520
 field. And it's so easy to lose grounding in reality, that if you properly define axioms,

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:07.600
 and you properly define what you're doing in math, whether that is true. And I don't think it is.

1:24:08.160 --> 1:24:12.880
 This is, yeah, we'll leave it as an open mystery, because actually this audience,

1:24:14.240 --> 1:24:19.840
 you know, there's literally over 100,000 people that have PhDs. And so they know

1:24:19.840 --> 1:24:25.760
 Gato's the complete theorem. I have this intuition that there's something different to you mathematics

1:24:25.760 --> 1:24:31.680
 and philosophy, that I'd love to hear from people, like what exactly is that difference? Because

1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:40.400
 there's a precision to mathematics that philosophy doesn't have. But that precision

1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:48.640
 gets you in trouble. It somehow actually takes you away from truth. Like the very constraints of

1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:55.360
 the language used in mathematics actually puts a constraint on the capture of truth that it's

1:24:55.360 --> 1:25:02.320
 able to do. I'm going to argue that that is a total product of the way you're conceptualizing

1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:10.000
 the terms within mathematics. It's not in reality. Yes. So you would argue it's in the

1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:15.200
 fact that mathematics in as much as it's detached from reality that you can do these kinds of things.

1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:28.320
 Yes. And that mathematicians have come up with concepts that they haven't grounded in reality

1:25:28.320 --> 1:25:34.320
 properly, that allows them to go off in places that don't lead to truth. That's right. That don't

1:25:34.320 --> 1:25:40.720
 lead to truth. But I encourage you then, I encourage you to do one of these podcasts with

1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:47.360
 one of our philosophers who know more about this stuff. And if you move to Austin,

1:25:47.360 --> 1:25:51.280
 I've got somebody I'd recommend to you. Can you throw a name out or no?

1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:56.720
 Yeah. I would talk to Greg so, Mary. When we say our, can you say what you mean by our?

1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:02.320
 I'd say people who are affiliated with the Ironman Institute are philosophers who are

1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:08.080
 affiliated with Objectivism. And Greg is one of our brightest and he's an Austin,

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:14.160
 he's just got a position at UT, is at the University of Texas. And he, and he would want

1:26:14.160 --> 1:26:18.960
 on Kogate would be another one who actually works at the Institute and a chief philosophy officer

1:26:18.960 --> 1:26:24.480
 at the Institute. That's awesome. And, and, and there are others who specialize in philosophy of

1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:30.640
 science who, who I think Greg could probably give you a lead. But, but these are unbelievably

1:26:30.640 --> 1:26:34.320
 smart people who know this part of the philosophy much better than I do.

1:26:34.320 --> 1:26:38.400
 What, can you just briefly perhaps say what is the Ironman Institute?

1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:45.040
 Yeah. So the Ironman Institute was an organization founded three years after Ironman died. She died

1:26:45.040 --> 1:26:53.760
 in 1982. And it was founded in 1985 to promote her ideas, to make sure that ideas and her novels

1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:00.240
 continued in the culture and were relevant. Well, they're relevant, but what the people

1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:05.680
 saw the relevance. So our mission is to get people to read her books, to engage in the ideas.

1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:11.600
 We teach, we have the Objectivist Academic Center where we teach the philosophy,

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:18.560
 primarily to graduate students and others who take the ideas seriously and really want a deep

1:27:18.560 --> 1:27:24.400
 understanding of the philosophy. And we apply the ideas. So we take the ideas and apply them to

1:27:24.400 --> 1:27:30.800
 ethics, to philosophy, to issues of the day, which is more my strength and more what, what I tend to

1:27:30.800 --> 1:27:38.080
 do. I've, you know, I've never, I've never formally studied philosophy. So all my education

1:27:38.080 --> 1:27:44.000
 philosophy is informal. And, you know, I'm an engineer and a finance guy. That's, that's my

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:53.280
 background. So I'm a numbers guy. Well, let me, I feel pretty under educated. I have a pretty open

1:27:53.280 --> 1:28:02.320
 mind, which sometimes can be painful on the internet because people mock me or, you know,

1:28:02.320 --> 1:28:07.840
 you know, if I say something nuanced about communism, people, people immediately kind

1:28:07.840 --> 1:28:13.120
 of put you in a bin or something like that. It's, it hurts to be open minded to say, I don't know,

1:28:13.760 --> 1:28:20.080
 to ask the question, why is communism or Marxism so problematic? Why is capitalism

1:28:20.080 --> 1:28:27.920
 problematic and so on? But let me nevertheless go into that direction with you. Maybe let's talk

1:28:27.920 --> 1:28:35.040
 about capitalism a little bit. How does objectivism compare or relate to the idea of capitalism?

1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:39.920
 Well, first we have to define what capitalism is. Because again, people use capitalism in all

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:44.960
 kinds of ways. And I know you had Ray Dalio on your show once. I haven't, I need to listen to that

1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:51.040
 episode episode. But Ray has no clue what capitalism is. And that's, that's, that's, that's his big

1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:57.440
 problem. So when he, when he says there are real problems today in capitalism, he's not talking

1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:00.960
 about capitalism. He's talking about problems in the world today. And I agree with many of the

1:29:00.960 --> 1:29:07.200
 problems, but they have nothing to do with capitalism. Capitalism is this is a social

1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:14.800
 political economic system in which all property is privately owned and in which the only role of

1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:20.320
 government is the protection of individual rights. I think it's the ideal system. I think it's the

1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:23.600
 right system for the reasons we talked about earlier. It's a system that leaves you as an

1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:28.720
 individual to pursue your values, your life, your happiness, free of coercion and force.

1:29:28.720 --> 1:29:34.000
 And if you get to decide what happens to you, and I get to decide if to help you or not, right?

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:37.120
 If you, let's say you fall flat on your face, people always say, well, what about the poor?

1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:42.800
 Well, if you, if you care about the poor, help them. Just don't, you know, what do you need a

1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:48.480
 government for? You know, I always ask audiences, okay, if there's a, if there's a poor kid who

1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:53.200
 can't afford to go to school and all the schools are private because capitalism has been instituted

1:29:54.160 --> 1:29:58.800
 and he can't go to school, would you be willing to participate in a fund that pays for his education?

1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:04.000
 Every hand in the room goes up. So what do you need government for? Just let's, let's, let's get

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:08.400
 all the money together and pay for his schooling. So the point is that what capitalism does is

1:30:08.400 --> 1:30:13.600
 leave individuals free to make their own decisions. And as long as they're not violating other people's

1:30:13.600 --> 1:30:17.840
 rights, in other words, as long as they're not using coercion force on other people,

1:30:18.640 --> 1:30:22.480
 then leave them alone. And, and people are going to make mistakes and people are going to screw

1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:26.160
 up their lives and people are going to commit suicide, people are going to do terrible things to

1:30:26.160 --> 1:30:32.080
 themselves. That is fundamentally their problem. And if you want to help, you under capitalism are

1:30:32.080 --> 1:30:38.160
 free to help. It's just the only thing that doesn't happen under capitalism is you don't get to impose

1:30:38.160 --> 1:30:46.480
 your will on other people. How's that a bad thing? So the question then is how does the

1:30:46.480 --> 1:30:55.840
 implementation of capitalism deviate from its ideal in practice? I mean, this is what is the

1:30:55.840 --> 1:31:02.880
 question with a lot of systems is how does it start to then fail? So one thing, maybe you can

1:31:02.880 --> 1:31:13.520
 correct me or inform me. It seems like information is very important. Like being able to make decisions

1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:21.360
 to be free, you have to have access, full access of all the information you need to make

1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:28.560
 rational decisions. No, that can't be because it can't be right because none of us has full access

1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:34.720
 to all the information we need. I mean, what does that even mean? And how big, how much of the scope

1:31:34.720 --> 1:31:40.160
 do you want to do? Let's just start there. Yeah. So you need to have access to information. So one

1:31:40.160 --> 1:31:45.360
 of the big criticisms of capitalism is this asymmetrical information. The drug maker has

1:31:45.360 --> 1:31:52.480
 more information about the drug than the drug buyer, pharmaceutical drugs. True, it's a problem.

1:31:53.600 --> 1:31:57.440
 Well, I wonder if one can think about an entrepreneur can think about how to solve

1:31:57.440 --> 1:32:01.760
 that problem. See, I view any one of these challenges to capitalism as an opportunity for

1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:06.240
 an entrepreneur to make money. And they have the freedom to do it. Yeah. So imagine an entrepreneur

1:32:06.240 --> 1:32:12.720
 steps in and says, I will test all the drugs that drug companies make, and I will provide you for a

1:32:12.720 --> 1:32:19.040
 fee with the answer. And how do I know he's not, he's not going to be corrupted. Well, there'll be

1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:25.120
 other ones and they'll compete. And who am I to tell which one of these is the right one? Well,

1:32:25.120 --> 1:32:31.200
 it won't be you really getting the information from them. It'll be a doctor. The doctors need

1:32:31.200 --> 1:32:37.280
 that information. So the doctor who has some expertise in medicine will be evaluating which

1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:44.000
 rating agency to use to evaluate the drugs and which ones then to recommend to you. So do we

1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:49.600
 need an FDA? Do we need a government that siphons all the information to one source that does all

1:32:49.600 --> 1:32:54.320
 the research, all the thing and has a clear incentive, by the way, not to approve drugs.

1:32:54.320 --> 1:32:59.040
 There's only because they don't make any money from it. Nobody pays them for the information.

1:32:59.040 --> 1:33:02.800
 Nobody pays them to be accurate. They're bureaucrats at the end of the day. And what is a

1:33:02.800 --> 1:33:08.800
 bureaucrat? What's the main focus of a bureaucrat? Even if they go in with the best of intentions,

1:33:08.800 --> 1:33:13.200
 which I'm sure all the scientists at the FDA have the best of intention, what's their incentive?

1:33:13.200 --> 1:33:20.800
 The system builds in this incentive not to screw up. Because one drug gets value and does damage.

1:33:20.800 --> 1:33:28.400
 You lose your job. But if a hundred drugs that could kill cancer tomorrow don't ever get to market,

1:33:28.960 --> 1:33:35.920
 nobody's going to come after you. Yeah. And you're saying that's not a mechanism that's

1:33:37.520 --> 1:33:41.920
 conducive to it? The marketplace is competition. So if you won't approve the drug, if I still think

1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:46.720
 it's possible, I will. And it's not zero one. You see the other thing that happens with the

1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:51.840
 FDA is zero one. It's either approved or it's not approved. Or it's approved for this, but it's not

1:33:51.840 --> 1:33:57.760
 approved for that. But what if a drug came out and you said, you told the doctors,

1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:06.480
 this drug in 10% of the cases can cause patients an increased risk of heart disease.

1:34:07.520 --> 1:34:14.480
 You and your patients should. We're not forcing you, but you should. It's your medical responsibility

1:34:14.480 --> 1:34:18.480
 to evaluate that and decide if the drug is appropriate or not. Why don't I get to make

1:34:18.480 --> 1:34:23.600
 that choice if I want to take on the 10% risk of heart disease? So there was a drug and right

1:34:23.600 --> 1:34:28.560
 now I forget the name, but it was a drug against pain, particularly for arthritic pain. And it

1:34:28.560 --> 1:34:34.400
 worked. It reduced pain dramatically. And some people tried everything and this was the only drug

1:34:34.400 --> 1:34:42.160
 that reduced their pain. And it turned out that in 10% of the cases, it caused the elevated risk.

1:34:42.160 --> 1:34:45.760
 Didn't kill people necessarily, but it caused elevated risk of heart disease.

1:34:46.960 --> 1:34:52.960
 Okay. What did the FDA do? It banned the drug. Some people, I know a lot of people who said

1:34:53.600 --> 1:34:59.920
 living with pain is much worse than taking on a 10% risk. Again, probabilities, right? People

1:34:59.920 --> 1:35:04.080
 don't think in those numbers. 10% risk of maybe getting heart disease. Why don't I get to make

1:35:04.080 --> 1:35:10.240
 that choice? Why does some bureaucrat make that choice for me? That's capitalism. Capitalism gives

1:35:10.240 --> 1:35:16.880
 you the choice. Not you as an ignorant person. You with your doctor and a whole marketplace,

1:35:16.880 --> 1:35:22.720
 which is not created to provide you with information. And think about a world where we

1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:31.040
 didn't have all these regulations and controls. The amount of opportunities that would exist

1:35:31.840 --> 1:35:37.840
 to create, to provide information, to educate you about that information would mushroom

1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:43.040
 dramatically. Bloomberg, the billionaire, Bloomberg, how did he make his money? He made

1:35:43.040 --> 1:35:47.760
 his money by providing financial information, by creating this service called Bloomberg that

1:35:47.760 --> 1:35:52.480
 you buy a terminal and you get all this amazing information. And he was before computers,

1:35:52.480 --> 1:35:56.480
 desktop computers. I mean, he was very early on in that whole computing revolution,

1:35:57.200 --> 1:36:00.400
 but his focus was providing financial information to professionals.

1:36:01.840 --> 1:36:05.520
 And you hire a professional to manage your money. That's the way it's supposed to be.

1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:12.640
 So you as an individual cannot have all the knowledge you need in medicine,

1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:16.080
 all the knowledge you need in finance, all the knowledge you need in every aspect of your life.

1:36:16.080 --> 1:36:22.720
 You can't do that. You have to delegate. And you hire a doctor. Now, you should be able to figure

1:36:22.720 --> 1:36:27.440
 out if the doctor's good or not. You should be able to ask doctors for reasons for why you have to

1:36:27.440 --> 1:36:30.480
 make the decision at the end. But that's why you have a doctor. That's why you have a financial

1:36:30.480 --> 1:36:35.600
 advisor. That's why you have different people who you're delegating certain aspects of your life,

1:36:35.600 --> 1:36:40.880
 too. But you want choices. And what the marketplace provides is those choices.

1:36:41.360 --> 1:36:48.800
 So let me then, this is what I do. I'll make a dumb case for things. And then you shut me down.

1:36:48.800 --> 1:36:52.640
 And then the internet says how dumb Lex is. This is good. This is how it works.

1:36:52.640 --> 1:37:01.520
 Good. It's shutting down. And they're foolish in blaming you for the question because you're here

1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:10.960
 to ask me questions. Let me make a case for socialism. It's going to be bad because that's

1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:16.720
 the only case there is for socialism. That's reality. So perhaps it's not a case for socialism,

1:37:16.720 --> 1:37:27.280
 but just a certain notion that inequality, the wealth inequality, that the bigger the gap between

1:37:27.280 --> 1:37:35.840
 the poorest or the average and the richest, the more painful it is to be average. Psychologically

1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:44.640
 speaking, if you know that there is the CEOs of companies make 300, 1,000, 1 million times more

1:37:44.640 --> 1:37:52.000
 than you do, that makes life for a large part of the population less fulfilling. That there's a

1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:58.080
 relative notion to the experience of our life that even though everybody's life has gotten better

1:37:58.080 --> 1:38:07.200
 over the past decades and centuries, it may feel actually worse because you know that life could

1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:18.640
 be so, so much better in life to the CEOs that that gap is fundamentally a thing that is undesirable

1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:31.280
 in a society. Everything about that is wrong. I like to start off like that. So my wife likes

1:38:31.280 --> 1:38:38.560
 to remind me that as well as we've done in life, we are actually from a wealth perspective closer

1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:42.640
 to a homeless person than we are to Bill Gates. Just a math, right? Just a math, right?

1:38:44.640 --> 1:38:50.000
 It's a good ego check. When I look at Bill Gates, I get a smile on my face. I love Bill Gates. I've

1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:56.160
 never met Bill Gates. I love Bill Gates. I love what he stands for. I love that he has a hundred

1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:01.840
 billion dollars. I love that he has built a trampoline room in his house where his kids can

1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:06.400
 jump up and down in a trampoline in a safe environment. Can we take another billionaire?

1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:12.720
 Because I'm not sure if you're paying attention, but there's all kinds of conspiracy theories about

1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:17.200
 Bill Gates. Well, but that's part of the story, right? They have to pull him down because people

1:39:17.200 --> 1:39:22.160
 resent him for other reasons. That's strange. But yes, we can take Jeff Bezos. We can take,

1:39:22.160 --> 1:39:28.400
 you know, my favorite, just because I like a lot about him was Steve Jobs.

1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:35.920
 I mean, I love these people. And I can't, they're very few billionaires I don't love.

1:39:37.440 --> 1:39:45.200
 In the sense that I appreciate everything they've done for me, for people I cherish and love,

1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:54.160
 they've made the world a better place. Why would it ever cross my mind that they make me look bad

1:39:54.160 --> 1:40:01.760
 because they're richer than me or that I don't have what they have? They've made me so much richer

1:40:02.960 --> 1:40:08.960
 that they've made inventions that used to cost millions and millions and millions of dollars

1:40:08.960 --> 1:40:16.560
 accessible to me. I mean, this is a simple computer in my pocket. Now, but think about it,

1:40:16.560 --> 1:40:21.760
 right? What is the difference between, and I'll get to the essence of your point in a minute,

1:40:21.760 --> 1:40:27.840
 but think about what the difference is between me and Bill Gates in terms of, because it's true

1:40:27.840 --> 1:40:32.080
 that in terms of wealth, I'm closer to the homeless person. But in terms of my day to day

1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:37.440
 life, I'm closer to Bill Gates. You know, we both live in a nice house. His is nicer.

1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:43.680
 His is nicer, but we live in a nice house. His is bigger, but mine is plenty big. We both drive

1:40:43.680 --> 1:40:52.320
 cars. His is nicer, but we both drive cars, cars. 100 years ago, what cars? We both can

1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:56.880
 fly, get on a plane in Los Angeles and fly to New York and get there in about the same time.

1:40:56.880 --> 1:41:02.480
 We're both flying private. The only difference is my private plane I share with 300 other people

1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:09.920
 and his, but it's accessible. It's relatively comfortable. Again, in the perspective of 50

1:41:09.920 --> 1:41:14.800
 years ago, 100 years ago, it's unimaginable that I could fly like that for such a low fee.

1:41:15.360 --> 1:41:20.960
 We live very similar lives in that sense. So I don't resent him. So first of all,

1:41:20.960 --> 1:41:25.520
 I'm an exception to the supposed rule that people resent. I don't think anybody,

1:41:25.520 --> 1:41:30.160
 I don't think people do resent unless they're taught to resent. And this is the key. People are

1:41:30.160 --> 1:41:37.520
 taught. And I've seen this in America. And this is, to me, the most horrible, shocking thing that

1:41:37.520 --> 1:41:42.480
 has happened in America over the last 40 years, I came to America. So I'm an immigrant. I came to

1:41:42.480 --> 1:41:49.120
 America from Israel in 1987. And I came here because I thought this was the place where I could,

1:41:49.120 --> 1:41:53.760
 where I'd had the most opportunities and it is most opportunities. And I came here because I

1:41:53.760 --> 1:42:00.080
 believed there was a certain American spirit of individualism and exactly the opposite of what

1:42:00.080 --> 1:42:07.520
 you just described. A sense of, I live my life. It's my happiness. I'm not looking at my neighbor.

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:13.920
 I'm not competing with the Joneses. The American dream is my dream. My two kids, my dog, my station

1:42:13.920 --> 1:42:19.840
 wagon, not because other people have it because I want it. And that sense. And when I came here

1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:27.200
 in the 80s, you had that. You had, you still had it. It was less than I think it had been in the

1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:31.920
 past. But you had that spirit. There was no envy. There was no resentment. There were rich people

1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:38.160
 and they were celebrated. There was still this admiration for entrepreneurs and admiration

1:42:38.160 --> 1:42:44.080
 for success. Not by everybody, certainly not by the intellectuals, but by the average person.

1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:49.120
 I have witnessed, particularly over the last 10 years, a complete transformation

1:42:49.120 --> 1:42:56.240
 and America has become like Europe. I know, are you Russian? Yeah. Yeah. It's become Russian.

1:42:57.280 --> 1:43:03.520
 In a sense where, you know, they've always done these studies. You know, I'll give you

1:43:04.160 --> 1:43:09.840
 a hundred dollars in your neighbor, a hundred dollars or give you, or is it, or give you

1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:15.280
 a thousand dollars, but your neighbor gets $10,000. And a Russian will always choose the

1:43:15.280 --> 1:43:22.160
 hundred dollars, right? He wants equality above being better himself. Americans would always choose

1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:32.000
 that gap. And that's not anymore. And it's changing because we've been told it should change.

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:37.360
 And morally you're saying that doesn't make any sense. So there's no sense in which,

1:43:37.360 --> 1:43:43.520
 let me put another spin. I forget the book, but the sense of if you're working for Steve Jobs

1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:50.640
 and you, your hands, you're the engineer behind the iPhone. And there's a sense in which his

1:43:50.640 --> 1:43:58.160
 salary is stealing from your efforts. Because I forget the book, right? That's literally the

1:43:58.160 --> 1:44:04.480
 terminology is used. Well, this is straight out of Karl Marx. Sure. It's also straight out of

1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:09.600
 Karl Marx. But like, there's no sense morally speaking that you see that as the best.

1:44:09.600 --> 1:44:14.480
 Other way around. That engineer is stealing off of, and it's not stealing, right? It's not.

1:44:15.520 --> 1:44:21.440
 But the engineer is getting more from Steve Jobs by a lot, not by a little bit, than Steve Jobs

1:44:21.440 --> 1:44:26.480
 is getting from the engineer. The engineer, even if they're a great engineer, they're probably

1:44:26.480 --> 1:44:31.360
 other great engineers that could replace him. Would he even have a job without Steve Jobs?

1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:37.520
 Would the industry exist without Steve Jobs? Without the giants that carry these things forward?

1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:42.400
 And let me ask you this. I mean, you're a scientist. Yes. Do you resent Einstein for being

1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:51.360
 smarter than you? I mean, you and VM, are you angry with him? Would you feel negative towards him

1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:54.480
 if he was in the room right now? Or would you, if you came into the room, you'd say,

1:44:54.480 --> 1:44:59.280
 Oh my God, I mean, you interview people who I think some of them are probably smarter than you

1:44:59.280 --> 1:45:04.720
 and me. Yeah, for sure. And your attitude towards them is one of reverence. Well, one interesting

1:45:04.720 --> 1:45:12.000
 little side question there is what is the natural state of being for us humans? You kind of implied

1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:18.960
 education has polluted our minds, but like if I, because you're referring to jealousy,

1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:25.760
 the Einstein question, the Steve Jobs question, I wonder which way, if we're left without education,

1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:32.800
 would we naturally go? So there is no such thing as the natural state in that sense, right? This is

1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:42.640
 the myth of whoso is noble savage, and of John Wall's is behind the veil of ignorance. Well,

1:45:42.640 --> 1:45:47.920
 if you're ignorant, you're ignorant. You can't make any decisions. You're just ignorant.

1:45:50.560 --> 1:45:57.200
 There is no human nature that determines how you will relate to other people. You will relate to

1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:00.800
 other people based on the conclusions you come to about how to relate to other people.

1:46:00.800 --> 1:46:09.360
 You can relate to other people as values to use your terminology from the perspective of love.

1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:16.720
 This other human being is a value to me. And I want to trade with them and trade the beauty

1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:22.000
 of trade is it's win win. I want to benefit and they are going to benefit. I don't want to screw

1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:28.320
 them. I don't want them to screw me. I want us to be win win. Or you can deal with other people

1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:37.200
 as threats as enemies. Much of human history, we have done that. And therefore, as a zero sum world,

1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:44.160
 what they have, I want, I will take it. I will use force to take it. I will use political force to

1:46:44.160 --> 1:46:50.640
 take it. I will use the force of my arm to take it. I will just take it. So those are two options,

1:46:50.640 --> 1:46:55.760
 right? And they will determine whether we live in civilization or not. And they are determined by

1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:00.320
 conclusions people come to about the world and the nature of reality and the nature of morality

1:47:00.320 --> 1:47:05.600
 and the nature of politics and all these things. They are determined by philosophy. And this is

1:47:05.600 --> 1:47:12.240
 why philosophy is so important. Because so philosophy shapes its evolution doesn't do this.

1:47:12.240 --> 1:47:19.520
 It doesn't just happen. Ideas shape how we relate to other people. And you say, well, little children

1:47:19.520 --> 1:47:23.520
 do it. Well, little children don't have a funnel cortex. Why it's not relevant, right?

1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:32.640
 What happens as you develop a funnel cortex, as you develop the brain, you learn ideas. And those

1:47:32.640 --> 1:47:37.760
 ideas will shape how you relate to other people. And if you learn good ideas, you relate to other

1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:45.200
 people in a healthy, productive win win. And if you develop bad ideas, you will resent other people

1:47:45.200 --> 1:47:51.440
 and you will want their stuff. And the thing is that human progress depends on the win win

1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:57.920
 relationship. It depends on civilization depends on peace. It depends on allowing people going

1:47:57.920 --> 1:48:01.040
 back to what we talked about earlier, allowing people the freedom to think for themselves.

1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:08.160
 And anytime you try to interrupt that, you're causing damage. So this change in America is

1:48:08.160 --> 1:48:17.920
 not some reversion to a natural state. It's a shift in ideas. We, we still live the better

1:48:17.920 --> 1:48:24.080
 part of American society and the world still lives on the remnants of the Enlightenment.

1:48:25.280 --> 1:48:30.640
 The Enlightenment ideas, the ideas that brought about this scientific revolution,

1:48:30.640 --> 1:48:34.320
 the ideas that brought about the creation of this country. And it's the same basic ideas

1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:43.360
 that led to both of those. And as those ideas get more distant, as those ideas are not defended,

1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:51.920
 as those ideas disappear, as Enlightenment goes away, we will become more violent, more resentful,

1:48:51.920 --> 1:48:59.760
 more tribal, more obnoxious, more unpleasant, more primitive. A very specific example of this

1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:08.400
 that bothers me, I'd be curious to get your comment on. So Elon Musk is a billionaire.

1:49:08.400 --> 1:49:17.520
 Yeah. And one of the things that really, maybe it's almost a pet peeve, it really bothers me

1:49:17.520 --> 1:49:24.000
 when the press and the general public will say, well, all those rockets they're sending up there,

1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:30.960
 those are just like the toys, the games that billionaires play. That, to me,

1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:41.200
 the billionaire has become a dirty word to use, as if money can buy or has anything to do with

1:49:41.200 --> 1:49:53.840
 genius. I'm trying to articulate a specific line of question here, because it just bothers me.

1:49:53.840 --> 1:50:00.240
 I guess the question is, how do we get here and how do we get out of that? Because Elon Musk is

1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:06.320
 doing some of the most incredible things that a human being has ever participated in. He doesn't

1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:11.280
 build the rockets himself, he's getting a bunch of other geniuses together. That takes genius.

1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:18.480
 That takes genius. But where did we go and how do we get back to where Elon Musk is an inspiring

1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:24.960
 figure as opposed to a billionaire playing with some toys? So this is the role of philosophy.

1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:29.280
 It goes back to the same place. It goes back to our understanding of the world and our role in it.

1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:33.840
 And if you understand that the only way to become a billionaire, for example,

1:50:34.640 --> 1:50:39.040
 is to create value. Value for whom? Value for people who are going to consume it.

1:50:39.600 --> 1:50:44.560
 The only way to become a billionaire, the only way Elon Musk became a billionaire is through PayPal.

1:50:45.440 --> 1:50:50.960
 Now, PayPal is something we all use. PayPal is an enormous value to all of us. It's why it's

1:50:50.960 --> 1:51:00.160
 worth several billions of dollars, which Elon Musk could then earn. But you cannot become a billionaire

1:51:00.160 --> 1:51:06.800
 in a free society by exploiting people. Because you'll be laughed, nobody will deal with you.

1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:12.560
 Nobody will have any interactions with you. The only way to become a billionaire is to do billions

1:51:12.560 --> 1:51:19.120
 of win win transactions. So the only way to become a billionaire in a free society is to change the

1:51:19.120 --> 1:51:25.040
 world to make it a better place. Billionaires are the great humanitarians of our time, not because

1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:32.640
 they give charity, but because they make them billions. And it's true that money and genius

1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:38.800
 are not necessarily correlated. But you cannot become a billionaire without being super smart.

1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:44.400
 You cannot become a billionaire by figuring something out that nobody else has figured out

1:51:44.400 --> 1:51:48.960
 in whatever realm it happens to be. And that thing that you figure out has to be something

1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:56.400
 that provides immense value to other people. Where do we go wrong? We go wrong. Our culture goes

1:51:56.400 --> 1:52:04.640
 wrong because it views billionaires as selfish. And there's a sense in which, and not a sense,

1:52:04.640 --> 1:52:11.280
 it's absolutely true. The billionaire doesn't ask from my opinion on what product to launch.

1:52:11.280 --> 1:52:16.480
 Elon Musk doesn't ask others what they think you should spend his money on, what the greatest

1:52:16.480 --> 1:52:21.760
 social well being will be. I mean, there's a sense in which the Rockets are his toys.

1:52:21.760 --> 1:52:29.120
 There's a sense in which he chose that he would be inspired the most. He would have the most fun

1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:34.960
 by going to Mars and building rockets. And he probably dreamt of rockets from when he was a

1:52:34.960 --> 1:52:39.440
 kid and probably always played with rockets. And now he has the funds, the capital to be able to

1:52:39.440 --> 1:52:46.880
 deploy it. So he's being selfish. Obviously, he's being self interested. This is what Elon Musk is

1:52:46.880 --> 1:52:54.880
 about. I mean, the same with Jeff Bezos. There's no committee to decide whether to invest in

1:52:54.880 --> 1:53:02.080
 cloud computing or not. Bezos decided that. And at the end of the day, the bosses, they pursue

1:53:02.080 --> 1:53:07.920
 the values they believe are good. They create the wealth. It's their decisions. It's their mind.

1:53:07.920 --> 1:53:16.240
 And the fact is we live in a world where for 2000 plus years, self interest, even though we all do

1:53:16.240 --> 1:53:25.680
 it, to more extent or the less, we deem it as morally abhorrent. It's bad. It's wrong. I mean,

1:53:25.680 --> 1:53:30.640
 your mother probably taught you the same thing my mother taught me. Think of others first. Think

1:53:30.640 --> 1:53:36.720
 of yourself last. The good stuff is kept for the guests. You never get to use the good stuff.

1:53:36.720 --> 1:53:44.880
 It's others. That's what the focus of morality is now. No mother, even no Jewish mother,

1:53:44.880 --> 1:53:51.600
 actually believes that because they don't really want you to be last. They want you to be first

1:53:51.600 --> 1:53:57.760
 and they push you to be first. But morally, they taught their entire lives and they believe that

1:53:57.760 --> 1:54:08.080
 the right thing to say and to some extent do is to argue for sacrifice for other people. So most

1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:19.200
 people, 99% of people are torn. They know they should be self less sacrifice, live for other

1:54:19.200 --> 1:54:25.520
 people. They don't really want to. So they act selfishly in their day to day life and they feel

1:54:25.520 --> 1:54:30.880
 guilty and they can't be happy. They can't be happy and Jewish mothers and Catholic mothers are

1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:36.560
 excellent at using that guilt to manipulate you. But the guilt is inevitable because you've got these

1:54:36.560 --> 1:54:40.400
 two conflicting things, the way you want to live and the way you've been taught to live.

1:54:41.840 --> 1:54:49.040
 And what objectivism does is at the end of the day provides you with a way to unite morality,

1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:56.560
 a proper morality with what you want and to think about what you really want, to conceptualize what

1:54:56.560 --> 1:55:01.120
 you really want properly. So what you want is really good for you and what you want will really

1:55:01.120 --> 1:55:08.080
 lead to your happiness. So we reject the idea of sacrifice. We reject the idea of living for other

1:55:08.080 --> 1:55:15.920
 people. But you see, if you believe that the purpose of morality is to sacrifice for other people

1:55:15.920 --> 1:55:22.480
 and you look at Jeff Bezos, when was the last time he sacrificed anything, right? He's living

1:55:22.480 --> 1:55:28.720
 pretty well. He's got billions that he could give it all away. And yet he doesn't. How day,

1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:35.920
 you know, in my, in my talks, I often position and I'm going to use Bill Gates, sorry guys,

1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:41.600
 drop the conspiracy theory. They're all BS, complete and utter nonsense. There's not a

1:55:41.600 --> 1:55:48.720
 shred of truth. You know, I disagree with Bill Gates on everything political. I think he politically

1:55:48.720 --> 1:55:55.360
 is a complete ignoramus. But the guy's a genius when it comes to technology and when he's just

1:55:55.360 --> 1:56:00.640
 thoughtful, even in this philanthropy, he just uses his mind and I respect that even though

1:56:00.640 --> 1:56:06.720
 politically he's terrible. Anyway, think about this. Who, who had a bigger impact on the lives

1:56:06.720 --> 1:56:13.040
 of poor people in the world? Bill Gates or Mother Teresa? Bill Gates. It's not even close.

1:56:14.400 --> 1:56:18.480
 And Mother Teresa lived this altruistic life to the core. She lived it consistently.

1:56:19.040 --> 1:56:25.040
 And yet she was miserable, pathetic, horrible. She hated her life. She, she, she, she was miserable.

1:56:25.040 --> 1:56:29.120
 And most of people she helped didn't do very well because she just helped them not die.

1:56:29.840 --> 1:56:35.200
 Right. Yeah. And then Bill Gates changed all and he helped a lot of by providing technology. We

1:56:35.200 --> 1:56:40.080
 even philanthropy gets to them. The food gets them, fans, the more efficient. Yet who is the

1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:46.560
 moral saint? Saintshood is not determined based on what you do for other people. Saintshood is

1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:52.480
 based on how much, how much pain you suffer. I like to ask people to go to a museum and look at

1:56:52.480 --> 1:56:58.720
 all the paintings of saints. How many of them are smiling and are happy? They've usually got arrows

1:56:58.720 --> 1:57:03.280
 through them and holes in their body and they're just suffering a horrible death. The whole point

1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:13.840
 of the morality we are taught is that happiness is immorality. That happy people cannot be good

1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:21.440
 people and that good people suffer and that suffering is necessary for morality. Morality is

1:57:21.440 --> 1:57:29.360
 about sacrifice, self sacrifice and suffering. And at the end of the day, almost all the problems

1:57:29.360 --> 1:57:38.320
 in the world boil down to that false view. So can we try to talk about, part of it is the problem

1:57:38.320 --> 1:57:44.080
 of the word selfishness, but let's talk about the virtue of selfishness. So let's start at the fact

1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:52.720
 that for me, I really enjoy doing stuff for other people. I enjoy being cheering on the success of

1:57:52.720 --> 1:58:02.880
 others. Why? I don't know. It's deep in there. Why? Because I think you do know. If I were to really

1:58:02.880 --> 1:58:14.240
 think, I don't want to resort to like evolutionary arguments or like this. So I think... So I can

1:58:14.240 --> 1:58:19.440
 tell you why I enjoy helping others. Maybe you can go there, like one thing, because we'll

1:58:19.440 --> 1:58:24.400
 should talk about love a little bit. I'll tell you, there's a part of me that's a little bit

1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:32.240
 not rational. Like there's a gut that I follow that not everything I do is perfectly rational.

1:58:32.240 --> 1:58:38.480
 Like, for example, my dad criticizes me. He says like, you should always have a plan.

1:58:38.480 --> 1:58:45.360
 Like it should make sense. You have a strategy. And I say that, I left, I stepped down from

1:58:45.360 --> 1:58:50.960
 my full salary position at MIT. There's so many things I did without like a plan. It's a gut.

1:58:50.960 --> 1:58:55.680
 It's like, I want to start a company. Well, you know how many companies fail? I don't know.

1:58:57.680 --> 1:59:04.400
 It's just a gut. And the same thing with being kind to others is a gut. I watch the way that

1:59:04.400 --> 1:59:09.760
 karma works in this world, that the people like us, one guy I look up to is Joe Rogan,

1:59:09.760 --> 1:59:17.040
 that he does stuff for others. And that the joy he experiences, the way he sees the world, like

1:59:17.600 --> 1:59:24.080
 just the glimmer in his eyes because he does stuff for others that creates a joyful experience.

1:59:24.080 --> 1:59:31.200
 And that somehow seems to be an instructive way to, that to me is inspiring of a life while

1:59:31.200 --> 1:59:34.880
 lived. But you probably know a lot of people who have done stuff others were not happy.

1:59:34.880 --> 1:59:41.600
 True. So I don't think it's the doing stuff others that brings the happiness. It's why you

1:59:41.600 --> 1:59:48.800
 do stuff others and what else you're doing in your life and what is the proportion. But it's

1:59:48.800 --> 1:59:55.040
 why at the end of the day, which is, and it's the same. Look, you can maybe through a gut feeling

1:59:55.040 --> 1:59:59.920
 say, I want to start a company, but you better start doing thinking about how and what and all

1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:04.080
 of that. And to some extent, the why, because if you really want to be happy doing this, you may

2:00:04.080 --> 2:00:08.640
 better make sure you're doing it for the right reason. So I'm not, you know, there's something

2:00:08.640 --> 2:00:17.760
 called fast thinking, the common Daniel Kahneman. Daniel Kahneman talks about and it's, it's, it's,

2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:23.760
 you know, all the integrations you've made so far in your life cause you to have specialized

2:00:23.760 --> 2:00:29.760
 knowledge in certain things. And you can think very fast. And, and, and your gut tells you what

2:00:29.760 --> 2:00:34.720
 that, what the right answer is. It's, but it's not, it's, it's your mind is constantly evaluating

2:00:34.720 --> 2:00:40.080
 and constantly working. You want to make it as rational as you can, not in the sense that I

2:00:40.080 --> 2:00:44.880
 have to think through every time I make a decision, but that they've so programmed my mind in a sense

2:00:45.760 --> 2:00:51.200
 that the answers are the right answers, you know, in, in, in, when I get them.

2:00:51.200 --> 2:01:02.000
 So, you know, I like, I view other people as a value. Other people contribute enormously

2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:08.560
 to my life, whether it's a romantic love relationship, or whether it's a friendship

2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:16.320
 relationship, or whether it's just, you know, Jeff Bezos creating Amazon and, and delivering

2:01:16.320 --> 2:01:21.200
 goodies to my home when I get them. And, and, and people do all that, right? It's not just Jeff

2:01:21.200 --> 2:01:25.680
 Bezos. He gets the most credit, but everybody in that chain of command, everybody at Amazon

2:01:25.680 --> 2:01:32.880
 is working for me. I love that. I love the idea of a human being. I love the idea that they are

2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:39.520
 people capable of, of being an Einstein, of being, you know, and, and creating and building and making

2:01:39.520 --> 2:01:46.640
 stuff that makes my life so good. I, you know, most of us like, this is not a good room for an

2:01:46.640 --> 2:01:53.920
 example, most of us like plants, right? We like pets. I don't particularly, but people like pets. Why?

2:01:53.920 --> 2:02:00.960
 We like to see life. Yeah. Human beings are life on steroids, right? They're life with a brain.

2:02:00.960 --> 2:02:07.040
 It's amazing, right? What they can do. I love people. Now, that doesn't mean I love everybody

2:02:07.040 --> 2:02:11.840
 because there's some, they're really bad people out there who I hate, right? And I do hate.

2:02:11.840 --> 2:02:17.200
 And there are people out there that are just, I have no opinion about, but generally the idea

2:02:17.200 --> 2:02:23.200
 of a human being to me is a phenomenal idea. When I see a baby, I light up because to me,

2:02:23.760 --> 2:02:30.560
 there's a potential, you know, there's a, there's this magnificent potential that is embodied in

2:02:30.560 --> 2:02:36.960
 that. And when I see people struggling and need help, I think they're human beings that, you know,

2:02:36.960 --> 2:02:42.080
 they embody that potential. They embody that goodness. They might turn out to be bad,

2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:47.120
 but why would I ever give the presumption of that? I give them the presumption of the positive and I

2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:53.120
 cheer them on and, and I, and I, and I enjoy watching people succeed. I'm really watching

2:02:53.120 --> 2:02:58.320
 people get to the top of the mountain and produce something. Even if I don't get anything directly

2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:02.560
 from it. I enjoy that because it's part of my enjoyment of life.

2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:09.840
 So the word, see, to you, the morality of selfishness, this kind of love of other human

2:03:09.840 --> 2:03:13.840
 beings, the love of life fits into a morality of selfishness.

2:03:13.840 --> 2:03:20.800
 Can't not. Because it, it's, it, you, there's no context in which you can truly love yourself

2:03:20.800 --> 2:03:29.040
 without loving life and loving what it means to be human. So, you know, the love of yourself is

2:03:29.040 --> 2:03:34.000
 going to manifest itself definitely in different people, but it's core. What do you love about

2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:39.200
 yourself? First of all, I love, I love that I'm alive. I love that I, you know, I love this world

2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:44.160
 and the opportunities it provides me and the, the, the fun and the excitement of discovering

2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:50.320
 something new and meeting a new person and, and having a conversation. You know, all of this is,

2:03:50.320 --> 2:03:55.440
 is, is, is immensely enjoyable. But behind all of that is, is a particular human capability

2:03:55.440 --> 2:04:00.320
 that not only I have, other people have. And the fact that they have it makes my life so much more

2:04:00.320 --> 2:04:07.920
 fun because, so it's, it's, you cannot view, you know, it's all integrated and you cannot

2:04:07.920 --> 2:04:12.880
 view yourself in isolation. Now that doesn't, that doesn't place a moral commandment on me.

2:04:12.880 --> 2:04:20.880
 Help everybody who's poor that you happen to meet in the street. It doesn't place a burden on me in

2:04:20.880 --> 2:04:27.600
 a sense that now I have this moral duty to help everybody. It leaves me free to make decisions

2:04:27.600 --> 2:04:32.160
 about who I help and who I don't. There's some people who I will not help. There's some people

2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:40.720
 who I do not wish positive things upon. Bad people should have bad outcomes. Bad people should suffer.

2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:45.440
 So, and then you have the freedom to choose who's good, who's bad within your,

2:04:45.440 --> 2:04:50.000
 your decision based on your values. Now, I think there's an objectivity to it. There's a,

2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:54.240
 there's a standard by which you should evaluate good versus bad. And that standard should be,

2:04:54.240 --> 2:05:00.320
 to what extent do they contribute a hurt human life? The standard is human life. And so when I

2:05:00.320 --> 2:05:05.040
 say, look at a Jeff Bezos, I say, he's contributed to human life. Good guy. I might disagree with

2:05:05.040 --> 2:05:09.600
 him on stuff. We might disagree about politics. We might disagree about women. I don't know what we

2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:17.120
 agree. But overall, big picture. He is pro life. Right? I look at somebody like, you know, to take

2:05:17.680 --> 2:05:26.240
 like 99.9% of our politicians. And they are pro death. They are pro destruction. They are pro

2:05:26.240 --> 2:05:31.120
 cutting corners in ways that destroy human life and human potential and human ability.

2:05:31.120 --> 2:05:38.160
 So I literally hate almost every politician out there. And I wish ill on them. Right? I don't

2:05:38.160 --> 2:05:43.200
 want them to be successful or happy. I want them all to go away. Right? Leave me alone. So

2:05:44.160 --> 2:05:47.040
 I believe in justice. I believe good things should happen to good people and bad things

2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:51.760
 should happen to bad people. So I can, I make those generalizations based on this one,

2:05:52.480 --> 2:05:56.080
 you know, on the other hand, if you know, I shouldn't say all politicians, right? So if I,

2:05:56.080 --> 2:06:00.400
 you know, I love Thomas Jefferson and, and, and George Washington, right? I love Abraham Lincoln.

2:06:00.400 --> 2:06:04.880
 I love people who fought for freedom and who believed in freedom, who had his ideas and

2:06:04.880 --> 2:06:08.640
 lived up to at least in parts of their lives to those principles. Now,

2:06:08.640 --> 2:06:11.920
 do I think Thomas Jefferson was flawed because he held slaves? Absolutely.

2:06:12.720 --> 2:06:17.520
 But the virtues way outweigh that in my view. And I understand people who don't accept that.

2:06:17.520 --> 2:06:21.680
 You don't have to also love and hate the entirety of the person. There's parts of that

2:06:21.680 --> 2:06:25.360
 person that you, that you're directing. The major part is pro life. And therefore,

2:06:25.360 --> 2:06:29.920
 I'm pro that person. And, and I think, and I said earlier, the rejectivism philosophy of love.

2:06:29.920 --> 2:06:36.640
 And I believe that because objectivism is about your life, about loving your life,

2:06:36.640 --> 2:06:41.920
 about embracing your life, about engaging with the world, about loving the world in which you live,

2:06:42.480 --> 2:06:46.800
 about win, win relationships with other people, which means to a large extent loving

2:06:47.600 --> 2:06:52.000
 the good in other people and the, and the best in other people and encouraging that and supporting

2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:57.600
 that and promoting that. So I know selfishness is a harsh word because the culture has given

2:06:57.600 --> 2:07:01.840
 it that harshness. Selfishness is a harsh word because the people who don't like selfishness

2:07:01.840 --> 2:07:06.880
 want you to believe it's a harsh word. But it's not. What does it mean? It means

2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:13.280
 focus on self. It means take care of self. It means make yourself your highest priority,

2:07:13.280 --> 2:07:19.680
 not your only priority, because in taking care of self, what would I be without my wife?

2:07:20.240 --> 2:07:26.800
 What would I be without the people who support me, who help me, who, who, who I have these

2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:33.200
 love relationships with? It is so other people are crucial. What would my life be without,

2:07:34.080 --> 2:07:41.280
 you know, Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs, right? A lot of things you mentioned here are just beautiful.

2:07:41.280 --> 2:07:47.200
 So one is one win. So one key thing about this selfishness and the idea of objectivism is the

2:07:47.200 --> 2:07:54.400
 philosophy of love is that you don't want parasitism. So that goes, that is unethical.

2:07:54.400 --> 2:08:00.960
 So you actually, first of all, you say win, win a lot. And I just like that terminology because

2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:06.480
 it's a good way to see life is try to maximize the number of win, win interactions. Absolutely.

2:08:06.480 --> 2:08:10.880
 That's a good way to see business actually. Well, life generally, I think every aspect of life,

2:08:10.880 --> 2:08:15.120
 you want to have a win, win relationship with your wife. Imagine if it was wouldn't lose.

2:08:15.920 --> 2:08:22.080
 Either way, if you win and she loses, how long is that going to sustain? So win, lose relationships

2:08:22.080 --> 2:08:28.880
 are not in equilibrium. What they turn into is lose, lose. Like win, lose turns into lose, lose.

2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:33.440
 And the, so the alternative, the only alternative to lose, lose is win, win.

2:08:34.240 --> 2:08:38.320
 And you win and the person you love wins. What's better than that, right?

2:08:38.320 --> 2:08:44.320
 That's the way to maximize. So like the selfishness is you're trying to maximize the win,

2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:48.080
 but the way to maximize the win is to maximize the win, win.

2:08:48.080 --> 2:08:53.520
 Yes. And it turns out, and Adam Smith understood this a long time ago, that if you focus on your own

2:08:53.520 --> 2:08:59.600
 winning while respecting other people as human beings, then everybody wins. And the beauty of

2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:04.080
 capitalism, if we go back to capitalism for a second, the beauty of capitalism is you cannot

2:09:04.080 --> 2:09:10.560
 be successful in capitalism without producing values that other people appreciate and therefore

2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:15.440
 willing to buy from you. And they buy them and this goes back to that question about the engineer

2:09:15.440 --> 2:09:20.800
 and Steve Jobs. Why is the engineer working there? Because he's getting paid more than his time is

2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:25.920
 worth to him. I know people don't like to think in those terms, but that's the reality. If his

2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:32.320
 time is worth more to him than what he's getting paid, he would leave. So he's winning. And his

2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:35.920
 apple winning, yes, because they're getting more productivity from him, they're getting more from

2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:44.160
 him than what he's actually producing. It's tough because there's the human psychology and

2:09:44.160 --> 2:09:49.760
 imperfect information. It just makes it a little messier than the clarity of thinking you have

2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:57.600
 about this. Because for sure, but not everything in life is an economic transaction. It ultimately

2:09:58.560 --> 2:10:04.320
 is close. But even if it's not an economic transaction, even if it's a relationship

2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:10.240
 transaction, when you get to a point with a friend where you're now gaining from the relationship,

2:10:10.240 --> 2:10:15.360
 friendship is going to be over. Not immediately because it takes time for these things to manifest

2:10:15.360 --> 2:10:20.480
 itself and to really absorb into it. But we change friendships, we change our loves. We fall

2:10:20.480 --> 2:10:27.200
 in and out of love. We fall out of love because we're not love. So let's go back to love. Love

2:10:27.200 --> 2:10:34.160
 is the most selfish of all emotions. Love is about what you do to me. So I love my wife because she

2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:43.840
 makes me feel better about myself. So the idea of selfless love is bizarre. So Ayn Rand used to say,

2:10:43.840 --> 2:10:51.600
 before you said, I love you, you have to say the I. And you have to know who you are and you have

2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:55.600
 to appreciate yourself. If you hate yourself, what does it mean to love somebody else?

2:10:57.440 --> 2:11:01.040
 So I love my wife because she makes me feel great about the world.

2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:08.000
 Yeah. And she lives me for the same reason. And so Ayn Rand used to use this example. Imagine

2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:14.400
 you go up to your, to be spoused the night before the wedding, and you say, you know,

2:11:14.400 --> 2:11:20.640
 I get nothing out of this relationship. I'm doing this purely as an act of noble self sacrifice.

2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:29.920
 She would slap you as she should, right? So no, we know this intuitively that love is selfish,

2:11:29.920 --> 2:11:35.120
 but we are afraid to admit it to ourselves. And why? Because the other side has convinced us

2:11:35.120 --> 2:11:40.240
 that selfishness is associated with exploiting other people. Selfishness means lying,

2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:47.360
 cheating, stealing, walking in corpses, backstabbing people. But is that ever in your

2:11:47.360 --> 2:11:52.240
 self interest? Truly, right? You know, I'll often be in front of an audience to say,

2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:59.440
 okay, how many people here have lied? I'm kidding, right? How many of you think that that if you

2:11:59.440 --> 2:12:05.120
 did that consistently, that would make your life better. Nobody thinks that, right? Because

2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:11.680
 everybody's experienced how shitty lying, not because of how it makes you feel out of a sense

2:12:11.680 --> 2:12:17.760
 of guilt. Existentially, it's just a bad strategy, right? You get caught. You have to create other

2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:23.120
 lies to cover up the previous lie. It screws up with your own psychology and your own cognition.

2:12:23.120 --> 2:12:29.440
 You know, the mind, to some extent, like a computer, right, is an integrating machine.

2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:32.800
 And in computer science, I understand there's a term called garbage in, garbage out.

2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:41.760
 Lying is garbage in. Yeah. So it's not good strategy, cheating, screwing your customers

2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:47.040
 in a business, not paying your suppliers as a businessman, not good business practices,

2:12:47.040 --> 2:12:53.680
 not good practices for being alive. So win, win is both moral and practical and the beauty of

2:12:53.680 --> 2:12:58.640
 Iron Man's philosophy. And I think this is really important, is that the moral is the practical

2:12:58.640 --> 2:13:03.040
 and the practical is the moral. And therefore, if you are moral, you will be happy.

2:13:04.560 --> 2:13:12.080
 Yeah, that's why the application of the philosophy of objectivism is so easy to practice. So like,

2:13:12.080 --> 2:13:16.960
 they ought to discuss or possible to discuss. That's why you talk about all... So clear cut.

2:13:16.960 --> 2:13:20.960
 Yeah. I'm not ambiguous about my view. And it's fundamentally practical. I mean,

2:13:20.960 --> 2:13:27.120
 that's the best of philosophies is practical. Yes. It's in a sense, teaching you how to live a good

2:13:27.120 --> 2:13:32.560
 life. And it's teaching you how to live a good life, not just as you, but as a human being.

2:13:33.120 --> 2:13:38.000
 And then for the principles that apply to you, probably apply to me as well. And if we both

2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:42.000
 share the same principles of how to live a good life, we're not going to be enemies.

2:13:44.480 --> 2:13:51.200
 You brought up anarchy earlier. It's an interesting question, because you've kind of said

2:13:51.200 --> 2:13:56.880
 politicians, I mean, part of it is a little bit joking, but politicians are, you know, not good

2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:05.840
 people. Yeah. So, but we should have some. So you have an opposition to anarchism.

2:14:05.840 --> 2:14:10.640
 So they, first of all, they weren't always not bad people. That is, I gave examples of people

2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:15.360
 who engage in political life, who I think were good people basically. And, and, but they think

2:14:15.360 --> 2:14:21.840
 they get worse over time. If the system is corrupt. And I think the system, unfortunately,

2:14:21.840 --> 2:14:27.040
 even the American system, as good as it was, was founded on quicksand and have corruption built

2:14:27.040 --> 2:14:32.720
 in. They didn't quite get it. And, and they needed an invent to get it. So I'm not blaming

2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:37.520
 them. I don't think they, they show any blame. You needed a philosophy in order to completely

2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:42.160
 fulfill the promise that is America, or the promise that is the founding of.

2:14:42.160 --> 2:14:47.600
 So the, the place where the corruption is sneaked in is the lack in some way of the

2:14:47.600 --> 2:14:54.400
 philosophy underlying the nation? Absolutely. So, so it's Christianity. It's, it's, it's, you know,

2:14:54.400 --> 2:15:01.760
 not to hit on another controversial topic. It's religion, which, which undercut their morality.

2:15:01.760 --> 2:15:08.000
 So the founders were explicitly Christian and altruistic in their morality.

2:15:09.920 --> 2:15:13.360
 Implicitly in terms of their actions, they were completely secular and they were,

2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:18.480
 they were very secular anyway, but in their morality, even they were secular. So there's

2:15:18.480 --> 2:15:22.320
 nothing in Christianity that says that they, that the, you have an inalienable right to pursue

2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:27.760
 happiness. That's unbelievably self interested in a, in a, based on, on kind of a moral philosophy

2:15:27.760 --> 2:15:32.320
 of ego, of a egoistic moral philosophy, but they didn't know that and they didn't know how to

2:15:32.320 --> 2:15:37.040
 ground it. They implicitly, they had that fast thinking, that guts that told them that this was

2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:44.720
 right. And the whole enlightenment, that period from John Locke on to really to, to, to Hume,

2:15:44.720 --> 2:15:50.320
 that period is about pursuit of happiness using reason in pursuit of the good life, right? But

2:15:50.320 --> 2:15:54.480
 they can't ground it. They don't really understand what reason is and they don't really understand

2:15:54.480 --> 2:16:00.080
 what happiness requires and they can't detach and fell for Christianity. They're not allowed to

2:16:00.080 --> 2:16:05.120
 politically and they can't, I think conceptually, you just can't make that big break. Rand is an

2:16:05.120 --> 2:16:10.960
 enlightenment thinker in that sense. She is what should have followed right after, right? She should

2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:18.480
 have come then grounded them in the secular and in the egoistic and there was the Tillion view

2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:25.360
 of morality as, as a, as a, as a code of values to basically to guide your life, to guide your life

2:16:25.360 --> 2:16:35.760
 towards happiness. That's Aristotle's view, right? So they didn't have that. So you, you know, so I

2:16:35.760 --> 2:16:40.320
 think that government is necessary. It's not a necessary evil. It's a necessary good because

2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:47.440
 it does something good. And the good that it does is it eliminates coercion from society. It

2:16:47.440 --> 2:16:54.400
 eliminates violence from society. It eliminates the use of force between individuals from society.

2:16:55.280 --> 2:17:01.520
 And that, but see the argument that Michael Malone should make. Give me a chance here.

2:17:02.400 --> 2:17:08.000
 Is why can't you apply the same kind of reasoning that you've effectively used for the rest

2:17:08.640 --> 2:17:15.920
 of mutually agreed upon institutions that are driven by capitalism, that we can't also hire

2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:22.320
 forces to protect us from the violence, to ensure the stability of society that protects us from the

2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:29.200
 violence? Why, why, why draw the line at this particular place, right? Well, because there

2:17:29.200 --> 2:17:34.080
 is no other place to draw a line and there is a line. And by the way, we draw lines other places,

2:17:34.080 --> 2:17:46.960
 right? We don't vote. We don't, we don't have, we don't determine truth and science based on

2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:53.680
 competition. Right. So that's a, that's a line. But first off, some people might say, I mean,

2:17:53.680 --> 2:17:58.240
 there's competition in a sense that you have alternate theories. But at the end of the day,

2:17:58.240 --> 2:18:05.440
 whether you decide that this he's right or he's right is not based on the market. It's based on

2:18:06.080 --> 2:18:13.120
 facts, on reality, on objective reality. You have to, you, and some people will never accept

2:18:13.120 --> 2:18:18.960
 that this person is right because they don't see the stream. So first of all, what they reject,

2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:24.640
 what most anarchists reject, even if they don't admit it or recognize it, is they object,

2:18:24.640 --> 2:18:32.240
 they, they reject objective reality. In which sense. So like, right. So there's a whole,

2:18:32.880 --> 2:18:44.960
 so the, the whole realm of law is a scientific realm to define, for example, the boundaries of

2:18:44.960 --> 2:18:53.840
 private property. It's not an issue of competition. It's not an issue of, of, of, I have one system

2:18:53.840 --> 2:18:59.520
 and you have another system. It's an issue of objective reality. And now it's more difficult

2:18:59.520 --> 2:19:05.040
 than science in a sense, because it's more difficult to prove that my conception of property is

2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:11.840
 correct and you're correct. But there has, there is a correct one. In reality, there's a correct

2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:20.960
 vision. It's more abstract. But look, somebody has to decide what property is. So I have, I have to

2:19:20.960 --> 2:19:28.640
 find, my property is defined by certain boundaries. And I have a police force and I have a judiciary

2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:34.880
 system that backs my vision. And you have a claim against my property. You have a claim

2:19:34.880 --> 2:19:39.680
 against my property. And you have a police force and a judicial system that backs your claim.

2:19:41.120 --> 2:19:46.880
 Who's right? So the, our definitions of property are different. Yeah. So our definitions of property

2:19:46.880 --> 2:19:53.280
 or a claim on the property is different. So what, what, so, so just agree on the definition of property.

2:19:54.240 --> 2:19:58.880
 And, but why should we agree, right? Your judicial system is one definition of property.

2:19:58.880 --> 2:20:04.240
 My judicial system is done. You, you think that there's no such thing as intellectual property

2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:09.680
 rights. And your whole system believes that. Yeah. And my whole system believes there is such thing.

2:20:09.680 --> 2:20:16.080
 So you are duplicating my books and handing them out to all your friends and not paying me a royalty.

2:20:16.080 --> 2:20:23.440
 Yeah. And I, I think that's wrong. My judicial system and my police force think that's wrong.

2:20:24.000 --> 2:20:30.640
 And we're both living in the same geographic area, right? So we have overlapping jurisdictions.

2:20:31.600 --> 2:20:36.640
 Now the anarchists would say, well, we'll negotiate. Why should we negotiate? My system is

2:20:36.640 --> 2:20:39.600
 actually right. There is such a thing as intellectual property rights. There's no

2:20:39.600 --> 2:20:43.520
 negotiation here. You're wrong. And you should either pay a fine or go to jail.

2:20:43.520 --> 2:20:48.880
 Yeah. But why can't, because it's a community is multiple, there's multiple parties and it's

2:20:48.880 --> 2:20:53.760
 like a majority vote. They'll, they'll hire different forces that says, yeah, Yaron is,

2:20:53.760 --> 2:20:57.200
 is onto something here with the definition of property and we'll go with that.

2:20:57.200 --> 2:21:02.000
 So anarchists pro democracy in the, in the majority rule sense, I don't think so.

2:21:02.000 --> 2:21:07.680
 Well, I think, I think anarchy, you know, so it promotes like emergent democracy, right?

2:21:07.680 --> 2:21:13.680
 Like, no, it doesn't. I'll tell you what it promotes. It promotes emergent, uh,

2:21:13.680 --> 2:21:19.040
 strife and civil war and violence, constant uninterrupted violence, because the only way

2:21:19.040 --> 2:21:25.600
 to settle the dispute between us, since we both think that we are right. And we have guns behind

2:21:25.600 --> 2:21:31.760
 us to protect that. And we have a legal system. We have a whole theory of ideas is, is you're

2:21:31.760 --> 2:21:39.840
 stealing my stuff. How do I get it back? I invade you, right? I take over, you know, and, and who's

2:21:39.840 --> 2:21:44.400
 going to, who's going to win that battle? The smartest guy? Oh, the guy with the biggest guns.

2:21:44.400 --> 2:21:51.680
 See, but the anarchists would say that they're using implied, like the state uses implied force.

2:21:51.680 --> 2:21:56.000
 They're already doing violence because they, they, they take the state as it is today,

2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:01.200
 and they refuse to engage in the conversation about what a state should and could look like.

2:22:01.200 --> 2:22:07.680
 And how we can create mechanisms to protect us from the state using those, those, but look,

2:22:07.680 --> 2:22:13.760
 this is, my view of anarchy is very simple. It's a ridiculous position. It's infantile. I mean,

2:22:13.760 --> 2:22:18.560
 I really mean this, right? And, and I'm sorry to Michael, but, and, and all the other very, very smart,

2:22:19.280 --> 2:22:24.720
 very, very smart anarchists, because anarchists is never, you won't find a dumb anarchist,

2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:31.520
 right? Because dumb people know it wouldn't work. You have to have, it's absolutely true.

2:22:31.520 --> 2:22:37.200
 You have to have a certain IQ to be an anarchist. That's true. They're all really intelligent.

2:22:37.200 --> 2:22:45.680
 All intelligence. And the reason is that you have to create such a mythology in your head.

2:22:45.680 --> 2:22:52.480
 You have to create so many rationalizations. Any Joe in the street knows it doesn't work,

2:22:52.480 --> 2:22:59.040
 because they can understand what happens with two people who are armed in the street

2:22:59.040 --> 2:23:05.600
 and have a dispute. And there's no mechanism to resolve that dispute. Yeah. That's objective.

2:23:05.600 --> 2:23:10.240
 That's separate. And this is where it gets subjective. That's objective. The whole point of

2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:19.200
 government is that it is the objective authority for determining the truth in one regard, in regard

2:23:19.200 --> 2:23:27.120
 to force, because the only alternative to determining it when it comes to force is through force.

2:23:27.680 --> 2:23:32.960
 The only way to resolve disputes is through force or through this negotiation, which is unjust,

2:23:32.960 --> 2:23:38.640
 because if one party's right and one party's wrong, why negotiate? And, and this is the point. I'm

2:23:38.640 --> 2:23:44.320
 not against competition of governance. I'm all for competition of governance. We do that all the

2:23:44.320 --> 2:23:49.440
 time. It's called countries. The United States has a certain governance structure. The Soviet

2:23:49.440 --> 2:23:53.280
 Union had a governance structure. Mexico has a governance structure. And they're competing.

2:23:54.000 --> 2:23:59.440
 And we can observe the competition. And in my world, you could move freely from one governance

2:23:59.440 --> 2:24:03.680
 to another. If you didn't like your governance, you would move to a better governance system.

2:24:03.680 --> 2:24:08.560
 But they have to have autonomy within a geographic area. Otherwise, what you get

2:24:08.560 --> 2:24:14.320
 is complete and out of civil war. The law needs to be objective. And there needs to be one law

2:24:14.320 --> 2:24:18.000
 over a piece of ground. And if you disagree with that law, you can move somewhere else where they

2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:22.960
 may. This is why federalism is such a beautiful system. Even within the United States, we have

2:24:22.960 --> 2:24:27.840
 states. And on certain issues, we're allowed to disagree between states, like the death penalty

2:24:27.840 --> 2:24:32.960
 some states do, some states don't. Fine. And now I can move from one state if I don't like it.

2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:37.200
 But there's certain issues you cannot have disagreement. Slavery, for example, this is

2:24:37.200 --> 2:24:44.800
 why we had a civil war. But let me one other argument against Anarchy. Markets exist

2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:52.960
 where force has been eliminated. So I can say that again. Markets exist where the rule of

2:24:52.960 --> 2:25:03.120
 force has been eliminated. The rule of force. Yes. So a market will exist if we know that you

2:25:03.120 --> 2:25:08.160
 can't pull a gun on me and just take my stuff. I'm willing to engage in transaction with you if

2:25:08.960 --> 2:25:12.240
 we have an implicit understanding that we're not going to use force against each other.

2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:19.360
 So force has something special to it. Yes. It's a special. It overrides. Because we're still

2:25:19.360 --> 2:25:25.680
 agreeing we can manipulate each other. Yes. But force, we can't force kind of. So what is it

2:25:25.680 --> 2:25:30.960
 about something fundamental about violence? Force is a is a fundamental force. It's the

2:25:30.960 --> 2:25:39.600
 anti reason. It's the anti life. It's the anti force against another person. And it's what it does

2:25:39.600 --> 2:25:47.920
 is shuts down the mind. Right. So in order to have a market, you have to extract force.

2:25:49.360 --> 2:25:55.680
 How can you have a market in force? When I there's an Instagram channel called nature's

2:25:55.680 --> 2:26:03.280
 metal where it has all these videos of animals basically having a market of force. Yes.

2:26:03.920 --> 2:26:08.480
 But that shuts down the ability to reason and animals don't need to because they can't. Exactly.

2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:14.320
 So the innovation that is human beings is a capacity to reason and therefore the relegation

2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:19.360
 of force to the animals. We don't do force. Civilization is where we don't have force.

2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:27.600
 And so what you have is you cannot have a market in that which a market requires the

2:26:27.600 --> 2:26:32.080
 elimination of it. And I, you know, I, I don't debate formally these guys,

2:26:32.080 --> 2:26:36.800
 but I interact with them all the time. Right. And you get these absurd arguments where, you

2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:40.880
 know, David Friedman will say, that's Milton Friedman's son, he will say something like,

2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:45.200
 well, in Somalia, in the northern part of Somalia, where they have no government,

2:26:45.200 --> 2:26:51.680
 you have all these wonderful, you have these tribal tribunals of these tribes and they resolve

2:26:51.680 --> 2:26:58.560
 disputes. Yeah. Barbarically, they show real law. They have no respect for individual rights,

2:26:58.560 --> 2:27:03.120
 no respect for property. And the only reason they have any authority is because they have

2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:09.360
 guns and they have power and they have force. And they do it barbarically. There's nothing

2:27:09.360 --> 2:27:17.680
 civilizing about the courts of Somalia. And, and they write about pirates and because they view

2:27:17.680 --> 2:27:23.040
 force, they don't view force as something unique that must be extracted from human life.

2:27:23.040 --> 2:27:27.280
 And that's why Anarchy has to devolve into violence because it treats forces just,

2:27:28.400 --> 2:27:31.600
 what's the big deal with negotiating, you know, over guns.

2:27:32.240 --> 2:27:36.560
 So we covered a lot of high level philosophy, but I'd like to touch on

2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:44.640
 the troubles, the chaos of the day, a couple of things. And I really would,

2:27:45.760 --> 2:27:54.960
 trying to find a hopeful path way out. So one is the current coronavirus pandemic,

2:27:54.960 --> 2:28:03.040
 or in particular, not the virus, but our handling of it. Is there something philosophically,

2:28:03.040 --> 2:28:09.040
 politically, that you would like to see that you would like to recommend that you would like to

2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:14.160
 maybe give a hopeful message, if we take that kind of trajectory, we might be able to get out.

2:28:14.160 --> 2:28:20.000
 Because I'm kind of worried about the economic pain that people are feeling that there's this

2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:24.800
 quiet suffering. I mean, I agree with you completely. There is a quiet suffering. It's

2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:29.840
 horrible. I mean, I know people, you know, I go to a lot of restaurants. One of the things we

2:28:29.840 --> 2:28:35.760
 love to do is eat out. My wife doesn't like cooking anymore. We don't have kids in the house anymore,

2:28:35.760 --> 2:28:39.600
 so she doesn't have to. So we go out a lot. We go to restaurants. And because we have our favorites,

2:28:39.600 --> 2:28:45.360
 we go to them a lot. We get to know the owners of the restaurant, the chef. And it's just

2:28:45.360 --> 2:28:50.960
 heartbreaking. You know, these people put their life, you know, their blood, sweat, and tears.

2:28:50.960 --> 2:28:56.320
 I mean, real blood, sweat, and tears into these projects. Restaurants are super difficult to

2:28:56.320 --> 2:29:01.600
 manage. Most of them go bankrupt anyway. And the restaurants, we go to a good restaurant,

2:29:01.600 --> 2:29:09.040
 so they've done a good job. And they've got a unique value. And they shut them down.

2:29:10.560 --> 2:29:15.040
 And, you know, many of them will never open. You know, something like they estimate 50,

2:29:15.040 --> 2:29:19.040
 60% of restaurants in some places won't open. These are people's lives. These are people's

2:29:19.040 --> 2:29:23.120
 capital. These are people's effort. These are people's love. Talk about love. They love what

2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:28.400
 they do, particularly if they're the chef as well. And it's gone. And it's disappeared. And what are

2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:31.200
 they going to do with their lives now? They're going to live off the government the way our

2:29:31.200 --> 2:29:35.600
 politicians would like them, bigger and bigger stimulus plans so we can hand checks to people

2:29:35.600 --> 2:29:40.960
 to get them used to living off of us rather than it's disgusting and it's offensive and it's

2:29:40.960 --> 2:29:45.440
 unbelievably sad. And this is where it comes to this. I care about other people. I mean,

2:29:45.440 --> 2:29:50.560
 this idea that objectivists don't care. I mean, I love these people who provide me with pleasure

2:29:50.560 --> 2:29:53.840
 of eating wonderful food in a great environment.

2:29:54.640 --> 2:29:58.400
 There's something inspiring about them too. Like when I say great restaurants,

2:29:58.400 --> 2:30:04.000
 I want to do better with my own stuff. Yeah, exactly. It's inspiring. Anybody who does it

2:30:04.000 --> 2:30:09.280
 is excellent. I love sports because it's the one realm in which you'd still value and celebrate

2:30:09.280 --> 2:30:15.840
 excellence. But I try to celebrate excellence, everything in my life. So I try to be nice to

2:30:15.840 --> 2:30:21.520
 these people and, you know, with COVID, we went more to restaurants, if you believe it. We did

2:30:21.520 --> 2:30:26.960
 more takeout stuff. We made an effort, particularly the restaurants. We really love to keep them

2:30:26.960 --> 2:30:33.600
 going, to encourage them to support them. The problem is, the problem is philosophy drives the

2:30:33.600 --> 2:30:41.840
 world. The response to COVID has been worse than pathetic. And it's driven by philosophy.

2:30:41.840 --> 2:30:48.560
 It's driven by disrespect to science, ignorance and disrespect of statistics,

2:30:49.760 --> 2:30:54.720
 a disrespect of individual human decision making. Government has to decide everything for us.

2:30:56.160 --> 2:31:00.560
 And just throughout the process and a disrespect of markets, because we didn't let

2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:05.040
 markets work to facilitate what we needed in order to deal with this virus.

2:31:05.760 --> 2:31:10.160
 If you look at the play, it's interesting that the only place on the planet that's done well

2:31:10.160 --> 2:31:16.000
 with this, a parts of Asia, right? Taiwan did phenomenally with this. And the vice president

2:31:16.000 --> 2:31:22.000
 of Taiwan is an epidemiologist. So he knew what he was doing. And they got it right from the

2:31:22.000 --> 2:31:29.920
 beginning. South Korea did amazing. Even Hong Kong and Singapore. Hong Kong is just very few deaths.

2:31:31.520 --> 2:31:36.880
 And the economy wasn't shut down in any of those places. There were no lockdowns in any of those

2:31:36.880 --> 2:31:46.960
 places. The CDC had plans before this happened and how to deal with good plans. Indeed, if you

2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:51.920
 ask people around the world before the pandemic, which country is best prepared for a pandemic

2:31:51.920 --> 2:31:56.960
 they would have said the United States because of the CDC's plans and all of our emergency reserves

2:31:56.960 --> 2:32:04.080
 and all that and the wealth. And yet all of that went out the window because people panicked.

2:32:04.080 --> 2:32:13.680
 People didn't think, go back to reason. People were arrogant, refused to use the tools that

2:32:13.680 --> 2:32:18.160
 they had at their disposal to deal with this. So you deal with pandemics. It's very simple how

2:32:18.160 --> 2:32:21.840
 you deal with pandemics. And this is how South Korea and Taiwan interview. You deal with them by

2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:31.040
 testing, tracing and isolating. That's it. And you do it well. And you do it vigorously. And you

2:32:31.040 --> 2:32:35.680
 do it on scale if you have to. And you scale up to do it. We have the wealth to do that.

2:32:35.680 --> 2:32:44.480
 So one question I have, it's a difficult one. So I talk about love a lot. And you've just talked

2:32:44.480 --> 2:32:49.520
 about Donald Trump. I guarantee you this particular segment would be full of division from the

2:32:49.520 --> 2:32:59.200
 internet. But I believe that should be and can be fixed. What I'm referring to in particular is the

2:32:59.200 --> 2:33:06.240
 division, because we've talked about the value of reason. And what I've noticed on the internet is

2:33:06.240 --> 2:33:13.280
 the division shuts down reason. So when people hear you say Trump, actually the first sentence

2:33:13.280 --> 2:33:18.080
 you said about Trump, they'll hear Trump and their ears will perk up. And they'll immediately

2:33:18.080 --> 2:33:22.640
 start in that first sentence, they'll say, is he a Trump supporter or a Trump?

2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:27.360
 They're not interested in anything else after that. And then after that, that's it. And what,

2:33:27.360 --> 2:33:34.720
 how do, so my question is, you as one of the beacons of intellectualism, well, you're quite

2:33:34.720 --> 2:33:42.400
 honest. I mean, it sounds silly to say, but you are a beacon of reason. How do we bring people

2:33:42.400 --> 2:33:51.440
 together long enough to where we can reason? I mean, there's no easy way out of this because

2:33:51.440 --> 2:34:00.640
 the fact that people have become tribal and they have very tribal. And the tribe in the tribe

2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:05.360
 reason doesn't matter. It's all about emotion. It's all about belonging and not belonging. And

2:34:05.360 --> 2:34:10.080
 you don't want to stand out. You don't want to have a different opinion. You want to belong. And

2:34:10.080 --> 2:34:18.320
 it's all about belonging. It took us decades to get back to tribalism where we were hundreds of

2:34:18.320 --> 2:34:24.480
 years ago. It took millennium to get out of tribalism. It took the enlightenment to get

2:34:24.480 --> 2:34:28.640
 us to the point of individualism where we think for and reason, respectful reason. Before that,

2:34:28.640 --> 2:34:33.040
 we were all tribal. So it took the enlightenment to get us out of it. We've been in the enlightenment

2:34:33.040 --> 2:34:38.960
 for about 250 years influenced by the enlightenment and worth and it's fading. The impact is fading.

2:34:39.680 --> 2:34:42.960
 So what would we need to get out of it? We need self esteem.

2:34:42.960 --> 2:34:50.400
 People join a tribe because they don't trust their own mind. People join a tribe because they're afraid

2:34:50.400 --> 2:34:54.960
 to stand on their own two feet. They're afraid to think for themselves. They're afraid to be different.

2:34:54.960 --> 2:35:00.800
 They're afraid to be unique. They're afraid to be an individual. People need self esteem. To gain

2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:07.840
 self esteem, they have to have respect for rationality. They have to think and they have to

2:35:07.840 --> 2:35:12.960
 have respect for rationality. They have to think and they have to achieve and they have to recognize

2:35:12.960 --> 2:35:21.040
 that achievement. To do that, they have to be, they have to have respect for thinking. They

2:35:21.040 --> 2:35:26.800
 have to have respect for reason. And we have to think about the schools. We have to have schools

2:35:26.800 --> 2:35:32.320
 that teach people to think, teach people to value their mind. We have schools that teach people

2:35:32.320 --> 2:35:37.520
 and value their feelings. We have groups of six year olds sitting around a circle discussing politics.

2:35:37.520 --> 2:35:43.120
 What? They don't know anything. They're ignorant. So you don't know anything when you're ignorant.

2:35:43.120 --> 2:35:51.120
 Yes, you can feel, but your feelings are useless as decision making tools. But we emphasize emotion.

2:35:51.120 --> 2:35:57.360
 It's all about socialization and emotion. This is why they talk about this generation of snowflakes.

2:35:57.360 --> 2:36:03.360
 They can't hear anything that they're opposed to because they've not learned how to use their mind,

2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:10.800
 how to think. So it boils down to teaching people how to think, two things. How to think

2:36:10.800 --> 2:36:16.240
 and how to care about themselves. So it's thinking of self esteem and they're connected

2:36:16.240 --> 2:36:22.000
 because when you think, you achieve, which gains your self esteem. When you have self esteem,

2:36:22.000 --> 2:36:30.080
 it's easier to think for yourself. And I don't know how you do that quickly. I think leadership

2:36:30.080 --> 2:36:37.520
 matters. So part of what I try to do is try to encourage people to do those things. But I am

2:36:37.520 --> 2:36:42.160
 a small voice. You asked me when early on, you said we should talk about why I'm not more famous.

2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:48.480
 I'm not famous. My following is not big. It's very small in the scope of things.

2:36:48.480 --> 2:36:53.040
 Well, yours and objectivism and that question, could you linger on it for a moment?

2:36:53.600 --> 2:37:02.720
 Why isn't objectivism more famous? I think because it's so challenging. It's not challenging to me,

2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:08.640
 right? When I first encountered objectivism, it's like after the first shock and after the first

2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:15.200
 kind of, none of this can be true. This is all BS. In fighting it, once I got it,

2:37:15.200 --> 2:37:20.400
 it was easy. It was easy. It required years of studying, but it was easy in the sense of,

2:37:20.400 --> 2:37:26.640
 yes, this makes sense. But it's challenging because it upends everything. It really says

2:37:26.640 --> 2:37:32.720
 what my mother taught me is wrong. And when my politicians say left and right is wrong,

2:37:32.720 --> 2:37:38.560
 all of them, there's not a single politician on which I agree with on almost anything,

2:37:38.560 --> 2:37:45.280
 right? Because on the fundamentals, we disagree. And what my teachers are telling me is wrong.

2:37:45.280 --> 2:37:53.680
 And what Jesus said is wrong. And it's hard. But the thing is, so you talk about politics and all

2:37:53.680 --> 2:37:59.200
 that kind of stuff, but most people don't care. The more powerful thing about objectivism is the

2:37:59.200 --> 2:38:06.560
 practical of my life, of how I revolutionize my life. And that feels to be like a very

2:38:06.560 --> 2:38:14.640
 important and appealing, get your shit together. Yeah, but this is why Jordan Peterson is so

2:38:14.640 --> 2:38:19.680
 much more successful than we are, right? Make your bed or whatever. Make your bed.

2:38:19.680 --> 2:38:25.520
 Yeah, because his personal responsibility is shallow. It's make your bed, stand up straight.

2:38:25.520 --> 2:38:28.880
 It's what my mother told me when I was growing up. There's nothing new about Jordan Peterson.

2:38:28.880 --> 2:38:36.880
 And he says, embrace Christianity. Christianity is fine, right? Religion is okay. Just do these

2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:43.600
 few things and you'll be fine. And by the way, he says, happiness, you either have it or you don't.

2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:47.040
 You know, it's random. You don't actually, you can't bring about your own happiness.

2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:52.800
 So he's given people an easy out. People want easy out. People buy self help books that give

2:38:52.800 --> 2:38:59.600
 them five principles for living it, you know, shallow. I'm telling them, think, stand on your

2:38:59.600 --> 2:39:07.440
 own two feet. Be independent. Don't listen to your mother. Do your own thing. But thoughtfully,

2:39:07.440 --> 2:39:14.720
 not based on emotions. So you're responsible not just for a set of particular habits and so on.

2:39:14.720 --> 2:39:19.760
 You're responsible for everything. Yes. And you respond. Here's the big one, right?

2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:30.400
 You're responsible for shaping your own soul. Your consciousness, you get to decide what it's

2:39:30.400 --> 2:39:36.560
 going to be like. And the only tool you have is your mind. Your only reason is your mind. Well,

2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:41.600
 your emotions play a tool when they're properly cultivated. They play a role in that. And the

2:39:41.600 --> 2:39:46.480
 tools you have is thinking, experiencing, living, coming to the right conclusions,

2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:53.040
 you know, listening to great music and watching good movies and art is very important in shaping

2:39:53.040 --> 2:40:02.080
 your own soul and helping you do this. It's got a crucial role in that. But it's work. And it's

2:40:03.040 --> 2:40:08.560
 lonely work because it's what you do with yourself. Now, if you find somebody who you love, who shares

2:40:08.560 --> 2:40:13.520
 these values and you can do with them, that's great. But it's mostly lonely work. It's hard.

2:40:13.520 --> 2:40:21.760
 It's challenging. It ends your world. The reward is unbelievable. But even at the, think about,

2:40:21.760 --> 2:40:26.640
 think about the Enlightenment, right? So up until the Enlightenment, where was truth?

2:40:26.640 --> 2:40:31.440
 Truth came from our book. And there were a few people who understood the book. Most of us couldn't

2:40:31.440 --> 2:40:36.000
 read and they conveyed it to us and they just told us what to do. And in that sense, life's easy.

2:40:36.000 --> 2:40:42.560
 It sucks. And we die young and we have nothing and we don't enjoy it. But it's easy. And the

2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:50.080
 Enlightenment comes around and says, we've got this tool. It's called reason. And it allows us to

2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:54.800
 discover truth about the world. It's not in a book. It's actually your reason allows you to

2:40:54.800 --> 2:41:00.560
 discover stuff about the world. And I consider the first, really the first figure of the Enlightenment

2:41:00.560 --> 2:41:07.760
 is Newton, not Locke, right? It's a scientist because he teaches us the laws of mechanics,

2:41:07.760 --> 2:41:15.200
 like how does stuff work? And people go, oh, wow, this is cool. I can use my mind. I can discover

2:41:15.200 --> 2:41:21.680
 truth. Isn't that amazing? And everything opens up when you do that. Hey, if I can discover,

2:41:21.680 --> 2:41:26.080
 if I understand the laws of motion, if I can understand truth in the world, how come I can't

2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:31.760
 decide who I marry? I mean, everything was fixed in those lists. How come I can't decide what

2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:36.000
 profession I should be in, right? Everybody will belong to a guild. How come I can't decide who

2:41:36.000 --> 2:41:42.480
 I'm a political leader should be? So it's all reason. It's all once you understand the efficacy

2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:46.560
 of your own mind to understand truth, to understand reality, discover truth, not understand truth,

2:41:46.560 --> 2:41:51.680
 discover it. Everything opens up. Now you can take responsibility for your own life because now you

2:41:51.680 --> 2:41:58.000
 have the tool to do it. But we are living in an era where postmodernism tells us there is no truth,

2:41:58.000 --> 2:42:03.680
 there is no reality, and our mind is useless anyway. Critical race theory tells us that

2:42:03.680 --> 2:42:08.480
 you're determined by your race, and your race shapes everything, and your free will is meaningless,

2:42:08.480 --> 2:42:13.440
 and your reason doesn't matter because reason is just shaped by your genes and shaped by your

2:42:13.440 --> 2:42:20.400
 color of your skin. It's the most racist theory of all. And you've got our friend at UC Irvine

2:42:20.400 --> 2:42:25.040
 telling them, oh, your senses don't tell you anything about reality anyway. Reality is what

2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:30.240
 it is. So what's the purpose of reason? It's to invent stuff. It's to make stuff up. And what

2:42:30.240 --> 2:42:36.960
 use is that? It's complete fantasy. You've basically got every philosophical intellectual voice in the

2:42:36.960 --> 2:42:45.280
 culture telling them their reason is impotent. There's like a Steven Pinker who tries and I love

2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:52.160
 Pinker and he's really good and I love his books. But you know, he needs to be stronger about this.

2:42:53.200 --> 2:42:56.960
 And there's a few people on kind of there's a few people partially in the intellectual

2:42:56.960 --> 2:43:02.400
 doc web and otherwise who are big on reason, but not consistent enough and not full understanding

2:43:02.400 --> 2:43:09.680
 of what it means or what it implies. And then there's little old me. And it's me against the

2:43:09.680 --> 2:43:16.400
 world in a sense, because I'm not only willing to accept to articulate the case for reason,

2:43:16.400 --> 2:43:21.440
 but then what that implies. It implies freedom. It implies capitalism. It implies taking personal

2:43:21.440 --> 2:43:25.920
 responsibility over your own life. And there are other intellectual doc web people get to reason

2:43:25.920 --> 2:43:31.520
 and then oh politics, you can be whatever. No, you can't. You can't be a socialist. And for reason,

2:43:31.520 --> 2:43:37.120
 right? It doesn't actually that those are incompatible. And you can't be a determinist.

2:43:37.120 --> 2:43:42.720
 And for reason, reason and determinism don't go together. The whole point of reason is that it's

2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:48.560
 an achievement. It requires effort and requires engagement. It requires choice. So it is it does

2:43:48.560 --> 2:43:54.400
 feel like a little me because that's that's it. I the allies I have allies. I have allies among

2:43:54.400 --> 2:43:59.040
 the some libertarians over economics. I have some allies in the intellectual doc web, maybe over

2:43:59.040 --> 2:44:04.320
 reason, but none of them are allies in the full sense. So my allies are the other objectivists,

2:44:04.320 --> 2:44:11.280
 but we're just they're not a lot of us. For people listening to this, for the few folks kind

2:44:11.280 --> 2:44:18.720
 of listening to this and thinking about the trajectory of their own life. I guess the takeaway

2:44:18.720 --> 2:44:26.640
 is reason is a difficult project, but a project that's worthy of taking on.

2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:32.480
 Yeah, difficult is I don't know if difficult is the right word because difficult sounds like it's,

2:44:32.480 --> 2:44:36.800
 you know, I have to push this bolder up a hill. It's not difficult in that sense.

2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:41.920
 It's difficult in the sense that it requires energy and focus. It requires effort. But it's

2:44:41.920 --> 2:44:51.760
 immediately rewarding. It's fun to do. And it's rewards immediate, pretty quick, right? It takes

2:44:51.760 --> 2:44:56.560
 a while to undo all the garbage that you have. But we all have that I had that took me years and

2:44:56.560 --> 2:45:01.040
 years and years to get rid of certain concepts and certain emotions that I had that didn't make any

2:45:01.040 --> 2:45:08.480
 sense. But it takes a long time to fully integrate that. So I don't want it to sound like it's a

2:45:08.480 --> 2:45:14.720
 burden. Like it's hard in that sense. It does require focus and energy. And I don't want to

2:45:14.720 --> 2:45:19.680
 sound like a Dr. Spock. I don't want to say, and I don't think I do because I'm pretty passionate

2:45:19.680 --> 2:45:25.120
 guy, but I don't want it to appear like, Oh, just forget about emotions. Emotions are how you

2:45:25.120 --> 2:45:32.400
 experience the world. You want to have strong emotions. You want to live. You want to experience

2:45:32.400 --> 2:45:39.680
 life strongly and passionately. You just need to know that emotions are not cognition. It's

2:45:39.680 --> 2:45:45.200
 another realm. It's like, don't mix the realms. Think about outcomes and then experience them.

2:45:45.200 --> 2:45:50.400
 And sometimes your emotions won't coincide with what you think should be. And that means

2:45:50.400 --> 2:45:56.960
 there's no more integration to be done. Yeah. And as I told you offline, I've been a fan of yours

2:45:56.960 --> 2:46:02.560
 for a long time. It's been, I was a little starstruck early on, getting a little more comfortable

2:46:02.560 --> 2:46:12.800
 enough. I highly recommend that people that haven't heard your work, listen to it through the Yaron

2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:19.440
 Brook show, you know, the times I've disagreed with something I've hear you say is usually

2:46:20.400 --> 2:46:25.600
 a first step on a journey of learning a lot more about that thing, about that viewpoint.

2:46:25.600 --> 2:46:30.880
 And that's been so fulfilling. It's been a gift, the passion. You know, you talk about

2:46:30.880 --> 2:46:38.560
 reason a lot, but the passion radiates in a way that's just contagious and awe inspiring. So

2:46:38.560 --> 2:46:42.960
 thank you for everything you've done for this world. It's truly an honor and a pleasure to talk

2:46:42.960 --> 2:46:49.360
 to you. Well, thank you. And it's, my word is that if I've had an impact on you and people like you,

2:46:49.360 --> 2:46:54.880
 wow, I mean, that's amazing. You wrote to me an email saying, you've been a fan. I was blown away

2:46:54.880 --> 2:47:01.600
 because I had no idea and completely unexpected. And, and I, you know, every, every few months,

2:47:01.600 --> 2:47:05.920
 I discover, Hey, I had an impact on this book and people that I would have never thought. And they,

2:47:06.480 --> 2:47:12.400
 so, you know, the only way to change the world is to change your one mind at the time.

2:47:13.600 --> 2:47:20.160
 And when you, when you have an impact on a good mind and a mind that cares about the world and

2:47:20.160 --> 2:47:24.000
 a mind that goes out and does something about it, then you get the exponential growth.

2:47:24.000 --> 2:47:30.160
 So through you, I've impacted other people. And that's how you get, that's how you ultimately

2:47:30.800 --> 2:47:36.480
 change everything. And, and so I'm, in spite of everything, I'm, I'm optimistic in a sense that

2:47:36.480 --> 2:47:42.800
 I think that the progress we've made today is so universally accepted that scientific progress

2:47:42.800 --> 2:47:49.040
 that technological progress, it can just vanish like it did under when Rome collapsed. And whether

2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:56.400
 it's in the United States or somewhere, progress will continue. The human project for human progress

2:47:56.400 --> 2:48:01.600
 will continue. And I think these ideas, ideas of reason and individualism will always be at the

2:48:01.600 --> 2:48:06.880
 heart of it. And, you know, what we are doing is continuing the project of the Enlightenment.

2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:13.440
 And, and it's the project that will, will save this, save the human race and, and allow it to,

2:48:13.440 --> 2:48:21.120
 to for Elon Musk and for Jeff Bezos to reach the stars. Thank you for masterfully ending

2:48:21.120 --> 2:48:26.560
 on a hopeful note. You're on a pleasure and an honor. Thanks. Thanks for listening to this

2:48:26.560 --> 2:48:32.400

2:49:02.080 --> 2:49:11.680
 Einrand. Do not let your fire go out, spark by irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of

2:49:11.680 --> 2:49:18.880
 the not quite, the not yet, and the not at all. Do not let the hero in your soul perish

2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:23.600
 in lonely frustration for the life you deserved and have never been able to reach.

2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:32.320
 The world you desire can be one. It exists. It is real. It is possible. It is yours.

2:49:32.320 --> 2:49:53.200
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
