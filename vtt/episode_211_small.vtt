 The following is a conversation with Brian Muralescu, author of The Immortality Key,

00:05.520 --> 00:10.400
 The Secret History of the Religion with No Name, a book that reconstructs the forgotten

00:10.400 --> 00:16.400
 history of psychedelics in the development of Western civilization. To support this podcast,

00:24.160 --> 00:30.480
 links are in the description. This is the Lex Friedman podcast, and here's my conversation

00:30.480 --> 00:39.760
 with Brian Muralescu. Who or what do you think God is? How is our conception maybe put another way

00:39.760 --> 00:43.920
 of God change throughout history? We're starting with an easy one, Lex. Yep.

00:43.920 --> 00:54.960
 So, what is God? Well, God is a thought. God is an idea, but its reference is to that which

00:54.960 --> 01:02.320
 is beyond thinking, beyond our ability to even conceive, beyond the categories of being and

01:02.320 --> 01:07.680
 nonbeing. So, how do we talk about that? To talk about it is almost to get it wrong, right? So,

01:07.680 --> 01:15.120
 Joe Campbell famously said that any God that is not transparent to transcendence is like an idolatry

01:15.120 --> 01:20.480
 because it's just a mental construct, and it can't possibly speak to the incomprehensible. So,

01:20.480 --> 01:28.240
 we use poetic language. We say the being of beings, the infinite life energy of the universe,

01:28.240 --> 01:35.040
 the mystery of transcendence, boundless life, unqualified isness. But it doesn't quite get to

01:35.040 --> 01:42.640
 the point. I think that if there's any great insight from mysticism, it's that you and I participate

01:42.640 --> 01:49.200
 with God in a very real way, Lex Friedman, here in Austin, Texas, that in the here and now to touch

01:49.200 --> 01:55.120
 that eternal principle, another way to refer to God, to touch that eternal principle within ourselves

01:55.920 --> 02:03.120
 is to participate with divinity in some way. So, not an external force, but that divine sense

02:03.120 --> 02:08.000
 within. So, there's some aspect in which God is a part of us. So, one, it's the thing we can't

02:08.000 --> 02:14.480
 describe. It represents all of the mystery around us. It's outside our ability to comprehend,

02:14.480 --> 02:18.640
 and at the same time, it's somehow the thing that's inside of us also.

02:18.640 --> 02:24.480
 The ultimate paradox. Macteald of Magdeburg, 13th century German mystic, maybe the first German mystic

02:25.840 --> 02:32.160
 says that the day of her spiritual awakening was the day that she saw and knew that she saw God

02:32.160 --> 02:37.920
 in all things and all things in God. And so, we can say this, by the way, without apology or

02:37.920 --> 02:45.120
 lightweight theology or vapid speculation or even heresy, we can talk about this,

02:45.120 --> 02:49.520
 including within the Abrahamic faiths. The mystical core of these faiths all talk about

02:49.520 --> 02:56.160
 the encounter of divinity within. That's what I explore in the immortality key. This notion of

02:56.160 --> 03:03.280
 techniques, archaic techniques in some cases, of ecstasy, that allow that experience of the

03:03.280 --> 03:08.080
 eternal principle to actually rise up in our consciousness when we're still here as flesh

03:08.080 --> 03:17.040
 and blood beings. There's some sense in which our conception of God, though, is conjured up by our

03:17.040 --> 03:27.280
 own mind. And so, aren't we creating God? Aren't we the gods that are creating the idea of God?

03:28.480 --> 03:36.720
 If we are, when we talk about God, aren't we playing with ideas that are created by our mind

03:36.720 --> 03:46.320
 and thereby we are the creator, not God? This is a very kind of cyclical question, but in some

03:46.320 --> 03:55.280
 sense, I mean that if God is the thing that represents the mystery all around us, contrast

03:55.280 --> 04:01.600
 that with our conception of God, the way we talk about Him, is more a creation of our minds. It's

04:01.600 --> 04:07.360
 not the mystery. It's our struggle to comprehend the mystery. And therefore, we're creating the

04:07.360 --> 04:11.600
 God in terms of the God that we were talking about in this conversation or in general,

04:11.600 --> 04:16.400
 if that makes any sense. It makes no sense whatsoever. Great. This is wonderful.

04:17.840 --> 04:25.760
 But this is the eternal mystery. This is why it's so difficult to talk about, and yet it could be

04:25.760 --> 04:34.560
 the very center of our beings. The Upanishads speak about us as the creators, about us as gods.

04:34.560 --> 04:40.160
 It's a very different creation myth, but the God of the Upanishads in this great verse talks about

04:40.160 --> 04:46.560
 pouring themselves, pouring themselves into creation. Indeed, I have become this creation,

04:47.120 --> 04:53.600
 says God. And there's a great line. Verily, he or she who knows this becomes in this creation

04:54.240 --> 05:02.480
 a creator. So, yeah, I mean, just our ability to engage in mentation, our ability to think about

05:02.480 --> 05:06.960
 this stuff is partly our divine nature. This is what the humanists were talking about in the

05:06.960 --> 05:13.600
 Renaissance, by the way, and that it's not so much learning, putting dots together, having

05:14.400 --> 05:20.160
 arguments with each other over learned books. It's a process of unlearning is what some of

05:20.160 --> 05:26.640
 the mystical traditions talk about. Unlearning all these thoughts, emotions, traumas, and experiences

05:26.640 --> 05:31.520
 that have gone into the false construction of our false self, that behind all these layers,

05:31.520 --> 05:37.920
 like peeling back the onion, is a part of us that, once you can identify that,

05:39.280 --> 05:42.320
 begins to look a little bit different. In other words, it's one thing to

05:43.520 --> 05:50.800
 foster a relationship with God. It's a very different thing to identify as God. And I mean

05:50.800 --> 05:55.760
 that quite literally without being heretical. You can find this in the mystery traditions.

05:55.760 --> 06:01.760
 Can you expand on this? You mean a human being can embody God?

06:03.440 --> 06:10.320
 That is textbook incarnational theology that you can find in any Christian mystic,

06:11.120 --> 06:18.000
 but you can find it in the mystical tradition of Islam and Judaism as well. So, Rumi, for example,

06:18.800 --> 06:25.520
 the great Sufi mystic talks about if you could get rid of yourself, just get rid of

06:25.520 --> 06:31.680
 yourself just once, the secret of secrets would open to you, that the face of the unknown would

06:31.680 --> 06:37.840
 appear on the perception of your consciousness. Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a modern day contemporary

06:37.840 --> 06:42.000
 mystic, talks about, because this stuff does continue, there's a continuity to it.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
 The poetry here is incredible.

06:44.000 --> 06:49.120
 So, well, listen to Rabbi Kushner. He says that the emptying of selfhood

06:49.120 --> 06:55.760
 allows the soul to attach to true reality. And in Kabbalism, the true reality is what's called

06:55.760 --> 07:02.720
 the divine nothingness, ayin. And so, I like the adage that atheists and mystics both essentially

07:02.720 --> 07:09.120
 believe in nothing, except that the mystics spell it with a capital N, the divine nothing.

07:09.120 --> 07:15.200
 And then I'll give you Meister Eckhardt, another medieval Christian mystic. He says that

07:15.200 --> 07:21.200
 if you could not yourself, right, the same concept, if you could not yourself for just an instant,

07:21.200 --> 07:26.080
 indeed, I say less than an instant, you would possess all. So, again, you're seeing the same

07:26.080 --> 07:32.320
 thing in Sufism, Kabbalism, Christian mysticism. The way to identify with the divine is to peel

07:32.320 --> 07:36.320
 back these layers and attempt to discover pure awareness.

07:36.320 --> 07:40.960
 If we look at the universe from a physics perspective, or, you know, I'm a computer science

07:40.960 --> 07:52.160
 person, so if the universe is a computer, there's some sense that God, the creator of the universe,

07:52.160 --> 07:57.600
 or just the computer itself, doesn't know what the heck is going to happen. He just kind of

07:57.600 --> 08:04.560
 creates some basic rules and runs the thing. So, there is some element in which you can conceive

08:04.560 --> 08:12.960
 of humans, or conscious beings, or intelligent beings, as a tool that the creator uses to

08:12.960 --> 08:22.960
 understand itself, himself. Do you think that's a perspective that we could or is useful to take on

08:22.960 --> 08:31.760
 God that is basically the universe created humans to understand itself? He doesn't actually know

08:31.760 --> 08:39.520
 the full thing. He needs the human brains to figure out the puzzle. So, that's in contrasting to the

08:39.520 --> 08:44.320
 unlearning, to getting out of the way that we've talked about. It's more like, no, we need the

08:44.320 --> 08:49.760
 humans to figure out this puzzle. Well, we have no answers to this, which is why philosophers

08:49.760 --> 08:55.280
 still have jobs, if they have jobs at all. So, the physicists take a look at this. Have you

08:55.280 --> 08:59.280
 seen the article that came out, I think it was this month, in the Journal of Cosmology and

08:59.280 --> 09:05.840
 Astroparticle Physics, Robert Lanza, the biocentrism theory, the idea that the universe comes into

09:05.840 --> 09:10.960
 being through our observation, the whole, the God equation. So, not just in quantum mechanics,

09:10.960 --> 09:16.400
 but in general relativity, the idea that we make the universe moment by moment, which is

09:16.400 --> 09:21.600
 kind of mind blowing, gets into ideas of simulation. Okay, so that's how the physicists,

09:21.600 --> 09:25.600
 at least some of them, might look at it. You could also look back to the medieval Christian

09:25.600 --> 09:32.640
 mystics. Meister Eckhart once again says that the eye with which I see God is the same eye

09:33.280 --> 09:41.680
 that sees me, right? So, one sight, one knowledge, one love, another mind blowing concept. But this

09:41.680 --> 09:46.240
 is why the arts and poetry and music are so important, because although I love astroparticle

09:46.240 --> 09:51.840
 physics, it's another to kind of hear this, the same message across time.

09:51.840 --> 09:57.840
 Yeah, the simulation thing. I was actually looking this morning at video games,

09:57.840 --> 10:03.520
 just the statistics of video games. And I saw that the two top video games in terms of hours

10:03.520 --> 10:10.640
 played is Fortnite and World of Warcraft. And I saw that it's 140 billion hours,

10:11.840 --> 10:13.920
 billion hours have been played at those games.

10:13.920 --> 10:22.400
 That's a lot of video games. Yeah, but that's very sophisticated worlds being created,

10:22.400 --> 10:27.280
 especially in the world of Warcraft. It's a massive online role playing game. So,

10:27.280 --> 10:32.400
 you have these characters that are together sort of creating a world, but they in themselves are

10:32.400 --> 10:36.880
 also developing. They have all these items and they're like they're little humans,

10:36.880 --> 10:40.480
 like there's complicated societies that are formed, their goals are striving and so on.

10:40.480 --> 10:45.520
 And it's, we're creating a universe within our universe. And for now, it's a kind of,

10:47.280 --> 10:53.520
 it's a basic sort of constrained version of our more richer earth like civilization.

10:53.520 --> 11:00.720
 But it's conceivable that, you know, that we are this thing on earth is a kind of video game

11:00.720 --> 11:04.800
 that somebody else is playing. It's like, you can see sort of video games upon video games

11:04.800 --> 11:11.760
 being created. And this is something I think a lot about not from a philosophical perspective,

11:11.760 --> 11:19.520
 but practically, how fun does this video game have to be for us to let go of the silly pursuits in

11:19.520 --> 11:26.560
 this meat space that we live in and fully just stay in WoW, stay in World of Warcraft, stay in

11:26.560 --> 11:31.680
 the video game for full time. So, I think about that from an engineering perspective. Like,

11:31.680 --> 11:38.800
 is there going to be a time when this video game is actual real life for us? And then the

11:38.800 --> 11:44.960
 creatures inside the video game, they'll be just borrowing our consciousness for sort of

11:44.960 --> 11:51.680
 to ground themselves will refer to us as the gods, right? Like, won't we become the gods?

11:53.840 --> 11:59.040
 This conversation is not going how expected. But I think about this a lot from, you know,

11:59.040 --> 12:03.760
 because I love video games. And I wonder more and more of us, especially in COVID times,

12:03.760 --> 12:07.600
 are living in the digital world. You could think about Twitter and all those kinds of things.

12:07.600 --> 12:12.480
 You could think about clubhouse people using just voices to communicate little icons,

12:12.480 --> 12:16.880
 sort of in the digital space, you could see more and more will be moving in the digital space

12:16.880 --> 12:25.120
 and let go of this physical space. And then the remnants of the ancients that created the video

12:25.120 --> 12:31.040
 games that nobody centuries from now will even remember those will be the gods. And then there'll

12:31.040 --> 12:37.120
 be gods upon gods being created. This is the kind of stuff I think about. But is that any at all

12:37.120 --> 12:43.280
 useful to you to this thought experiment of a simulation, basically, the fabric of our reality?

12:43.280 --> 12:48.240
 How did it come to be? What is running this thing? Is that useful? Or is it ultimately

12:48.240 --> 12:55.520
 the project of understanding God, of understanding myth, is the project that centers on the human,

12:56.560 --> 12:58.320
 on the human mind for you?

13:00.320 --> 13:04.960
 We seem to be at the center of this divine dance, which sounds awfully anthropocentric.

13:05.520 --> 13:10.880
 But the ancients thought about this too. I mean, the concept in Sanskrit of lila,

13:10.880 --> 13:16.160
 that the point behind existence is this play, right? It's ultimately playful, this divine dance.

13:16.160 --> 13:23.440
 It gets awfully complicated in the Gnostic and Neoplatonic schools, these chains of being

13:23.440 --> 13:30.240
 from Godhead down to us, right? Some invisible, right? And we're going to get into Terence McKenna

13:30.240 --> 13:35.760
 territory later on, but we can start now by talking about discarnate entities and archons

13:35.760 --> 13:40.960
 and aliens and archetypes. I mean, there is a world where Terence McKenna does meet Plato

13:40.960 --> 13:48.560
 and Gnosticism quite kindly, and that's in this invisible college, right? The invisible world

13:49.680 --> 13:56.400
 with which we seem to have some kind of symbiosis that has a higher intent, maybe even a purpose

13:56.400 --> 14:01.200
 or a plan in mind for us. I mean, these ideas come across when you've had a heroic dose of

14:01.200 --> 14:06.160
 mushrooms. They also pop up in the ancient philosophical literature. This idea of archons

14:06.160 --> 14:14.720
 who, you know, the puppet masters controlling us flesh and blood beings, it's all a cosmic dance,

14:14.720 --> 14:16.080
 and there are no answers to this.

14:16.080 --> 14:20.160
 First, who are the archons? And second, what is this world where Terence McKenna means Plato?

14:20.160 --> 14:25.120
 Do you mean in the space of ideas, or are we talking about some kind of world that connects

14:25.120 --> 14:26.880
 all of consciousness throughout human history?

14:26.880 --> 14:32.080
 I think through different techniques, it is, you know, I think Gordon Wasson is the meeting

14:32.080 --> 14:38.000
 point of the two. So Gordon Wasson, who I do talk about in the book, was this J.P. Morgan

14:38.000 --> 14:44.000
 Banker turned ethnomicologist, and he's largely credited with the rediscovery of psilocybin

14:44.000 --> 14:50.080
 containing mushrooms, which kind of gave rise to the pop psychedelic revolution of the 1960s.

14:50.080 --> 14:55.760
 He visited Maria Sabina down in Mexico in his wake when Bob Dylan led Zeppelin the Stones

14:55.760 --> 15:02.560
 and everybody else. And the way he describes his psilocybin experience is a bit strange

15:02.560 --> 15:08.400
 because he thinks of Plato, right? And he says that, you know, whereas our ordinary reality

15:08.400 --> 15:14.400
 is kind of this imperfect view of things, Gordon Wasson felt that on mushrooms, he was spying

15:14.400 --> 15:19.200
 the archetypes. And he talks about Plato, and he writes about the archetypes in this famous

15:19.200 --> 15:25.920
 article that's released in 1957 in Life Magazine. And so a well read individual from the mid 20th

15:25.920 --> 15:32.480
 century has his premier psychedelic experience and out comes Plato, because what he was witnessing

15:32.480 --> 15:39.440
 was so sharp, so brilliant, so detailed, in some sense, more real than real, this noetic sense

15:39.440 --> 15:44.640
 that William James talks about, that when you confront something more real than real, these

15:44.640 --> 15:51.760
 discarnate entities, these images, these visionary motifs, you're tempted to believe that you've

15:51.760 --> 15:57.120
 tapped into the truest nature and the underlying structure of the cosmos. And that's difficult

15:57.120 --> 16:01.440
 to escape from, whether you're Plato or Terence McKenna or Gordon Wasson caught in between.

16:02.160 --> 16:06.720
 Can we talk about this being in touch with something that is more real than real?

16:07.440 --> 16:11.520
 And let's just go straight there to McKenna before we return to the bigger picture.

16:11.520 --> 16:16.000
 So he's talked about the, what is it, self healing machine, self...

16:16.000 --> 16:17.040
 Self transforming.

16:17.040 --> 16:25.120
 Self transforming machine. I was during his DMT travels. And I just talked to Rick Doblin,

16:25.120 --> 16:32.720
 who also had different travels to this hyperspace. But they all seem to be traveling on the same

16:32.720 --> 16:37.440
 spaceship, just the different locations. And there is a sense in which they seem to be traveling

16:37.440 --> 16:43.120
 through whatever, I don't know if it's through space time or something else to meet

16:43.840 --> 16:48.560
 something that is more real than real. What can you say about this DMT experience,

16:48.560 --> 16:54.080
 about Terence McKenna, about the poetry he used, but maybe more specifically about

16:54.080 --> 16:56.320
 this place that they seem to all travel to?

16:57.040 --> 17:01.760
 So the big question is, is it real? Is it really more real than real? The ancient philosophers

17:01.760 --> 17:07.840
 were asking the same question, and their means of attempting to answer that was by dying. So if

17:07.840 --> 17:13.360
 you ask Plato the definition of philosophy, he will say that to practice it in the right way

17:14.000 --> 17:20.160
 is to practice dying and being dead. And many people describe the psychedelic experience in

17:20.160 --> 17:26.160
 sort of near death experience terms. And the encountering of all this visual imagery tends

17:26.160 --> 17:30.960
 to be something that is often described as more real than real. So how does Terence talk about

17:30.960 --> 17:36.320
 this? So I was just listening to the trialogues, which folks should look up somewhere between

17:36.320 --> 17:44.640
 1989 and 1990. Terence sits down with his friends Ralph Abraham and Rupert Sheldrake at Esalen.

17:44.640 --> 17:50.400
 And they're trying to figure out the meaning of these discarnate entities and these nonhuman

17:50.400 --> 17:57.040
 intelligences. And Terence develops a taxonomy for how to analyze this. And he says that number one,

17:57.040 --> 18:05.520
 they're either semi physical, but kind of elusive. So think of the Bigfoot or the Yeti or things like

18:05.520 --> 18:13.200
 this beings that exist somewhere between mythology and zoology, which isn't really appropriate here.

18:13.200 --> 18:21.120
 So option number two, he says, is the mental. You're dropping so many good lines. It's so good.

18:21.120 --> 18:27.280
 Okay, I apologize. Somewhere between mythology and zoology. This is all Terence McKenna.

18:27.280 --> 18:33.280
 Okay. I take no credit for this. But you're combining, you're like, Jimi Hendrix only

18:33.280 --> 18:38.160
 used the blue scale, but he still, he still created something new in the music you played.

18:38.160 --> 18:46.960
 Anyway, go ahead. We're going into Mixolydian right now. So option number two, and this is

18:46.960 --> 18:53.600
 what Terence calls sort of the mentalist reductionist approach. And this is pure McKenna poetry.

18:53.600 --> 19:00.720
 He says that these beings could be autonomous fragments of psychic energy that have temporarily

19:00.720 --> 19:07.440
 escaped the controlling power of the ego. So in Jungian sense is that these would just be pure

19:07.440 --> 19:12.720
 projections, the projections of schizophrenics in some cases. So they're essentially unreal.

19:12.720 --> 19:18.960
 And the third option, the most tantalizing is that they're both non physical, but autonomous.

19:18.960 --> 19:24.800
 In other words, they actually exist in some kind of real place, in some kind of real space,

19:24.800 --> 19:30.240
 and that we can have Congress with them. There is communication. He talks about the whisperings

19:30.240 --> 19:36.080
 of the demon artificers, and that it's just possible that our meetings with these beings

19:36.080 --> 19:42.640
 have coaxed the human species into self expression in a very real way, that at different times in

19:42.640 --> 19:49.520
 history, our relationships with these semi autonomous beings may actually guide the species. Now,

19:49.520 --> 19:57.760
 this is high speculation. And Terence and Ralph and Rupert wind up talking about the early modern

19:57.760 --> 20:03.520
 period and the scientific enlightenment and that even someone like Descartes reports a dream in

20:03.520 --> 20:09.920
 which he came face to face with an angel who said that the conquest of nature is to be achieved

20:09.920 --> 20:17.600
 through measure and number. So even the hard minded materialist like Descartes is confronting

20:17.600 --> 20:23.360
 these discarnate entities. John Dee in the 16th century, the high magician of the Elizabethan

20:23.360 --> 20:30.480
 court, he reports decades worth of what we would say is extraterrestrial communication,

20:30.480 --> 20:37.040
 or interdimensional communication. And you can find instances of this throughout history,

20:37.040 --> 20:41.680
 including among the presocratics. And Peter Kingsley writes quite a bit about this,

20:41.680 --> 20:46.880
 but I'll save that until your next question. Well, first of all, we don't seem to understand

20:46.880 --> 20:51.440
 from where intelligence came from. We don't understand from where life came from on earth,

20:52.560 --> 20:55.840
 but that we can kind of intuit, because that's the space of chemistry and biology,

20:55.840 --> 21:00.240
 you have good theories about the origins of life on earth, but the origins of intelligent life,

21:00.240 --> 21:07.680
 that is a giant mystery. And there's some sense in which, I mean, I don't know if you know the

21:07.680 --> 21:15.680
 movie 2001 Space Odyssey, but it does seem that there's like important throughout human history,

21:15.680 --> 21:22.080
 throughout life on earth, there's important phase shifts of it feels like something happened

21:23.120 --> 21:29.760
 where there's big leaps. It could be something coincidental like fire and learning how to cook

21:29.760 --> 21:35.520
 meat and all those kinds of things. But it feels like there could be other things. And I think

21:35.520 --> 21:41.520
 that's at the core of your work is exploring what those things could be. Is there, is it possible?

21:43.920 --> 21:50.560
 Talked about Joe Roganoff. Is it in this entirely possible? Is it possible that psychedelics have,

21:50.560 --> 21:57.680
 in fact, contributed of being an important source of those phase shift throughout human history

21:57.680 --> 22:03.040
 of the intellect, basically steering the intellectual development and growth of human

22:03.040 --> 22:08.480
 civilization? It's a hypothesis worth investigating. How about that? Beautiful.

22:09.520 --> 22:13.760
 And maybe not psychedelics in and of themselves, but I think our whole conversation is kind of

22:13.760 --> 22:19.840
 wrapped up in these nonordinary states of awareness. We start by talking about God,

22:19.840 --> 22:29.040
 which is something unordinary and expansive. And I think that as you trace the intervention

22:29.040 --> 22:33.520
 of divinity, if that's the case, throughout human history, you have to bump up against the

22:33.520 --> 22:41.360
 irrational. Merset Eliade, the great scholar of religions and fellow Romanian, said that the

22:41.360 --> 22:46.000
 history of religions essentially constitutes the point of intersection between metaphysics and

22:46.000 --> 22:53.760
 biology, so that we are biological beings who do interact with our planet, with the natural kingdom.

22:54.480 --> 22:59.840
 And you would think that as early archaic ecologists, we would have figured out what

22:59.840 --> 23:06.080
 plants work, which fungi don't, and developed maybe language around that. And so this is

23:06.080 --> 23:12.880
 another one of McKenna's speculative, but very interesting hypotheses, the Stone and Ape theory.

23:12.880 --> 23:18.880
 Is it possible that psychedelics were involved in one of the several leaps forward? You mentioned

23:18.880 --> 23:23.600
 the word leap. Jared Diamond talks about the great leap forward 60,000 years ago.

23:24.240 --> 23:27.920
 The species had been around for a couple hundred thousand years. All of a sudden,

23:27.920 --> 23:33.360
 the cave painting appears. All of a sudden, there's a phase shift. Did something like that happen

23:33.360 --> 23:38.080
 millions of years ago? And I love the way Paul Stamets talks about this. It would be the ingestion

23:38.080 --> 23:45.760
 of perhaps psilocybin containing fungi millions and millions of times over millions and millions

23:45.760 --> 23:52.720
 of years. So it's not just a one time event that cascades, but it's the accumulation of psychedelic

23:52.720 --> 23:59.520
 experience. It's really difficult to test that hypothesis. But I've been talking with a paleo

23:59.520 --> 24:05.520
 anthropologist in South Africa, my friend Lee Berger, about ways that we might test for this.

24:05.520 --> 24:11.520
 And so Lee, amongst many things, is this National Geographic Explorer. He's the paleo

24:11.520 --> 24:16.800
 anthropologist, paleo anthropologist at the University of Whitwatershwin. He's famous,

24:16.800 --> 24:21.920
 amongst other things, for the discovery of previously undiscovered hominids like Homo

24:21.920 --> 24:31.760
 Naledi. And there's an interesting point. So Naledi is this archaic hominid, morphologically

24:31.760 --> 24:38.960
 archaic, but it dates to about 300,000 years ago, which is very strange. What's even more strange

24:38.960 --> 24:44.560
 about Homo Naledi at the rising star cave system there in South Africa is that Lee believes he's

24:44.560 --> 24:52.240
 discovered the first bipedal ape deliberately disposing of its dead. So there is a recognition

24:52.240 --> 24:58.960
 of self mortality and the practicing of rituals around death. We're talking about burials. And

24:58.960 --> 25:05.840
 if you have burials, says Lee, in an archaic hominid 300,000 years ago, maybe you have language.

25:05.840 --> 25:11.440
 And I mention that because Terence McKenna was obsessed with language in the stoned ape theory,

25:11.440 --> 25:18.080
 that the ingestion of psilocybin, in addition to enhancing visual acuity, perhaps facilitating

25:18.080 --> 25:24.400
 sexual arousal, leads to proto language. Now, isn't it interesting, this could be

25:24.400 --> 25:30.880
 entirely a coincidence, that the largest sound inventory of any language is the Khoisan

25:30.880 --> 25:38.000
 of Botswana and Namibia. They have something like 164 consonants and 44 vowels. English,

25:38.000 --> 25:43.040
 by comparison, has about 45. So I don't know what to make of this, but what you find in that part

25:43.040 --> 25:50.640
 of the world is very, very complex language, language that could be an inheritance, language

25:50.640 --> 25:56.640
 that could be incredibly archaic, together with this recognition of self mortality. And when I

25:56.640 --> 26:01.760
 talk to Lee Berger, we say, when you're looking at universals like that, language around all human

26:01.760 --> 26:08.160
 populations, the recognition of self mortality, the contemplation of death, just maybe you have

26:08.160 --> 26:13.440
 pharmacology. And so maybe we can go out and test for this using gas chromatography, mass

26:13.440 --> 26:19.280
 spectrometry, proteomics, technology that doesn't even exist. But maybe we can actually test the

26:19.280 --> 26:23.520
 Stone and Ape theory to figure out once and for all, if there's any merit there.

26:23.520 --> 26:29.280
 Can you just linger a little bit on the pharmacology tools? How would it be possible

26:29.280 --> 26:33.520
 to say something about what was being ingested so, so, so long ago?

26:33.520 --> 26:40.800
 That's what I asked Dr. Berger. So Lee has discovered in the dental calculus

26:40.800 --> 26:47.920
 nice of archaic hominids dental calculus. I like this evidence of their diet and

26:47.920 --> 26:52.960
 you might not believe how old this was, but in Cediba, Australopithecus Cediba,

26:52.960 --> 27:00.160
 they found evidence of Cediba's diet going back two million years. So through things like phytoliths,

27:00.160 --> 27:07.520
 which are essentially fossilized plant tissue, they found evidence that Cediba was eating bark

27:07.520 --> 27:15.280
 and leaves and grasses and fruits and palm. So no psychedelics to speak of, but it just goes to show

27:15.280 --> 27:19.920
 that through things like dental microwear analysis and other techniques that we're still developing,

27:19.920 --> 27:25.520
 we can actually figure out what the diet was at the time. I'll fast forward to 50,000 years ago.

27:25.520 --> 27:31.680
 There was another study out of El Cidron Cave in 2012, which found that Neanderthals, again,

27:31.680 --> 27:38.880
 preceding our species 50,000 years ago, were ingesting yarrow and chamomile, which had been

27:38.880 --> 27:44.800
 identified as medicinal. So again, not psychedelic or psychoactive, but we can see that there's

27:44.800 --> 27:49.280
... We kind of have the beginnings of the technology, and that was nine years ago,

27:49.280 --> 27:53.280
 to begin figuring out the ancestral diet of these hominids.

27:53.840 --> 27:58.400
 Presumably, there could be a way to figure out, it's not just diet, but which have

27:58.400 --> 28:02.480
 psychoactive elements to them. So whether you're chewing it, whether you're smoking it,

28:02.480 --> 28:06.960
 whether... I mean, I don't know what licking it. I don't know if there's any kind of ways

28:06.960 --> 28:11.840
 through the dental calculus to figure out what exact substances were being consumed.

28:11.840 --> 28:18.000
 Is it possible to figure out whether psychedelic substances are being consumed by looking at

28:18.000 --> 28:25.760
 human behavior, like you said, organized burials or cave paintings? No, but so that's a little bit

28:25.760 --> 28:28.480
 of a stretch to say where did this leap come from.

28:28.480 --> 28:34.480
 But it's not. So just last fall, as a matter of fact, that notion's been out there for a while,

28:34.480 --> 28:39.680
 the idea that hallucinogens and the ritual consumption of hallucinogens were somehow

28:39.680 --> 28:44.400
 related to the Great Leap Forward, were somehow related to the initial cave painting. Graham

28:44.400 --> 28:49.760
 Hancock wrote a beautiful book about this called Supernatural, which in many ways sent me down

28:49.760 --> 28:55.040
 this rabbit hole back in 2007. But even at the time when he was writing that in the year subsequent,

28:55.600 --> 29:02.800
 it was still kind of seen as a kooky idea. Last fall, interestingly enough, the first

29:02.800 --> 29:09.760
 archeochemical data for the ritual consumption of psychedelics associated with cave art was finally

29:09.760 --> 29:15.200
 published. It's not that ancient. It's only about 400 or 500 years ago, but it came from the Pinwheel

29:15.200 --> 29:21.520
 Cave, a Chumash site in California. And what they found were Datura quids, like these chewed up,

29:21.520 --> 29:27.600
 you mentioned how did they ingest it, these chewed up quids, like these bunches of Datura,

29:27.600 --> 29:34.000
 which contain these very powerful tropane alkaloids. And what was believed to be some kind of Chumash

29:34.000 --> 29:39.920
 initiation site. So we can say that there is initial archeochemical data for the consumption

29:39.920 --> 29:44.960
 of psychedelics and cave art. And so where else might we find this? Are there a lot of

29:44.960 --> 29:52.320
 archeochemists in the world? Because this is fascinating, is through chemistry, through biology,

29:52.320 --> 29:58.400
 through physics, whatever, like all the disciplines we perhaps in one day, computer science, we

29:59.840 --> 30:04.320
 apply those tools to study not the data of today, but the data of the past.

30:05.440 --> 30:10.160
 Are we talking about dozens here? How hard is this problem relative to how many people are

30:10.160 --> 30:16.080
 taking it on just as a side little tangent? We're probably talking more dozens than hundreds.

30:17.120 --> 30:22.000
 I spent many years trying to track down an archeochemist who would talk to me. There were

30:22.000 --> 30:28.000
 a couple, Pat McGovern at the University of Pennsylvania, and then my friend Andrew Koh at

30:28.000 --> 30:34.640
 MIT, which you might know something about. Andrew really on his own time, on his own dime,

30:35.280 --> 30:42.000
 has been gathering the data for this organic residue analysis. He has what's called the

30:42.000 --> 30:47.440
 open archeochem project, which is this online open source repository for this data. But there's

30:47.440 --> 30:53.360
 never been a center for this. No university has stood up a dedicated center, a team, really,

30:53.360 --> 30:57.920
 which is what you need of archeochemists looking at this stuff. But even despite that,

30:57.920 --> 31:02.640
 there have been some remarkable discoveries over the past 10, 20 years. It's still a discipline

31:02.640 --> 31:08.160
 very much in its infancy. Maybe it's becoming a toddler, but as the technology gets better

31:08.160 --> 31:13.680
 and cheaper, I hope you'll see more and more archeochemists joining the fight.

31:13.680 --> 31:19.600
 Yeah, and Andrew is fascinating. His work is fascinating. But also, just because of your

31:19.600 --> 31:25.760
 work, I came across and exchanged a few emails with Patrick McGovern, who's basically, what would

31:25.760 --> 31:31.760
 you call him? So he has a center, I guess, that does biomolecular archeology at UPenn.

31:32.320 --> 31:38.320
 And he's the author of a bunch of books, one of which is Ancient Brews. So he's a scholar of beer

31:38.320 --> 31:44.000
 and wine and like ancient alcohol, which is fascinating. The influence, even just alcohol,

31:44.000 --> 31:50.640
 but he has alcohol with hallucinogenic properties as well. But it's fascinating,

31:50.640 --> 31:57.600
 as a Russian, it's fascinating to think about the influence of alcohol on the development

31:58.720 --> 32:03.520
 of human civilization throughout its history. Is there something you can comment on

32:03.520 --> 32:12.640
 on alcohol or in general Patrick's work that was informative to you, inspiring or kind of

32:13.840 --> 32:19.760
 added to your conception of human history? His work was some of the first hard scientific data

32:19.760 --> 32:25.840
 that I saw for the ritual consumption of these intoxicants. I don't think he's ever found

32:26.400 --> 32:30.720
 the hard and fast data for psychedelics. But what he turned me on to was this idea

32:30.720 --> 32:36.720
 that alcohol or beer and wine specifically could have been used as vehicles for the

32:36.720 --> 32:42.080
 administration of psychedelics. That's where it all started for me. Just the notion that

32:42.080 --> 32:46.720
 ancient beer and ancient wine is very, very different from what we drink today,

32:46.720 --> 32:52.800
 that typically they were cocktails. They were often fortified and mixed with different fruits,

32:52.800 --> 32:58.400
 berries, herbs, plants, maybe even fungi over time, because this was all in the absence of

32:58.400 --> 33:05.840
 distilled liquor. There is no hard alcohol, even in Russia, before maybe the 12th century it was

33:05.840 --> 33:13.360
 in Europe, maybe a bit earlier. But the concept of distillation just didn't exist. To pack a punch,

33:15.040 --> 33:21.040
 rather than just drink a kind of watered down Budweiser, these people were interested in fortifying

33:21.040 --> 33:26.880
 these beverages with whatever they could find in nature. Pat, to his credit, found some of the

33:26.880 --> 33:32.480
 initial data for these, you could say, spiked wines and spiked beers. Not with anything overtly

33:32.480 --> 33:39.360
 psychedelic, but just the fact that in the 16th century BC, at Graves Circle A in Mycenae,

33:39.360 --> 33:44.880
 there's this Minoan ritual cocktail of beer mixed with wine mixed with mead is very interesting.

33:44.880 --> 33:50.880
 It's even more interesting that you find that across the Aegean in Gordium at King Midas's

33:50.880 --> 33:58.080
 Tomb, the same kind of ritual cocktail which Pat and Sam at the Dogfish Head Brewery resurrected

33:58.080 --> 34:04.560
 as the Midas touch. The notion that we can go back, find this data, resurrect it, in some cases,

34:04.560 --> 34:10.480
 2800 years later, I found pretty exciting 10 years ago. Yeah, bringing it back for research.

34:11.680 --> 34:14.960
 But that's fascinating that people were playing with these ideas. We'll return to

34:14.960 --> 34:22.640
 ideas of psychedelic and fused wine, which is pretty fascinating. But can we step back and

34:22.640 --> 34:29.200
 just look at your work with the book Immortality Key? What is the story that you tell in this book?

34:29.200 --> 34:37.200
 I knew we'd get there eventually, Alex. It's a nonlinear path. Somehow we were talking about

34:37.200 --> 34:43.200
 simulation and the universe is a computer that's creating video games in WoW and Fortnite. But

34:43.200 --> 34:50.000
 we got there and we'll return always to the insane philosophical. But your book Immortality Key,

34:50.000 --> 34:55.040
 what's the stories that you tell in this book? Which part of human history are you studying?

34:55.040 --> 35:02.160
 Right. So that's the way to phrase it. So it's my 12 year search for the hard scientific data

35:02.160 --> 35:07.200
 for the ritual use of psychedelics in classical antiquity. So we're talking about amongst the

35:07.200 --> 35:13.520
 ancient Greeks and Romans and the Paleo Christians. So the generations that would give birth to the

35:13.520 --> 35:18.320
 largest religion the world's ever known, Christianity today was two and a half billion people.

35:18.320 --> 35:22.720
 The big question for me is, we're psychedelics actually involved. There was a lot written

35:22.720 --> 35:28.480
 about this in the 60s, John Marco Allegro. The book that I follow was published in 1978,

35:28.480 --> 35:33.920
 before I was born, The Road to a Lucis by Gordon Wasson, who we talked about already,

35:33.920 --> 35:39.600
 Albert Hofmann, who famously discovers LSD or synthesizes it from Ergot, and Carl Ruck,

35:40.320 --> 35:46.400
 who is still a professor of classics at Boston University, the only surviving member

35:46.400 --> 35:53.440
 of that renegade trio, and now 85 years old. So this all predates us. But what was lacking in the

35:53.440 --> 36:00.240
 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s, I think was some of this technology and the hard scientific data. Now,

36:00.240 --> 36:04.880
 for years and years, I went out to the archaeobotanists and the archaeochemists around the world,

36:04.880 --> 36:10.880
 and I asked a very basic question, is there any evidence for psychedelics in classical antiquity?

36:10.880 --> 36:15.760
 And the answer would almost invariably come back, no. I'm talking to, in addition to Pat,

36:15.760 --> 36:20.800
 he put me in touch with Hans Peter Stiecker in Germany, Tania Valamotti in Greece,

36:20.800 --> 36:25.440
 Sinta Florinzano in Italy. I went all over the place asking one question and getting the

36:25.440 --> 36:31.920
 same answer back time and again. And so the book is essentially my search for that data and the

36:31.920 --> 36:40.320
 eventual uncovering of two, what I think are key pieces of data. One data point shows the ritual

36:40.320 --> 36:47.200
 use of a psychedelic beer in classical antiquity in Iberia, what today is Spain. And the other

36:47.200 --> 36:54.080
 shows what looks like a kind of psychedelic wine just outside Pompeii from the 1st century AD.

36:54.080 --> 37:00.480
 At the right place, at the right time, when the earliest Christians were showing up in Italy.

37:01.520 --> 37:08.720
 Again, these are early steps in the search for evidence in the space. But speaking of early

37:08.720 --> 37:17.600
 Christians, what role do you think psychedelic and fused wine could have played in the life of

37:17.600 --> 37:24.320
 the, I won't be clever, in the life of Jesus Christ?

37:25.520 --> 37:31.840
 I've been saying recently that, and I hope this doesn't sound obscurantist, but I think it's

37:31.840 --> 37:38.240
 impossible to understand Jesus and the birth of Christianity in the absence of ancient Greek.

37:38.800 --> 37:41.760
 And I'll give you a very specific example of why I think that's the case.

37:41.760 --> 37:49.920
 Interesting. You can read the entire New Testament in ancient Greek. And not once will you ever find

37:49.920 --> 37:55.680
 a reference to alcohol, because there was no word in ancient Greek for alcohol. The way the

37:55.680 --> 38:01.920
 word sounds, alcohol, it comes, it's Semitic, it comes from the Arabic. Kahela means to enliven a

38:01.920 --> 38:07.840
 refresh, probably comes from coal, KOHL, sort of these powdered metallics that were used in

38:07.840 --> 38:13.520
 alchemical experiments and cosmetics. So again, that's much later in time when we're using alchemy,

38:13.520 --> 38:21.040
 distillation, et cetera. In the first century AD, the power of wine wasn't necessarily tied

38:21.040 --> 38:26.560
 to alcohol, fermented grapes, the way we think about wine today. So Pat McGovern found some of

38:26.560 --> 38:33.680
 that early organic data for wine being mixed with beer and with mead. But if you look at the

38:33.680 --> 38:39.280
 literature from the first century AD, Diascorides, for example, he writes this massive treatise at

38:39.280 --> 38:45.280
 the exact same time the Gospels are being written. And Diascorides, in just one of his books, talks

38:45.280 --> 38:53.520
 about 56 detailed recipes for spiking wine with all kinds of things like salvia and hellebore and

38:53.520 --> 38:58.880
 frankincense and myrrh, these spiced perfumes, but also more dangerous things like henbane

38:58.880 --> 39:05.040
 and mandrake, which he says in Greek, can be fatal with just one cupful. And in book 474

39:05.040 --> 39:12.160
 of his Materia Medica, he talks about black nightshade producing fantasias ou aedes,

39:13.520 --> 39:19.680
 not unpleasant visions. What today we would say is psychedelic. So just looking at the literature

39:19.680 --> 39:23.760
 and the kind of literature that even most classicists, I didn't really learn it

39:23.760 --> 39:29.600
 in undergrad, I came across Diascorides later. But just a basic look at the literature

39:30.240 --> 39:34.720
 supports what McGovern has been testing, which is the fact that wine

39:34.720 --> 39:39.680
 was routinely mixed with different compounds. It's fascinating, by the way, that language

39:39.680 --> 39:47.280
 affects our conception of the tools we use to understand the world. So you can see wine,

39:47.280 --> 39:56.800
 you can see psychedelics, if they're not called drugs, you can maybe reframe

39:57.920 --> 40:02.320
 how you see them in terms of their role in us thinking about the world, understanding the

40:02.320 --> 40:06.320
 world. That's really interesting that language has that power. But what language was used to

40:06.320 --> 40:11.840
 understand wine at the time? So we're talking about a Greek speaking world, right? So Jesus

40:12.880 --> 40:16.880
 is born and does his public ministry in the Holy Land, but think about the early church.

40:16.880 --> 40:21.440
 Think about where the church takes root. Paul, the greatest evangelist of the time,

40:21.440 --> 40:26.800
 writes basically half the New Testament. He's writing letters in Greek to Greek speakers in

40:26.800 --> 40:33.920
 places like Corinth in Greece, or Philippi, a defunct city just north of the island of Thassos,

40:33.920 --> 40:39.840
 or he's writing to folks in what today is Turkey, the Colossians, the Galatians. He writes letters

40:39.840 --> 40:45.680
 to the Romans. These are Greek speakers in these pockets, these Hellenic pockets all around the

40:45.680 --> 40:52.080
 ancient Mediterranean. And for them, again, ignore diascorities, ignore Pat McGovern's work. To them,

40:52.080 --> 40:58.880
 to think about wine was to think about a mixed potion. And so the word oinos in ancient Greek

40:58.880 --> 41:03.600
 does show up in the New Testament, but there was another word to describe wine. And it exists for

41:03.600 --> 41:10.000
 like a thousand years before, during, and after the life of Jesus. The word used for wine is

41:10.000 --> 41:15.600
 pharmacon, which obviously gives us the word pharmacy. It means drug. So in Greek, a Greek

41:15.600 --> 41:21.120
 speaker would actually use the word drug to refer to wine. Ruth Skodal, the classicist,

41:21.120 --> 41:28.480
 talks about this as a ritualistic formula. They understood wine as this compound beverage,

41:28.480 --> 41:36.880
 a drug against grief, a medicinal elixir that could either harm or heal, or just maybe a sacrament

41:36.880 --> 41:46.080
 to put you in touch with wine gods, all anew. Clearly, religion, and myth, but religion very

41:46.080 --> 41:56.240
 much so has sort of a, much like dreams, has like an imagery component. Like you're kind of going

41:56.240 --> 42:04.080
 outside the visual constraints of physical space where you kind of have very specific

42:04.080 --> 42:11.200
 conceptions of what things look like. And you kind of use your imagination to stretch beyond the

42:11.200 --> 42:16.640
 world as we know it. Things that are, try to get in touch with things that are more real than real.

42:17.280 --> 42:26.960
 What role do these tools, do these pharmacons have in trying to stimulate the imagery of religion?

42:28.000 --> 42:32.400
 Do you have a sense that they have a critical role here, or is this just a bunch of different

42:32.400 --> 42:37.440
 factors that are utilized, a bunch of different tools that are utilized to construct this imagery?

42:37.440 --> 42:42.560
 Or is this not even, or is imagery the wrong terminology? Is it more like space of ideas

42:42.560 --> 42:48.960
 that's core to religion? No, I think the wine is absolutely essential. And so if it's impossible

42:48.960 --> 42:54.480
 to understand paleo Christianity in the absence of ancient Greek, I think it's equally difficult

42:54.480 --> 43:00.560
 in the absence of the sacred pharmacopeia, or wine itself, right? Just think about wine

43:00.560 --> 43:06.480
 at the time. I think that the ancient Greek audience would have heard that in a very different way

43:07.600 --> 43:12.320
 from us. And so they're referring to it maybe as a pharmacon, but the followers of Dionysus,

43:12.320 --> 43:18.400
 which precedes Jesus. And in some cases, the story of Jesus is kind of a recapitulation

43:18.400 --> 43:23.440
 of the mysteries of Dionysus. But when you think about Dionysus, maybe from your high school

43:23.440 --> 43:28.400
 mythology, you think about him as the god of theater, or the god of wine, which is typically

43:28.400 --> 43:36.400
 what it is, or the god of ecstasy. Again, Dionysus is not the god of alcohol. There's no concept

43:37.040 --> 43:42.560
 of fermented grapes. The power of Dionysus, and the ability to commune with Dionysus through his

43:42.560 --> 43:49.360
 blood. And before Christianity, the blood of Dionysus is equated to his wine. The sacramental

43:49.360 --> 43:54.320
 drinking of the wine was interpreted, and classicists write about this, including Walter Berkert,

43:54.320 --> 44:00.480
 it was interpreted as consuming the god himself in order to become one with the god. This is

44:00.480 --> 44:05.680
 where we get the idea of enthusiasm, because the language matters. Enthusiasm to be filled

44:05.680 --> 44:11.360
 with the spirit of the god, so that you became identified with Dionysus and acquired his divine

44:11.360 --> 44:16.240
 powers. Now, how does that happen? Again, he's not the god of alcohol. He is the god of wine,

44:16.240 --> 44:22.880
 but he's really the god of madness, and delirium, and frenzy, and his principal followers are women.

44:22.880 --> 44:27.680
 They're called the minads. And the way they get in touch with him is through the consumption of

44:27.680 --> 44:34.880
 this sacramental wine. Even at the theater of Dionysus, separate from his outdoor churches,

44:34.880 --> 44:40.400
 there was a wine served there called Drima. And this is the wine that gives birth to Hollywood.

44:40.400 --> 44:44.720
 I mean, the ancient Hollywood was there at the theater of Dionysus. This is where comedy and

44:44.720 --> 44:49.840
 tragedy and poetry and music come from. But rather than a hot dog and a beer, what they drink at the

44:49.840 --> 44:56.400
 theater of Dionysus was this wine called Drima, which means pounded or rubbed. And Professor Ruck

44:56.400 --> 45:02.960
 talks about maybe it was the drugs that were rubbed into this theatrical beverage to help the

45:03.840 --> 45:10.720
 play come alive. So madness is seen as a positive thing, as like a creative journey. It's not,

45:12.000 --> 45:17.040
 it's the, what is it, the unlearning, getting out of the way kind of thing. Is that how it's

45:17.040 --> 45:28.240
 seen? Or is it more like entertaining escape from life that is suffering? I gotta inject a little

45:28.240 --> 45:37.360
 modern Dostoyevsky into the old existential despair. Maybe it's a bit of that. We can't say

45:37.360 --> 45:43.840
 that there wasn't recreational drinking happening. The Greeks also had the symposium, right?

45:43.840 --> 45:49.920
 And they also were just getting hammered in some cases. But when it comes to the rights

45:49.920 --> 45:58.720
 of Dionysus, what you see there is the creation of these states of awareness in which, again,

45:58.720 --> 46:04.080
 you identify with the God to become the God. There's theophagy. There's the consumption

46:04.080 --> 46:08.480
 of divinity in order to become divinity. Right back to how we started the conversation, right?

46:08.480 --> 46:16.240
 So if we stop conceiving of God as something exterior to us, but that the mystery of being

46:16.240 --> 46:21.360
 itself is the mystery of your being and the mystery of my being, that the way to encounter

46:21.360 --> 46:27.920
 that is through this sacramental theology, that you drink the actual blood of this Greek

46:27.920 --> 46:32.800
 God to become that God. And there was a place for this in ancient Greek society.

46:32.800 --> 46:41.600
 So drinking the wine and drinking the blood of Dionysus, do you think Jesus is an actual

46:41.600 --> 46:51.440
 physical person that existed in history or is an idea that came to life through the consumption

46:51.440 --> 46:56.320
 of wine and those kinds of rituals? So this is where I face my excommunication,

46:56.320 --> 47:03.200
 depending how I answer this. I mean, you're playing with fire and wine.

47:04.880 --> 47:13.040
 A good combination, by the way. So I shy away from that controversy in the book. I'm perfectly

47:13.040 --> 47:19.360
 willing to accept Jesus as a historical personage. We have the multiplicity of sources, although it's

47:19.360 --> 47:25.280
 a generation after his death, but we have the Eucharist being described in the four gospels.

47:25.280 --> 47:32.000
 We have it being described by Paul in 1 Corinthians. But when you read John, it does read a bit

47:32.000 --> 47:36.240
 differently than the other gospels. And in my book, I rely a lot on the scholarship of Dennis

47:36.240 --> 47:41.840
 McDonald, who writes a fabulous book called The Dionysian Gospel. And this is again why the

47:41.840 --> 47:47.360
 Greek matters, because once you start to analyze the Greek of John's gospel, it seems to be a

47:47.360 --> 47:52.960
 presentation of Jesus very much in the guise of Dionysus. The most obvious example is the wedding

47:52.960 --> 47:59.200
 at Cana, right? That only occurs in John's gospel, the famous transformation of water into wine.

47:59.200 --> 48:03.680
 Now again, to any Greek speaker of the first century, they would have known about the Greek

48:03.680 --> 48:10.240
 district of Ellis on the Peloponnese. And in Ellis, around the epiphany, every January,

48:10.240 --> 48:16.720
 the priests of Dionysus would deposit these water basins, empty basins in the temple of Dionysus.

48:16.720 --> 48:22.480
 They'd return the next morning and find them magically filled with wine. Now, on the island of

48:22.480 --> 48:27.840
 Andros, it's even more interesting, around the same epiphany date, the God's gift day,

48:27.840 --> 48:33.840
 diesteodosia, the wine would emanate from the temple and run like a river for a week. And you

48:33.840 --> 48:39.200
 can Google the bacchanal of the Andrians, a wonderful painting by Titian, which hangs in the

48:39.200 --> 48:43.920
 brado, and you'll see a river of wine behind these people having a great time. This exists for

48:43.920 --> 48:50.560
 centuries and centuries before the wedding at Cana and before Jesus begins his public ministry

48:50.560 --> 48:56.800
 with what these scholars call the signature miracle of Dionysus. It would not have been lost

48:56.800 --> 49:01.440
 on the Greek audience that something very specific is being communicated here. What's being

49:01.440 --> 49:08.240
 communicated that you just might find in early Christianity what you hold strong to in these

49:08.240 --> 49:12.880
 mysteries of Dionysus that you may have inherited from your parents, your grandparents, your great

49:12.880 --> 49:17.840
 grandparents for centuries. There was a perfectly good religion. There were perfectly good mystery

49:17.840 --> 49:23.920
 cults in the ancient Greek and Roman worlds. And here comes this new, untested, illegal cult,

49:24.800 --> 49:30.480
 illegal of a dozen or so illiterate day laborers that go on to convert the empire in a few hundred

49:30.480 --> 49:37.600
 years. The answer to that extraordinary growth is not psychedelics, but I do think it's visionary

49:37.600 --> 49:42.720
 experiences and I do think it's this continuity from the pagan world into early Christianity.

49:42.720 --> 49:48.800
 So what part, you mentioned this idea that's really interesting. I think you said Paul Stamets of

49:50.320 --> 49:58.400
 I guess millions of people over millions of years kind of consuming, really practicing a ritual or

49:58.400 --> 50:03.840
 a habit of some sort. This idea of rituals is kind of interesting. Again, you mentioned cult.

50:04.480 --> 50:09.920
 What's the role of ritual consumption of some of these substances or just ritual practice of

50:09.920 --> 50:16.800
 anything in the intellectual growth of particular groups of people or societies?

50:17.760 --> 50:23.360
 So again, I would say it is the centerpiece of ancient life, not just the mysteries of Dionysus,

50:24.160 --> 50:28.240
 which we've only talked a bit about, but the mysteries of Elucis were probably the most famous

50:28.880 --> 50:34.080
 and longest lasting of these Greek mystery rites. Just to put it in simple terms, the best definition

50:34.080 --> 50:40.480
 for a mystery religion, as the name implies, is something secret. Muo from the Greek means to

50:40.480 --> 50:47.120
 shut the eyes or to shut the mouth, to keep quiet about this stuff. We're always teasing details

50:47.680 --> 50:54.320
 from the archaeological and the literary record and we're kind of just grabbing at these secrets,

50:54.320 --> 51:01.120
 but Elucis, which survives for like 2000 years into the Christian period from about 1500 BC

51:01.120 --> 51:07.760
 to the 4th century AD, it's kind of this centerpiece of Greek life. Cicero, the great Roman

51:07.760 --> 51:14.320
 statesman, calls what was happening at Elucis the most exceptional and divine thing that Athens

51:14.320 --> 51:21.120
 ever produced. So not democracy, the arts and sciences or philosophy, but the vision that was

51:21.120 --> 51:27.040
 encountered at Elucis, perhaps through the ritual consumption of a potent psychedelic

51:27.040 --> 51:32.080
 over hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands and thousands, if not millions of initiates,

51:32.080 --> 51:38.160
 pilgrims who would walk from Athens to Elucis to encounter this vision. It seems to have been

51:39.120 --> 51:44.960
 not just an important part of Greek life, but the thing that made life livable, such that as these

51:44.960 --> 51:51.760
 mysteries are about to be exterminated by the newly Christianized Roman Empire, there's this passage

51:51.760 --> 51:56.240
 in the ancient literature that talks about these, in the absence of these mysteries, life becomes

51:56.240 --> 52:02.800
 unlivable. Abios. Is there ways you can, I mean, you write about the mysteries of Elucis and is

52:02.800 --> 52:10.720
 there ways you can convert that into words? Why those are so important to them, more important

52:10.720 --> 52:18.720
 than any other invention to them? Why is it such a source of meaning to life? So from what we can

52:18.720 --> 52:24.240
 reconstruct, they would make that pilgrimage 13 miles northwest of Athens to confront their

52:24.240 --> 52:29.520
 mortality. Remember, we were talking about homo naledi and in South Africa, this recognition

52:29.520 --> 52:37.040
 of self mortality, the deliberate disposal of the dead. Plato talks about the real practice of

52:37.040 --> 52:43.040
 philosophy being the death and dying process. So in some senses, you went to Elucis to die

52:43.600 --> 52:49.680
 and to experience a death before your death. We talked about this with Terence McKenna as well,

52:49.680 --> 52:54.960
 and this is how the psychedelic state seems to share something in common with the near death

52:54.960 --> 53:00.000
 or out of body experiences or these ecstatic experiences, whether through wine or beer or

53:00.000 --> 53:06.240
 otherwise, you went to Elucis to die. And it was said that only those who had witnessed this vision,

53:06.240 --> 53:12.960
 whatever vision was to be witnessed in Demeter Sanctuary, it essentially vouched safety the

53:12.960 --> 53:19.280
 afterlife, that only those who went there became immortal. And Cicero says that at that point,

53:19.280 --> 53:22.960
 you essentially live with more joy and die with a better hope.

53:24.240 --> 53:30.000
 Can I ask you a question about this human contention with death, this confrontation of

53:30.000 --> 53:38.080
 death that seems to be at the core of things? I don't know how deep to the core, but it seems

53:38.080 --> 53:44.640
 to be a central element of the human condition. What do you think about Ernest Becker and those

53:44.640 --> 53:52.560
 guys that put death at the, what is it, the warm of the core, which as the main thing,

53:54.320 --> 53:59.040
 the main, like this confrontation of our own mortality, first of all, being understand that

53:59.040 --> 54:06.800
 we're immortal and then confronting the terror of it, the fear of it as the creative, like trying

54:06.800 --> 54:14.640
 to escape the fear of death as the creative force of human society. So the reason we do anything is

54:14.640 --> 54:22.880
 because we're just running away from our death scared. Do you find some of that to be true?

54:22.880 --> 54:28.240
 First of all, as somebody who looks in the mirror, looks at yourself and your own as a human being,

54:28.240 --> 54:34.800
 two, just looking at society today, and three, at this whole big spread of human history and all

54:34.800 --> 54:40.320
 the cool stuff we've created, including the mysteries of eluces. I wonder what life would

54:40.320 --> 54:47.280
 look like in the absence of the fear of our mortality. I wonder how we'd interact with one

54:47.280 --> 54:52.400
 another if there was relatively little or no fear of death. I really do when it comes to

54:52.400 --> 54:57.520
 Becker's work and others. If the ancients were known for anything, it was running to death.

54:58.480 --> 55:02.800
 It was the opposite. In fact, dying before dying, which is the immortality key, by the way. It's

55:02.800 --> 55:08.560
 not psychedelics. When I refer to this key, I'm referring to this notion that's preserved in Greek.

55:08.560 --> 55:15.120
 An pethanis, prin pethanis, denta pethanis, otan pethanis. If you die before you die,

55:15.120 --> 55:22.880
 you won't die when you die. For some reason, the ancients prized that experience. We talked about

55:22.880 --> 55:30.000
 the mystics of Sufism and Kabbalism and Christian mysticism, where you have this same self nodding,

55:30.000 --> 55:35.840
 this death before death, the divine nothingness. For some reason, the mystic saints, visionaries,

55:35.840 --> 55:41.280
 and ancient philosophers, they ran to death. The one message I wanted to try and communicate with

55:41.280 --> 55:48.960
 this book is how they viewed life, that it can only be fully experienced, fully embodied in the

55:48.960 --> 55:56.560
 wake of a really intense, perhaps terrifying, but utterly transformational encounter with death.

55:56.560 --> 56:06.080
 Running to death, not running away from death. You talk about Aldous Huxley and mind changers.

56:07.680 --> 56:15.200
 If we look at the history where the ancients were running to death and maybe using some

56:15.200 --> 56:24.880
 performance enhancing permacons to run more effectively towards death. Now, we're using

56:26.800 --> 56:33.280
 tools of modern society, whether they're psychological, sociological, or pharmaceutical,

56:33.280 --> 56:40.800
 to run away from this conception. What do you see as a hopeful future for human civilization?

56:40.800 --> 56:50.240
 If all of these kinds of societies are ice cream flavors, how do you create the perfect ice cream

56:50.240 --> 56:55.360
 flavor? What is the future of religious experience, of psychedelic experience,

56:55.360 --> 57:01.120
 of intellectual journeys of facing death, running away from death? What do you hope

57:02.240 --> 57:05.600
 that looks like and what kind of idea should we look to?

57:05.600 --> 57:11.840
 My next book will be entitled Performance Enhancing Farmaca. You get a little copyright.

57:13.840 --> 57:22.160
 Yeah, I like it. But that's a historical view. What in that book would you suggest

57:22.160 --> 57:27.920
 in one of the last chapters about the future of this process?

57:27.920 --> 57:32.320
 Well, Huxley has to stop you. He stopped me in my tracks. Aldous Huxley.

57:32.320 --> 57:41.360
 Okay. In 1958, he pens this op ed of sorts. It reads incredibly prescient,

57:42.320 --> 57:48.400
 because I really do think in many ways as the fog of the war drug is ending and finally lifting

57:48.960 --> 57:55.040
 that we've come full circle back to the late 1950s, which might sound strange.

57:55.920 --> 58:00.560
 It'll make more sense when you hear what Huxley said about psychedelics. He was looking forward

58:00.560 --> 58:05.680
 to a revival of religion, which is why I subtitled the book, The Religion with No Name.

58:07.360 --> 58:15.280
 To him, Huxley, this revival wouldn't come about through televangelistic mass meetings

58:15.280 --> 58:22.240
 or photogenic clergymen, as he says. He points to the biochemical discoveries, such as we have

58:22.240 --> 58:28.720
 today, that would allow for large numbers of men and women to achieve a radical self transcendence

58:28.720 --> 58:33.520
 and a deeper understanding of the nature of things. In other words, that this revival of

58:33.520 --> 58:39.040
 religion, he says, would be a revolution. Alan Watts comes along and says that there's nothing more

58:41.040 --> 58:46.880
 dangerous to authority than a popular outbreak of mysticism. But I think this is what Huxley

58:46.880 --> 58:52.640
 was pointing to. He talks about religion in these terms, being less about symbols and returning

58:52.640 --> 58:59.200
 to a sense of experience and intuition. Huxley says that he envisions a religion

59:00.000 --> 59:05.680
 which gives rise to everyday mysticism. He talks about something that would undergird

59:05.680 --> 59:13.200
 everyday rationality, everyday tasks and duties, and everyday human relationships. In other words,

59:13.200 --> 59:19.120
 religion has to mean something. These altered states of awareness that we seem to be able to

59:19.120 --> 59:26.960
 produce quite easily inside the lab at Hopkins, NYU, and elsewhere with psilocybin, I think this is

59:26.960 --> 59:34.160
 kind of part of Huxley's prediction about a time when we would have legal access, safe access,

59:34.160 --> 59:40.960
 efficacious access to this material that would allow for insight in an afternoon. What do you do

59:40.960 --> 59:50.400
 when millions of people can become mystics in an afternoon? So psychedelics, psilocybin,

59:51.120 --> 59:58.000
 might be the practical way of having these kinds of maybe could be termed religious experiences.

59:58.640 --> 1:00:03.840
 And then many people partaking in those experiences and then like evolving this collective

1:00:03.840 --> 1:00:09.280
 intelligence thing we got going on, that's sort of the practice of religion that we should be

1:00:09.280 --> 1:00:15.680
 looking at striving for, as opposed to kind of operating in the space of ideas, actually practicing

1:00:15.680 --> 1:00:26.320
 it. You mentioned, and that's the religion with no name, the use of these tools. Is there a simple

1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:32.000
 way to summarize religion for our previous discussion about God, basically discovering the

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:37.040
 God inside? What if I give you a very complicated definition of religion and then we talk about

1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:43.840
 a more simplified? Let's do it. So the most complicated we can get on this is the anthropologist

1:00:43.840 --> 1:00:49.840
 Clifford Geertz. But I think it's worth defining our terms when we're talking about God and religion.

1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:55.200
 So religion religio from the Latin means to bind back. So to bind us back to some meaningful

1:00:55.200 --> 1:01:02.000
 tradition, to bind us back to the source, here's a mouthful from Clifford Geertz. Religion, he

1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:08.560
 defines as a set of symbols which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long lasting moods and

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:13.920
 motivations by formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing those

1:01:13.920 --> 1:01:21.200
 conceptions in such an aura of factuality that those moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic,

1:01:22.560 --> 1:01:28.240
 which is complex. What does that mean? That religion has to make you feel something,

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:33.920
 these moods and motivations. But it can't just do that in the way that sex does that for us or

1:01:33.920 --> 1:01:41.200
 sports or ultimate fighting or the World Cup or going to a concert. So we get all that emotion

1:01:41.200 --> 1:01:47.120
 in these experiences like that. But that emotion has to be concomitant to a deep existential

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.240
 insight that answers this question for you in the morning. I know why I'm here. I know why humans

1:01:52.240 --> 1:01:58.000
 are here. I think I know what the meaning of life is. That's what religion is. And if you find that

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:03.440
 meaning in science, then that's your religion and that's fine. But we need to be more honest about

1:02:03.440 --> 1:02:09.280
 that. If your epistemological model is weighing facts and figures and you think that's why you're

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:14.320
 here on this planet and you find deep meaning, that's okay. Religion is the thing that makes you

1:02:14.320 --> 1:02:20.880
 feel. It has the aura of factuality. It just makes you feel like you know the point behind

1:02:20.880 --> 1:02:25.680
 existence. In other words, I think it comes down to experience. Like Joe Campbell was talking about

1:02:25.680 --> 1:02:30.480
 like Audis Huxley mentions about experience and intuition. I think this is how we connect to God.

1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:38.720
 Make you feel like you understand the world. I mean, so that's kind of bigger than science.

1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:47.040
 That includes science, but it's bigger. Do you think, what is real? Like, do you think there's

1:02:47.040 --> 1:02:53.360
 an absolute reality that we're kind of striving towards understanding or is it all just conjured

1:02:53.360 --> 1:03:00.400
 up in our minds? And that's the whole kind of point. We together create these realities and

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:07.920
 play with them and dance to somehow derive meaning from those realities. And it's ultimately not

1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:15.520
 like very deeply integrated into what's like into atoms of space time.

1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:23.760
 Another easy question, Lex. Well, I mean, you have to kind of, when you're thinking about

1:03:25.280 --> 1:03:32.240
 emotion and making it concrete into something that feels real, you have to start asking

1:03:32.240 --> 1:03:40.000
 like, what is real? It's something that, you know, Ben Shapiro has this saying of facts don't

1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:46.240
 care about your feelings. I was always uncomfortable with this. I mean, he's just being spiffy or

1:03:46.240 --> 1:03:53.360
 whatever, but I was always uncomfortable with somehow first that the hubris of thinking that

1:03:53.360 --> 1:04:02.000
 humans can have like arrive at absolute truth, what he means, which is what I assume he means by

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:08.880
 facts, like things that are uncontrovertible. And then somehow deriding feelings, like feelings

1:04:08.880 --> 1:04:17.520
 are not important. To me, like the whole thing is reality. The facts don't even like facts is

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:24.240
 reality, feelings are reality, like the entirety of human experience is reality. All these

1:04:24.240 --> 1:04:29.680
 consciousnesses somehow interacting together, make up making up random crap and together agreeing

1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:33.920
 that we're all going to wear the same colors, rooting for one football team or the other

1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:40.800
 football team or countries. All those things, that's real because we've agreed that it's real

1:04:40.800 --> 1:04:46.800
 in the same way and gives us meaning. In that same way, religion is a set of ideas that gives us

1:04:46.800 --> 1:04:57.680
 meaning. But, you know, real, it's really a difficult for me as a scientist that finds comfort

1:04:57.680 --> 1:05:04.000
 in the physical understanding of the universe of physics. You know, I love physics, I love computer

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:11.520
 science. It makes me feel like everything is perfectly understandable. And then I look at humans,

1:05:12.320 --> 1:05:17.360
 they're totally not understandable. It's like a giant mess, but that's part of the beauty. Like,

1:05:17.360 --> 1:05:26.320
 what is love? Like, what the hell is love? It's certainly not like a weird hack to convince me

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:31.920
 to procreate because it feels something bigger than that. So like, taking a purely evolutionary

1:05:31.920 --> 1:05:37.520
 biologist perspective is missing the, it's not missing, it's only capturing a part of the picture.

1:05:38.080 --> 1:05:45.040
 And so it just keeps making me ask, what is real? Because as a human, it's very human centric. It

1:05:45.040 --> 1:05:57.600
 does certainly feel like a part, a big part of what is real is all the fake stuff my mind makes up.

1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:01.760
 I mean, okay, I guess, is there something you could say

1:06:03.760 --> 1:06:09.760
 from our discussions about the tools of psychedelics, about our discussion about religion,

1:06:09.760 --> 1:06:17.600
 of what is real, of what is reality? These are largely unanswerable questions.

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:22.720
 But we should never less strive to answer them. That's the whole point of the human experience.

1:06:22.720 --> 1:06:26.880
 And I think science is one way and religion is another. And I think there's actually a sphere

1:06:26.880 --> 1:06:33.120
 where they intersect, you know, there's a way for religion to be observable, testable, repeatable,

1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:37.280
 falsifiable. When I look at the ancient mystery is that that's what I find. I think I find people

1:06:37.280 --> 1:06:43.920
 exploring alternate states of consciousness and arriving at conclusions based on that exploration

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:49.280
 and deriving deep meaning from that, which, yes, are feelings and emotions and very hard to quantify.

1:06:49.280 --> 1:06:53.600
 But nonetheless, these are the things that govern our lives. I mean, I don't know a parent who

1:06:53.600 --> 1:07:00.240
 isn't motivated by their, by the love of their children. Everything I do at 40 years old now

1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:05.120
 is pretty much inspired by my love for my two daughters. And I can't prove to you that I love

1:07:05.120 --> 1:07:10.400
 them. I can say it, I can show you behavior, but it's very hard for me to weigh and measure that.

1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:19.520
 So not everything is so reducible to this quantifiable reality. And yet, I also love science.

1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:24.960
 And I love the historical process of weighing this data. I love the chemistry. I love the biology.

1:07:25.840 --> 1:07:31.680
 And for me, I think this was the message of the ancient Greeks. And I think this is the world

1:07:31.680 --> 1:07:37.120
 in which Paleo Christianity was born. I think there is this meeting ground between science and

1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:47.200
 religion, which allow for the, if not the discovery, then at least the near identification

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:52.320
 of the ultimate reality, which is another way to describe God, right? This being of beings,

1:07:52.320 --> 1:07:57.920
 the transcendent mystery. So speaking of God, you mentioned to me offline, you're wearing

1:07:57.920 --> 1:08:05.680
 the, the most sophisticated clothing choice of the elite intellectuals. Like you mentioned,

1:08:05.680 --> 1:08:09.360
 Sam Harris was wearing a hoodie. This is the Sam Harris hoodie. He's starting a trend.

1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:15.200
 He's starting a trend. This is a new religion, you could even say. It's a ritual. It's a ritual

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:23.280
 practice of intellectuals of searching for meaning. So there's, there's quite a fascinating debate.

1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:31.120
 So he was, for a time, still known as one of the sort of new age atheists. So he was kind

1:08:31.120 --> 1:08:36.640
 of trying to explore the role of religion society and the role of science. And then on the other

1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:44.800
 side, another kind of powerhouse intellectual is Jordan Peterson, who in sometimes, for my

1:08:44.800 --> 1:08:51.520
 taste, a bit too poetic of ways is exploring the ideas of religion. And they had these

1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:58.880
 interesting debates that I think will continue about the role of religion society. For, for Jordan,

1:08:58.880 --> 1:09:09.200
 there's all these flaws with religion, but there is a lot of value to be discovered amidst the,

1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:14.960
 the rituals, the traditions, the practice, the way we conceive of each other because of the ideas

1:09:14.960 --> 1:09:23.840
 that religion propagates. And then for Sam, it says that everything about religion is basically

1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:32.400
 gets in the way of us fully realizing our human potential, which is deeply scientific and rational

1:09:32.400 --> 1:09:42.240
 and sort of like we're surrounded by mystery. Calling that mystery God is getting in the way

1:09:42.240 --> 1:09:48.320
 of us understanding that mystery. What do you think about this debate about the role of religion

1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:52.960
 and society? We should continue having this debate. I talked to Jordan a couple of weeks ago,

1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:57.920
 as a matter of fact. Excellent. On his podcast? Yes. Public? Excellent. It'll be out soon. And so,

1:09:58.560 --> 1:10:04.000
 you know, he and I, How did that go, by the way? It was, it was incredible. Carl Ruck,

1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:08.400
 the professor, joined us as a matter of fact for one of his rare public appearances. Beautiful.

1:10:08.400 --> 1:10:13.760
 We went, we went deep. And Jordan is very well read, obviously, on the psychedelic literature.

1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:19.440
 He had just had Roland Griffiths from Hopkins on the podcast. And it's one of Roland's figures

1:10:19.440 --> 1:10:24.880
 that Jordan and I, again, just like the language of Aldous Huxley, it's hard to move past the

1:10:24.880 --> 1:10:31.360
 following statistic. Over the past 20 years of the modern study of psilocybin, Roland will tell you

1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:37.520
 that about three and four of their volunteers walk away from their single dose of psilocybin,

1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:43.600
 high dose, saying it was among the most meaningful experiences of their entire lives, if not the

1:10:43.600 --> 1:10:51.520
 most meaningful. And Jordan says, like, how do you, what do you do with that? How do we, I mean,

1:10:51.520 --> 1:11:00.160
 how do we synthesize that? You know, here we are quantifying the, the qualifiable, the unqualifiable.

1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:05.680
 And yet these, these compounds have dramatic effects on people's lives. And they walk away

1:11:05.680 --> 1:11:12.560
 feeling like they're more loving, more compassionate. The science of all talks about

1:11:13.360 --> 1:11:19.360
 the, the welling up of cooperation and resource sharing and kindness and all these strange things

1:11:19.360 --> 1:11:25.280
 from this single chemical intervention, which seems to reduce us to automata as if enlightenment can

1:11:25.280 --> 1:11:30.640
 be flipped on like a switch. And yet there it is, there's the data. And I don't see how you walk

1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:36.480
 away from that. I mean, I completely understand Sam's position. But I think there's, there's a

1:11:36.480 --> 1:11:42.000
 reading of religion, particularly the mystical core of, of the big faiths and especially these

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:48.800
 ancient mystery cults, which do speak again to those moods and motivations, creating this aura

1:11:48.800 --> 1:11:55.280
 of factuality that these volunteers never walk away from permanently transformed, just like the

1:11:55.280 --> 1:12:00.240
 ancient mysteries. And part of that is perhaps language that we need to continue to evolve

1:12:00.240 --> 1:12:09.920
 language in, in how we conceive of these processes. Maybe religion has a bunch of baggage associated

1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:17.520
 with it that is good to let go of, or perhaps not. I don't know. It did, this is connected to our

1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:21.760
 previous part of our conversation is the importance of language in this whole thing.

1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:26.160
 Well, that's how I start my book with one of these volunteers from the NYU psilocybin experiments,

1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:32.480
 this, this woman Dynah Dynabaser, who's an atheist and she still describes herself as an atheist.

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:38.080
 And yet as one of these three and four people who walked away from this experiment transformed,

1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:44.080
 she says that her experience of psilocybin was like being bathed in God's love from an atheist.

1:12:44.080 --> 1:12:49.840
 And I asked her why she uses the word God, why not the love of the cosmos or the universe or

1:12:49.840 --> 1:12:54.160
 mother nature? And she says, well, frankly, you know, we don't know about any of this stuff and

1:12:54.160 --> 1:13:00.880
 that God makes sense to me. She's still an atheist. But it's the way she describes that as kind of

1:13:00.880 --> 1:13:06.800
 like the way your mother's love must have felt when you were a baby. Yeah, there's a, there's a kind

1:13:06.800 --> 1:13:12.160
 of, I like the way Einstein uses God, God doesn't play dice. There's a poetry, there's a humility

1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:16.960
 that you don't know what the hell is going on. There's a humor to it. I'm a huge fan, especially

1:13:16.960 --> 1:13:25.040
 like more and more of just kind of having a big old laugh at the absurdity of this world and this

1:13:25.040 --> 1:13:32.240
 life as represented nicely by memes on Twitter kind of thing. I mean, there's a, there's a sense

1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:38.480
 in which we want to be playing with these words and not take them so seriously and being a little

1:13:38.480 --> 1:13:45.840
 bit lighthearted and explore. Let me ask you about, because you mentioned NYU, what I find

1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:53.680
 fascinating is how much amazing research or speaking of science, right? Studying the effects of

1:13:53.680 --> 1:14:00.240
 psilocybin, studying the effects of various psychedelics, MDMA on the human mind right now

1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:07.040
 for helping people. But I'm hoping they'll be studies soon at Hopkins and elsewhere that

1:14:07.040 --> 1:14:13.120
 allow people that are kind of more quote unquote, creatives or regular people that don't have a

1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:18.560
 particular demon they're trying to work through, a problem they're trying to work through. But

1:14:19.120 --> 1:14:25.760
 more like to see what can I find if I utilize psychedelics to explore? Is there something

1:14:25.760 --> 1:14:32.160
 you could say that is exciting to you as promising about the future, what currently is going on,

1:14:32.160 --> 1:14:35.680
 but also the future of psychedelics research? Yeah. Hopkins and elsewhere.

1:14:35.680 --> 1:14:40.480
 The healthy normals. The healthy normals. I was looking for the right words because normal doesn't

1:14:40.480 --> 1:14:44.880
 feel healthy, doesn't feel like a good term and normal doesn't feel like a good term because

1:14:44.880 --> 1:14:50.320
 we're all pretty messed up and we're all weird. Well, those with ontological angst in that case.

1:14:50.880 --> 1:14:56.240
 Great. Maybe there'll be a future DSM qualification. There's no doubt that things like

1:14:56.240 --> 1:15:02.880
 psilocybin, MDMA are useful for things like anxiety, depression, end of life distress, PTSD,

1:15:02.880 --> 1:15:09.280
 alcoholism, you name it. And it's largely because of the clinical research that MDMA and psilocybin

1:15:09.280 --> 1:15:16.160
 will probably be legal in some FDA regulated way in the next five years. But again, I start the

1:15:16.160 --> 1:15:21.840
 first page of my book with this question, why do psychedelics work across all these different

1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:30.400
 conditions? And the best that I could find is the meaning. Tony Bossis at NYU talks about

1:15:30.400 --> 1:15:35.120
 psilocybin, for example, as meaning making medicine, which is interesting because it

1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:42.080
 puts it somewhere between a therapeutic and, again, this ontological instigator. What is it

1:15:42.080 --> 1:15:48.000
 about psychedelics that creates these mystical experiences or mystical like experiences? You

1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:53.360
 can call them emotional breakthroughs. You can call them moments of all. I do think we get

1:15:53.360 --> 1:15:57.920
 locked up in the language and we're somewhere between science and religion here, including

1:15:57.920 --> 1:16:03.440
 legally. So the FDA's one route to this, what excites me about psychedelics is the First

1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:07.360
 Amendment. What does this going to mean for religion? The freedom of religion being the

1:16:07.360 --> 1:16:11.200
 first thing that's mentioned in the First Amendment before freedom of speech, freedom of

1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:18.080
 assembly. If America is known for anything, it's a refuge for religious pioneers. And so

1:16:18.080 --> 1:16:23.040
 we already have the Native American church, Brazilian spawn churches that are using psychedelics.

1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:30.720
 But what would happen if Judaism or Christianity or Islam were to begin incorporating the very

1:16:30.720 --> 1:16:38.160
 ritual, very sacred and discreet use of psychedelics as part of their liturgy? So not replacing

1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:45.120
 the Sunday Eucharist in the case of Christianity, but part of the extra credit dimension of the

1:16:45.120 --> 1:16:50.320
 faith. And then we can, through practice, figure out how essential it is. It could be a minor

1:16:50.320 --> 1:16:56.000
 thing. It could be a major thing. That's another thing I wanted to ask you is, recently, despite

1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:02.240
 the fact that I'm eating a huge amount of meat, I'm getting fat. I'm loving it. This is actually,

1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:08.800
 as of two days ago, I started this long road to training for David Goggins, to training back,

1:17:09.680 --> 1:17:15.840
 to getting back to competing in Jiu Jitsu. So the fun is over. But I also partook in fasting.

1:17:15.840 --> 1:17:23.360
 And there was a very strong, there's an almost like a hose and a genetic aspect of fasting,

1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:28.320
 because it was especially because it was a 72 hour fast versus a more common fast that I do,

1:17:28.320 --> 1:17:35.600
 which is 24 hours. And a bunch of people talk about throughout history about the value of

1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:42.960
 fasting and having these kind of visual, these kind of intellectual experiences. Also, there's

1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:52.560
 meditation, Sam Harris with the hoodie. Do you have a sense that those other rituals of fasting

1:17:52.560 --> 1:18:00.080
 of meditation and maybe other things could be as essential or more essential to the religious

1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:06.560
 experience as psychedelics? Yes, if not, and this is going to sound weird, but maybe not if more so.

1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:13.920
 I look at psychedelics as a catalyst for spiritual investigation, not as the superficial

1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:22.000
 means to an end. I think their value is in kind of serving as a Google Maps for the kingdom of

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:33.920
 heaven. Well, so Ram Dass's teacher said that when he was offered psychedelics that it'll get you

1:18:33.920 --> 1:18:39.600
 in the room with Jesus, but it won't keep you there. And I think that's all well and good,

1:18:39.600 --> 1:18:43.120
 but what if you don't know where the house is in the first place? What if you've never had

1:18:43.120 --> 1:18:49.440
 a mystical experience? What if religion is anathema to you? What if you hate God? What if all these

1:18:49.440 --> 1:18:53.520
 words mean nothing to you? And they probably do for many, many people, and it's perfectly

1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:58.800
 understandable. I think that we've lost the coordinates to these irrational states, again,

1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:04.800
 that were prized throughout antiquity and that continue to be prized by the mystical communities

1:19:04.800 --> 1:19:10.000
 even in big organized religion. It just doesn't filter out that much. And so psychedelics in

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:19.360
 my mind help orient our minds, bodies, and souls towards the irrational. We talked about McKenna's

1:19:19.360 --> 1:19:25.520
 invisible world that seems to have this symbiosis with our own and perhaps has this higher intent

1:19:25.520 --> 1:19:33.120
 for us. You could very well just take catalog of your dreams, and that would do it too. But

1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:39.760
 psychedelics seem to be particularly fast acting, particularly potent and very reliable,

1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:44.880
 especially in the clinical studies. And so I looked at them as biochemical discoveries like

1:19:44.880 --> 1:19:51.520
 Huxley did. Maybe it's once in your life or infrequently. But maybe that's the beginning

1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:57.440
 of a genuine introspection and a life well examined as the ancients always instructed us.

1:19:57.440 --> 1:20:02.480
 Yeah, it does seem in the research that the effectiveness of psychedelics always comes

1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:09.520
 with the integration where you use it just like you said as a catalyst for thinking through stuff.

1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:17.120
 It's not going to be, I don't even know if Google Maps, maybe Google Maps is the right analogy,

1:20:17.120 --> 1:20:23.360
 but it doesn't do the driving for you. You still have to do the driving. It just kind of gives you

1:20:23.360 --> 1:20:29.760
 the directions. So after you come down from the trip or whatever, you still have to drive.

1:20:30.640 --> 1:20:35.760
 There's other tools that are kind of interesting. We've been talking about this at the psychological

1:20:35.760 --> 1:20:41.440
 level, but there's also a neuroscience perspective that if you kind of like go past the skull into

1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:46.560
 the brain with the neurons firing, there's ideas of brain computer interfaces. First of all,

1:20:46.560 --> 1:20:50.880
 there's a whole field of neuroscience that's kind of zooming in and studying the firing of the brain,

1:20:50.880 --> 1:20:58.960
 the firing of the neurons in the brain, of how from those neurons emerges all the things that we

1:20:58.960 --> 1:21:03.680
 think that make us human. That's a fascinating exploration of the human mind. That that's of

1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:09.600
 course where the psychedelics have the chemical, the biochemical effects on those neurons.

1:21:11.120 --> 1:21:17.040
 There's ideas of brain computer interfaces, which if you look at, especially what Neuralink is doing

1:21:17.040 --> 1:21:26.160
 with this long term vision with Elon Musk and Neuralink, they hope to expand. He calls it a

1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:38.080
 wizard hat. This is back to the humor on the internet thing. The wizard hat that expands the

1:21:38.960 --> 1:21:44.880
 capabilities, the capacity of the human mind. Do you think there's something there or

1:21:47.840 --> 1:21:54.080
 is the human mind so infinitely complex that we're quite a long way away from

1:21:54.080 --> 1:22:02.240
 expanding the capabilities of the human mind through technology versus something like psychedelics?

1:22:03.440 --> 1:22:05.760
 I wonder how Terence McKenna would answer that question.

1:22:06.960 --> 1:22:14.080
 He looked to shamans as kind of the scientists, the high magicians of the high archaic past

1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:20.400
 and the far flung future. You know more about AI than I do, so I'm not going to discount it,

1:22:20.400 --> 1:22:32.880
 but I do think that AI paired with the sacred recovery, the archaeology of consciousness

1:22:33.440 --> 1:22:38.400
 and these states, these archaic techniques of ecstasy that were practiced across time.

1:22:38.400 --> 1:22:45.200
 I think that's a winning combination. Part of what I do in the book is just I try and lay out

1:22:45.200 --> 1:22:49.680
 the set and setting. That's often talked about with psychedelics. I mean, so maybe psychedelics

1:22:49.680 --> 1:22:54.880
 in the right AI environment is going to work. I think it'd probably work a lot better with that

1:22:54.880 --> 1:23:01.760
 myth and ritual incorporated. The reason Elusis worked for 2,000 years, and let's assume the

1:23:01.760 --> 1:23:06.960
 psychedelic hypothesis has some merit to it, but I think the reason it worked is because you were

1:23:06.960 --> 1:23:12.800
 born into a mythology. You were born into a story about Demeter and Persephone and you waited your

1:23:12.800 --> 1:23:19.840
 entire life to meet them in the flesh, so you weren't just preparing for a few months. It was a lifetime

1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:27.280
 of expectation, anticipation, ritual preparation. In fact, some of the early church fathers made fun

1:23:27.280 --> 1:23:32.400
 of the Greeks for essentially just peaking people's curiosity and revving up the anticipation,

1:23:32.400 --> 1:23:36.160
 which has something to do with the outcome, by the way. But in other words, I think we need to

1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:41.920
 create a new mythology around this. I don't think you pop into a laboratory. I don't think you pop

1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:47.120
 into a retreat center from one day to the next. I think that in my own case, I feel like I've been

1:23:47.120 --> 1:23:52.720
 preparing 12 years for psychedelics and I'm still preparing, including in today's conversation.

1:23:52.720 --> 1:23:59.440
 I'm learning new things and I'm willing to explore it together with the computer interface,

1:23:59.440 --> 1:24:08.000
 but I do think ritual is a gigantic part of this. Even McKenna would say that. I'll paraphrase him by

1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:14.960
 saying that if you'd met someone who didn't know where they were between the years 1995 and 2005,

1:24:14.960 --> 1:24:20.480
 you would describe them as a fairly damaged person. Yet, who among us knows what was happening

1:24:20.480 --> 1:24:26.720
 in Western civilization between 900 and 1300, let alone 2,500 years ago? This is, in many ways,

1:24:26.720 --> 1:24:32.320
 the prophet of the psychedelic renaissance, saying that history has lessons. I don't think

1:24:32.320 --> 1:24:38.480
 they're superficial lessons. I think it cuts to the very core of how and why Western civilization

1:24:38.480 --> 1:24:46.400
 came to be born. Yeah, but that history can be loaded into AI systems. I do love the idea of

1:24:47.680 --> 1:24:55.520
 whether it's to bring computer interfaces or without direct reading of the neurons

1:24:55.520 --> 1:25:01.920
 and more interactive experience of the robot, that you can have an AI system that steers

1:25:01.920 --> 1:25:10.320
 your psychedelic experience, that helps you when you take a heroic dose of psilocybin,

1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:16.720
 for example, help steer you, steer your mind, say just the right things. I mean, you could say that

1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:25.200
 kind of thing with, it's a totally open problem, I would say. You talk about set and setting,

1:25:25.200 --> 1:25:31.200
 this is the interesting thing about Johns Hopkins is you create a comfortable environment,

1:25:31.200 --> 1:25:39.040
 a safe environment for allowing, then if you take a large dose of psilocybin that you could

1:25:39.680 --> 1:25:44.320
 trust that everything would be safe and you can really allow the exploration of your mind,

1:25:44.320 --> 1:25:51.040
 but then you don't know from a psychotherapy perspective of during that trip what a human

1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:57.360
 should say to steer that trip. That's a totally open set of problems. In some sense, probably

1:25:57.360 --> 1:26:02.320
 throughout history, those rituals, you figured out what are the right things to say to each other.

1:26:02.320 --> 1:26:07.280
 Exactly. How to collaborate. Maybe if you can turn that to an optimization problem,

1:26:08.640 --> 1:26:13.520
 AI could figure that out much, much quicker. I'm with you. Elusis was known for three things,

1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:20.160
 the legomena, the dromena, the deignumena, the things said, the things done, the things shown.

1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:24.800
 If you can pack that all into your AI interface, I'm in, Lex Friedman. I'm going to write a

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:33.840
 proposal and then try to get it through the IRB at MIT. There's a certain sense in which I definitely

1:26:33.840 --> 1:26:41.600
 want to explore psychedelics in my personal life, but also more rigorously as a scientist

1:26:42.400 --> 1:26:52.080
 and to push that forward, especially in the AI space. It is difficult how to do that dance

1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:58.080
 when there's gray areas of legality and all those kinds of things. We're dancing around them and

1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:07.760
 some of that is language. Some of that is what we socially conceive of as drugs or not. You're

1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:12.320
 right that perhaps we can reframe it as religious experiences, all those kinds of things. It's

1:27:12.320 --> 1:27:17.600
 fascinating because it feels like there's a bunch of tools before us that were used by the ancients

1:27:17.600 --> 1:27:26.080
 that were not utilizing for exploring the human mind that we very well could be in a rigorous

1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:34.080
 scientific way in a safe way. That's fascinating. There's this interesting period of in the 20th

1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:42.160
 century of LSD use that many of the people doing research on psychedelics now kind of have their

1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:49.200
 roots in that history. I mentioned that Dr. McDowell, and he is one of those people. There's

1:27:49.200 --> 1:27:55.440
 this interesting story of a bunch of creatives that used LSD or other drugs to help them.

1:27:57.200 --> 1:28:01.600
 What do you make of the idea of somebody like Ken Keezy who wrote One Flover's The Cuckoo's Nest

1:28:01.600 --> 1:28:14.320
 in part under the influence of LSD? What do you make of the use of psychedelics to maximize the

1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:26.080
 creative potential of the human mind? Is this as a crutch or is this actually an effective tool

1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:31.840
 that we should explore? One person's crutch might be another bungee cord.

1:28:35.360 --> 1:28:41.840
 It depends on that mind. Think about Paul McCartney. I mean, we might not have some of the

1:28:41.840 --> 1:28:48.400
 better Beatles music in the absence of LSD. What did Sir Paul say in 1967 when he was asked about

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:55.200
 his use of LSD? He said that he recognized the dangers inherent in it, but that he did it with

1:28:55.200 --> 1:29:00.720
 a very specific, very deliberate purpose in mind. He wanted to find the answer to what life is all

1:29:00.720 --> 1:29:06.560
 about. I'm not sure what Sir Paul is doing this week, but he's probably not doing LSD.

1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:13.920
 Speaking back to my theory about these substances being catalyzers of spiritual introspection,

1:29:15.760 --> 1:29:19.920
 it came along at a time in their life when I think they were ripe for it, especially George

1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:28.480
 Harrison. I highly recommend the Martin Scorsese documentary about George Harrison. For them,

1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:35.280
 I think it was exactly the way we ought to investigate it, which is, well, mind expanders.

1:29:35.280 --> 1:29:39.600
 This is what psychedelics do. That which makes manifest the contents of the mind.

1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:45.360
 In the absence of an experience like that, and it can be in a three day fast, it can be laying down

1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:51.840
 in a cave, it can be in ritual chanting, it can be in a Sundance, but in the absence of that kind

1:29:51.840 --> 1:29:57.840
 of experience at the right time in your life, it may otherwise be very difficult to find entrance

1:29:57.840 --> 1:30:01.840
 to that kingdom of heaven, which I do think is here and now, getting right back to the very

1:30:01.840 --> 1:30:07.440
 beginning. If we are actually to participate in that eternal principle, how and when?

1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:11.680
 What do you think Nietzsche meant when you said that God is dead?

1:30:11.680 --> 1:30:21.040
 There is a sense that religion is fading from society, and there's a cranky German that

1:30:21.040 --> 1:30:23.840
 kind of wrote about it. What do you think he meant?

1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:29.920
 He was a cranky German who knew a lot about Dionysus, by the way, which is why I like him.

1:30:30.720 --> 1:30:38.000
 Certainly, there's some truth to the mortality of God. I think Gallup put out a study only a

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:43.040
 couple of months ago where church membership is now officially in the minority in the United States

1:30:43.040 --> 1:30:49.840
 at 47% according to the most recent poll. That number was closer to 70% only 20 years ago.

1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:54.800
 So we're living through something, and we're living through the unchurching of America,

1:30:54.800 --> 1:31:00.800
 and it's the rise of the spiritual but not religious, the inheritor of all traditions,

1:31:00.800 --> 1:31:06.240
 but the slave to none. There's a rise in the unaffiliated, the nuns. I think it was one third

1:31:06.240 --> 1:31:10.400
 of millennials. It's probably much higher now that don't affiliate with any religion.

1:31:10.400 --> 1:31:16.480
 So in that sense, God is absolutely dead, but maybe not the God that we were trying to define

1:31:17.120 --> 1:31:21.200
 at the very beginning. So Nietzsche also looked forward to the ubermensch,

1:31:21.200 --> 1:31:28.080
 which would be a fully realized human being that despite the death of God did not fall into

1:31:28.640 --> 1:31:34.000
 nihilism and amorality, existential despair, all that great German stuff.

1:31:34.000 --> 1:31:40.240
 And there are some commentators who talk about this eternal recurrence that just may be by

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:45.040
 incorporating some of these techniques, not necessarily doctrine and dogma, but I would

1:31:45.040 --> 1:31:50.400
 say the techniques of antiquity. And again, Nietzsche writes a lot about the irrationality

1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:56.000
 of Dionysus having its place in society. If anything, these biochemical discoveries,

1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:01.760
 I think point us back. They point us back to Dionysus, and they're responsible

1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:10.160
 in corporation of the irrational into our otherwise society of rational people and our

1:32:10.160 --> 1:32:16.240
 Khazoo history. I have a sense that there'll be kind of, just kind of as you've implied,

1:32:16.960 --> 1:32:23.360
 that there'll be maybe the God of old is dying and there'll be a rebirth of different kind of

1:32:23.360 --> 1:32:28.480
 God and it'll just keep happening throughout history. I do think there will be a time where

1:32:28.480 --> 1:32:34.480
 AI will be the gods we look to, the other, the super intelligent, those kinds of things.

1:32:35.360 --> 1:32:43.520
 There's a little bit of an inkling of religious longing for meaning in the way people conceive

1:32:43.520 --> 1:32:50.400
 of aliens currently. I mean, I talked to a bunch of people about UFOs, EPs and aliens.

1:32:50.400 --> 1:32:54.960
 And so to me, it's very interesting for perhaps different reasons because I'm just,

1:32:54.960 --> 1:33:01.360
 I look up to the stars and it's incredibly humbling to me to think that there's trillions of

1:33:01.360 --> 1:33:06.480
 intelligent alien civilizations out there, which to me seems likely or perhaps not intelligent,

1:33:07.040 --> 1:33:13.440
 perhaps just alien life. And actually also that we don't even understand what it means to be

1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:18.160
 intelligent or do we understand what it means to be alive? The time scale, the spatial scale, which

1:33:18.160 --> 1:33:28.160
 patterns of atoms can form in a way that you can call life, it just could be way weirder

1:33:29.280 --> 1:33:35.520
 than we can imagine and certainly way different than human life. Anyway, that to me is humbling.

1:33:36.160 --> 1:33:41.680
 And so it's almost like the simulation, conceiving of the world, the simulation,

1:33:42.240 --> 1:33:47.120
 thinking of aliens to me is a useful thought experiment of like, what would aliens look like

1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:51.760
 if they visited? How would we know? How would we communicate with them? How would we

1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:59.280
 send signals to them if they're already here and we don't see them? How's that possible?

1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:04.640
 That seems to me actually likely that we would just be too self centered and too dumb to see them

1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:12.320
 if they're already here. Anyway, but so that's kind of the almost the the the pragmatic, the

1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:20.000
 engineering, the the physics sense of aliens. But there's also kind of a longing to connect

1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:24.240
 with other intelligent beings out there, both the fear and the excitement of that,

1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:30.560
 that has kind of a religious aspect to it, that I find fascinating. And in the right context,

1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:37.040
 when you remove the skepticism of government from that, it's actually a hopeful longing. Do you have a

1:34:37.040 --> 1:34:44.240
 do you see this kind of interest in aliens as it all connected to your study of religion?

1:34:44.240 --> 1:34:48.480
 So you're the first person to ask me about aliens in eight months. So it looks like I'm going on

1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:59.840
 the record. I'll drop some J. Allen Heineck on you. So Heineck, involved in Project Blue Book,

1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:06.240
 famously says in 1966, when the long awaited solution to the UFO problem comes, and we're

1:35:06.240 --> 1:35:11.760
 assuming that UFOs have something to do with aliens. But when the long awaited solution comes,

1:35:11.760 --> 1:35:17.680
 I believe it will prove to be not merely the next small step in the march of science,

1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:24.160
 but a mighty and unexpected quantum leap. In other words, I do not think that we're dealing with

1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:31.680
 flesh and blood beings in nuts and bolts crafts. I think it's way, way more complicated than that.

1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:36.960
 And if anything, it takes me back to the ancient world. It takes me back to this invisible college

1:35:36.960 --> 1:35:43.600
 of beings of apparent higher intent. It takes me to the geniuses and the muses. So the first

1:35:43.600 --> 1:35:49.520
 document in Western civilization, Homer's, Homer's epics, they begin by invoking an alien.

1:35:50.080 --> 1:36:00.320
 They invoke a muse. Tell me, oh muse about the man. So Homer isn't inventing poetry. He's channeling

1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:08.240
 poetry, epic poetry from an alien intelligence. Maybe that intelligence has felt a little

1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:16.640
 unrecognized in recent years. Trying to show up in human recognizable forms. The muse is trying

1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:23.920
 to give a little hints of its existence. Yeah, I mean, I have been saying, I honestly sort of,

1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:31.600
 I don't believe this, but I think about this, whether alien, like muse is a great example,

1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:40.560
 whether aliens could be thoughts, ideas we have are the aliens, or consciousness itself

1:36:41.200 --> 1:36:45.680
 is the methods by which aliens communicate with us. Like I find this very kind of

1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:52.720
 liberating to expand our conception of what intelligent beings are.

1:36:52.720 --> 1:36:59.120
 You would like Julian Jaynes. Julian Jaynes writes a great book, The Origins of Consciousness and

1:36:59.120 --> 1:37:05.040
 the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind. It's this theory that the ancient Greek mind was very

1:37:05.040 --> 1:37:10.320
 different from ours, and that when they heard the muses, or the gods and goddesses for that

1:37:10.320 --> 1:37:17.840
 matter, they would hear them as voices in the head and hear it as an internal god figure

1:37:17.840 --> 1:37:21.840
 offering commands, which they couldn't ignore. So were they walking schizophrenics?

1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:25.760
 It might be one way to talk about it before the breakdown of the bicameral mind,

1:37:25.760 --> 1:37:31.360
 but it's a provocative theory, largely untestable. But when you're reading ancient Greek and Latin

1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:35.840
 for that matter, you can't read it very long without bumping up against these discarnate

1:37:35.840 --> 1:37:43.360
 entities. They're everywhere, and they survived. They persist across time, which is even stranger,

1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:47.840
 not just in the form of all the things my daughters like, like fairies and gnomes and elves, but,

1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:53.600
 and McKenna loves this, the sylphs and the bolder grinders and the sprites and the jins

1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:57.360
 and elementals. Every society has them. It seems to be fairly universal,

1:37:58.560 --> 1:38:02.880
 and they largely exist in folklore, mythology. This is what Jacques Valais writes about so

1:38:02.880 --> 1:38:09.680
 wonderfully. We've kind of been sneaking around it, but let me ask you from yours,

1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:13.680
 from everything we've been talking about, how do you think about consciousness?

1:38:13.680 --> 1:38:22.400
 Is it a fun little trick that the human mind does, or is it somehow fundamental to this whole thing?

1:38:23.920 --> 1:38:32.400
 So, this three pound lump of jelly inside our craniums that can contemplate the vastness of

1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:38.480
 interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity, and it can contemplate itself

1:38:38.480 --> 1:38:44.400
 contemplating on the meaning of infinity, that peculiar self recursive quality that we call

1:38:44.400 --> 1:38:50.160
 self awareness. So, this is the hard problem, right? This is the unknowable, the unknown at

1:38:50.160 --> 1:38:55.200
 least. I don't know. I have no good answer for that, aside from that.

1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:00.160
 Do you think it's somehow deeply fundamental to the human experience, or is it just a trick? So,

1:39:00.160 --> 1:39:07.040
 you have like, I mean, Sam Harris has really been making me think about this. So, you know,

1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:15.280
 calling free will an illusion. The interesting thing about Sam is it's not just a philosophical

1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:25.200
 little chat with him about free will. He really says he experiences the lack of free will. Like,

1:39:25.200 --> 1:39:30.400
 he's able to, you know, large parts of the day to feel like he has no free will.

1:39:30.400 --> 1:39:41.280
 In that same way, now he thinks that consciousness is not an illusion. It is, you know, it's a

1:39:41.280 --> 1:39:47.920
 real thing. But at the same, I'm more almost like, I'm almost more like consciousness seems to be a

1:39:47.920 --> 1:39:53.200
 little bit of an illusion, in the sense that like, it feels like maybe this is a robotics AI

1:39:53.200 --> 1:40:00.080
 perspective, but it feels like in that same way that Sam steps outside of feeling like he has an

1:40:00.080 --> 1:40:06.080
 agency, feeling like he has a free will, I feel like we should be able to step outside of having a

1:40:06.080 --> 1:40:14.160
 consciousness. So, that for my perspective, maybe that's a hopeful perspective for trying to engineer

1:40:14.160 --> 1:40:20.400
 consciousness. But do you think consciousness is like at the core of this? Or is it just like

1:40:20.400 --> 1:40:30.000
 language, or almost like a thing we build on top of much deeper human, the things that makes us human?

1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:35.360
 I don't know. I am attracted to Lanz's notion of biocentrism. I mean, it's difficult to walk away

1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:41.840
 from the double slit experiment, not wondering why we seem capable of collapsing that quantum

1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:48.080
 wave function. It's very, very weird, giving rise to even weirder ideas about superposition

1:40:48.080 --> 1:40:52.560
 and spooky action at a distance, and things that MIT guys know a lot better than me. But

1:40:53.760 --> 1:40:59.600
 it seems to me fundamental. Maybe consciousness is the fundamental thing. I mean, weirdly,

1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:04.880
 some of these ancient incubatory practices, I talked about Peter Kingsley before. So, he's not

1:41:04.880 --> 1:41:10.000
 a proponent of ancient psychedelic use, but is a proponent of these ancient rites of incubation

1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:16.080
 that were practiced by Pythagoras, Parmentides, and Pettichlis, other Presocratics. And so,

1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:20.240
 what were they doing? They were trying to get in touch with consciousness. They were entering

1:41:20.240 --> 1:41:26.160
 into suspended states of animation in these cave like settings. Pythagoras had built one in his

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:31.440
 basement and would lie down motionless, apparently, for long periods of time. And what I think they

1:41:31.440 --> 1:41:37.840
 were trying to do was tap into and try to answer this question in their own, you could call it a

1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:43.520
 scientific way, actually, less religion than science. And what they would discover or try to

1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:49.440
 discover was a state of awareness that is somehow beyond life and death, beyond waking and dreaming,

1:41:49.440 --> 1:41:55.280
 where you can be aware of the senses, but also in touch with another reality at the exact same

1:41:55.280 --> 1:42:01.600
 time, what Kingsley calls sensation. That, I think, is definitely worth exploring.

1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:09.680
 Well, in the way I hope to explore is by trying to build it. Everybody uses the tools they have.

1:42:09.680 --> 1:42:14.240
 Well, no, I do also hope psychedelics can help. So, how do you build that? I'm curious.

1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:20.560
 That's a whole nother discussion. There's a lot of things I could say here, but let me put simply

1:42:21.280 --> 1:42:27.200
 is I believe that you can go a long way

1:42:29.920 --> 1:42:35.200
 building towards building consciousness by trying to fake consciousness.

1:42:35.200 --> 1:42:42.160
 So, fake it till you make it as an engineering approach, I think we'll work for consciousness.

1:42:45.200 --> 1:42:50.240
 You seem satisfied with that. I'm satisfied with that, because I know how deeply

1:42:50.240 --> 1:42:58.640
 unsatisfied others are, but just wait. So, I mean, I don't know what to do.

1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:05.360
 So, the topic of consciousness is mostly handled by philosophers currently,

1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:13.520
 and that's great, and their philosophers are wonderful and good at what they do.

1:43:13.520 --> 1:43:18.960
 I'm not a philosopher. I'm an engineer, and I think the approach there is quite different.

1:43:18.960 --> 1:43:30.480
 I think falling in love is different than trying to have a podcast conversation about what is love.

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:39.600
 I think the engineering effort is just fundamentally different than the philosophical

1:43:39.600 --> 1:43:45.920
 effort, and I have a sense that consciousness can be engineered even before it is understood

1:43:45.920 --> 1:43:50.480
 by the philosophers. So, I think there's a bunch of things like that in this world that

1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:55.520
 could be engineered before they're understood. I think the intelligence is one such thing.

1:43:55.520 --> 1:44:00.960
 I think we'll be able to engineer super intelligent beings before we're able to

1:44:00.960 --> 1:44:10.960
 understand the human mind. There's a lot of intuition to unpack there of why that is, but

1:44:10.960 --> 1:44:19.280
 as it stands, that's perhaps my engineering optimism and engineering ethic under which I

1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:25.120
 operate. Consciousness is easy to build, hard to understand. Okay.

1:44:27.600 --> 1:44:34.160
 Other books or movies in your life, long ago or recently, that had a big impact on you.

1:44:34.160 --> 1:44:42.320
 You've, immortality is exceptionally well researched. The amount of books you read

1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:51.520
 I cannot even imagine. So, is there something in your travels through the land of language

1:44:52.400 --> 1:44:56.320
 that's stuck with you that was especially impactful? I mentioned a couple of them, but

1:44:56.320 --> 1:45:05.120
 I knew nothing about psychedelics before 2007, and it was in hearing about some of the first

1:45:05.120 --> 1:45:10.480
 psilocybin experiments at Hopkins, and then shortly thereafter, I went down this rabbit hole,

1:45:10.480 --> 1:45:17.040
 and so the first set of recommendations all fit in that time period in my life, 2007, 2008.

1:45:17.040 --> 1:45:22.400
 It started with Jeremy Narby, the cosmic serpent, DNA and the origins of knowledge.

1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:27.680
 It was a total impulse buy at the Barnes and Noble on 6th Avenue in New York,

1:45:28.480 --> 1:45:36.160
 and wound up introducing me to Supernatural by Graham Hancock. That convinced me that there

1:45:36.160 --> 1:45:43.120
 was a long story to psychedelics that he tried to prove in that book and that we're still trying

1:45:43.120 --> 1:45:50.320
 to prove. I mentioned the connection between ritual psychedelics and cave art. This is the

1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:55.120
 neuropsychological model that was first proposed by David Lewis Williams at the University of

1:45:55.120 --> 1:45:59.680
 Waterstrend, the same university where Lee Burger is, by the way, in South Africa. So,

1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:05.680
 these ideas are old, but what Graham did in that book is just, it's well worth your time,

1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:10.800
 it's well worth a few reads, actually, because it was after that that I discovered Breaking Open

1:46:10.800 --> 1:46:18.320
 the Head by Daniel Pinchbeck and a lot of other books that just kind of blew my mind.

1:46:18.320 --> 1:46:24.480
 What is Breaking Open the Head about? So, it's Daniel's romp through contemporary shamanism,

1:46:25.280 --> 1:46:33.040
 and it's his very well told experiences with everything from psilocybin to iboga being initiated

1:46:33.040 --> 1:46:40.000
 by the buites. It was the first time I'd read any first hand accounts, aside from Jeremy Narby,

1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:46.720
 any first hand accounts by a New Yorker, by the way, about the potential for these compounds

1:46:46.720 --> 1:46:52.640
 that I'd been ignoring for far too long, obviously. And so, that's when I started revisiting the road

1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:58.080
 to Ellusis and looking through the anthropological literature, reading everything Gordon Wasson

1:46:58.080 --> 1:47:03.200
 had ever written, that Carl Ruck had written. And it sent me down a pretty weird rabbit hole

1:47:03.200 --> 1:47:09.600
 until I found Peter Kingsley, which is my second recommendation. So, Peter, again, he's not a fan

1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:16.960
 of the psychedelic hypothesis, but what he does is, I think, expose the value of the irrational

1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:22.960
 to the ancient Greeks, especially the presocratics. Here we are talking about AI and God and these

1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:31.760
 entangled philosophical questions. The best I can read Kingsley is that Western civilization is a

1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:38.960
 product of a gift from the goddess Persephone. And this is not a hippie. This is a pretty gold

1:47:38.960 --> 1:47:44.880
 standard classicist who went on to write a couple of books. One is in the dark places of wisdom,

1:47:44.880 --> 1:47:50.080
 and the other is reality, what better way to title your book, where he talks about these

1:47:50.080 --> 1:47:55.120
 ancient techniques for exploring the irrational. The same thing Carl Ruck was talking about.

1:47:56.080 --> 1:48:00.880
 After compiling all this data in the road to Ellusis, Ruck says that the biggest challenge

1:48:00.880 --> 1:48:05.360
 is trying to convince his colleagues in the late 1970s that the ancient Greeks,

1:48:05.360 --> 1:48:10.800
 and indeed some of the most famous and intelligent among them, could enter so fully

1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:16.160
 into irrationality. Same thing Nietzsche is talking about in his exploration of Dionysus.

1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:23.040
 And so, I think Kingsley just stands apart as one of those books, reality that my life was never

1:48:23.040 --> 1:48:34.000
 quite the same after reading them. We talked about the three pound jelly that is able to conceive

1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:44.480
 of the entirety of the fabric of reality in the universe and everything, and also of its own mortality.

1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:52.000
 What do you think is the meaning of it all? What's the meaning of life?

1:48:55.520 --> 1:48:58.160
 Is a three pound jelly able to answer that one?

1:48:58.160 --> 1:49:06.640
 No, but I can plagiarize Joseph Campbell, which is good enough. Joe Campbell says that I don't

1:49:06.640 --> 1:49:12.000
 think what we're looking for is a meaning of life. I think what we're looking for is an experience

1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:18.400
 of being alive, so that the experiences we have on the purely physical plane will have

1:49:18.400 --> 1:49:23.360
 resonances within that are those of our innermost being and reality. You talked about the true

1:49:23.360 --> 1:49:30.240
 reality, absolute truth. These are all constructs. And I think there are constructs that are made

1:49:30.240 --> 1:49:35.840
 day by day and acquire this aura of factuality, remembering Clifford Geertz's definition of

1:49:35.840 --> 1:49:41.920
 religion. We're all just faking it until we make it. And I think a lot of that has to do with moods

1:49:41.920 --> 1:49:47.040
 and motivations and feelings and emotions, which is not to discredit facts and figures.

1:49:47.040 --> 1:49:55.360
 But I think that meaning, meaning making is a very subjective process that is not only difficult

1:49:55.360 --> 1:49:59.840
 to talk about, but difficult to quantify. And experience is a primary in that versus

1:50:00.880 --> 1:50:07.520
 so like the actual subjective experience is primary to the meaning making process versus

1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:15.920
 like some kind of rigorous analysis of like having an algorithm that runs and computes and then

1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:23.520
 finally spits out 42. Well, this is how families are created. Tell me more about this. My wife

1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:28.320
 and I fell in love and made babies. We didn't type up an Excel sheet and figure out the best

1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:32.880
 way to go about this. That's what I've been doing all these years. That's why I'm single.

1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:41.920
 Too many Excel sheets. Well, we say falling in love, right? We say fall in love. What does that

1:50:41.920 --> 1:50:50.080
 mean to fall in love? You are surrendering to an intelligence that is beyond us. You could say a

1:50:50.080 --> 1:50:55.040
 godlike intelligence. Richard Rohr, the Franciscan friar I mentioned in the Universal Christ, he

1:50:55.040 --> 1:51:02.480
 writes a lot about how the divine for you is often encountered in the other. In fact, how could it

1:51:02.480 --> 1:51:08.960
 be otherwise? This is bedrock sacramental theology that you find the God in the things in your life

1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:15.280
 as well as you should. That's the proving ground for identifying as God rather than

1:51:15.280 --> 1:51:19.840
 creating a relationship with God. I think that these irrational states play a big role in that.

1:51:20.400 --> 1:51:25.760
 Irrational. Well, I don't think there's a better way to end it than on the topic of love. Brian,

1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:33.360
 thank you so much for a brilliant exposition of history and the poetry. I really appreciate you

1:51:33.360 --> 1:51:40.080
 talking with me today. I love you, Alex. I love you too, Brian. Thanks for listening to this

1:51:40.080 --> 1:51:47.200
 conversation with Brian Muralescu, and thank you to Inside Tracker, Givewell, NI, Indeed,

1:51:47.200 --> 1:51:51.120
 and Masterclass. Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:56.480
 And now, let me leave you some words from Terence McKenna about psychedelics.

1:51:56.480 --> 1:52:04.080
 Part of what psychedelics do is they decondition you from cultural values. This is what makes it

1:52:04.080 --> 1:52:09.520
 such a political hot potato since all culture is a kind of con game. The most dangerous candy you

1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:14.800
 can hand out is one which causes people to start questioning the rules of the game.

1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:27.280
 Thank you for listening. I hope to see you next time.
