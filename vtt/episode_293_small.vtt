00:00.000 --> 00:03.660
 Whatever reality is, it's not what you see.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.720
 What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

00:12.560 --> 00:14.920
 The following is a conversation with Donald Hoffman,

00:14.920 --> 00:17.920
 professor of cognitive sciences at UC Irvine,

00:17.920 --> 00:21.200
 focusing his research on evolutionary psychology,

00:21.200 --> 00:23.920
 visual perception, and consciousness.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.760
 He's the author of over 120 scientific papers

00:27.760 --> 00:31.160
 on these topics, and his most recent book titled

00:31.160 --> 00:33.280
 The Case Against Reality,

00:33.280 --> 00:36.680
 Why Evolution Hit the Truth from Our Eyes.

00:36.680 --> 00:39.600
 I think some of the most interesting ideas in this world,

00:39.600 --> 00:42.080
 like those of Donald Hoffman's attempt

00:42.080 --> 00:45.920
 to shake the foundation of our understanding of reality,

00:45.920 --> 00:50.320
 and thus, they take a long time to internalize deeply.

00:50.320 --> 00:52.240
 So proceed with caution.

00:52.240 --> 00:54.440
 Questioning the fabric of reality

00:54.440 --> 00:58.520
 can lead you to either madness or the truth.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.400
 And the funny thing is, you won't know which is which.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.280
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:04.280 --> 01:06.420
 To support it, please check out our sponsors

01:06.420 --> 01:07.640
 in the description.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.120
 And now, dear friends, here's Donald Hoffman.

01:12.040 --> 01:14.320
 In your book, The Case Against Reality,

01:14.320 --> 01:17.200
 Why Evolution Hit the Truth from Our Eyes,

01:17.200 --> 01:20.000
 you make the bold claim that the world we see

01:20.000 --> 01:21.960
 with our eyes is not real.

01:21.960 --> 01:24.560
 It's not even an abstraction of objective reality.

01:24.560 --> 01:28.800
 It is completely detached from objective reality.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.900
 Can you explain this idea?

01:30.900 --> 01:32.400
 Right, so this is a theorem

01:32.400 --> 01:34.160
 from evolution of a natural selection.

01:34.160 --> 01:38.520
 So the technical question that I and my team asked was,

01:38.520 --> 01:41.380
 what is the probability that natural selection

01:41.380 --> 01:43.000
 would shape sensory systems

01:43.000 --> 01:46.240
 to see true properties of objective reality?

01:46.240 --> 01:48.260
 And to our surprise, we found that the answer

01:48.260 --> 01:51.400
 is precisely zero, except for one kind of structure

01:51.400 --> 01:52.480
 that we can go into if you want to.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.640
 But for any generic structure

01:54.640 --> 01:56.080
 that you might think the world might have,

01:56.080 --> 01:59.160
 a total order, a topology metric,

02:00.280 --> 02:02.320
 the probability is precisely zero

02:02.320 --> 02:05.320
 that natural selection would shape any sensory system

02:05.320 --> 02:08.560
 of any organism to see any aspect of objective reality.

02:08.560 --> 02:12.480
 So in that sense, what we're seeing is

02:13.700 --> 02:18.700
 what we need to see to stay alive long enough to reproduce.

02:18.960 --> 02:20.620
 So in other words, we're seeing what we need

02:20.620 --> 02:23.480
 to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.080
 So the evolutionary process,

02:26.080 --> 02:30.080
 the process that took us from the original life on earth

02:30.080 --> 02:32.320
 to the humans that we are today,

02:33.280 --> 02:37.320
 that process does not maximize for truth,

02:37.320 --> 02:41.320
 it maximizes for fitness, as you say, fitness beats truth.

02:41.320 --> 02:45.000
 And fitness does not have to be connected to truth,

02:45.000 --> 02:46.680
 is the claim.

02:46.680 --> 02:49.000
 And that's where you have an approach

02:49.000 --> 02:51.320
 towards zero of probability

02:51.320 --> 02:56.320
 that we have evolved human cognition, human consciousness,

02:57.240 --> 03:00.640
 whatever it is, the magic that makes our mind work,

03:00.640 --> 03:05.640
 evolved not for its ability to see the truth of reality,

03:06.240 --> 03:09.160
 but its ability to survive in the environment.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.240
 That's exactly right.

03:10.240 --> 03:14.240
 So most of us intuitively think that surely

03:14.240 --> 03:18.600
 the way that evolution will make our senses more fit

03:18.600 --> 03:21.120
 is to make them tell us more truths,

03:21.120 --> 03:22.960
 or at least the truths we need to know

03:22.960 --> 03:24.080
 about objective reality,

03:24.080 --> 03:26.120
 the truths we need in our niche.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.960
 That's the standard view and it was the view I took.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.520
 I mean, that's sort of what we're taught

03:30.520 --> 03:31.840
 or just even assume.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.480
 It's just sort of like the intelligent assumption

03:33.480 --> 03:34.720
 that we would all make.

03:34.720 --> 03:37.880
 But we don't have to just wave our hands.

03:37.880 --> 03:38.960
 Evolution of a natural selection

03:38.960 --> 03:41.240
 is a mathematically precise theory.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.200
 John Maynard Smith in the 70s

03:44.200 --> 03:45.600
 created evolutionary game theory.

03:45.600 --> 03:48.120
 And we have evolutionary graph theory

03:48.120 --> 03:50.520
 and even genetic algorithms that we can use to study this.

03:50.520 --> 03:52.360
 And so we don't have to wave our hands.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.160
 It's a matter of theorem and proof

03:54.160 --> 03:56.720
 and or simulation before you get the theorems and proofs.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.440
 And a couple of graduate students of mine,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.160
 Justin Mark and Brian Marion,

04:01.160 --> 04:03.960
 did some wonderful simulations that tipped me off

04:03.960 --> 04:06.480
 that there was something going on here.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.080
 And then I went to a mathematician,

04:08.080 --> 04:10.320
 Chaitan Prakash and Manish Singh

04:10.320 --> 04:14.440
 and some other friends of mine, Chris Fields.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.000
 But Chaitan was the real mathematician behind all this.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.560
 And he's proved several theorems

04:18.560 --> 04:21.800
 that uniformly indicate that with one exception,

04:21.800 --> 04:23.800
 which has to do with probability measures,

04:25.160 --> 04:28.240
 there's no, the probability is zero.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.920
 The reason there's an exception for probability measures,

04:30.920 --> 04:35.920
 so called sigma algebras or sigma additive classes,

04:36.680 --> 04:38.760
 is that for any scientific theory,

04:40.680 --> 04:43.400
 there is the assumption that needs to be made

04:43.400 --> 04:47.960
 that the whatever structure,

04:47.960 --> 04:51.800
 the whatever probabilistic structure the world may have

04:51.800 --> 04:55.480
 is not unrelated to the probabilistic structure

04:55.480 --> 04:56.320
 of our perceptions.

04:56.320 --> 04:57.400
 If they were completely unrelated,

04:57.400 --> 04:59.600
 then no science would be possible.

04:59.600 --> 05:04.600
 So this is technically the map from reality to our senses

05:05.120 --> 05:07.080
 has to be a so called measurable map,

05:07.080 --> 05:08.680
 has to preserve sigma algebras.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.400
 But that means it could be infinite to one

05:10.400 --> 05:14.360
 and it could collapse all sorts of event information.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.200
 But other than that,

05:15.200 --> 05:19.000
 there's no requirement in standard evolutionary theory

05:19.000 --> 05:22.480
 for fitness payoff functions, for example,

05:22.480 --> 05:25.600
 to preserve any specific structures of objective reality.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.120
 So you can ask the technical question.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.200
 This is one of the avenues we took.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.960
 If you look at all the fitness payoffs

05:32.960 --> 05:37.960
 from whatever world structure you might want to imagine,

05:37.960 --> 05:40.480
 so a world with, say, a total order on it.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.120
 So it's got n states and they're totally ordered.

05:44.120 --> 05:48.200
 And then you can have a set of maps from that world

05:48.200 --> 05:50.640
 into a set of payoffs, say from zero to a thousand

05:50.640 --> 05:52.680
 or whatever you want your payoffs to be.

05:52.680 --> 05:56.320
 And you can just literally count all the payoff functions

05:56.320 --> 05:58.160
 and just do the combinatorics and count them.

05:58.160 --> 05:59.880
 And then you can ask a precise question.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.240
 How many of those payoff functions

06:02.240 --> 06:04.040
 preserve the total order?

06:04.040 --> 06:04.880
 If that's what you're looking for.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.360
 Or how many preserve the topology?

06:07.360 --> 06:09.080
 And you just count them and divide.

06:09.080 --> 06:11.920
 So the number that are homomorphisms

06:11.920 --> 06:14.200
 versus the total number and then take the limit

06:14.200 --> 06:16.720
 as the number of states in the world

06:16.720 --> 06:20.000
 and the number of payoff values goes very large.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.680
 And when you do that, you get zero every time.

06:21.680 --> 06:24.440
 Okay, there's a million things to ask here,

06:24.440 --> 06:28.960
 but first of all, just in case people are not familiar

06:28.960 --> 06:32.200
 with your work, let's sort of linger

06:32.200 --> 06:36.560
 on the big, bold statement here,

06:36.560 --> 06:39.440
 which is the thing we see with our eyes

06:41.080 --> 06:45.080
 is not some kind of limited window into reality.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.880
 It is completely detached from reality,

06:47.880 --> 06:49.640
 likely completely detached from reality.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.280
 You're saying 100% likely.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.760
 Okay, so none of this is real

06:55.760 --> 06:57.800
 in the way we think is real.

06:57.800 --> 07:00.040
 In the way we have this intuition,

07:00.040 --> 07:05.040
 there's like this table is some kind of abstraction,

07:05.040 --> 07:07.920
 but underneath it all, there's atoms.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.920
 And there's an entire century of physics

07:09.920 --> 07:12.080
 that describes the functioning of those atoms

07:12.080 --> 07:13.760
 and the quarks that make them up.

07:13.760 --> 07:18.760
 There's many Nobel prizes about particles and fields

07:19.880 --> 07:23.360
 and all that kind of stuff that slowly builds up

07:23.360 --> 07:25.240
 to something that's perceivable to us,

07:25.240 --> 07:27.760
 both with our eyes, with our different senses

07:27.760 --> 07:29.980
 as this table.

07:29.980 --> 07:33.600
 Then there's also ideas of chemistry

07:33.600 --> 07:38.600
 that overlays of abstraction from DNA to embryos,

07:38.600 --> 07:42.960
 the cells that make the human body.

07:42.960 --> 07:46.680
 So all of that is not real.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.320
 It's a real experience

07:48.320 --> 07:52.560
 and it's a real adaptive set of perceptions.

07:52.560 --> 07:56.200
 So it's an adaptive set of perceptions, full stop.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.360
 We want to think that the perceptions are real.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.360
 So their perceptions are real as perceptions.

08:01.360 --> 08:03.640
 We are having our perceptions,

08:03.640 --> 08:06.920
 but we've assumed that there's a pretty tight relationship

08:06.920 --> 08:09.000
 between our perceptions and reality.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.720
 If I look up and see the moon,

08:11.720 --> 08:15.160
 then there is something that exists in space and time

08:15.160 --> 08:18.960
 that matches what I perceive.

08:18.960 --> 08:23.960
 And all I'm saying is that if you take evolution

08:24.600 --> 08:29.600
 by natural selection seriously, then that is precluded.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.880
 Our perceptions are there,

08:31.880 --> 08:35.160
 they're there to guide adaptive behavior, full stop.

08:35.160 --> 08:36.720
 They're not there to show you the truth.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.600
 In fact, the way I think about it

08:38.600 --> 08:40.680
 is they're there to hide the truth

08:40.680 --> 08:42.520
 because the truth is too complicated.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.720
 It's just like if you're trying to use your laptop

08:45.720 --> 08:47.560
 to write an email, right?

08:47.560 --> 08:50.280
 What you're doing is toggling voltages in the computer,

08:50.280 --> 08:52.600
 but good luck trying to do it that way.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.280
 The reason why we have a user interface

08:54.280 --> 08:56.600
 is because we don't want to know that quote unquote truth,

08:56.600 --> 08:59.600
 the diodes and resistors and all that terrible hardware.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.600
 If you had to know all that truth,

09:01.600 --> 09:04.000
 it would, your friends wouldn't hear from you.

09:04.000 --> 09:08.360
 So what evolution gave us was perceptions

09:08.360 --> 09:10.200
 that guide adaptive behavior.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.000
 And part of that process, it turns out,

09:12.000 --> 09:16.680
 means hiding the truth and giving you eye candy.

09:16.680 --> 09:20.720
 So what's the difference between hiding the truth

09:20.720 --> 09:22.840
 and forming abstractions,

09:22.840 --> 09:26.560
 layers upon layers of abstractions

09:26.560 --> 09:30.320
 over these, over low level voltages and transistors

09:30.320 --> 09:35.320
 and chips and programming languages from assembly

09:36.480 --> 09:39.000
 to Python that then leads you to be able

09:39.000 --> 09:42.240
 to have an interface like Chrome where you open up

09:42.240 --> 09:46.800
 another set of JavaScript and HTML programming languages

09:46.800 --> 09:49.360
 that lead you to have a graphical user interface

09:49.360 --> 09:53.320
 on which you can then send your friends an email.

09:53.320 --> 09:58.320
 Is that completely detached from the zeros and ones

09:58.480 --> 10:01.560
 that are firing away inside the computer?

10:01.560 --> 10:02.880
 It's not.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.800
 Of course, when I talk about the user interface

10:04.800 --> 10:09.800
 on your desktop, there's this whole sophisticated

10:10.120 --> 10:11.280
 backstory to it, right?

10:11.280 --> 10:13.120
 That the hardware and the software

10:13.120 --> 10:15.040
 that's allowing that to happen.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.200
 Evolution doesn't tell us the backstory, right?

10:17.200 --> 10:20.400
 So the theory of evolution is not going to be adequate

10:20.400 --> 10:23.040
 to tell you what is that backstory.

10:23.040 --> 10:27.120
 It's gonna say that whatever reality is,

10:27.120 --> 10:27.960
 and that's the interesting thing,

10:27.960 --> 10:31.240
 it says whatever reality is, you don't see it.

10:31.240 --> 10:34.280
 You see a user interface, but it doesn't tell you

10:34.280 --> 10:38.840
 what that user interface is, how it's built, right?

10:38.840 --> 10:43.840
 Now, we can try to look at certain aspects of the interface,

10:43.880 --> 10:46.000
 but already we're gonna look at that and go,

10:46.000 --> 10:47.920
 okay, before I would look at neurons

10:47.920 --> 10:49.600
 and I was assuming that I was seeing something

10:49.600 --> 10:52.800
 that was at least partially true.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.840
 And now I'm realizing that it could be like looking

10:54.840 --> 10:59.200
 at the pixels on my desktop or icons on my desktop,

10:59.200 --> 11:02.560
 and good luck going from that to the data structures

11:02.560 --> 11:05.360
 and then the voltages, and I mean, good luck.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.920
 There's just no way.

11:06.920 --> 11:09.280
 So what's interesting about this is that our scientific

11:09.280 --> 11:13.800
 theories are precise enough and rigorous enough

11:13.800 --> 11:18.280
 to tell us certain limits, and even limits

11:18.280 --> 11:21.440
 of the theories themselves, but they're not going

11:21.440 --> 11:23.200
 to tell us what the next move is,

11:23.200 --> 11:25.840
 and that's where scientific creativity comes in.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.920
 So the stuff that I'm saying here, for example,

11:28.920 --> 11:31.000
 is not alien to physicists.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.640
 The physicists are saying precisely the same thing,

11:33.640 --> 11:35.200
 that space time is doomed.

11:35.200 --> 11:37.080
 We've assumed that space time is fundamental,

11:37.080 --> 11:39.320
 that we've assumed that for several centuries,

11:39.320 --> 11:40.720
 and it's been very useful.

11:40.720 --> 11:41.960
 So all the things that you were mentioning,

11:41.960 --> 11:43.920
 the particles and all the work that's been done,

11:43.920 --> 11:45.120
 that's all been done in space time,

11:45.120 --> 11:47.520
 but now physicists are saying space time is doomed.

11:47.520 --> 11:51.720
 There's no such thing as space time fundamentally

11:51.720 --> 11:54.080
 in the laws of physics.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.960
 And that comes actually out of gravity together

11:58.960 --> 12:01.080
 with quantum field theory, which just comes right out of it.

12:01.080 --> 12:05.680
 It's a theorem of those two theories put together.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.000
 But it doesn't tell you what's behind it.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.640
 So the physicists know that their best theories,

12:11.640 --> 12:15.120
 Einstein's gravity and quantum field theory put together,

12:15.120 --> 12:17.360
 entail that space time cannot be fundamental,

12:17.360 --> 12:20.880
 and therefore particles in space time cannot be fundamental.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.480
 They're just irreducible representations

12:22.480 --> 12:23.760
 of the symmetries of space time.

12:23.760 --> 12:24.720
 That's what they are.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.560
 So we have, so space time, so we put the two together.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.680
 We put together what the physicists are discovering,

12:29.680 --> 12:32.200
 and we can talk about how they do that.

12:32.200 --> 12:33.760
 And then we, the new discoveries

12:33.760 --> 12:35.320
 from evolution of a natural selection,

12:35.320 --> 12:38.720
 both of these discoveries are really in the last 20 years.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.480
 And what both are saying is space time

12:41.480 --> 12:42.320
 has had a good ride.

12:43.480 --> 12:44.320
 It's been very useful.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.480
 Reductionism has been useful, but it's over.

12:46.480 --> 12:48.360
 And it's time for us to go beyond.

12:48.360 --> 12:51.360
 When you say space time is doomed, is it the space,

12:51.360 --> 12:55.400
 is it the time, is it the very hard coded

12:55.400 --> 12:57.600
 specification of four dimensions?

12:59.760 --> 13:01.680
 Or are you specifically referring to

13:01.680 --> 13:06.360
 the kind of perceptual domain that humans operate in,

13:06.360 --> 13:07.320
 which is space time?

13:07.320 --> 13:12.080
 You think like there's a 3D, like our world

13:12.080 --> 13:15.400
 is three dimensional, and time progresses forward.

13:15.400 --> 13:18.080
 Therefore, three dimensions plus one 4D.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.600
 What exactly do you mean by space time?

13:20.600 --> 13:24.040
 What do you mean by space time is doomed?

13:24.040 --> 13:24.880
 Great, great.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.560
 So this is, by the way, not my quote.

13:26.560 --> 13:29.840
 This is from, for example, Nima Arkany Ahmed

13:29.840 --> 13:31.720
 at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.320
 Ed Whitten, also there.

13:34.320 --> 13:36.520
 David Gross, Nobel Prize winner.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.360
 So this is not just something that cognitive scientists,

13:39.360 --> 13:40.640
 this is what the physicists were saying.

13:40.640 --> 13:45.120
 Yeah, the physicists, they're space time skeptics.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.840
 Yeah, they're saying that, and I can say exactly

13:47.840 --> 13:49.600
 why they think it's doomed.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.600
 But what they're saying is that,

13:51.600 --> 13:53.880
 because your question was what aspect of space time,

13:53.880 --> 13:55.000
 what are we talking about here?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.920
 It's both space and time.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.760
 They're union into space time as in Einstein's theory.

13:59.760 --> 14:01.280
 That's doomed.

14:01.280 --> 14:05.200
 And they're basically saying that

14:05.200 --> 14:09.160
 even quantum theory, this is Nima Arkany Ahmed especially,

14:09.160 --> 14:12.840
 so Hilbert spaces will not be fundamental either.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.480
 So that the notion of Hilbert space,

14:15.480 --> 14:18.920
 which is really critical to quantum field theory,

14:18.920 --> 14:20.920
 quantum information theory,

14:20.920 --> 14:23.960
 that's not going to figure in the fundamental

14:23.960 --> 14:25.200
 new laws of physics.

14:25.200 --> 14:28.960
 So what they're looking for is some new mathematical

14:28.960 --> 14:31.920
 structures beyond space time,

14:31.920 --> 14:35.240
 beyond Einstein's four dimensional space time

14:35.240 --> 14:38.000
 or supersymmetric version,

14:38.000 --> 14:41.120
 geometric algebra, signature, two comma four, kind of.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.240
 There are different ways that you can represent it,

14:43.240 --> 14:45.520
 but they're finding new structures,

14:45.520 --> 14:47.280
 and by the way, they're succeeding now.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.600
 They're finding, they found something called

14:48.600 --> 14:49.640
 the amplitude hydrant.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.480
 This is Nima and his colleagues,

14:51.480 --> 14:53.560
 the cosmological polytope.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.360
 These are, so there are these like polytopes,

14:57.360 --> 15:00.320
 these polyhedra in multi dimensions,

15:00.320 --> 15:02.400
 generalizations of simplices,

15:02.400 --> 15:06.200
 that are coding for, for example,

15:06.200 --> 15:08.200
 the scattering amplitudes of processes

15:08.200 --> 15:10.880
 in the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.000
 So they're finding that if they let go of space time,

15:14.000 --> 15:16.920
 completely, they're finding new ways

15:16.920 --> 15:18.720
 of computing these scattering amplitudes

15:18.720 --> 15:22.560
 that turn literally billions of terms into one term.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.000
 When you do it in space and time,

15:25.000 --> 15:26.760
 because it's the wrong framework,

15:26.760 --> 15:29.520
 it's just a user interface,

15:29.520 --> 15:30.880
 and that's now from the evolutionary point of view,

15:30.880 --> 15:32.120
 it's just user interface,

15:32.120 --> 15:34.560
 it's not a deep insight into the nature of reality.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.880
 So it's missing deep symmetry,

15:36.880 --> 15:39.000
 it's something called a dual conformal symmetry,

15:39.000 --> 15:40.920
 which turns out to be true of the scattering data,

15:40.920 --> 15:42.680
 but you can't see it in space time,

15:42.680 --> 15:46.240
 and it's making the computations way too complicated

15:46.240 --> 15:47.880
 because you're trying to compute all the loops

15:47.880 --> 15:50.280
 and Feynman diagrams and all the Feynman integrals.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.960
 So see the Feynman approach to the scattering amplitudes

15:52.960 --> 15:56.480
 is trying to enforce two critical properties of space time,

15:56.480 --> 15:58.560
 locality and uniterity.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.360
 And so when you enforce those,

16:00.360 --> 16:03.480
 you get all these loops and multiple,

16:03.480 --> 16:04.520
 different levels of loops,

16:04.520 --> 16:05.360
 and for each of those,

16:05.360 --> 16:07.520
 you have to add new terms to your computation.

16:07.520 --> 16:11.000
 But when you do it outside of space time,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.720
 you don't have the notion of uniterity,

16:13.720 --> 16:15.720
 you don't have the notion of locality,

16:15.720 --> 16:17.280
 you have something deeper,

16:17.280 --> 16:18.760
 and it's capturing some symmetries

16:18.760 --> 16:20.720
 that are actually true of the data.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.920
 And, but then when you look at the geometry

16:22.920 --> 16:25.320
 of the facets of these polytopes,

16:25.320 --> 16:30.320
 then certain of them will code for uniterity and locality.

16:30.760 --> 16:31.720
 So it actually comes out

16:31.720 --> 16:33.480
 of the structure of these deep polytopes.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.440
 So what we're finding is there's this whole new world,

16:36.440 --> 16:39.440
 now beyond space time,

16:39.440 --> 16:42.040
 that is making explicit symmetries

16:42.040 --> 16:45.000
 that are true of the data that cannot be seen in space time,

16:45.000 --> 16:46.640
 and that is turning the computations

16:46.640 --> 16:50.360
 from billions of terms to one or two or a handful of terms.

16:50.360 --> 16:53.240
 So we're getting insights into symmetries,

16:53.240 --> 16:55.360
 and all of a sudden the math is becoming simple

16:55.360 --> 16:56.800
 because we're not doing something silly,

16:56.800 --> 16:59.000
 we're not adding up all these loops in space time,

16:59.000 --> 17:00.760
 we're doing something far deeper.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.000
 But they don't know what this world is about.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.840
 So they're in an interesting position

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
 where we know that space time is doomed,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.280
 and I should probably tell you why it's doomed,

17:11.280 --> 17:12.760
 what they're saying about why it's doomed.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.520
 But they need a flashlight to look beyond space time.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.360
 What flashlight are we gonna use

17:17.360 --> 17:19.640
 to look into the dark beyond space time?

17:19.640 --> 17:22.200
 Because Einstein's theory and quantum theory

17:22.200 --> 17:23.880
 can't tell us what's beyond them.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.240
 All they can do is tell us that when you put us together,

17:26.240 --> 17:30.040
 space time is doomed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters,

17:30.040 --> 17:31.560
 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.960
 Beyond that, space time doesn't even make sense.

17:33.960 --> 17:36.040
 It just has no operational definition.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.960
 So, but it doesn't tell you what's beyond,

17:38.960 --> 17:41.520
 and so they're just looking for deep structures

17:41.520 --> 17:43.680
 like guessing is really fun.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.640
 So these really brilliant guys, generic,

17:46.640 --> 17:48.920
 brilliant men and women who are doing this work,

17:48.920 --> 17:52.280
 physicists, are making guesses about these structures,

17:52.280 --> 17:54.120
 informed guesses, because they're trying to ask,

17:54.120 --> 17:56.600
 well, okay, what deeper structure could give us

17:56.600 --> 17:58.400
 the stuff that we're seeing in space time,

17:58.400 --> 18:00.000
 but without certain commitments

18:00.000 --> 18:02.880
 that we have to make in space time, like locality.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.720
 So they make these brilliant guesses,

18:04.720 --> 18:06.680
 and of course, most of the time you're gonna be wrong,

18:06.680 --> 18:09.560
 but once you get one or two, that start to pay off.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.400
 And then you get some lucky breaks.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.080
 So they got lucky break back in 1986.

18:15.560 --> 18:17.600
 Couple of mathematicians named Park and Taylor

18:17.600 --> 18:22.600
 took the scattering amplitude for two gluons coming in

18:22.680 --> 18:25.600
 at high energy and four gluons going out at low energy.

18:25.600 --> 18:27.240
 So that kind of scattering thing.

18:27.240 --> 18:30.320
 So apparently for people who are into this,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.080
 that's sort of something that happens so often,

18:32.080 --> 18:34.360
 you need to be able to find it and get rid of those,

18:34.360 --> 18:36.200
 because you already know about that and need to,

18:36.200 --> 18:37.320
 so you needed to compute them.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.920
 It was billions of terms, and they couldn't do it,

18:39.920 --> 18:42.000
 even for the supercomputers, couldn't do that

18:42.000 --> 18:44.600
 for the many billions or millions of times per second

18:44.600 --> 18:45.440
 they needed to do it.

18:45.440 --> 18:48.840
 They bagged, the experimentals bagged the theorists,

18:48.840 --> 18:51.280
 and please, you got it.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.120
 And so Park and Taylor took the billions of terms,

18:53.120 --> 18:58.120
 hundreds of pages, and miraculously turned it into nine.

18:58.120 --> 18:59.360
 And then a little bit later,

18:59.360 --> 19:01.240
 they guessed one term expression

19:01.240 --> 19:02.480
 that turned out to be equivalent.

19:02.480 --> 19:07.240
 So billions of terms reduced to one term,

19:07.240 --> 19:10.720
 that's so called famous Park Taylor formula, 1986.

19:10.720 --> 19:13.920
 And that was like, okay, where did that come from?

19:13.920 --> 19:17.280
 What, this is a pointer into a deep realm

19:17.280 --> 19:20.400
 beyond space and time, but no one,

19:20.400 --> 19:21.480
 I mean, what can you do with it?

19:21.480 --> 19:23.160
 And they thought maybe it was a one off,

19:23.160 --> 19:25.880
 but then other formulas started coming up,

19:25.880 --> 19:27.120
 and then eventually,

19:27.120 --> 19:28.480
 Neymar, Connie, Hamad and his team

19:28.480 --> 19:30.240
 found this thing called the amplituhedron,

19:30.240 --> 19:32.720
 which really sort of captures the whole,

19:32.720 --> 19:34.640
 a big part of the whole ball of wax.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.880
 I'm sure they would say, no, there's plenty more to do.

19:37.880 --> 19:40.520
 So I won't say they did it all by any means.

19:40.520 --> 19:42.720
 They're looking at the cosmological polytope as well.

19:42.720 --> 19:44.960
 So what's remarkable to me

19:44.960 --> 19:49.840
 is that two pillars of modern science,

19:49.840 --> 19:52.920
 quantum field theory with gravity on the one hand,

19:52.920 --> 19:55.560
 and evolution by natural selection on the other.

19:55.560 --> 19:59.120
 Just in the last 20 years have very clearly said,

19:59.120 --> 20:01.160
 space time has had a good run.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.880
 Reductionism has been a fantastic methodology.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.760
 So we had a great ontology of space time,

20:05.760 --> 20:08.000
 a great methodology of reductionism.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.520
 Now it's time for a new trick,

20:10.760 --> 20:12.200
 but now you need to go deeper.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.680
 And show, by the way,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.840
 this doesn't mean we throw away everything we've done,

20:15.840 --> 20:17.240
 not by a long shot.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.800
 Every new idea that we come up with beyond space time

20:20.800 --> 20:23.360
 must project precisely into space time,

20:23.360 --> 20:25.040
 and it better give us back everything

20:25.040 --> 20:26.600
 that we know and love in space time,

20:26.600 --> 20:28.760
 or generalizations,

20:28.760 --> 20:30.280
 or it's not gonna be taken seriously,

20:30.280 --> 20:31.120
 and it shouldn't be.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.520
 So we have a strong constraint

20:33.520 --> 20:35.520
 on whatever we're going to do beyond space time.

20:35.520 --> 20:37.640
 It needs to project into space time,

20:37.640 --> 20:39.400
 and whatever this deeper theory is,

20:39.400 --> 20:42.840
 it may not itself have evolution by natural selection.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.480
 This may not be part of this deeper realm,

20:44.480 --> 20:47.520
 but when we take whatever that thing is beyond space time

20:47.520 --> 20:49.200
 and project it into space time,

20:49.200 --> 20:51.800
 it has to look like evolution by natural selection,

20:51.800 --> 20:52.960
 or it's wrong.

20:52.960 --> 20:57.440
 So that's a strong constraint on this work.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.880
 So even the evolution by natural selection

21:00.880 --> 21:05.880
 and quantum field theory could be interfaces

21:05.880 --> 21:10.880
 into something that doesn't look anything like.

21:11.760 --> 21:12.600
 Like you mentioned,

21:12.600 --> 21:14.520
 I mean, it's interesting to think that evolution

21:14.520 --> 21:16.880
 might be a very crappy interface

21:16.880 --> 21:18.360
 into something which deeper.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.200
 That's right.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.280
 They're both telling us that the framework

21:21.280 --> 21:23.200
 that you've had can only go so far,

21:23.200 --> 21:24.160
 and it has to stop.

21:24.160 --> 21:25.560
 And there's something beyond.

21:25.560 --> 21:26.400
 And that framework,

21:26.400 --> 21:29.200
 the very framework that is space and time itself.

21:29.200 --> 21:32.400
 Now, of course, evolution by natural selection

21:32.400 --> 21:36.360
 is not telling us about Einstein's relativistic space time.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.360
 So that was another question you asked a little bit earlier.

21:38.360 --> 21:42.440
 It's telling us more about our perceptual space and time,

21:42.440 --> 21:45.280
 which we have used as the basis

21:45.280 --> 21:49.760
 for creating first a Newtonian space versus time

21:49.760 --> 21:53.360
 as a mathematical extension of our perceptions.

21:53.360 --> 21:56.720
 And then Einstein then took that and extended it even further.

21:56.720 --> 21:59.160
 So the relationship between what evolution is telling us

21:59.160 --> 22:01.080
 and what the physicists are telling us is that,

22:01.080 --> 22:05.920
 in some sense, the Newton and Einstein space time

22:07.200 --> 22:11.360
 are formulated as sort of rigorous extensions

22:11.360 --> 22:12.800
 of our perceptual space,

22:14.080 --> 22:15.560
 making it mathematically rigorous

22:15.560 --> 22:19.120
 and laying out the symmetries that they find there.

22:19.120 --> 22:20.800
 So that's sort of the relationship between them.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.480
 So it's the perceptual space time

22:22.480 --> 22:26.680
 that evolution is telling us is just a user interface,

22:26.680 --> 22:27.800
 effectively.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.000
 And then the physicists are finding

22:29.000 --> 22:31.480
 that even the mathematical extension of that

22:31.480 --> 22:36.200
 into the Einsteinian formulation has to be as well,

22:36.200 --> 22:38.160
 not the final story, there's something deeper.

22:38.160 --> 22:43.240
 So let me ask you about reductionism and interfaces.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.920
 As we march forward from Newtonian physics

22:48.000 --> 22:49.960
 to quantum mechanics,

22:49.960 --> 22:53.840
 these are all in your view interfaces.

22:53.840 --> 22:58.840
 Are we getting closer to objective reality?

22:59.280 --> 23:02.280
 How do we know if these interfaces

23:02.280 --> 23:04.880
 in the process of science,

23:04.880 --> 23:06.920
 the reason we like those interfaces

23:06.920 --> 23:09.720
 is because they're predictive of some aspects,

23:09.720 --> 23:13.160
 strongly predictive about some aspects of our reality.

23:14.160 --> 23:18.120
 Is that completely deviating from our understanding

23:18.120 --> 23:19.600
 of that reality?

23:19.600 --> 23:22.800
 Or is it helping us get closer and closer and closer?

23:22.800 --> 23:24.560
 Well, of course, one critical constraint

23:24.560 --> 23:27.240
 on all of our theories is that they are empirically tested

23:27.240 --> 23:30.800
 and pass the experiments that we have for them.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.440
 So no one's arguing against experiments being important

23:34.440 --> 23:38.440
 and wanting to test all of our current theories

23:38.440 --> 23:40.600
 and any new theories on that.

23:40.600 --> 23:44.280
 So that's all there.

23:44.280 --> 23:48.920
 But we have good reason to believe

23:48.920 --> 23:52.280
 that science will never get a theory of everything.

23:52.280 --> 23:53.600
 Everything, everything.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.520
 Everything, everything, right?

23:54.520 --> 23:56.440
 The final theory of everything, right?

23:56.440 --> 23:59.160
 I think that my own take is for what it's worth

23:59.160 --> 24:01.600
 is that Gertl's incompleteness theorem

24:01.600 --> 24:03.160
 sort of points us in that direction,

24:03.160 --> 24:04.800
 that even with mathematics,

24:05.960 --> 24:09.440
 any finite axiomatization that's sophisticated enough

24:09.440 --> 24:11.040
 to be able to do arithmetic,

24:11.040 --> 24:14.240
 it's easy to show that there'll be statements that are true

24:14.240 --> 24:16.960
 that can't be proven,

24:16.960 --> 24:19.520
 can't be deduced from within that framework.

24:19.520 --> 24:21.960
 And if you add the new statements to your axioms,

24:21.960 --> 24:24.280
 then there'll be always new statements that are true

24:24.280 --> 24:26.920
 but can't be proven with a new axiom system.

24:26.920 --> 24:29.960
 And the best scientific theories

24:31.480 --> 24:34.120
 in physics, for example, and also now evolution

24:34.120 --> 24:35.080
 are mathematical.

24:35.080 --> 24:36.320
 So our theories are gonna be,

24:36.320 --> 24:38.400
 they're gonna have their own assumptions

24:38.400 --> 24:41.720
 and they'll be mathematically precise.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.240
 And there'll be theories perhaps of everything

24:43.240 --> 24:44.440
 except those assumptions,

24:44.440 --> 24:46.520
 because assumptions are,

24:46.520 --> 24:48.280
 we say please grant me these assumptions.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.440
 If you grant me these assumptions,

24:49.440 --> 24:51.520
 then I can explain this other stuff.

24:51.520 --> 24:56.520
 But so you have the assumptions that are like miracles

24:57.600 --> 24:59.440
 as far as the theory is concerned, they're not explained,

24:59.440 --> 25:01.560
 they're the starting points for explanation.

25:01.560 --> 25:03.200
 And then you have the mathematical structure

25:03.200 --> 25:04.240
 of the theory itself,

25:04.240 --> 25:07.520
 which will have the girdle limits.

25:07.520 --> 25:12.520
 And so my take is that reality, whatever it is,

25:12.520 --> 25:17.520
 is always going to transcend any conceptual theory

25:21.520 --> 25:22.480
 that we can come up with.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.720
 There's always gonna be mystery at the edges.

25:24.720 --> 25:29.440
 Contradictions and all that kind of stuff.

25:29.440 --> 25:30.280
 Okay.

25:31.600 --> 25:32.880
 And truths.

25:32.880 --> 25:34.880
 So there's this idea that is brought up

25:34.880 --> 25:39.480
 in the financial space of settlement of transactions.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.600
 It's often talked about in cryptocurrency especially.

25:42.600 --> 25:47.600
 So you could do, money, cash is not connected to anything.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.200
 It used to be connected to gold, to physical reality,

25:52.200 --> 25:54.640
 but then you can use money to exchange,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.320
 to exchange value to transact.

25:57.320 --> 25:59.800
 So when it was on the gold standard,

25:59.800 --> 26:04.800
 the money would represent some stable component of reality.

26:04.800 --> 26:09.800
 Isn't it more effective to avoid things like hyperinflation

26:12.320 --> 26:14.200
 if we generalize that idea?

26:14.200 --> 26:19.200
 Isn't it better to connect your,

26:19.320 --> 26:20.560
 whatever we humans are doing

26:20.560 --> 26:23.080
 in the social interaction space with each other?

26:23.080 --> 26:26.040
 Isn't it better from an evolutionary perspective

26:26.040 --> 26:28.080
 to connect it to some degree to reality

26:28.080 --> 26:31.640
 so that the transactions are settled

26:31.640 --> 26:33.760
 with something that's universal

26:33.760 --> 26:35.920
 as opposed to us constantly operating

26:35.920 --> 26:38.120
 in something that's a complete illusion?

26:38.120 --> 26:40.520
 Isn't it easy to hyperinflate that?

26:41.480 --> 26:45.280
 Like where you really deviate very, very far away

26:49.680 --> 26:51.040
 from the underlying reality

26:51.040 --> 26:53.760
 or do you not never get in trouble for this?

26:53.760 --> 26:58.240
 Can you just completely drift far, far away

26:58.240 --> 27:01.600
 from the underlying reality and never get in trouble?

27:01.600 --> 27:04.480
 That's a great question, on the financial side,

27:04.480 --> 27:06.920
 there's two levels at least that we could take your question.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.840
 One is strictly evolutionary psychology

27:09.840 --> 27:11.680
 of financial systems.

27:11.680 --> 27:13.520
 And that's pretty interesting.

27:13.520 --> 27:15.160
 And there the decentralized idea,

27:15.160 --> 27:18.560
 the DeFi kind of idea in cryptocurrencies

27:18.560 --> 27:19.960
 may make good sense

27:19.960 --> 27:22.440
 from just an evolutionary psychology point of view.

27:22.440 --> 27:25.760
 Having human nature being what it is,

27:25.760 --> 27:30.640
 putting a lot of faith in a few central controllers

27:30.640 --> 27:34.280
 depends a lot on the veracity of those

27:34.280 --> 27:37.080
 and the trustworthiness of those few central controllers.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.440
 And we have ample evidence time and again

27:39.440 --> 27:41.880
 that that's often betrayed.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.960
 So it makes good evolutionary sense, I would say,

27:44.960 --> 27:46.680
 to have a decentralized,

27:46.680 --> 27:49.600
 I mean, democracy is a step in that direction, right?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.240
 We don't have a monarch now telling us what to do.

27:52.240 --> 27:54.560
 We decentralize things, right?

27:54.560 --> 27:57.080
 Because if the monarch, if you have Marcus Aurelio

27:57.080 --> 27:58.600
 says you're emperor, you're great.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.160
 If you have Nero, it's not so great.

28:01.160 --> 28:02.320
 And so we don't want that.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.280
 So democracy is a step in that direction,

28:04.280 --> 28:08.800
 but I think the DeFi thing is an even bigger step

28:08.800 --> 28:13.120
 and is going to even make the democratization even greater.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.840
 So that's one level of...

28:14.840 --> 28:16.480
 Also the fact that power corrupts

28:16.480 --> 28:18.120
 and absolute power corrupts absolutely

28:18.120 --> 28:22.600
 is also a consequence of evolution.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.960
 That's also a feature, I think, right?

28:26.960 --> 28:30.840
 You can argue from the long span of living organisms,

28:30.840 --> 28:33.840
 it's nice for power to corrupt for you to...

28:33.840 --> 28:38.760
 So mad men and women throughout history

28:38.760 --> 28:42.200
 might be useful to teach us a lesson.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.760
 We can learn from our negative example, right?

28:44.760 --> 28:45.600
 Exactly.

28:45.600 --> 28:48.000
 Right, right.

28:48.000 --> 28:51.080
 Power does corrupt and I think that you can think about that

28:51.080 --> 28:53.560
 again from an evolutionary point of view.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.760
 But I think that your question was a little deeper.

28:55.760 --> 29:00.760
 When that was, does the evolutionary interface idea

29:01.480 --> 29:06.480
 sort of unhinge science from some kind of

29:06.760 --> 29:08.840
 important test for the theories, right?

29:08.840 --> 29:12.360
 We don't want, it doesn't mean that anything goes

29:12.360 --> 29:14.560
 in scientific theory, but there's no...

29:14.560 --> 29:15.920
 If we don't see the truth,

29:15.920 --> 29:18.680
 is there no way to tether our theories and test them?

29:18.680 --> 29:23.680
 And I think there's no problem there.

29:23.680 --> 29:27.120
 We can only test things in terms of what we can measure

29:27.120 --> 29:29.040
 with our senses in space and time.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.920
 So we're going to have to continue to do experiments

29:32.920 --> 29:34.520
 but we're going to re...

29:34.520 --> 29:36.320
 We're going to understand a little bit differently

29:36.320 --> 29:38.160
 what those experiments are.

29:38.160 --> 29:43.160
 We had thought that when we see a pointer on some machine

29:43.160 --> 29:46.880
 in an experiment that the machine exists,

29:46.880 --> 29:48.480
 the pointer exists and the values exist

29:48.480 --> 29:50.840
 even when no one is looking at them

29:50.840 --> 29:52.280
 and that they're an object of truth.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.920
 And our best theories are telling us no.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.960
 The pointers, pointers are just pointers

29:57.960 --> 29:59.640
 and that's what you have to rely on

29:59.640 --> 30:02.360
 for making your judgments.

30:02.360 --> 30:07.360
 But even the pointers themselves are not the objective reality.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.080
 So, and I think Gertl is telling us that

30:13.080 --> 30:18.080
 not that anything goes, but as you develop new axiom systems

30:18.320 --> 30:21.160
 you will find out what goes within that axiom system

30:21.160 --> 30:23.680
 and what testable predictions you can make.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.760
 So I don't think we're untethered.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.960
 We continue to do experiments.

30:27.960 --> 30:31.120
 What I think we won't have that we want

30:31.120 --> 30:35.120
 is a conceptual understanding that gives us a theory

30:35.120 --> 30:37.520
 of everything that's final and complete.

30:37.520 --> 30:40.240
 I think that this is, to put it another way,

30:40.240 --> 30:43.060
 this is job security for scientists.

30:44.000 --> 30:46.000
 Our job will never be done, it's job security

30:46.000 --> 30:49.440
 for neuroscience because before we thought

30:49.440 --> 30:51.640
 that when we looked in the brain we saw neurons

30:51.640 --> 30:55.840
 and neural networks and action potentials

30:55.840 --> 30:57.600
 and synapses and so forth.

30:57.600 --> 31:00.360
 And that was the reality.

31:00.360 --> 31:01.760
 Now we have to reverse engineer that.

31:01.760 --> 31:04.800
 We have to say what is beyond space time?

31:04.800 --> 31:05.640
 What is going on?

31:05.640 --> 31:08.400
 What is a dynamical system beyond space time?

31:08.400 --> 31:10.560
 That when we project it into Einstein space time

31:10.560 --> 31:12.360
 gives us things that look like neurons

31:12.360 --> 31:14.680
 and neural networks and synapses.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.520
 That's, so we have to reverse engineer it.

31:16.520 --> 31:19.000
 So there's gonna be lots more work for neuroscience.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.880
 It's gonna be far more complicated

31:20.880 --> 31:23.880
 and difficult and challenging.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.040
 But that's wonderful, that's what we need to do.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.400
 We thought neurons exist when they are perceived

31:28.400 --> 31:29.360
 and they don't.

31:29.360 --> 31:31.040
 In the same way that if I show you,

31:31.040 --> 31:34.480
 when I say they don't exist, I should be very, very concrete.

31:34.480 --> 31:36.280
 If I draw on a piece of paper,

31:36.280 --> 31:40.520
 a little sketch of something that is called the necker cube,

31:40.520 --> 31:42.880
 it's just a little line drawing of a cube, right?

31:42.880 --> 31:44.040
 It's not a flat piece of paper.

31:44.040 --> 31:46.200
 If I execute it well and I show it to you,

31:46.200 --> 31:48.400
 you'll see a 3D cube and you'll see it flip.

31:48.400 --> 31:49.800
 Sometimes you'll see one face in front,

31:49.800 --> 31:51.960
 sometimes you'll see the other face in front.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.280
 But I've asked you, you know,

31:53.280 --> 31:55.480
 which face is in front when you don't look?

31:57.320 --> 31:59.640
 The answer is, well, neither face is in front

31:59.640 --> 32:01.360
 because there's no cube.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.280
 There's just a flat piece of paper.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.160
 So when you look at the piece of paper,

32:05.160 --> 32:08.480
 you perceptually create the cube.

32:08.480 --> 32:11.560
 And when you look at it, then you fix one face

32:11.560 --> 32:13.160
 to be in front and one face to be in.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.040
 So that's what I mean when I say it doesn't exist.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.160
 Space time itself is like the cube.

32:18.160 --> 32:22.000
 It's a data structure that your sensory systems construct,

32:22.000 --> 32:23.760
 whatever your sensory systems mean now,

32:23.760 --> 32:27.360
 because we now have to even take that for granted.

32:27.360 --> 32:31.440
 But there are perceptions that you construct on the fly

32:31.440 --> 32:34.000
 and their data structures and the computer science says,

32:34.000 --> 32:35.720
 and you garbage collect them when you don't need them.

32:35.720 --> 32:37.520
 So you create them and garbage collect them.

32:37.520 --> 32:40.920
 But is it possible that it's mapped well

32:40.920 --> 32:45.680
 in some concrete predictable way to object to reality?

32:45.680 --> 32:48.680
 The sheet of paper, the two dimensional space,

32:48.680 --> 32:53.680
 or we can talk about space time maps in some way

32:53.680 --> 32:55.880
 that we maybe don't yet understand,

32:55.880 --> 32:59.640
 but we'll one day understand what that mapping is,

32:59.640 --> 33:02.960
 but it maps reliably, it is tethered in that way.

33:02.960 --> 33:03.800
 Well, yes.

33:03.800 --> 33:06.280
 And so the new theories that the physicists are finding

33:06.280 --> 33:08.160
 beyond space time have that kind of tethering.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.200
 So they show precisely how you start with an amplitude

33:11.200 --> 33:15.320
 headran and how you project this high dimensional structure

33:15.320 --> 33:18.320
 into the four dimensions of space time.

33:18.320 --> 33:22.360
 So there's a precise procedure that relates the two.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.880
 And they're doing the same thing

33:23.880 --> 33:25.200
 with the cosmological polytopes.

33:25.200 --> 33:29.800
 So they're the ones that are making the most concrete

33:29.800 --> 33:32.880
 and fun advances going beyond space time.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.000
 And they're tethering it.

33:35.000 --> 33:38.480
 But they say this is precisely the mathematical projection

33:38.480 --> 33:41.600
 from this deeper structure into space time.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.640
 One thing I'll say about as a nonphysicist

33:44.640 --> 33:48.840
 what I find interesting is that they're finding just geometry,

33:48.840 --> 33:51.120
 but there's no notion of dynamics.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.960
 Right now, they're just finding

33:52.960 --> 33:57.360
 these static geometric structures, which is impressive.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.400
 So I'm not putting them down.

33:58.400 --> 34:01.160
 This is what they're doing is unbelievably complicated

34:01.160 --> 34:06.160
 and brilliant and adventurous, all those things.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.280
 It's all those things.

34:08.280 --> 34:11.720
 And beautiful, from a human aesthetic perspective

34:11.720 --> 34:12.920
 because geometry is beautiful.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.160
 It's absolutely.

34:14.160 --> 34:16.400
 And they're finding symmetries that are true of the data

34:16.400 --> 34:18.640
 that can't be seen in space time.

34:18.640 --> 34:22.920
 But I'm looking for a theory beyond space time

34:22.920 --> 34:24.440
 that's a dynamical theory.

34:25.320 --> 34:27.520
 I would love to find, and we can talk about that

34:27.520 --> 34:29.560
 at some point, a theory of consciousness

34:29.560 --> 34:33.120
 in which the dynamics of consciousness itself

34:33.120 --> 34:36.360
 will give rise to the geometry that the physicists

34:36.360 --> 34:37.960
 are finding beyond space time.

34:37.960 --> 34:40.440
 If we can do that, then we'd have a completely different way

34:40.440 --> 34:42.640
 of looking at how consciousness is related

34:42.640 --> 34:45.280
 to what we call the brain or the physical world

34:45.280 --> 34:46.280
 more generally, right?

34:46.280 --> 34:49.640
 Right now, all of my brilliant colleagues,

34:49.640 --> 34:51.960
 99% of them are trying to,

34:53.880 --> 34:56.720
 they're assuming space time is fundamental.

34:56.720 --> 34:59.200
 They're assuming that particles are fundamental,

34:59.200 --> 35:02.000
 quarks, gluons, leptons and so forth,

35:02.000 --> 35:04.040
 elements, atoms and so forth are fundamental

35:04.040 --> 35:06.400
 and that therefore neurons and brains

35:06.400 --> 35:08.800
 are part of objective reality.

35:08.800 --> 35:10.880
 And that somehow when you get matter

35:10.880 --> 35:12.640
 that's complicated enough,

35:12.640 --> 35:16.240
 it will somehow generate conscious experiences

35:16.240 --> 35:17.840
 by its functional properties.

35:17.840 --> 35:20.520
 Or if you're panpsychist, maybe you,

35:20.520 --> 35:22.680
 in addition to the physical properties of particles,

35:22.680 --> 35:27.240
 you add consciousness property as well.

35:27.240 --> 35:29.560
 And then you combine these physical

35:29.560 --> 35:32.200
 and conscious properties to get more complicated ones.

35:32.200 --> 35:34.720
 But they're all doing it within space time.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.960
 All of the work that's being done on consciousness

35:38.960 --> 35:41.880
 and its relationship to the brain

35:41.880 --> 35:45.000
 has all assumed something that our best theories

35:45.000 --> 35:46.760
 are telling us is doomed, space time.

35:46.760 --> 35:50.440
 Why does that particular assumption bother you the most?

35:50.440 --> 35:52.080
 So you bring up space time.

35:53.640 --> 35:56.960
 I mean, that's just one useful interface

35:56.960 --> 35:59.880
 we've used for a long time.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.720
 Surely there's other interfaces.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.680
 Is space time just one of the big ones

36:04.680 --> 36:06.800
 that you, to build up people's intuition

36:06.800 --> 36:10.360
 about the fact that they do assume a lot of things strongly?

36:10.360 --> 36:15.040
 Or is it in fact the fundamental flaw

36:15.040 --> 36:16.560
 in the way we see the world?

36:17.480 --> 36:20.640
 Well, everything else that we think we know

36:20.640 --> 36:21.840
 are things in space time.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.240
 Sure.

36:24.240 --> 36:27.760
 And so when you say space time is doomed,

36:27.760 --> 36:32.760
 this is a shot to the heart of the whole framework,

36:32.920 --> 36:35.920
 the whole conceptual framework that we've had in science.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.760
 Not to the scientific method,

36:37.760 --> 36:40.840
 but to the fundamental ontology

36:40.840 --> 36:42.440
 and also the fundamental methodology,

36:42.440 --> 36:45.800
 the ontology of space time and its contents.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.400
 And the methodology of reductionism,

36:47.400 --> 36:51.960
 which is that as we go to smaller scales in space time,

36:51.960 --> 36:55.160
 we will find more and more fundamental laws.

36:55.160 --> 36:56.520
 And that's been very useful

36:56.520 --> 36:59.440
 for space and time for centuries,

36:59.440 --> 37:01.440
 reductionism for centuries.

37:01.440 --> 37:04.720
 But now we realized that that's over.

37:04.720 --> 37:08.720
 Reductionism is in fact dead as is space time.

37:08.720 --> 37:10.600
 What exactly is reductionism?

37:10.600 --> 37:15.000
 What is the process of reductionism that is different

37:15.000 --> 37:18.200
 than some of the physicists that you mentioned

37:18.200 --> 37:22.120
 that are trying to let go of the assumption of space time?

37:22.120 --> 37:24.600
 And it can be on, isn't that still trying to come up

37:24.600 --> 37:27.400
 with a simple model that explains this whole thing?

37:27.400 --> 37:29.440
 Isn't it still reducing?

37:29.440 --> 37:30.280
 It's a wonderful question

37:30.280 --> 37:33.160
 because it really helps to clarify two different notions,

37:33.160 --> 37:35.520
 which is scientific explanation on the one hand

37:36.560 --> 37:39.440
 and a particular kind of scientific explanation

37:39.440 --> 37:40.880
 on the other, which is the reductionist.

37:40.880 --> 37:43.280
 So the reductionist explanation is saying,

37:43.280 --> 37:47.560
 I will start with things that are smaller in space time

37:47.560 --> 37:49.320
 and therefore more fundamental,

37:49.320 --> 37:51.080
 where the laws are more fundamental.

37:51.080 --> 37:54.880
 So we go to just smaller and smaller scales.

37:54.880 --> 37:58.000
 Whereas in science more generally,

37:58.000 --> 37:59.520
 we just say like when Einstein

37:59.520 --> 38:01.520
 did the special theory of relativity,

38:01.520 --> 38:03.600
 he's saying, let me have a couple of postulates.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.160
 I will assume that the speed of light is universal

38:06.160 --> 38:11.160
 for all observers in uniform motion

38:12.000 --> 38:13.360
 and that the laws of physics,

38:13.360 --> 38:16.800
 so for uniform motion are that's it.

38:16.800 --> 38:18.120
 That's not a reductionist.

38:18.120 --> 38:20.040
 Those are saying, grant me these assumptions.

38:20.040 --> 38:23.400
 I can build this entire concept of space time out of it.

38:23.400 --> 38:24.600
 It's not a reductionist thing.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.800
 You're not going to smaller and smaller scales of space.

38:27.800 --> 38:30.640
 You're coming up with these deep, deep principles.

38:30.640 --> 38:33.120
 Same thing with this theory of gravity, right?

38:33.120 --> 38:35.640
 It's the falling elevator idea, right?

38:35.640 --> 38:37.720
 So this is not a reductionist kind of thing.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.840
 It's something different.

38:39.840 --> 38:43.320
 So simplification is a bigger thing

38:43.320 --> 38:45.560
 than just reductionism.

38:45.560 --> 38:47.760
 Reductionism has been a particularly useful

38:47.760 --> 38:49.560
 kind of scientific explanation,

38:49.560 --> 38:51.720
 for example, in thermodynamics, right?

38:51.720 --> 38:53.440
 Where the notion that we have of heat,

38:53.440 --> 38:56.680
 some macroscopic thing like temperature and heat,

38:56.680 --> 38:59.640
 it turns out that Neil Boltzmann and others discovered,

38:59.640 --> 39:02.000
 well, hey, if we go to smaller and smaller scales,

39:02.000 --> 39:04.480
 we find these things called molecules or atoms.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.480
 And if we think of them as bouncing around

39:06.480 --> 39:08.680
 and having some kind of energy,

39:08.680 --> 39:13.680
 then what we call heat is really can be reduced to that.

39:13.680 --> 39:18.680
 And so that's a particularly useful kind of reduction,

39:19.080 --> 39:21.360
 is a useful kind of scientific explanation

39:21.360 --> 39:25.440
 that works within a range of scales within space time.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.400
 But we know now precisely where that has to stop,

39:28.400 --> 39:30.240
 at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters

39:30.240 --> 39:32.720
 and 10 to the minus 43 seconds.

39:32.720 --> 39:34.360
 And I would be impressed

39:34.360 --> 39:37.520
 if it was 10 to the minus 33 trillion centimeters.

39:37.520 --> 39:40.360
 I'm not terribly impressed at 10 to the minus 33 centimeters.

39:40.360 --> 39:44.880
 I don't even know how to comprehend

39:44.880 --> 39:47.360
 either of those numbers, frankly.

39:47.360 --> 39:49.080
 Just a small aside,

39:49.080 --> 39:51.520
 because I am a computer science person,

39:51.520 --> 39:54.160
 I also find cellular automata beautiful.

39:54.160 --> 39:57.840
 And so you have somebody like Stephen Wolfram,

39:57.840 --> 40:01.560
 who recently has been very excitedly exploring

40:01.560 --> 40:05.040
 a proposal for a data structure that could be

40:06.520 --> 40:08.400
 the numbers that would make you a little bit happier

40:08.400 --> 40:10.720
 in terms of scale, because they're very, very, very,

40:10.720 --> 40:11.760
 very tiny.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.520
 So do you like this space of exploration

40:15.520 --> 40:18.640
 of really thinking, letting go of space time,

40:18.640 --> 40:20.360
 letting go of everything and trying to think

40:20.360 --> 40:21.720
 what kind of data structures

40:21.720 --> 40:23.840
 could be underneath this whole mess?

40:23.840 --> 40:24.680
 That's right.

40:24.680 --> 40:27.840
 So if they're thinking about these as outside of space time,

40:27.840 --> 40:29.160
 then that's what we have to do.

40:29.160 --> 40:30.600
 That's what our best theories are telling us.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.640
 You now have to think outside of space time.

40:32.640 --> 40:36.560
 Now, of course, I should back up and say,

40:36.560 --> 40:40.360
 we know that Einstein surpassed Newton, right?

40:40.360 --> 40:41.960
 But that doesn't mean that there's not good work

40:41.960 --> 40:42.960
 to do Newton.

40:42.960 --> 40:44.280
 There's all sorts of Newtonian physics

40:44.280 --> 40:46.200
 that takes us to the moon and so forth.

40:46.200 --> 40:48.640
 And there's lots of good problems that we want to solve

40:48.640 --> 40:49.960
 with Newtonian physics.

40:49.960 --> 40:51.280
 The same thing will be true of space time.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.960
 We'll still, it's not like we're gonna stop using space time.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.400
 We'll continue to do all sorts of good work there.

40:56.400 --> 41:00.480
 But for those scientists who are really looking to

41:01.640 --> 41:04.240
 go deeper, to actually find the next,

41:04.240 --> 41:06.160
 just like what Einstein did to Newton,

41:06.160 --> 41:07.440
 what are we gonna do to Einstein?

41:07.440 --> 41:09.800
 How do we get beyond Einstein and quantum theory

41:09.800 --> 41:10.920
 to something deeper?

41:10.920 --> 41:13.280
 Then we have to actually let go.

41:13.280 --> 41:17.800
 And if we're gonna do like this automata kind of approach,

41:18.800 --> 41:21.200
 it's critical that it's not automata in space time,

41:21.200 --> 41:23.560
 it's automata prior to space time,

41:23.560 --> 41:25.880
 from which we're going to show how space time emerges.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.200
 If you're doing automata within space time,

41:28.200 --> 41:29.600
 well, that might be a fun model,

41:29.600 --> 41:32.120
 but it's not the radical new step that we need.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.520
 Yeah, so the space time emerges from that,

41:35.520 --> 41:37.480
 whatever system, like you're saying,

41:37.480 --> 41:39.600
 it's a dynamical system.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.520
 Do we even have an understanding what dynamical means

41:42.520 --> 41:43.760
 when we go beyond?

41:45.520 --> 41:48.080
 When you start to think about dynamics,

41:48.080 --> 41:50.360
 that could mean a lot of things.

41:50.360 --> 41:53.000
 Even causality could mean a lot of things

41:53.000 --> 41:56.800
 if we realize that everything's an interface.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.440
 Like what, how much do we really know

42:00.440 --> 42:01.440
 is an interesting question?

42:01.440 --> 42:02.560
 Because you brought up neurons,

42:02.560 --> 42:05.480
 I gotta ask you on another, yet another tangent.

42:05.480 --> 42:07.920
 There's a paper I remember a while ago looking at

42:07.920 --> 42:11.480
 called, could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?

42:11.480 --> 42:14.200
 And I just enjoyed that thought experiment

42:14.200 --> 42:16.000
 that they provided, which is,

42:16.000 --> 42:18.920
 they basically, it's a couple of neuroscientists,

42:18.920 --> 42:22.360
 Eric Jonas and Conrad Cording,

42:22.360 --> 42:24.880
 who use the tools of neuroscience

42:24.880 --> 42:27.920
 to analyze a microprocessor.

42:27.920 --> 42:30.440
 I saw a computer, computer chip.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.280
 Yeah, if we lesion it here, what happens and so forth?

42:32.280 --> 42:35.280
 And if you go and lesion into your computer,

42:35.280 --> 42:37.840
 it's very, very clear that lesion experiments

42:37.840 --> 42:39.000
 on computers are not gonna give you

42:39.000 --> 42:40.400
 a lot of insight into how it works.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.280
 And also the measurement devices and the kinda,

42:42.280 --> 42:43.920
 so just using the basic approaches

42:43.920 --> 42:46.320
 of neuroscience collecting the data,

42:46.320 --> 42:49.400
 trying to intuit about the underlying function of it.

42:49.400 --> 42:52.520
 And that helps you understand that

42:52.520 --> 42:55.880
 our scientific exploration of concepts,

42:57.680 --> 42:59.320
 depending on the field,

43:00.240 --> 43:05.000
 are maybe in the very, very early stages.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.400
 I wouldn't say it leaves us astray.

43:08.400 --> 43:09.560
 Perhaps it does sometimes,

43:09.560 --> 43:13.000
 but it's not a, it's not anywhere close

43:13.000 --> 43:14.680
 to some fundamental mechanism

43:14.680 --> 43:16.440
 that actually makes the thing work.

43:16.440 --> 43:18.960
 I don't know if you can sort of comment on that

43:18.960 --> 43:21.080
 in terms of using neuroscience to understand

43:21.080 --> 43:24.200
 the human mind and neurons.

43:24.200 --> 43:26.320
 Are we really far away potentially

43:26.320 --> 43:29.560
 from understanding in the way we understand

43:30.480 --> 43:33.680
 the transistors enough to be able to build a computer?

43:33.680 --> 43:37.920
 So one thing about understanding

43:37.920 --> 43:39.560
 is you can understand for fun.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.040
 The other one is to understand

43:43.040 --> 43:45.840
 so you could build things.

43:45.840 --> 43:49.120
 And that's when you really have to understand.

43:49.120 --> 43:49.960
 Exactly.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.880
 In fact, what got me into the field that I at MIT

43:53.880 --> 43:57.600
 was worked by David Maher on this very topic.

43:57.600 --> 43:59.800
 So David Maher was a professor at MIT,

43:59.800 --> 44:02.040
 but he'd done his PhD in neuroscience,

44:02.040 --> 44:05.360
 studying just the architectures of the brain.

44:05.360 --> 44:08.640
 But he realized that his work, it was on the cerebellum.

44:10.040 --> 44:15.040
 He realized that his work, as rigorous as it was,

44:15.160 --> 44:16.680
 left him unsatisfied

44:16.680 --> 44:19.040
 because he didn't know what the cerebellum was for.

44:19.040 --> 44:19.880
 Yeah.

44:19.880 --> 44:21.720
 And why it had that architecture.

44:21.720 --> 44:25.520
 And so he went to MIT and he was in the AI lab there.

44:25.520 --> 44:29.640
 And he said he had this three level approach

44:29.640 --> 44:30.720
 that really grabbed my attention.

44:30.720 --> 44:32.760
 So when I was an undergrad at UCLA,

44:32.760 --> 44:34.800
 I read one of his papers in a class and said,

44:34.800 --> 44:35.640
 who is this guy?

44:35.640 --> 44:37.520
 Because he said, you have to have a computational theory.

44:37.520 --> 44:39.000
 What is being computed and why?

44:40.400 --> 44:42.440
 An algorithm, how is it being computed?

44:42.440 --> 44:44.800
 What are the prosaic algorithms?

44:44.800 --> 44:45.960
 And then the hardware,

44:45.960 --> 44:47.840
 how does it get instantiated in the hardware?

44:47.840 --> 44:50.400
 And so to really do neuroscience, he argued,

44:50.400 --> 44:52.760
 we needed to have understanding at all those levels.

44:52.760 --> 44:54.400
 And that really got me.

44:54.400 --> 44:55.440
 I loved the neuroscience,

44:55.440 --> 44:57.080
 but I realized this guy was saying,

44:57.080 --> 45:00.080
 if you can't build it, you don't understand it effectively.

45:00.080 --> 45:02.000
 And so that's why I went to MIT.

45:02.000 --> 45:04.520
 And I had the pleasure of working with David

45:04.520 --> 45:07.760
 until he died just a year and a half later.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.880
 So there's been that idea that,

45:11.880 --> 45:14.600
 with neuroscience, we have to have in some sense

45:14.600 --> 45:18.960
 a top down model of what's being computed and why

45:18.960 --> 45:20.000
 that we would then go after.

45:20.000 --> 45:21.480
 And the same thing with the,

45:21.480 --> 45:24.240
 trying to reverse engineer a computing system

45:24.240 --> 45:25.520
 like your laptop.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.640
 We really need to understand

45:27.640 --> 45:29.120
 what the user interface is about

45:29.120 --> 45:34.120
 and why we have what are keys on the keyboard for and so forth.

45:34.280 --> 45:37.520
 You need to know why to really understand

45:37.520 --> 45:40.360
 all the circuitry and what it's for.

45:40.360 --> 45:45.360
 Now, evolution of a natural selection

45:46.600 --> 45:51.600
 does not tell us the deeper question that we're asking,

45:51.800 --> 45:53.680
 the answer to the deeper question, which is why.

45:53.680 --> 45:58.680
 What's this deeper reality and what's it up to and why?

45:59.440 --> 46:03.240
 It all it tells us is that whatever reality is,

46:04.160 --> 46:05.540
 it's not what you see.

46:06.760 --> 46:11.760
 What you see is just an adaptive fiction.

46:12.200 --> 46:15.440
 So just to linger on this fascinating bold question

46:15.440 --> 46:19.040
 that shakes you out of your dream state,

46:19.040 --> 46:23.480
 does this fiction still help you in building intuitions

46:23.480 --> 46:27.800
 as literary fiction does about reality?

46:27.800 --> 46:30.280
 The reason we read literary fiction

46:31.240 --> 46:34.760
 is it helps us build intuitions

46:34.760 --> 46:37.200
 and understanding in indirect ways,

46:37.200 --> 46:40.320
 sneak up to the difficult questions of human nature.

46:40.320 --> 46:41.920
 Great fiction.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.440
 Same with this observed reality.

46:46.120 --> 46:48.000
 Does this interface that we get,

46:48.000 --> 46:50.720
 this fictional interface help us build intuition

46:50.720 --> 46:55.000
 about deeper truths of how this whole mess works?

46:55.000 --> 46:58.880
 Well, I think that each theory that we propose

46:58.880 --> 47:01.080
 will give its own answer to that question.

47:01.080 --> 47:05.280
 So when the physicists are proposing these structures

47:05.280 --> 47:08.240
 like the amplitude hydrant and cosmological polytope,

47:08.240 --> 47:11.080
 associated hydrant and so forth beyond space time,

47:11.080 --> 47:12.920
 we can then ask your question

47:12.920 --> 47:15.000
 for those specific structures and say,

47:15.000 --> 47:17.600
 how much information, for example,

47:17.600 --> 47:19.240
 does evolution of a natural selection

47:19.240 --> 47:24.240
 and the kinds of sensory systems that we have right now

47:24.520 --> 47:26.960
 give us about this deeper reality?

47:26.960 --> 47:30.000
 And why did we evolve this way?

47:30.000 --> 47:33.040
 We can try to answer that question from within the deeper.

47:33.040 --> 47:34.920
 So there's not gonna be a general answer.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.760
 I think we're gonna, what we'll have to do

47:36.760 --> 47:39.400
 is posit these new deeper theories

47:39.400 --> 47:41.480
 and then try to answer your question

47:41.480 --> 47:43.600
 within the framework of those deeper theories,

47:43.600 --> 47:47.160
 knowing full well that there'll be an even deeper theory.

47:47.160 --> 47:49.880
 So is this paralyzing though?

47:49.880 --> 47:53.400
 Because how do we know we're not completely adrift

47:54.720 --> 47:57.760
 out to sea, lost forever from,

47:57.760 --> 48:00.120
 so like that our theories are completely lost.

48:00.120 --> 48:02.020
 So if it's all,

48:04.280 --> 48:07.960
 if we can never truly deeply introspect to the bottom,

48:09.240 --> 48:12.040
 if it's always just turtles on top of turtles infinitely,

48:12.040 --> 48:17.040
 then isn't that paralyzing for a scientific mind?

48:18.400 --> 48:21.480
 Well, it's interesting that you say introspect to the bottom.

48:23.160 --> 48:27.360
 Because there is one, I mean, again,

48:27.360 --> 48:28.920
 this isn't the same spirit of what I said before,

48:28.920 --> 48:31.040
 which is it depends on what answer you give

48:31.040 --> 48:32.840
 to what's beyond space time,

48:32.840 --> 48:35.200
 what answer we would give to your question, right?

48:35.200 --> 48:39.680
 So, but one answer that is interesting to explore

48:39.680 --> 48:41.000
 is something that spiritual traditions

48:41.000 --> 48:42.600
 have said for thousands of years,

48:42.600 --> 48:43.680
 but haven't said precisely.

48:43.680 --> 48:45.880
 So we can't take it seriously in science

48:45.880 --> 48:46.960
 until it's made precise,

48:46.960 --> 48:49.160
 but we might be able to make it precise.

48:49.160 --> 48:52.600
 And that is that they've also said something

48:52.600 --> 48:54.800
 like space and time aren't fundamental,

48:54.800 --> 48:56.840
 they're Maya, they're illusion.

48:56.840 --> 49:01.440
 And but that if you look inside, if you introspect,

49:03.280 --> 49:05.960
 and let go of all of your particular perceptions,

49:05.960 --> 49:10.360
 you will come to something that's beyond conceptual thought.

49:11.280 --> 49:15.360
 And that is, they claim,

49:15.360 --> 49:17.600
 being in contact with the deep ground of being

49:17.600 --> 49:21.240
 that transcends any particular conceptual understanding.

49:21.240 --> 49:24.240
 If that is correct, and I'm not saying it's correct,

49:24.240 --> 49:26.040
 but, and I'm not saying it's not correct,

49:26.040 --> 49:28.360
 I'm just saying, if that's correct,

49:28.360 --> 49:30.760
 then it would be the case that as scientists,

49:30.760 --> 49:34.120
 because we also are in touch with this ground of being,

49:34.120 --> 49:37.000
 we would then not be able

49:37.000 --> 49:40.160
 to conceptually understand ourselves all the way,

49:40.160 --> 49:43.600
 but we could know ourselves just by being ourselves.

49:43.600 --> 49:46.120
 And so we would, there would be a sense

49:46.120 --> 49:48.920
 in which there is a fundamental grounding

49:48.920 --> 49:50.840
 to the whole enterprise,

49:50.840 --> 49:53.320
 because we're not separate from the enterprise.

49:53.320 --> 49:57.400
 This is the opposite of the impersonal third person science.

49:57.400 --> 50:01.640
 This would make science go personal all the way down.

50:01.640 --> 50:05.160
 But nevertheless, scientific, because the scientific method

50:05.160 --> 50:09.320
 would still be what we would use all the way down

50:09.320 --> 50:10.440
 for the conceptual understanding.

50:10.440 --> 50:12.760
 Unfortunately, I still don't know if you went all the way down.

50:12.760 --> 50:15.920
 It's possible that this kind of whatever consciousness is,

50:15.920 --> 50:17.280
 and we'll talk about it,

50:17.280 --> 50:22.280
 is getting the cliche statement of be yourself.

50:25.120 --> 50:28.520
 It is somehow digging at a deeper truth of reality,

50:28.520 --> 50:31.760
 but you still don't know when you get to the bottom.

50:31.760 --> 50:34.400
 You know, a lot of people, they'll take psychedelic drugs

50:34.400 --> 50:38.000
 and they'll say, well, that takes my mind to certain places

50:38.000 --> 50:41.120
 where it feels like that is revealing

50:41.120 --> 50:43.120
 some deeper truth of reality,

50:43.120 --> 50:45.280
 but you still, it could be interfaces

50:45.280 --> 50:46.840
 on top of interfaces.

50:46.840 --> 50:51.840
 That's in your view of this, you really don't know.

50:52.600 --> 50:54.080
 I mean, it's gaitos and completeness,

50:54.080 --> 50:55.640
 is that you really don't know.

50:55.640 --> 50:59.200
 My own view on it, for what it's worth,

50:59.200 --> 51:00.720
 because I don't know the right answer,

51:00.720 --> 51:05.720
 but my own view on it right now is that it's never ending.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.240
 I think that there will never,

51:07.240 --> 51:09.000
 that this is great, as I said before,

51:09.000 --> 51:12.040
 great job security for science,

51:12.040 --> 51:14.880
 and that we, if this is true,

51:14.880 --> 51:17.560
 and if consciousness is somehow important

51:17.560 --> 51:19.000
 or fundamental in the universe,

51:19.000 --> 51:20.640
 this may be an important fundamental fact

51:20.640 --> 51:21.960
 about consciousness itself,

51:21.960 --> 51:25.920
 that it's never ending exploration that's going on,

51:25.920 --> 51:27.520
 in some sense.

51:27.520 --> 51:29.720
 Well, that's interesting.

51:29.720 --> 51:31.920
 Let me push back on the job security.

51:31.920 --> 51:32.760
 Okay.

51:34.440 --> 51:37.520
 So maybe as we understand this kind of idea,

51:37.520 --> 51:39.160
 deeper and deeper,

51:39.160 --> 51:42.960
 we understand that the pursuit is not a fruitful one.

51:42.960 --> 51:45.160
 Then maybe we need to,

51:45.160 --> 51:48.400
 maybe that's why we don't see aliens everywhere.

51:48.400 --> 51:51.240
 As you get smarter and smarter and smarter,

51:51.240 --> 51:55.560
 you realize that like exploration is,

51:55.560 --> 51:59.240
 there's other fun ways to spend your time than exploring.

51:59.240 --> 52:03.960
 You could be sort of living maximally

52:03.960 --> 52:05.840
 in some way that's not exploration.

52:06.920 --> 52:07.840
 You know, I could,

52:07.840 --> 52:10.000
 there's all kinds of video games you can construct

52:10.000 --> 52:11.800
 and put yourself inside of them

52:11.800 --> 52:15.200
 that don't involve you going outside of the game world.

52:15.200 --> 52:18.720
 It's, you know, feeling, for my human perspective,

52:18.720 --> 52:20.960
 what seems to be fun is challenging yourself

52:20.960 --> 52:22.640
 and overcoming those challenges.

52:22.640 --> 52:25.200
 So you can constantly artificially generate challenges

52:25.200 --> 52:29.480
 for yourself, like Sisyphus and his boulder, just,

52:29.480 --> 52:30.640
 and that's it.

52:30.640 --> 52:32.240
 So the scientific method

52:32.240 --> 52:34.000
 that's always reaching out to the stars,

52:34.000 --> 52:35.560
 that's always trying to figure out the puzzle

52:35.560 --> 52:36.400
 and bottom puzzle,

52:36.400 --> 52:40.520
 the trick we're always trying to get to the bottom turtle.

52:40.520 --> 52:43.960
 Maybe if we can build more and more the intuition

52:43.960 --> 52:46.560
 that that's an infinite pursuit,

52:46.560 --> 52:51.120
 we get, we agree to start deviating from that pursuit,

52:51.120 --> 52:53.160
 start enjoying the here and now

52:53.160 --> 52:56.600
 versus the looking out into the unknown always.

52:56.600 --> 52:58.960
 Maybe that's looking out into the unknown

52:58.960 --> 53:03.960
 as a early activity for a species that's evolved.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.800
 I'm just sort of saying, pushing back

53:09.800 --> 53:12.160
 as you probably got a lot of scientists excited

53:12.160 --> 53:13.600
 in terms of job security.

53:13.600 --> 53:17.760
 I could envision where it's not job security

53:17.760 --> 53:20.760
 or scientists become more and more useless.

53:22.040 --> 53:25.480
 Maybe they're like the holders of the ancient wisdom

53:26.640 --> 53:29.680
 that allows us to study our own history,

53:29.680 --> 53:32.320
 but not much more than that.

53:32.320 --> 53:34.520
 Just to get fun pushback.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.520
 That's good, pushback.

53:36.520 --> 53:38.640
 I'll put one in there for the scientists again.

53:38.640 --> 53:39.480
 Yes.

53:39.480 --> 53:41.480
 But sure, but then I'll take the other side too.

53:41.480 --> 53:46.480
 So when Faraday did all of his experiments

53:46.600 --> 53:50.320
 with magnets and electricity and so forth,

53:50.320 --> 53:52.080
 came with all this wonderful empirical data

53:52.080 --> 53:54.160
 and James Clerk Maxwell looked at it

53:54.160 --> 53:56.160
 and wrote down a few equations,

53:56.160 --> 53:58.240
 which we can now write down in a single equation,

53:58.240 --> 54:00.200
 the Maxwell equation if we use geometric algebra,

54:00.200 --> 54:01.160
 just one equation.

54:03.920 --> 54:06.960
 That opened up unbelievable technologies

54:06.960 --> 54:09.520
 where people are zooming and talking to each other

54:09.520 --> 54:13.760
 around the world, the whole electronics industry.

54:13.760 --> 54:17.160
 There was something that transformed our lives

54:17.160 --> 54:21.840
 in a very positive way with the theories beyond space time.

54:23.440 --> 54:24.880
 Here's one potential.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.880
 Right now, most of the galaxies that we see,

54:30.160 --> 54:32.640
 we can see them, but we know that we could never get to them

54:32.640 --> 54:34.200
 no matter how fast we traveled.

54:34.200 --> 54:37.600
 They're going away from us at the speed of light or beyond.

54:37.600 --> 54:39.360
 So we can't ever get to them.

54:39.360 --> 54:40.800
 So there's all this beautiful real estate

54:40.800 --> 54:42.760
 that's just smiling and waving at us

54:42.760 --> 54:44.920
 and we can never get to it.

54:44.920 --> 54:47.440
 But that's if we go through space time.

54:47.440 --> 54:48.920
 But if we recognize that space time

54:48.920 --> 54:51.800
 is just a data structure, it's not fundamental.

54:52.760 --> 54:56.120
 We're not little things inside space time.

54:56.120 --> 55:00.280
 Space time was a little data structure in our perceptions.

55:00.280 --> 55:02.160
 It's just the other way around.

55:02.160 --> 55:05.480
 Once we understand that, and we get equations

55:05.480 --> 55:07.240
 for the stuff that's beyond space time,

55:07.240 --> 55:10.640
 maybe we won't have to go through space time.

55:10.640 --> 55:11.800
 Maybe we can go around it.

55:11.800 --> 55:14.280
 Maybe I can go to Proxima Centauri and not go through space.

55:14.280 --> 55:16.800
 I can just go right there directly.

55:16.800 --> 55:17.640
 It's a data structure.

55:17.640 --> 55:19.320
 We can start to play with it.

55:19.320 --> 55:23.600
 So I think that for what it's worth,

55:23.600 --> 55:28.600
 my take would be that the endless sequence of theories

55:29.800 --> 55:32.880
 that we could contemplate building

55:32.880 --> 55:37.880
 will lead to an endless sequence of new remarkable insights

55:38.680 --> 55:41.520
 into the potentialities, the possibilities

55:41.520 --> 55:44.000
 that would seem miraculous to us.

55:44.000 --> 55:47.600
 And that we will be motivated to continue the exploration

55:47.600 --> 55:51.240
 partly just for the technological innovations

55:51.240 --> 55:52.920
 that come out.

55:52.920 --> 55:56.200
 But the other thing that you mentioned though,

55:56.200 --> 55:57.840
 what about just being?

55:57.840 --> 56:00.480
 What do we decide instead of all this doing

56:00.480 --> 56:02.360
 and exploring what about being?

56:02.360 --> 56:06.680
 My guess is that the best scientists will do both

56:06.680 --> 56:10.160
 and that the act of being

56:11.560 --> 56:14.920
 will be a place where they get many of their ideas

56:14.920 --> 56:18.800
 and that they then pull into the conceptual realm.

56:18.800 --> 56:20.800
 And I think many of the best scientists,

56:20.800 --> 56:22.160
 Einstein comes to mind, right?

56:22.160 --> 56:24.400
 Where these guys say, look, I didn't come up

56:24.400 --> 56:27.640
 with these ideas by a conceptual analysis.

56:27.640 --> 56:30.240
 I was thinking in vague images

56:30.240 --> 56:34.000
 and it was just something non conceptual.

56:34.000 --> 56:36.040
 And then it took me a long, long time

56:36.040 --> 56:38.120
 to pull it out into concepts

56:38.120 --> 56:40.640
 and then longer to put it into math.

56:40.640 --> 56:42.480
 But the real insights didn't come

56:42.480 --> 56:45.720
 from just slavishly playing with equations.

56:45.720 --> 56:48.320
 They came from a deeper place.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.600
 And so there may be this going back and forth

56:51.600 --> 56:54.680
 between the complete non conceptual

56:54.680 --> 56:57.640
 where there's essentially no end to the wisdom

56:57.640 --> 56:58.800
 and then conceptual systems

56:58.800 --> 57:02.200
 where there's the girdle limits that we have to that.

57:02.200 --> 57:05.480
 And that may be if consciousness is important

57:05.480 --> 57:07.600
 and fundamental, that may be what consciousness,

57:07.600 --> 57:09.360
 at least part of what consciousness is about

57:09.360 --> 57:11.880
 is this discovering itself,

57:11.880 --> 57:14.040
 discovering its possibilities, so to speak.

57:14.040 --> 57:15.960
 We can talk about what that might mean

57:17.240 --> 57:20.240
 by going from the non conceptual

57:20.240 --> 57:22.200
 to the conceptual and back and forth.

57:23.400 --> 57:26.440
 To get better and better and better at being.

57:26.440 --> 57:29.000
 Right, let me ask you, Jeff, just to linger

57:29.000 --> 57:32.200
 on the evolutionary, because you mentioned

57:32.200 --> 57:35.320
 evolutionary game theory and that's really where you,

57:35.320 --> 57:36.840
 the perspective from which you come

57:38.560 --> 57:40.200
 to form the case against reality.

57:42.120 --> 57:45.400
 At which point in our evolutionary history

57:45.400 --> 57:49.560
 do we start to deviate the most from reality?

57:49.560 --> 57:54.560
 Is it way before life even originated on earth?

57:54.560 --> 57:55.800
 On earth?

57:55.800 --> 58:00.800
 Is it in the early development from bacteria and so on?

58:02.280 --> 58:05.080
 Or is it when some inklings

58:05.080 --> 58:06.760
 of what we think of as intelligence

58:06.760 --> 58:11.760
 or maybe even complex consciousness started to emerge?

58:12.880 --> 58:14.880
 So where did this deviation,

58:15.960 --> 58:19.480
 just like with the interfaces in a computer,

58:19.480 --> 58:23.920
 you start with transistors and then you have assembly

58:23.920 --> 58:28.160
 and then you have C, C++, then you have Python,

58:28.160 --> 58:31.480
 then you have GUIs, all that kind of layers upon layers.

58:31.480 --> 58:33.320
 When did we start to deviate?

58:33.320 --> 58:36.240
 Well, David Maher, again, my advisor at MIT

58:37.480 --> 58:41.120
 in his book, Vision, suggested that the more primitive

58:41.120 --> 58:45.800
 sensory systems were less realistic, less theoretical,

58:45.800 --> 58:47.000
 but that by the time you got to something

58:47.000 --> 58:48.240
 as complicated as the humans,

58:48.240 --> 58:51.600
 we were actually estimating the true shapes

58:51.600 --> 58:53.400
 and distances to objects and so forth.

58:53.400 --> 58:57.080
 So his point of view, and I think it was probably,

58:57.080 --> 59:01.640
 it's not an uncommon view among my colleagues,

59:01.640 --> 59:06.200
 that yeah, the sensory systems of lower creatures

59:06.200 --> 59:07.560
 may just not be complicated enough

59:07.560 --> 59:10.040
 to give them much, much truth.

59:10.040 --> 59:12.880
 But as you get to 86 billion neurons,

59:12.880 --> 59:14.080
 you can now compute the truth

59:14.080 --> 59:17.080
 or at least the parts of the truth that we need.

59:17.080 --> 59:19.240
 When I look at evolutionary game theory,

59:19.240 --> 59:24.120
 one of my graduate students, Justin Mark,

59:24.120 --> 59:27.680
 did some simulations using genetic algorithms.

59:27.680 --> 59:30.600
 So there he was just exploring,

59:30.600 --> 59:32.120
 we start off with random organisms,

59:32.120 --> 59:36.320
 random sensory genetics and random actions

59:36.320 --> 59:38.160
 and the first generation was unbelievably,

59:38.160 --> 59:39.680
 it was a foraging situation,

59:39.680 --> 59:41.320
 they were foraging for resources.

59:41.320 --> 59:44.160
 Most of them, you know, stayed in one place,

59:44.160 --> 59:45.920
 didn't do anything important.

59:45.920 --> 59:50.920
 And, but we could then just look at how the genes evolved.

59:51.160 --> 59:56.080
 And what we found was, what he found,

59:56.080 --> 59:59.920
 was that basically you never even saw

59:59.920 --> 1:00:04.920
 the truth organisms even come on the stage.

1:00:06.040 --> 1:00:07.800
 If they came out, they were gone in one generation,

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:09.400
 they just weren't.

1:00:09.400 --> 1:00:14.400
 So they came and went even just in one generation.

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:16.280
 They just are not good enough.

1:00:16.280 --> 1:00:17.960
 The ones that were just tracking,

1:00:17.960 --> 1:00:20.840
 their senses just were tracking the fitness payoffs

1:00:20.840 --> 1:00:25.840
 were far more fit than the truth seekers.

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:30.480
 So from, so an answer at one level,

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:31.800
 I want to give an answer to a deeper level,

1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:34.160
 but just with evolutionary game theory.

1:00:34.160 --> 1:00:36.480
 Because my attitude as a scientist is,

1:00:37.280 --> 1:00:38.880
 I don't believe any of our theories.

1:00:40.120 --> 1:00:42.240
 I take them very, very seriously, I study them,

1:00:42.240 --> 1:00:43.320
 I look at their implications,

1:00:43.320 --> 1:00:44.920
 but none of them are the gospel.

1:00:44.920 --> 1:00:47.200
 They're just the latest ideas that we have.

1:00:47.200 --> 1:00:50.600
 And so the reason I study evolutionary game theory

1:00:50.600 --> 1:00:53.040
 is because that's the best tool we have

1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:55.040
 right now in this area.

1:00:55.040 --> 1:00:57.320
 There is nothing else that competes.

1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:59.560
 And so as a scientist is my responsibility

1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:02.040
 to take the best tools and see what they mean.

1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:03.600
 And the same thing the physicists are doing,

1:01:03.600 --> 1:01:04.840
 they're taking the best tools

1:01:04.840 --> 1:01:07.240
 and looking at what they entail.

1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:11.720
 But I don't, I think that science now has enough experience

1:01:11.720 --> 1:01:15.000
 to realize that we should not believe our theories

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.000
 in the sense that we've now arrived.

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:22.440
 In 1890, it was a lot of physicists thought we'd arrived.

1:01:22.440 --> 1:01:26.680
 They were discouraging bright young students

1:01:26.680 --> 1:01:28.800
 from going into physics because it was all done.

1:01:28.800 --> 1:01:31.800
 And that's precisely the wrong attitude.

1:01:31.800 --> 1:01:34.560
 Forever is the wrong attitude forever.

1:01:34.560 --> 1:01:38.640
 The attitude we should have is a century from now,

1:01:38.640 --> 1:01:40.600
 they'll be looking at us and laughing

1:01:40.600 --> 1:01:41.760
 at what we didn't know.

1:01:41.760 --> 1:01:44.160
 And we just have to assume that that's going to be the case.

1:01:44.160 --> 1:01:46.920
 Just know that everything that we think is so brilliant

1:01:46.920 --> 1:01:49.280
 right now, our final theory,

1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:50.880
 a century from now they'll look at us

1:01:50.880 --> 1:01:53.160
 like we look at the physicists of 1890

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:55.440
 and go, how could they have been so dumb?

1:01:55.440 --> 1:01:56.280
 Yeah.

1:01:56.280 --> 1:01:57.720
 So I don't want to make that mistake.

1:01:57.720 --> 1:02:01.720
 So I'm not Dr. Nair about any of our current

1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:02.960
 scientific theories.

1:02:02.960 --> 1:02:06.320
 I am Dr. Nair about this.

1:02:06.320 --> 1:02:09.120
 We should use the best tools we have right now.

1:02:09.120 --> 1:02:11.080
 And with humility.

1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:13.480
 Well, so let me ask you about game theory.

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:17.980
 There's, I love game theory, evolution game theory,

1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:22.600
 but I'm always suspicious of it, like economics.

1:02:23.520 --> 1:02:28.520
 When you construct models, it's too easy to construct things

1:02:28.840 --> 1:02:33.840
 that oversimplify just because we are human brains

1:02:34.440 --> 1:02:39.080
 enjoy the simplification of constructing a few variables

1:02:39.080 --> 1:02:43.160
 that somehow represent organisms or represent people

1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:45.640
 and running a simulation that then allows you

1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:48.480
 to build up intuition and then it feels really good

1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:50.480
 because you can get some really deep

1:02:50.480 --> 1:02:52.000
 and surprising intuitions.

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.240
 But how do you know your models aren't the assumptions

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:58.920
 underlying your models on some fundamentally flawed

1:02:58.920 --> 1:03:01.760
 and because of that, your conclusions

1:03:01.760 --> 1:03:03.040
 are fundamentally flawed.

1:03:03.040 --> 1:03:06.240
 So I guess my question is what are the limits

1:03:06.240 --> 1:03:08.880
 in your use of game theory, evolution game theory?

1:03:08.880 --> 1:03:12.520
 Your experience with it, what are the limits of game theory?

1:03:12.520 --> 1:03:15.800
 So I've gotten some pushback from professional colleagues

1:03:15.800 --> 1:03:19.360
 and friends who have tried to rerun simulations

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:21.880
 and try to, the idea that we don't see the truth

1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:22.720
 is not comfortable.

1:03:22.720 --> 1:03:24.880
 And so many of my colleagues are very interested

1:03:24.880 --> 1:03:26.480
 in trying to show that we're wrong.

1:03:26.480 --> 1:03:29.360
 And so the idea would be to say that somehow we did something

1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:31.640
 as you're suggesting, maybe something special

1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:33.800
 that wasn't completely general.

1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:37.000
 We got some little special part of the whole search space

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.200
 in evolutionary game theory in which this happens

1:03:39.200 --> 1:03:41.080
 to be true, but more generally,

1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:42.640
 organisms would evolve to see the truth.

1:03:42.640 --> 1:03:47.640
 So the best pushback we've gotten is from a team at Yale.

1:03:48.080 --> 1:03:52.640
 And they suggested that if you use thousands

1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:55.400
 of payoff functions, so our simulations,

1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:57.760
 we just use a couple, one or two.

1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:00.280
 Because it was our first simulations, right?

1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:01.240
 So that would be a limit.

1:04:01.240 --> 1:04:02.400
 We had one or two payoff functions

1:04:02.400 --> 1:04:03.920
 we showed the result in those,

1:04:03.920 --> 1:04:07.080
 at least for the genetic algorithms.

1:04:07.080 --> 1:04:10.440
 And they said if you have 20,000 of them,

1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:14.840
 then we can find these conditions in which truth

1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:17.280
 seeing organisms would be the ones

1:04:17.280 --> 1:04:19.360
 that evolved and survived.

1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:21.120
 And so we looked at their simulations

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:26.040
 and it certainly is the case that you can find special cases

1:04:26.040 --> 1:04:27.560
 in which truth can evolve.

1:04:27.560 --> 1:04:29.120
 So when I say it's probability zero,

1:04:29.120 --> 1:04:30.120
 it doesn't mean it can't happen.

1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:31.240
 It can happen.

1:04:31.240 --> 1:04:33.000
 In fact, it could happen infinitely often.

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.360
 It's just probability zero.

1:04:34.360 --> 1:04:38.280
 So if probability zero things can happen infinitely often.

1:04:38.280 --> 1:04:39.560
 When you say probability zero,

1:04:39.560 --> 1:04:41.960
 you mean probability close to zero.

1:04:41.960 --> 1:04:43.120
 To be very precise.

1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:46.720
 So for example, if I have a unit square on the plane

1:04:48.760 --> 1:04:51.440
 and I use a measure in which the,

1:04:51.440 --> 1:04:54.600
 on a probability measure in which the area

1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:56.280
 of a region is this probability.

1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:02.400
 Then if I draw a curve in that unit square,

1:05:02.400 --> 1:05:05.480
 it has measure precisely zero.

1:05:05.480 --> 1:05:07.800
 Precisely, not approximately, precisely zero.

1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:10.120
 And yet it has infinitely many points.

1:05:10.120 --> 1:05:12.200
 So there's an object that for that probability measure

1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:13.480
 has probability zero.

1:05:13.480 --> 1:05:16.280
 And yet there's infinitely many points in it.

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:19.040
 So that's what I mean when I say that the things

1:05:19.040 --> 1:05:20.280
 that are probability zero can happen

1:05:20.280 --> 1:05:21.760
 infinitely often in principle.

1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:25.080
 Yeah, but infinity as far as that.

1:05:25.080 --> 1:05:28.120
 And I look outside often at walk around

1:05:28.120 --> 1:05:29.200
 and I look at people.

1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:32.880
 I haven't never seen infinity in real life.

1:05:32.880 --> 1:05:36.000
 That's an interesting issue.

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.560
 I've been looking, I've been looking.

1:05:37.560 --> 1:05:41.240
 I don't notice it, infinitely small or the infinitely big.

1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:43.400
 And so the tools of mathematics,

1:05:43.400 --> 1:05:45.720
 you could sort of apply the same kind of criticism

1:05:45.720 --> 1:05:49.240
 that it is a very convenient interface into our reality.

1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:50.520
 That's a big debate in mathematics.

1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:52.280
 The intuitionist versus the ones who take,

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:55.160
 for example, the real numbers as real.

1:05:55.160 --> 1:05:57.120
 And that's a fun discussion.

1:05:57.120 --> 1:05:59.240
 Nicholas Giesen has a physicist that said,

1:05:59.240 --> 1:06:01.400
 really interesting work recently on how

1:06:01.400 --> 1:06:04.200
 if you go with intuitionist mathematics,

1:06:05.560 --> 1:06:10.040
 you could effectively quantize Newton.

1:06:10.040 --> 1:06:12.480
 And you find that Newtonian theory

1:06:12.480 --> 1:06:14.440
 and quantum theory aren't that different

1:06:14.440 --> 1:06:16.480
 once you go with it.

1:06:16.480 --> 1:06:17.320
 It's funny.

1:06:17.320 --> 1:06:18.160
 It's really quite interesting.

1:06:18.160 --> 1:06:21.040
 So the issue you raise is a very, very deep one.

1:06:21.040 --> 1:06:23.760
 And one that I think we should take quite seriously,

1:06:23.760 --> 1:06:27.640
 which is, how should we think about the reality

1:06:27.640 --> 1:06:30.400
 of the contrast hierarchy?

1:06:30.400 --> 1:06:35.400
 A love one, A love two and all these different infinities

1:06:35.880 --> 1:06:40.880
 versus just a more algorithmic approach, right?

1:06:41.680 --> 1:06:44.680
 So where everything's computable

1:06:44.680 --> 1:06:47.240
 in some sense everything's finite as big as you want,

1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:49.800
 but nevertheless finite.

1:06:49.800 --> 1:06:54.800
 So yeah, ultimately boils down to whether the world

1:06:55.040 --> 1:06:59.320
 is discrete or continuous in some general sense.

1:06:59.320 --> 1:07:01.200
 And again, we can't really know,

1:07:01.200 --> 1:07:05.480
 but there's just a mind breaking thought,

1:07:05.480 --> 1:07:09.880
 just common sense reasoning that something can happen

1:07:09.880 --> 1:07:13.840
 and is yet probability of it happening is 0%.

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:18.120
 That doesn't compute for common sense computer.

1:07:18.120 --> 1:07:21.800
 Right, this is where you have to be a sharp mathematician

1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:23.440
 to really, and I'm not.

1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:25.000
 Sharp is one word.

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.440
 What I'm saying is common sense computer is,

1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:32.440
 I mean that in a very kind of, in a positive sense,

1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:37.280
 because we've been talking about perception systems

1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:42.160
 and interfaces, if we are to reason about the world,

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:45.080
 we have to use the best interfaces we got.

1:07:45.080 --> 1:07:50.080
 And I'm not exactly sure that game theory

1:07:50.360 --> 1:07:53.400
 is the best interface we got for this.

1:07:53.400 --> 1:07:57.720
 And applications of mathematics, tricks and tools

1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:00.600
 of mathematics to game theory is the best we got

1:08:00.600 --> 1:08:03.920
 when we're thinking about the nature of reality

1:08:03.920 --> 1:08:07.560
 and fitness functions and evolution, period.

1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:10.040
 Well, that's a fair rejoinder.

1:08:10.040 --> 1:08:14.080
 And I think that that was the tool that we used.

1:08:14.080 --> 1:08:17.320
 And if someone says, here's a better mathematical tool,

1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:20.240
 and here's why, this is this mathematical tool,

1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:23.280
 better captures the essence of Darwin's idea.

1:08:23.280 --> 1:08:24.960
 John Maynard Smith didn't quite get it

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.320
 with evolutionary game theory.

1:08:26.320 --> 1:08:27.520
 There's this better, this thing.

1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:30.640
 Now there are tools like evolutionary graph theory,

1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:32.880
 which generalize evolutionary game theory.

1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:35.560
 And then there's quantum game theory.

1:08:35.560 --> 1:08:40.560
 So you can use quantum tools like entanglement,

1:08:40.560 --> 1:08:43.240
 for example, as a resource in games

1:08:43.240 --> 1:08:47.360
 that change the very nature of the solutions,

1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:50.040
 the optimal solutions of the game theory.

1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:53.360
 Well, the work from Yale is really interesting.

1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:55.280
 It's a really interesting challenge

1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:57.960
 of these ideas where, okay,

1:08:57.960 --> 1:09:00.640
 if you have a very large number of fitness functions,

1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:05.200
 or let's say you have a nearly infinite number

1:09:05.200 --> 1:09:07.280
 of fitness functions or a growing number

1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:09.840
 of fitness functions, what kind of interesting

1:09:09.840 --> 1:09:14.840
 things start to emerging, if you are to be an organism.

1:09:15.560 --> 1:09:17.640
 If to be an organism that adapts,

1:09:17.640 --> 1:09:22.440
 means having to deal with an ensemble of fitness functions.

1:09:23.360 --> 1:09:26.680
 Right, and so we've actually redone some

1:09:26.680 --> 1:09:29.040
 of our own work based on theirs.

1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:30.320
 And this is the back and forth

1:09:30.320 --> 1:09:32.320
 that we expect in science, right?

1:09:32.320 --> 1:09:34.520
 And what we found was that they,

1:09:34.520 --> 1:09:37.160
 in their simulations, they were assuming

1:09:37.160 --> 1:09:40.120
 that you couldn't carve the world up into objects.

1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:43.960
 And so we said, well, let's relax that assumption.

1:09:43.960 --> 1:09:46.000
 Allow organisms to create data structures

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:47.720
 that we might call objects.

1:09:47.720 --> 1:09:49.440
 And an object would be you take,

1:09:49.440 --> 1:09:51.600
 you would do hierarchical clustering

1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:53.200
 of your fitness payoff functions,

1:09:53.200 --> 1:09:54.840
 the ones that have similar shapes.

1:09:54.840 --> 1:09:56.360
 If you have 20,000 of them,

1:09:56.360 --> 1:09:59.560
 you may be these 50 are all very, very similar.

1:09:59.560 --> 1:10:03.640
 So I can take all the perception action fitness stuff

1:10:03.640 --> 1:10:05.720
 and make that into a data structure

1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:08.280
 and we'll call that a unit or an object.

1:10:08.280 --> 1:10:09.640
 And as soon as we did that,

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:11.600
 then all of their results went away.

1:10:11.600 --> 1:10:13.400
 It turned out they were the special case

1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:17.840
 and that the organisms that were allowed to only see,

1:10:17.840 --> 1:10:21.480
 that were shaped to see only fitness payoffs

1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:22.920
 were the ones that were.

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:25.320
 So the idea is that objects then,

1:10:25.320 --> 1:10:27.160
 what are objects from an evolutionary point of view?

1:10:27.160 --> 1:10:30.160
 This bottle, we thought that when I saw a bottle,

1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:31.760
 it was because I was seeing a true object

1:10:31.760 --> 1:10:34.400
 that existed whether or not it was perceived.

1:10:34.400 --> 1:10:37.960
 Evolutionary theories suggest a different interpretation.

1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:41.160
 I'm seeing a data structure that is encoding

1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:45.400
 a convenient way of looking at various fitness payoffs.

1:10:45.400 --> 1:10:48.320
 I can use this for drinking.

1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:50.760
 I could use it as a weapon, not a very good one.

1:10:50.760 --> 1:10:52.840
 I could beat someone with head with it.

1:10:52.840 --> 1:10:56.600
 If my goal is mating, this is pointless.

1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:59.640
 So I'm seeing for what I'm coding here

1:10:59.640 --> 1:11:04.200
 is all sorts of actions and the payoffs that I could get.

1:11:04.200 --> 1:11:05.480
 When I pick up an apple,

1:11:05.480 --> 1:11:08.680
 now I'm getting a different set of actions and payoffs.

1:11:08.680 --> 1:11:10.200
 When I pick up a rock, I'm getting,

1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:11.680
 so for every object,

1:11:11.680 --> 1:11:15.080
 what I'm getting is a different set of payoff functions

1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:18.160
 and act with various actions.

1:11:18.160 --> 1:11:20.640
 And so once you allow that,

1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:23.920
 then what you find is once again,

1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:25.640
 that truth goes extinct

1:11:25.640 --> 1:11:28.040
 and the organisms that just get an interface

1:11:28.040 --> 1:11:29.560
 are the ones that that went.

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:32.120
 But the question, I'm just sneaking up on,

1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:36.920
 this is fascinating, from where do fitness functions

1:11:36.920 --> 1:11:38.200
 originate?

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:40.160
 What gives birth to the fitness functions?

1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:43.360
 So if there's a giant black box

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:45.160
 that just keeps giving you fitness functions,

1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:46.200
 what are we trying to optimize?

1:11:46.200 --> 1:11:51.200
 You said that water has different uses than an apple.

1:11:55.320 --> 1:11:57.000
 So there's these objects.

1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:58.880
 What are we trying to optimize?

1:11:58.880 --> 1:12:02.760
 And why is not reality a really good generator

1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:03.880
 of fitness functions?

1:12:05.400 --> 1:12:07.480
 So each theory makes its own assumptions

1:12:07.480 --> 1:12:09.680
 and says grant me this and I'll explain that.

1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:11.040
 So evolutionary game theory says

1:12:11.040 --> 1:12:13.440
 grant me fitness payoffs, right?

1:12:13.440 --> 1:12:16.360
 And grant me strategies with payoffs

1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:18.560
 and I can write down the matrix

1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:20.360
 for this strategy interacts with that strategy.

1:12:20.360 --> 1:12:21.640
 These are the payoffs that come up.

1:12:21.640 --> 1:12:22.480
 If you grant me that,

1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:24.560
 then I can start to explain a lot of things.

1:12:24.560 --> 1:12:26.440
 Now you can ask for a deeper question like,

1:12:26.440 --> 1:12:31.440
 okay, how does physics evolve biology

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:36.080
 and where do these fitness payoffs come from, right?

1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:41.080
 Now, that's a completely different enterprise

1:12:41.360 --> 1:12:43.160
 and of course evolutionary game theory then

1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:45.360
 would be not the right tool for that.

1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:46.520
 It would have to be a deeper tool

1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.320
 that shows where evolutionary game theory comes from.

1:12:49.320 --> 1:12:54.320
 My own take is that there's gonna be a problem in doing that

1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:00.240
 because space time isn't fundamental.

1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:03.280
 It's just a user interface

1:13:04.520 --> 1:13:06.200
 and that the distinction that we make

1:13:06.200 --> 1:13:08.480
 between living and non living

1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:10.600
 is not a fundamental distinction.

1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:15.120
 It's an artifact of the limits of our interface, right?

1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:16.400
 So this is a new wrinkle

1:13:16.400 --> 1:13:20.680
 and this is an important wrinkle, it's so nice

1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:22.280
 to take space and time as fundamental

1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:24.080
 because if something looks like it's inanimate,

1:13:24.080 --> 1:13:27.160
 it's inanimate and we can just say it's not living.

1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:30.760
 Now, it's much more complicated.

1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:32.200
 Certain things are obviously living.

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:34.080
 I'm talking with you,

1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:36.560
 I'm obviously interacting with something

1:13:36.560 --> 1:13:38.640
 that's alive and conscious.

1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:40.000
 I think we've let go of the word

1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000
 obviously in this conversation.

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.360
 I think nothing is obvious.

1:13:43.360 --> 1:13:45.280
 Nothing's obvious, that's right.

1:13:45.280 --> 1:13:48.720
 But when we get down to like an ant,

1:13:48.720 --> 1:13:52.560
 it's obviously living, but I'll say it appears to be living.

1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:55.600
 But when we get down to a virus, now people wonder

1:13:55.600 --> 1:13:57.240
 and when we get down to protons,

1:13:57.240 --> 1:13:58.840
 people say it's not living.

1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:01.640
 And my attitude is, look, I have a user interface.

1:14:02.800 --> 1:14:05.800
 Interface is there to hide certain aspects of reality

1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:10.800
 and others to, it's an uneven representation,

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:11.960
 put it that way.

1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:14.920
 Certain things just get completely hidden.

1:14:14.920 --> 1:14:17.960
 Dark matter and dark energy are most

1:14:17.960 --> 1:14:19.800
 of the energy and matter that's out there.

1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:22.160
 Our interface just plain flat out hides them.

1:14:23.400 --> 1:14:25.280
 The only way we get some hint is

1:14:25.280 --> 1:14:28.720
 because gravitational things are going wrong within our,

1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:31.960
 so most things are outside of our interface.

1:14:31.960 --> 1:14:34.040
 The distinction between living and nonliving

1:14:35.160 --> 1:14:37.200
 is not fundamental, it's an artifact of our interface.

1:14:37.200 --> 1:14:41.920
 So if we really want to understand

1:14:41.920 --> 1:14:43.360
 where evolution comes from,

1:14:43.360 --> 1:14:46.760
 to answer the question, the deep question you asked,

1:14:46.760 --> 1:14:48.680
 I think the right way we're going to have to do that

1:14:48.680 --> 1:14:51.120
 is to come up with a deeper theory than space time,

1:14:52.120 --> 1:14:54.320
 in which there may not be the notion of time.

1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:59.320
 And show that whatever this dynamics

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:00.880
 of that deeper theory is,

1:15:02.240 --> 1:15:03.080
 by the way, I'll talk about

1:15:03.080 --> 1:15:04.440
 how you could have dynamics without time,

1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:07.160
 but the dynamics of this deeper theory,

1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:11.040
 when we project it into, in certain ways,

1:15:11.040 --> 1:15:13.080
 then we do get space time and we get what appears

1:15:13.080 --> 1:15:15.080
 to be evolution by natural selection.

1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:17.800
 So I would love to see evolution by natural selection,

1:15:17.800 --> 1:15:19.320
 nature, red, and tooth, and claw,

1:15:19.320 --> 1:15:21.480
 people fighting, animals fighting for resource

1:15:21.480 --> 1:15:23.280
 and the whole bit, come out of a deeper theory

1:15:23.280 --> 1:15:25.640
 in which perhaps it's all cooperation.

1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:28.000
 There's no limited resources and so forth,

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:32.240
 but as a result of projection, you get space and time,

1:15:32.240 --> 1:15:33.640
 and as a result of projection,

1:15:33.640 --> 1:15:35.480
 you get nature, red, and tooth, and claw,

1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:36.520
 the appearance of it,

1:15:36.520 --> 1:15:39.160
 but it's all an artifact of the interface.

1:15:39.160 --> 1:15:43.240
 I like this idea that the line between living

1:15:43.240 --> 1:15:45.040
 and nonliving is very important,

1:15:46.560 --> 1:15:48.680
 because that's the thing that would emerge

1:15:48.680 --> 1:15:52.440
 before you have evolution, the idea of death.

1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.880
 So that seems to be an important component

1:15:58.880 --> 1:16:01.040
 of natural selection, and if that emerged,

1:16:01.040 --> 1:16:05.520
 because that's also asking the question,

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:09.080
 I guess, that I ask, where do fitness functions come from?

1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:12.960
 That's like asking the old meaning of life question, right?

1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:17.520
 It's the why, why, why?

1:16:17.520 --> 1:16:20.600
 And one of the big underlying why is, okay,

1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:22.680
 you can start with evolution on earth,

1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:26.120
 but without living, without life and death,

1:16:26.120 --> 1:16:28.680
 without the line between the living and the dead,

1:16:28.680 --> 1:16:30.520
 you don't have evolution.

1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:31.680
 So what if underneath it,

1:16:31.680 --> 1:16:34.080
 there's no such thing as the living and the dead?

1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:39.080
 There's no, like this concept of an organism period,

1:16:39.520 --> 1:16:44.240
 there's a living organism that's defined by a volume

1:16:44.240 --> 1:16:48.360
 and space time that somehow interacts,

1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:52.200
 that over time maintains its integrity somehow,

1:16:53.320 --> 1:16:56.640
 has some kind of history, it has a wall of some kind,

1:16:56.640 --> 1:16:58.400
 the outside world, the environment,

1:16:58.400 --> 1:17:00.800
 and then inside there's an organism.

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:02.920
 So you're defining an organism,

1:17:02.920 --> 1:17:04.920
 and also you're defining that organism

1:17:04.920 --> 1:17:07.360
 by the fact that it can move,

1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:10.280
 and it can be come alive,

1:17:10.280 --> 1:17:12.040
 which you kind of think of as moving,

1:17:13.120 --> 1:17:15.160
 combined with the fact that it's keeping itself separate

1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:16.000
 from the environment,

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:17.960
 so you can point out that thing is living,

1:17:17.960 --> 1:17:19.560
 and then it can also die.

1:17:21.080 --> 1:17:25.040
 That seems to be of all very powerful components

1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:28.400
 of space time that enable you to have something

1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:31.640
 like natural selection and evolution.

1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:33.120
 Well, and there's a lot of interesting work,

1:17:33.120 --> 1:17:36.160
 some of it by collaborators of Carl Friston and others

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:40.920
 where they have Bayes net kind of stuff

1:17:40.920 --> 1:17:43.800
 that they built on in the notion of a Markov blanket.

1:17:43.800 --> 1:17:47.200
 So you have some states within this network

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:48.400
 that are inside the blanket,

1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:49.240
 then you have the blanket,

1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:50.760
 and then the states outside the blanket,

1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:52.960
 and the states inside this Markov blanket

1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:54.640
 are conditionally independent of the states outside

1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:57.400
 the blanket conditioned on the blanket.

1:17:57.400 --> 1:18:01.200
 And what they're looking at is that the dynamics

1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:04.480
 of the states inside the Markov blanket

1:18:04.480 --> 1:18:07.160
 seem to be trying to estimate properties of the outside

1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:09.000
 and react to them in a way.

1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:11.320
 So it seems like you're doing probabilistic inferences

1:18:11.320 --> 1:18:14.240
 in ways that might be able to keep you alive.

1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:17.600
 So there's interesting work going on in that direction,

1:18:17.600 --> 1:18:21.560
 but what I'm saying is something slightly different,

1:18:21.560 --> 1:18:24.840
 and that is, like when I look at you,

1:18:24.840 --> 1:18:26.440
 all I see is skin, hair and eyes, right?

1:18:26.440 --> 1:18:27.480
 That's all I see.

1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:31.200
 But I know that there's a deeper reality.

1:18:31.200 --> 1:18:32.640
 I believe that there's a much deeper reality.

1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:34.280
 There's the whole world of your experiences,

1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:35.840
 your thoughts, your hopes, your dreams.

1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:38.680
 In some sense, the face that I see

1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:42.120
 is just a symbol that I create, right?

1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:44.840
 And as soon as I look away, I delete that symbol,

1:18:44.840 --> 1:18:46.320
 but I don't delete you.

1:18:46.320 --> 1:18:48.560
 I don't delete the conscious experience,

1:18:48.560 --> 1:18:50.280
 the whole world of your...

1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:53.520
 So I'm only deleting an interface symbol,

1:18:53.520 --> 1:18:58.520
 but that interface symbol is a portal, so to speak.

1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:04.400
 Not a perfect portal, but a genuine portal

1:19:04.400 --> 1:19:06.560
 into your beliefs, into your conscious experiences,

1:19:06.560 --> 1:19:07.400
 into...

1:19:07.400 --> 1:19:08.800
 That's why we can have a conversation.

1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:12.200
 We genuinely, your consciousness is genuinely affecting mine,

1:19:12.200 --> 1:19:13.880
 and mine is genuinely affecting yours,

1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:17.640
 through these icons, which I create on the fly.

1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:20.120
 I mean, I create your face when I look, I delete it.

1:19:20.120 --> 1:19:22.080
 I don't create you, your consciousness,

1:19:22.080 --> 1:19:25.040
 that's there all the time, but I do...

1:19:25.040 --> 1:19:27.440
 So now when I look at a cat,

1:19:27.440 --> 1:19:29.920
 I'm creating something that I still call living,

1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:31.920
 and I still think is conscious.

1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:33.920
 When I look at an ant,

1:19:33.920 --> 1:19:36.480
 I create something that I still would call living,

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:38.160
 but may be not conscious.

1:19:38.160 --> 1:19:40.720
 When I look at something I call a virus,

1:19:40.720 --> 1:19:42.960
 now I'm not even sure I would call it living,

1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:45.360
 and when I look at a proton, I would say,

1:19:45.360 --> 1:19:48.920
 I don't even think it's not alive at all.

1:19:48.920 --> 1:19:53.600
 It could be that I'm nevertheless interacting

1:19:53.600 --> 1:19:55.680
 with something that's just as conscious as you.

1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:57.440
 I'm not saying the proton is conscious.

1:19:57.440 --> 1:19:59.400
 The face that I'm creating when I look at you,

1:19:59.400 --> 1:20:00.560
 that face is not conscious.

1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:03.680
 That face is a data structure in me.

1:20:03.680 --> 1:20:07.440
 That face is an experience, it's not an experiencer.

1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:13.360
 Similarly, a proton is something that I create when I look,

1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:16.080
 or do a collision in the Large Hadron Collider

1:20:16.080 --> 1:20:18.200
 or something like that.

1:20:18.200 --> 1:20:21.440
 But what is behind the entity in space time?

1:20:21.440 --> 1:20:23.160
 So I've got this space time interface,

1:20:23.160 --> 1:20:25.600
 and I've just got this entity that I call a proton.

1:20:25.600 --> 1:20:27.480
 What is the reality behind it?

1:20:27.480 --> 1:20:30.800
 Well, the physicists are finding these big, big structures,

1:20:30.800 --> 1:20:33.040
 ample two Hadron, the associate Hadron,

1:20:34.320 --> 1:20:36.040
 what's behind those?

1:20:36.040 --> 1:20:38.720
 Could be consciousness, what I'm playing with.

1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:41.280
 In which case, when I'm interacting with a proton,

1:20:42.280 --> 1:20:43.720
 I could be interacting with consciousness.

1:20:43.720 --> 1:20:45.240
 Again, to be very, very clear,

1:20:45.240 --> 1:20:49.320
 because I'm not saying a proton is conscious.

1:20:49.320 --> 1:20:51.360
 Just like I'm not saying your face is conscious.

1:20:51.360 --> 1:20:53.400
 Your face is a symbol I create,

1:20:53.400 --> 1:20:56.080
 and then delete as I look.

1:20:56.080 --> 1:20:57.360
 So your face is not conscious,

1:20:57.360 --> 1:21:00.040
 but I know that that face in my interface,

1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:01.880
 the Lex Friedman face that I create,

1:21:01.880 --> 1:21:04.240
 is an interface symbol that's a genuine portal

1:21:04.240 --> 1:21:06.080
 into your consciousness.

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:09.960
 The portal is less clear for a cat,

1:21:09.960 --> 1:21:11.840
 even less clear for an ant.

1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:13.400
 And by the time we get down to a proton,

1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:15.960
 the portal is not clear at all.

1:21:15.960 --> 1:21:17.920
 But that doesn't mean I'm not interacting with consciousness.

1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:20.200
 It just means my interface gave up.

1:21:20.200 --> 1:21:23.040
 And there's some deeper reality that we have to go after.

1:21:23.040 --> 1:21:27.000
 So your question really forces out a big part

1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:29.160
 of this whole approach that I'm talking about.

1:21:29.160 --> 1:21:30.640
 So it's this portal and consciousness.

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:33.360
 I wonder why you can't,

1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:36.840
 your portal is not as good to a cat,

1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:40.440
 to a cat's consciousness than it is to a human.

1:21:40.440 --> 1:21:43.760
 Does it have to do with the fact that you're human

1:21:45.120 --> 1:21:47.480
 and just similar organisms,

1:21:47.480 --> 1:21:49.840
 organisms with similar complexity

1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:53.480
 are able to create portals better to each other?

1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:54.320
 Or is it just,

1:21:54.320 --> 1:21:55.640
 as you get more and more complex,

1:21:55.640 --> 1:21:57.920
 you get better and better portals?

1:21:57.920 --> 1:22:00.160
 Well, let me answer one aspect

1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:01.240
 that I'm more confident about,

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:03.560
 then I'll speculate on that.

1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:07.200
 Why is it that the portal is so bad with protons?

1:22:07.200 --> 1:22:09.520
 Well, and elementary particles more generally.

1:22:09.520 --> 1:22:12.280
 So quarks, leptons, and gluons, and so forth.

1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:14.080
 Well, the reason for that

1:22:14.080 --> 1:22:18.280
 is because those are just symmetries of space time.

1:22:19.240 --> 1:22:21.080
 More technically, the irreducible representations

1:22:21.080 --> 1:22:22.960
 of the Poincare group of space time.

1:22:25.320 --> 1:22:29.840
 So they're just literally representations

1:22:29.840 --> 1:22:33.560
 of the data structure of space time that we're using.

1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:35.840
 So that's why they're not very much insightful.

1:22:35.840 --> 1:22:38.320
 They're just almost entirely tied

1:22:38.320 --> 1:22:39.480
 to the data structure itself.

1:22:39.480 --> 1:22:41.400
 There's not much,

1:22:41.400 --> 1:22:43.560
 they're telling you only something about the data structure,

1:22:43.560 --> 1:22:44.960
 not behind the data structure.

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.720
 It's only when we get to higher levels

1:22:46.720 --> 1:22:48.520
 that we're starting to, in some sense,

1:22:48.520 --> 1:22:52.280
 build portals to what's behind space time.

1:22:52.280 --> 1:22:53.600
 Sure, yeah.

1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:58.600
 So there's more and more complexity built on top

1:22:58.760 --> 1:23:02.000
 of the interface of space time with the cat.

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:03.520
 So you can actually build a portal, right?

1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:08.520
 Yeah, right. Yeah, this interface of face and hair

1:23:11.400 --> 1:23:14.640
 and so on, skin.

1:23:16.880 --> 1:23:20.160
 There's some sinking going on between humans though.

1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:24.320
 Where we sink, you're getting a pretty good representation

1:23:24.320 --> 1:23:26.320
 of the ideas in my head

1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:30.040
 and starting to get a foggy view

1:23:30.040 --> 1:23:32.640
 of my memories in my head,

1:23:32.640 --> 1:23:36.320
 even though this is the first time we're talking,

1:23:36.320 --> 1:23:38.640
 you start to project your own memories.

1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:42.720
 You start to solve a giant hierarchy of puzzles

1:23:42.720 --> 1:23:44.480
 about a human.

1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:47.000
 Because we're all, there's a lot of similarities,

1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:48.320
 a lot of it rhymes.

1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:49.880
 So you start to make a lot of inferences

1:23:49.880 --> 1:23:52.440
 and you build up this model of a person.

1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:54.440
 You have a pretty sophisticated model

1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:57.160
 what's going on underneath.

1:23:57.160 --> 1:24:00.560
 Again, I wonder if it's possible

1:24:00.560 --> 1:24:02.480
 to construct these models about each other

1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:04.920
 and nevertheless be very distant

1:24:04.920 --> 1:24:07.120
 from an underlying reality.

1:24:08.440 --> 1:24:09.880
 The sinking. Yeah, there's a lot of work on this.

1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:12.040
 So there's some interesting work called signaling games

1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:15.400
 where they look at how people can coordinate

1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:19.080
 and come to communicate.

1:24:19.080 --> 1:24:20.560
 There's some interesting work

1:24:20.560 --> 1:24:23.160
 that was done by some colleagues and friends of mine,

1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:28.360
 Lewis Naran's, Natalia Comorova and Kimberly Jamison,

1:24:28.360 --> 1:24:30.280
 where they were looking at

1:24:30.280 --> 1:24:33.800
 evolving color words.

1:24:33.800 --> 1:24:36.240
 So you have a circle of colors,

1:24:36.240 --> 1:24:37.800
 so the color circle.

1:24:37.800 --> 1:24:41.640
 And they wanted to see if they could get people to cooperate

1:24:41.640 --> 1:24:44.920
 and how they carved the color circle up into units of words.

1:24:45.920 --> 1:24:48.800
 And so they had a game,

1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:50.720
 theoretic kind of thing that they'd had people do.

1:24:50.720 --> 1:24:52.960
 And what they found was that when they included,

1:24:52.960 --> 1:24:54.960
 so most people are trichromats,

1:24:54.960 --> 1:24:57.960
 you have three kinds of cone photoreceptors,

1:24:57.960 --> 1:25:01.440
 but there are some, a lot of men, 7% of men have are dichromats.

1:25:01.440 --> 1:25:04.400
 They might be missing the red cone photoreceptor.

1:25:04.400 --> 1:25:09.000
 They found that the dichromats had an outsized influence

1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:12.600
 on the final ways that the whole space of colors

1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:14.920
 was carved up and labels attached.

1:25:14.920 --> 1:25:17.920
 You needed to be able to include the dichromats

1:25:17.920 --> 1:25:18.880
 in the conversation.

1:25:18.880 --> 1:25:20.160
 And so they had a bigger influence

1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:23.040
 on how you made the boundaries of the language.

1:25:23.040 --> 1:25:25.720
 And I thought that was a really interesting kind of insight

1:25:25.720 --> 1:25:28.560
 that there's going to be, again, a game, perhaps a game

1:25:28.560 --> 1:25:31.880
 or evolutionary or genetic algorithm kind of thing

1:25:31.880 --> 1:25:35.160
 that goes on in terms of learning to communicate

1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:37.920
 in ways that are useful.

1:25:37.920 --> 1:25:40.000
 And so yeah, you can use game theory

1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.640
 to actually explore that or signaling games.

1:25:42.640 --> 1:25:44.760
 There's a lot of brilliant work on that.

1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:47.640
 I'm not doing it, but there's work out there.

1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:50.840
 So if it's okay, let us tackle once more

1:25:50.840 --> 1:25:52.680
 and perhaps several more times

1:25:52.680 --> 1:25:55.640
 after the big topic of consciousness.

1:25:55.640 --> 1:25:56.920
 Okay.

1:25:56.920 --> 1:25:59.560
 This very beautiful, powerful things

1:25:59.560 --> 1:26:01.960
 that perhaps is the thing that makes us human.

1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:03.120
 What is it?

1:26:03.120 --> 1:26:06.160
 What's the role of consciousness in,

1:26:06.160 --> 1:26:08.160
 let's say even just the thing we've been talking about,

1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:10.320
 which is the formation of this interface,

1:26:12.360 --> 1:26:17.360
 any kind of ways you want to kind of start talking about it.

1:26:18.480 --> 1:26:21.440
 Well, let me say first what most of my colleagues say.

1:26:21.440 --> 1:26:26.440
 99% are again, assuming that space time is fundamental.

1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:30.880
 Particles and space time matter is fundamental.

1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:32.520
 And most are reductionist.

1:26:33.760 --> 1:26:37.120
 And so the standard approach to consciousness

1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:42.120
 is to figure out what complicated systems of matter

1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:45.960
 with the right functional properties

1:26:45.960 --> 1:26:48.560
 could possibly lead to the emergence of consciousness.

1:26:48.560 --> 1:26:51.440
 That's the general idea, right?

1:26:51.440 --> 1:26:53.920
 So maybe you have to have neurons.

1:26:53.920 --> 1:26:56.920
 Maybe only if you have neurons,

1:26:56.920 --> 1:26:58.640
 but that might not be enough.

1:26:58.640 --> 1:27:00.400
 They have to certain kinds of complexity

1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:02.840
 in their organization and their dynamics,

1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:05.240
 certain kind of network abilities, for example.

1:27:06.640 --> 1:27:10.760
 So there are those who say, for example,

1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:14.680
 that consciousness arises from orchestrated collapse

1:27:14.680 --> 1:27:18.280
 of quantum states of microtubules and neurons.

1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:21.280
 So this is a hemorrhagic hemorrhage,

1:27:21.280 --> 1:27:22.440
 have this kind of.

1:27:22.440 --> 1:27:25.440
 So you start with something physical,

1:27:25.440 --> 1:27:28.560
 a property of quantum states of neurons,

1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:32.160
 of microtubules and neurons,

1:27:32.160 --> 1:27:35.680
 and you say that somehow an orchestrated collapse of those

1:27:35.680 --> 1:27:38.720
 is consciousness or conscious experiences.

1:27:38.720 --> 1:27:40.480
 Or integrated information theory.

1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:42.560
 Again, you start with something physical,

1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:44.880
 and if it has the right kind of functional properties,

1:27:44.880 --> 1:27:46.280
 it's something they call fee,

1:27:46.280 --> 1:27:48.040
 with the right kind of integrated information,

1:27:48.040 --> 1:27:50.600
 then you have consciousness.

1:27:50.600 --> 1:27:53.720
 Or you can be a panpsychist,

1:27:53.720 --> 1:27:54.880
 Philip Goff, for example,

1:27:54.880 --> 1:27:57.280
 where you might say, well,

1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:01.320
 in addition to the particles in space and time,

1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:03.400
 those particles are not just matter,

1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:06.520
 they also could have, say, a unit of consciousness.

1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:08.280
 And so, but once again,

1:28:08.280 --> 1:28:11.200
 you're taking space and time and particles is fundamental,

1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:14.080
 and you're adding a new property to them,

1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:15.080
 see the consciousness,

1:28:15.080 --> 1:28:16.720
 and then you have to talk about how,

1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:19.560
 when a proton and a neutron,

1:28:19.560 --> 1:28:21.840
 where a proton and electron get together to form hydrogen,

1:28:21.840 --> 1:28:25.160
 then how those consciousnesses merge to,

1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:28.400
 or interact to create the consciousness of hydrogen,

1:28:28.400 --> 1:28:29.240
 and so forth.

1:28:30.280 --> 1:28:31.520
 There's a tension schema theory,

1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:35.800
 which again, this is how neural network processes,

1:28:35.800 --> 1:28:38.320
 representing to the network itself,

1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:40.000
 its attentional processes,

1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:41.800
 that could be consciousness.

1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.320
 There's global workspace theory,

1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:48.400
 and neuronal global workspace theory.

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:50.440
 So there's many, many theories of this type.

1:28:50.440 --> 1:28:52.800
 What's common to all of them,

1:28:52.800 --> 1:28:55.280
 is they assume that space time is fundamental.

1:28:56.240 --> 1:28:57.920
 They assume that physical processes

1:28:57.920 --> 1:28:59.640
 and space time is fundamental.

1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:02.560
 Panpsychism adds consciousness as an additional thing,

1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:04.640
 it's almost dualist in that regard.

1:29:05.960 --> 1:29:10.960
 And my attitude is, our best science is telling us,

1:29:11.240 --> 1:29:13.320
 that space time is not fundamental.

1:29:13.320 --> 1:29:17.120
 So, why is that important here?

1:29:17.120 --> 1:29:18.680
 Well, for centuries,

1:29:19.960 --> 1:29:24.440
 deep thinkers thought of earth, air, fire, and water

1:29:24.440 --> 1:29:26.280
 as the fundamental elements.

1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:28.600
 It was a reductionist kind of idea.

1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:30.120
 Nothing was more elemental than those,

1:29:30.120 --> 1:29:33.520
 and you could sort of build everything up from those.

1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:36.240
 When we got the periodic table of elements,

1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:40.040
 we realized that, of course,

1:29:40.040 --> 1:29:42.080
 we want to study earth, air, fire, and water.

1:29:42.080 --> 1:29:44.120
 There's combustion science for fire,

1:29:44.120 --> 1:29:49.040
 there's sciences for all these other things,

1:29:49.040 --> 1:29:50.360
 water and so forth.

1:29:50.360 --> 1:29:51.960
 So we're gonna do science for these things,

1:29:51.960 --> 1:29:54.240
 but fundamental, no, no.

1:29:54.240 --> 1:29:56.240
 If you're looking for something fundamental,

1:29:56.240 --> 1:29:58.520
 those are the wrong building blocks.

1:29:58.520 --> 1:30:02.200
 Earth has many, many different kinds of elements

1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:04.680
 that project into the one thing that we call earth.

1:30:04.680 --> 1:30:06.840
 If you don't understand that there's silicon,

1:30:06.840 --> 1:30:07.680
 that there's iron,

1:30:07.680 --> 1:30:09.040
 that there's all these different kinds of things

1:30:09.040 --> 1:30:11.280
 that project into what we call earth,

1:30:11.280 --> 1:30:14.680
 you're hopelessly lost.

1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:17.000
 You're not fundamental, you're not gonna get there.

1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.800
 And then after the periodic table,

1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:22.240
 then we came up with quarks, leptons, and gluons,

1:30:22.240 --> 1:30:26.480
 the particles of the standard model of physics.

1:30:26.480 --> 1:30:29.200
 And so we actually now know that

1:30:29.200 --> 1:30:31.080
 if you really want to get fundamental,

1:30:33.360 --> 1:30:34.640
 the periodic table isn't it.

1:30:34.640 --> 1:30:35.640
 It's good for chemistry,

1:30:35.640 --> 1:30:37.200
 and it's just wonderful for chemistry,

1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:39.800
 but if you're trying to go deep, fundamental,

1:30:39.800 --> 1:30:41.960
 what is the fundamental science, that's not it.

1:30:41.960 --> 1:30:44.080
 You're gonna have to go to quarks,

1:30:44.080 --> 1:30:46.080
 leptons, and gluons, and so forth.

1:30:46.080 --> 1:30:51.080
 Well, now we've discovered space time itself is doomed.

1:30:51.600 --> 1:30:53.000
 Quarks, leptons, and gluons

1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:54.920
 are just irreducible representations

1:30:54.920 --> 1:30:56.560
 of the symmetries of space time.

1:30:57.520 --> 1:31:00.320
 So the whole framework

1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:03.880
 on which consciousness research is being based right now

1:31:03.880 --> 1:31:05.480
 is doomed.

1:31:05.480 --> 1:31:09.200
 And for me, these are my friends and colleagues

1:31:09.200 --> 1:31:11.000
 that are doing this, they're brilliant.

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:12.920
 They're absolute, they're brilliant.

1:31:14.120 --> 1:31:17.720
 My feeling is I'm so sad

1:31:19.240 --> 1:31:21.760
 that they're stuck with this old framework

1:31:21.760 --> 1:31:24.040
 because if they weren't stuck,

1:31:24.040 --> 1:31:25.880
 like with earth, air, fire, and water,

1:31:25.880 --> 1:31:27.160
 you could actually make progress.

1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:28.720
 So it doesn't matter how smart you are.

1:31:28.720 --> 1:31:30.240
 If you start with earth, air, fire, and water,

1:31:30.240 --> 1:31:32.000
 you're not gonna get anywhere, right?

1:31:32.000 --> 1:31:33.840
 Can I actually just,

1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:36.040
 because the word doomed is so interesting,

1:31:36.040 --> 1:31:39.240
 let me give you some options, multiple choice quiz.

1:31:40.440 --> 1:31:43.200
 Is space time, we could say is reality,

1:31:43.200 --> 1:31:46.480
 the way we perceive it, doomed,

1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:54.160
 wrong, or fake?

1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:59.160
 Because doomed just means it could still be right,

1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:01.860
 and we're now ready to go deeper.

1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:03.840
 It would be that.

1:32:03.840 --> 1:32:08.320
 So it's not wrong, it's not a complete deviation

1:32:08.320 --> 1:32:10.600
 from a journey toward the truth.

1:32:10.600 --> 1:32:13.840
 Right, it's like earth, air, fire, and water is not wrong.

1:32:13.840 --> 1:32:15.720
 There is earth, air, fire, and water.

1:32:15.720 --> 1:32:19.040
 That's a useful framework, but it's not fundamental.

1:32:19.040 --> 1:32:20.800
 Right, well, there's also wrong,

1:32:20.800 --> 1:32:24.440
 which is they used to believe, as I recently learned,

1:32:24.440 --> 1:32:27.080
 that George Washington was the president,

1:32:27.080 --> 1:32:30.920
 the first president in the United States was blood to death

1:32:30.920 --> 1:32:34.040
 for something that could have been easily treated,

1:32:34.040 --> 1:32:36.400
 because it was believed that you can get,

1:32:36.400 --> 1:32:38.120
 actually, I need to look into this further,

1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:40.800
 but I guess you get toxins out or demons out.

1:32:40.800 --> 1:32:41.840
 I don't know what you're getting out

1:32:41.840 --> 1:32:43.560
 with the bleeding of a person.

1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:47.140
 But so that ended up being wrong,

1:32:47.140 --> 1:32:50.760
 but widely believed as a medical tool.

1:32:50.760 --> 1:32:55.760
 So it's also possible that our assumption of space time

1:32:55.920 --> 1:32:58.920
 is not just doomed, but it's wrong.

1:32:58.920 --> 1:33:02.200
 Well, if we believe that it's fundamental, that's wrong.

1:33:02.200 --> 1:33:05.320
 But if we believe it's a useful tool, that's right.

1:33:05.320 --> 1:33:08.120
 But bleeding somebody to death

1:33:08.120 --> 1:33:10.120
 was believed to be a useful tool.

1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:11.120
 And that was wrong.

1:33:11.120 --> 1:33:13.840
 It wasn't just not fundamental.

1:33:13.840 --> 1:33:17.240
 It was very, I'm sure there's cases

1:33:17.240 --> 1:33:19.020
 in which bleeding somebody would work,

1:33:19.020 --> 1:33:23.520
 but it would be a very tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of cases.

1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:25.840
 So it could be that it's wrong,

1:33:25.840 --> 1:33:30.520
 like it's a side road that's ultimately leading to a dead end

1:33:30.520 --> 1:33:32.600
 as opposed to a truck stop or something

1:33:32.600 --> 1:33:34.720
 that you can get off of.

1:33:34.720 --> 1:33:37.320
 My feeling is not the dead end kind of thing.

1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:39.480
 I think that what the physicists are finding

1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:41.700
 is that there are these structures beyond space time,

1:33:41.700 --> 1:33:44.280
 but they project back into space time.

1:33:44.280 --> 1:33:48.240
 And so space time, when they say space time is doomed,

1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:49.920
 they're explicit, they're saying it's doomed

1:33:49.920 --> 1:33:51.760
 in the sense that we thought it was fundamental.

1:33:51.760 --> 1:33:53.200
 It's not fundamental.

1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:57.440
 It's a useful, absolutely useful and brilliant data structure,

1:33:57.440 --> 1:33:59.480
 but there are deeper data structures

1:33:59.480 --> 1:34:01.440
 like cosmological polytope.

1:34:01.440 --> 1:34:03.960
 And space time is not fundamental.

1:34:03.960 --> 1:34:08.960
 What is doomed in the sense that it's wrong is reductionism.

1:34:10.560 --> 1:34:13.480
 Which is saying space time is fundamental.

1:34:13.480 --> 1:34:14.920
 Essentially. Right, right.

1:34:14.920 --> 1:34:19.920
 The idea that somehow being smaller in space and time,

1:34:19.920 --> 1:34:23.960
 or space time is a fundamental nature of reality,

1:34:23.960 --> 1:34:26.200
 that's just wrong.

1:34:26.200 --> 1:34:28.240
 It turned out to be a useful heuristic

1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:29.920
 for thermodynamics and so forth.

1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:31.320
 And in several other places,

1:34:31.320 --> 1:34:33.240
 reductionism has been very useful.

1:34:33.240 --> 1:34:35.400
 But that's in some sense,

1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:38.160
 an artifact of how we use our interface.

1:34:39.440 --> 1:34:41.640
 Yeah, so you're saying size doesn't matter.

1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:43.480
 Okay, this is very important for me.

1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:44.560
 Ultimately.

1:34:44.560 --> 1:34:45.400
 Ultimately.

1:34:45.400 --> 1:34:46.240
 Ultimately, right.

1:34:46.240 --> 1:34:49.800
 I mean, it's useful for theories like thermodynamics

1:34:49.800 --> 1:34:51.520
 and also for understanding brain networks

1:34:51.520 --> 1:34:54.000
 in terms of individual neurons

1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:58.560
 and neurons in terms of chemical systems inside cells.

1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:00.360
 That's all very, very useful.

1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:02.440
 But the idea that we're getting

1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:05.920
 to the more fundamental nature of reality, no.

1:35:05.920 --> 1:35:08.280
 When you get all the way down in that direction,

1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:10.000
 you get down to the quarks and gluons.

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.880
 And what you realize is what you've gotten down to

1:35:11.880 --> 1:35:13.320
 is not fundamental reality,

1:35:13.320 --> 1:35:16.440
 just the irreducible representations of a data structure.

1:35:16.440 --> 1:35:17.840
 That's all you've gotten down to.

1:35:17.840 --> 1:35:21.680
 So you're always stuck inside the data structure.

1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:23.520
 So you seem to be getting closer and closer.

1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:25.640
 I went from neural networks to neurons,

1:35:25.640 --> 1:35:27.720
 to neurons to chemistry, chemistry to particles,

1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:30.040
 particles to quarks and gluons.

1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:31.560
 I'm getting closer and closer to the real,

1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:32.880
 no, I'm getting closer and closer

1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:35.840
 to the actual structure of the data structure

1:35:35.840 --> 1:35:38.280
 of space and time, the irreducible representations.

1:35:38.280 --> 1:35:39.720
 That's what you're getting closer to,

1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:43.200
 not to a deeper understanding of what's beyond space time.

1:35:43.200 --> 1:35:45.040
 We'll also refer,

1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:48.080
 we'll return again to this question of dynamics,

1:35:48.080 --> 1:35:51.880
 because you keep saying that space time is doomed,

1:35:51.880 --> 1:35:54.480
 but mostly focusing on the space part of that.

1:35:54.480 --> 1:35:59.040
 It's very interesting to see why time gets the bad cred too,

1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:01.080
 because how do you have dynamics without time

1:36:01.080 --> 1:36:02.960
 is the thing I'd love to talk to you a little bit about.

1:36:02.960 --> 1:36:07.960
 But let us return your brilliant whirlwind overview

1:36:09.440 --> 1:36:11.480
 of the different theories of consciousness

1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:12.520
 that are out there.

1:36:12.520 --> 1:36:17.520
 What is consciousness if outside of space time?

1:36:18.760 --> 1:36:20.840
 If we think that we want to have a model of consciousness,

1:36:20.840 --> 1:36:23.960
 we as scientists then have to say,

1:36:23.960 --> 1:36:25.120
 what do we want to write down?

1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:26.960
 What kind of mathematical modeling

1:36:26.960 --> 1:36:28.680
 are we gonna write down, right?

1:36:28.680 --> 1:36:29.520
 And if you think about it,

1:36:29.520 --> 1:36:31.080
 there's lots of things that you might want to write down

1:36:31.080 --> 1:36:32.200
 about consciousness,

1:36:32.200 --> 1:36:34.080
 for only a complicated subject.

1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:36.880
 So most of my colleagues are saying,

1:36:36.880 --> 1:36:38.360
 let's start with matter or neurons

1:36:38.360 --> 1:36:42.480
 and say what properties of matter could create consciousness.

1:36:42.480 --> 1:36:45.160
 But I'm saying that that whole thing is out.

1:36:45.160 --> 1:36:47.720
 Space time is doomed, that whole thing is out.

1:36:47.720 --> 1:36:51.400
 We need to look at consciousness, qua consciousness.

1:36:51.400 --> 1:36:52.240
 In other words,

1:36:52.240 --> 1:36:54.480
 not as something that arises in space and time,

1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:56.160
 but perhaps as something that creates space and time

1:36:56.160 --> 1:36:57.080
 as a data structure.

1:36:58.240 --> 1:36:59.400
 So what do we want?

1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:02.000
 And here again, there's no hard and fast rule,

1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.800
 but what you as a scientist have to do is to pick

1:37:05.720 --> 1:37:09.720
 what you think are the minimal assumptions

1:37:09.720 --> 1:37:13.720
 that are gonna allow you to boot up a comprehensive theory.

1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:15.120
 That is the trick.

1:37:16.400 --> 1:37:17.360
 So what do I want?

1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:20.760
 So what I chose to do was to have three things.

1:37:23.040 --> 1:37:25.120
 I said that there are conscious experiences,

1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:28.920
 feeling of headache, the smell of garlic,

1:37:30.800 --> 1:37:32.200
 experiencing the color red.

1:37:32.200 --> 1:37:33.600
 There are, those are conscious.

1:37:33.600 --> 1:37:34.880
 So that's a primitive of a theory.

1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:36.800
 And the reason I want few primitives, why?

1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:38.760
 Because those are the miracles of the theory, right?

1:37:38.760 --> 1:37:40.720
 The primitives, the assumptions of the theory

1:37:40.720 --> 1:37:42.360
 are the things you're not going to explain.

1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:43.960
 Those are the things you assume.

1:37:43.960 --> 1:37:47.240
 And those experiences you particularly mean,

1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:49.600
 there's a subjectiveness to them.

1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:51.640
 That's the thing when people refer

1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:54.000
 to the hard problem of consciousness,

1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:58.160
 is it feels like something to look at the color red, okay?

1:37:58.160 --> 1:37:59.000
 Exactly right.

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.360
 It feels like something to have a headache

1:38:00.360 --> 1:38:02.720
 or to feel upset to your stomach.

1:38:02.720 --> 1:38:04.480
 It feels like something.

1:38:04.480 --> 1:38:09.480
 And so I'm going to grant that in this theory,

1:38:09.560 --> 1:38:11.520
 there are experiences and they're fundamental

1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:12.480
 in some sense.

1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:13.840
 So conscious experience.

1:38:13.840 --> 1:38:15.720
 So they're not derived from physics.

1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:18.800
 They're not functional properties of particles.

1:38:18.800 --> 1:38:20.200
 They are pseudo generous.

1:38:20.200 --> 1:38:21.800
 There, they exist.

1:38:21.800 --> 1:38:23.760
 Just like we assume space time exists.

1:38:23.760 --> 1:38:26.320
 I'm now saying space time is just a data structure.

1:38:26.320 --> 1:38:29.480
 It doesn't exist independent of conscious experiences.

1:38:29.480 --> 1:38:30.760
 Sorry to interrupt once again,

1:38:30.760 --> 1:38:33.280
 but should we be focusing in your thinking

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:34.480
 on humans alone?

1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:40.600
 Or is there something about in relation

1:38:40.600 --> 1:38:42.160
 to other kinds of organisms

1:38:42.160 --> 1:38:44.600
 that have a sufficiently high level of complexity?

1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:48.600
 Or even, or is there some kind of generalization

1:38:50.280 --> 1:38:52.040
 of the panpsychist idea

1:38:52.040 --> 1:38:55.720
 that all consciousness permeates all matter

1:38:55.720 --> 1:38:58.680
 outside of the usual definition

1:38:58.680 --> 1:39:01.200
 of what matter is inside space time?

1:39:01.200 --> 1:39:04.280
 So it's beyond human consciousness.

1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:06.360
 Human consciousness, from my point of view,

1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:10.480
 would be one of a countless variety of consciousnesses.

1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:12.080
 And even within human consciousness,

1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:15.120
 there's a countless variety of consciousnesses within us,

1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:15.960
 right?

1:39:15.960 --> 1:39:18.400
 I mean, you have your left and right hemisphere.

1:39:18.400 --> 1:39:20.680
 And apparently if you split the corpus callosum,

1:39:20.680 --> 1:39:22.760
 the personality of the left hemisphere

1:39:22.760 --> 1:39:24.320
 and the religious beliefs of the left hemisphere

1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:26.360
 can be very different from the right hemisphere.

1:39:26.360 --> 1:39:30.640
 And their conscious experiences can be disjoint.

1:39:30.640 --> 1:39:32.480
 One could have one conscious experience.

1:39:32.480 --> 1:39:33.880
 They can play 20 questions.

1:39:33.880 --> 1:39:35.840
 The left hemisphere can have an idea in its mind

1:39:35.840 --> 1:39:37.360
 and the right hemisphere has to guess

1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:38.880
 and it might not get it.

1:39:38.880 --> 1:39:40.640
 So even within you,

1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:43.040
 there is more than just one consciousness.

1:39:43.040 --> 1:39:45.200
 It's lots of consciousnesses.

1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:48.680
 So the general theory of consciousness that I'm after

1:39:48.680 --> 1:39:50.360
 is not just human consciousness.

1:39:50.360 --> 1:39:51.880
 It's going to be just consciousness.

1:39:51.880 --> 1:39:56.880
 And I presume human consciousness is a tiny drop in the bucket

1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:59.280
 of the infinite variety of consciousnesses.

1:39:59.280 --> 1:40:01.120
 That said, I should clarify

1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:06.120
 that the black hole of consciousness is the home cat.

1:40:07.360 --> 1:40:11.800
 I'm pretty sure cat's lack is the embodiment of evil

1:40:11.800 --> 1:40:15.960
 and lack all capacity for consciousness or compassion.

1:40:15.960 --> 1:40:17.000
 So I just want to lay that out until,

1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:17.920
 but that's the theory I'm working.

1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:21.840
 I don't have any good evidence, but it's just a shout out.

1:40:23.440 --> 1:40:24.280
 Sorry to distract.

1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:25.680
 So that's the first assumption.

1:40:25.680 --> 1:40:27.160
 The first assumption, that's right.

1:40:27.160 --> 1:40:29.920
 The second assumption is that these experiences

1:40:29.920 --> 1:40:31.640
 have consequences.

1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:35.000
 So I'm going to say that conscious experiences

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.240
 can trigger other conscious experiences somehow.

1:40:38.320 --> 1:40:43.320
 So really in some sense, there's two basic assumptions.

1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:46.160
 There's some kind of causality.

1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:47.760
 Is there is a chain of causality?

1:40:47.760 --> 1:40:50.280
 Does it relate to dynamics?

1:40:50.280 --> 1:40:52.480
 I'll say there's a probabilistic relationship.

1:40:52.480 --> 1:40:53.520
 Okay.

1:40:53.520 --> 1:40:58.520
 And then, so I'm trying to be as nonspecific to begin with

1:40:58.840 --> 1:41:01.040
 and see where it leads me.

1:41:01.040 --> 1:41:03.960
 So what I can write down are probability spaces.

1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:05.080
 So a probability space,

1:41:05.080 --> 1:41:08.160
 which contains the conscious experiences

1:41:08.160 --> 1:41:09.520
 that this consciousness can have.

1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:14.520
 So I call this a conscious agent, this technical thing.

1:41:15.920 --> 1:41:19.280
 I, Annika Harris and I have talked about this

1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:22.880
 and she rightly cautions me that people will think

1:41:22.880 --> 1:41:25.080
 that I'm bringing in a notion of a self or agency

1:41:25.080 --> 1:41:27.440
 and so forth when I say conscious agent.

1:41:27.440 --> 1:41:30.000
 So I just want to say that I use the term conscious agent

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.280
 merely as a technical term.

1:41:32.280 --> 1:41:34.200
 There is no notion of self

1:41:34.200 --> 1:41:36.640
 in my fundamental definition of a conscious agent.

1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:38.800
 There are only experiences

1:41:38.800 --> 1:41:40.760
 and probabilistic relationships

1:41:40.760 --> 1:41:43.000
 that of how they trigger other experiences.

1:41:43.000 --> 1:41:46.280
 So the agent is the generator of the conscious experience?

1:41:46.280 --> 1:41:49.560
 The agent is a mathematical structure

1:41:49.560 --> 1:41:51.920
 that includes a probability measure,

1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:56.040
 a probability space of a possible conscious experiences

1:41:56.040 --> 1:41:58.240
 and a Markovian kernel,

1:41:58.240 --> 1:42:01.080
 which describes how if this agent

1:42:01.080 --> 1:42:02.800
 has certain conscious experiences,

1:42:02.800 --> 1:42:04.280
 how that will affect the experiences

1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:07.520
 of other conscious agents, including itself.

1:42:07.520 --> 1:42:09.920
 But you don't think of that as a self?

1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:13.720
 No, there is no notion of a self here.

1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:16.560
 There's no notion of really of an agent.

1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:19.120
 But is there a locality?

1:42:20.320 --> 1:42:21.640
 Is there an organism?

1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:22.920
 There's no.

1:42:22.920 --> 1:42:27.920
 So these are conscious units, conscious entities.

1:42:28.320 --> 1:42:30.520
 But they're distinct in some way

1:42:30.520 --> 1:42:32.200
 because they have to interact.

1:42:32.200 --> 1:42:33.680
 Well, so here's the interesting thing.

1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:36.120
 When we write down the mathematics,

1:42:36.120 --> 1:42:39.360
 when you have two of these conscious agents interacting,

1:42:39.360 --> 1:42:43.720
 the pair satisfy a definition of a conscious agent.

1:42:43.720 --> 1:42:46.200
 So they are a single conscious agent.

1:42:46.200 --> 1:42:48.520
 So there is one conscious agent.

1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:52.360
 But it has a nice analytic decomposition

1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:53.880
 into as many conscious agents as you would.

1:42:53.880 --> 1:42:55.520
 So that's a nice interface.

1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:58.720
 It's a very useful scientific interface.

1:42:58.720 --> 1:43:03.200
 It's a scale free, or if you like a fractal like approach

1:43:03.200 --> 1:43:06.320
 to it in which we can use the same unit of analysis

1:43:06.320 --> 1:43:09.760
 at all scales in studying consciousness.

1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:12.200
 But if I want to talk about,

1:43:12.200 --> 1:43:16.040
 so there's no notion of learning, memory,

1:43:16.040 --> 1:43:20.800
 problem solving, intelligence, self, agency.

1:43:20.800 --> 1:43:22.320
 So none of that is fundamental.

1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:26.360
 So, and the reason I did that was

1:43:26.360 --> 1:43:29.880
 because I want to assume as little as possible.

1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:32.160
 Everything I assume is a miracle in the theory.

1:43:32.160 --> 1:43:34.520
 It's not something you explain, it's something you assume.

1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:37.440
 So I have to build networks of conscious agents.

1:43:38.800 --> 1:43:41.520
 If I want to have a notion of a self, I have to build a self.

1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:43.920
 I have to build learning, memory, problem solving,

1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:46.720
 intelligence, and planning, all these different things.

1:43:46.720 --> 1:43:49.480
 I have to build networks of conscious agents to do that.

1:43:49.480 --> 1:43:52.400
 It's a trivial theorem that networks of conscious agents

1:43:52.400 --> 1:43:54.680
 are computationally universal, that's trivial.

1:43:54.680 --> 1:43:56.800
 So anything that we can do with neural networks

1:43:56.800 --> 1:44:00.480
 or automata, you can do with networks of conscious agents.

1:44:00.480 --> 1:44:01.320
 That's trivial.

1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:04.920
 But you can also do more.

1:44:04.920 --> 1:44:08.840
 The events in the probability space need not be computable.

1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:13.920
 So the Markovian dynamics is not restricted to computable

1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:16.360
 functions because the very events themselves

1:44:16.360 --> 1:44:17.880
 need not be computable.

1:44:17.880 --> 1:44:21.200
 So this can capture any computable theory.

1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:22.600
 Anything we can do with neural networks,

1:44:22.600 --> 1:44:25.280
 we can do with conscious agent networks.

1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:28.120
 But it leaves open the door for the possibility

1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:32.520
 of noncomputable interactions between conscious agents.

1:44:32.520 --> 1:44:37.520
 So if we want a theory of memory, we have to build it.

1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:39.600
 And there's lots of different ways you could build.

1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:40.600
 We've actually got a paper.

1:44:40.600 --> 1:44:42.200
 Chris Fields took the lead on this,

1:44:42.200 --> 1:44:45.200
 and we have a paper called Conscious Agent Networks

1:44:45.200 --> 1:44:47.080
 where Chris takes the lead and shows

1:44:47.080 --> 1:44:49.000
 how to use these networks of conscious agents

1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:52.760
 to build memory and to build primitive kinds of learning.

1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:56.720
 But can you provide some intuition

1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:01.720
 of what conscious networks of conscious agents

1:45:02.520 --> 1:45:05.760
 helps you, first of all, what that looks like.

1:45:05.760 --> 1:45:08.960
 And I don't just mean mathematically,

1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:11.600
 of course, maybe that might help build up intuition,

1:45:11.600 --> 1:45:14.000
 but that helps us potentially solve

1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:15.640
 the hard problem of consciousness.

1:45:17.680 --> 1:45:21.640
 Or is that baked in, that that exists?

1:45:24.240 --> 1:45:27.120
 Can you solve the hard problem of consciousness?

1:45:27.120 --> 1:45:30.360
 Why it tastes delicious when you eat a delicious ice cream

1:45:31.640 --> 1:45:33.880
 with networks of conscious agents?

1:45:33.880 --> 1:45:36.040
 Or is that taken as an assumption?

1:45:36.040 --> 1:45:40.080
 So the standard way the hard problem is thought of

1:45:40.080 --> 1:45:44.600
 is we're assuming space and time in particles,

1:45:44.600 --> 1:45:46.000
 or neurons, for example.

1:45:47.120 --> 1:45:49.960
 These are just physical things that have no consciousness.

1:45:49.960 --> 1:45:51.760
 And we have to explain how the conscious experience

1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:54.920
 of the taste of chocolate could emerge from those.

1:45:54.920 --> 1:45:57.080
 So the spherical hard problem of consciousness

1:45:57.080 --> 1:45:58.720
 is that problem, right?

1:45:58.720 --> 1:46:02.040
 How do you boot up the taste of chocolate,

1:46:02.040 --> 1:46:03.920
 the experience of the taste of chocolate,

1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:07.600
 from neurons, say, or the right kind

1:46:07.600 --> 1:46:10.560
 of artificial intelligence circuitry?

1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:11.400
 How do you boot that up?

1:46:11.400 --> 1:46:13.800
 That's typically what the hard problem

1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:15.800
 of consciousness means to researchers.

1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:18.360
 Notice that I'm changing the problem.

1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:21.360
 I'm not trying to boot up conscious experiences

1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:23.800
 from the dynamics of neurons or silicon

1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:25.040
 or something like that.

1:46:25.040 --> 1:46:27.840
 I'm saying that that's the wrong problem.

1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:29.920
 My hard problem would go in the other direction.

1:46:29.920 --> 1:46:33.480
 If I start with conscious experiences,

1:46:33.480 --> 1:46:35.640
 how do I build up space and time?

1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:37.560
 How do I build up what I call the physical world?

1:46:37.560 --> 1:46:39.600
 How do I build up what we call brains?

1:46:40.560 --> 1:46:43.080
 Because I'm saying consciousness

1:46:43.080 --> 1:46:45.640
 is not something that brains do.

1:46:45.640 --> 1:46:48.080
 Brains are something that consciousness makes up.

1:46:49.440 --> 1:46:50.840
 It's among the experience,

1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:54.560
 it's an ephemeral experience in consciousness.

1:46:54.560 --> 1:46:57.040
 I look inside, so to be very, very clear,

1:46:57.040 --> 1:46:58.760
 right now I have no neurons.

1:46:58.760 --> 1:47:01.960
 If you looked, you would see neurons.

1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:04.240
 That's a data structure that you would create on the fly.

1:47:04.240 --> 1:47:05.400
 And it's a very useful one.

1:47:05.400 --> 1:47:07.280
 As soon as you look away,

1:47:07.280 --> 1:47:08.880
 you garbage collect that data structure,

1:47:08.880 --> 1:47:10.640
 just like that necr cube that I was talking about

1:47:10.640 --> 1:47:11.720
 on the piece of paper.

1:47:11.720 --> 1:47:14.320
 When you look, you see a 3D cube.

1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:16.160
 You create it on the fly.

1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:18.520
 As soon as you look away, that's gone.

1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:21.720
 When you say you, you mean a human being scientist.

1:47:21.720 --> 1:47:23.320
 Right now, that's right.

1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:25.800
 More generally, it'll be conscious agents

1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:27.160
 because as you pointed out,

1:47:27.160 --> 1:47:29.720
 in my asking for theory of consciousness,

1:47:29.720 --> 1:47:32.600
 only about humans, no, it's consciousness,

1:47:32.600 --> 1:47:36.600
 which human consciousness is just a tiny sliver.

1:47:36.600 --> 1:47:40.600
 But you are saying that there's a useful data structure.

1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:42.560
 How many other data structures are there?

1:47:42.560 --> 1:47:44.240
 That's why I said you human.

1:47:44.240 --> 1:47:46.000
 If there's another earth,

1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:48.400
 if there's another alien civilization

1:47:48.400 --> 1:47:50.400
 and doing these kinds of investigations,

1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:52.960
 would they come up with similar data structures?

1:47:52.960 --> 1:47:53.800
 Probably not.

1:47:53.800 --> 1:47:55.240
 What is the space of data structures,

1:47:55.240 --> 1:47:57.240
 I guess, is what I'm asking?

1:47:58.240 --> 1:48:02.240
 My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental,

1:48:02.240 --> 1:48:04.240
 if consciousness is all there is,

1:48:06.240 --> 1:48:09.240
 then the only thing that mathematical structure

1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:12.240
 can be about is possibilities of consciousness.

1:48:14.240 --> 1:48:16.240
 And that suggests to me

1:48:16.240 --> 1:48:19.240
 that there could be an infinite variety of consciousnesses

1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:24.240
 and a vanishingly small fraction of them,

1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:27.240
 use space time data structures

1:48:27.240 --> 1:48:29.240
 and the kinds of structures that we use.

1:48:29.240 --> 1:48:31.240
 There's an infinite variety of data structures.

1:48:31.240 --> 1:48:33.240
 Now, this is very similar to something

1:48:33.240 --> 1:48:35.240
 that Max Tegmark has said, but I want to distinguish it.

1:48:35.240 --> 1:48:40.240
 He has his level four multiverse idea.

1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:42.240
 He thinks that mathematics is fundamental.

1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:44.240
 And so that's the fundamental reality.

1:48:44.240 --> 1:48:46.240
 And since there's an infinite variety of,

1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:48.240
 endless variety of mathematical structures,

1:48:48.240 --> 1:48:51.240
 there's an infinite variety of multiverses in his view.

1:48:51.240 --> 1:48:54.240
 I'm saying something similar in spirit,

1:48:54.240 --> 1:48:56.240
 but importantly different.

1:48:56.240 --> 1:48:58.240
 There's an infinite variety of mathematical structures,

1:48:58.240 --> 1:49:00.240
 absolutely.

1:49:00.240 --> 1:49:02.240
 But mathematics isn't the fundamental reality

1:49:02.240 --> 1:49:04.240
 in this framework.

1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:08.240
 Consciousness is, and mathematics is to consciousness

1:49:08.240 --> 1:49:11.240
 like bones are to an organism.

1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:12.240
 You need the bones.

1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:15.240
 So mathematics is not divorced from consciousness,

1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:19.240
 but it's not the entirety of consciousness by any means.

1:49:19.240 --> 1:49:23.240
 And so there's an infinite variety of consciousnesses

1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:29.240
 and signaling games that consciousnesses could interact via.

1:49:29.240 --> 1:49:33.240
 And therefore, worlds, common worlds, data structures

1:49:33.240 --> 1:49:36.240
 that they can use to communicate.

1:49:36.240 --> 1:49:39.240
 So space and time is just one of an infinite variety.

1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:42.240
 And so I think that what we'll find

1:49:42.240 --> 1:49:46.240
 is that as we go outside of our little space time bubble,

1:49:46.240 --> 1:49:52.240
 we will encounter utterly alien forms of conscious experience

1:49:52.240 --> 1:49:58.240
 that we may not be able to really comprehend

1:49:58.240 --> 1:50:00.240
 in the following sense.

1:50:00.240 --> 1:50:05.240
 If I ask you to imagine a color that you've never seen before.

1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:07.240
 Does anything happen?

1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:09.240
 Nothing happens.

1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:11.240
 Nothing happens.

1:50:11.240 --> 1:50:13.240
 And that's just one color.

1:50:13.240 --> 1:50:15.240
 I'm asking for just a color.

1:50:15.240 --> 1:50:19.240
 We actually know, by the way, that apparently there are women

1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:24.240
 called tetrafemes who have four color receptors,

1:50:24.240 --> 1:50:26.240
 not just three.

1:50:26.240 --> 1:50:29.240
 And Kimberly Jamison and others who've studied these women

1:50:29.240 --> 1:50:31.240
 have good evidence that they apparently have

1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:34.240
 a new dimension of color experience

1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:36.240
 that the rest of us don't have.

1:50:36.240 --> 1:50:40.240
 So these women are apparently living in a world of color

1:50:40.240 --> 1:50:42.240
 that you and I can't even concretely imagine.

1:50:42.240 --> 1:50:44.240
 No man can imagine them.

1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:47.240
 And yet they're real color experiences.

1:50:47.240 --> 1:50:51.240
 And so in that sense, I'm saying now take that little baby step.

1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:53.240
 Oh, there are women who have color experiences

1:50:53.240 --> 1:50:54.240
 that I could never have.

1:50:54.240 --> 1:50:55.240
 Well, that's shocking.

1:50:55.240 --> 1:50:57.240
 Now take that infinite.

1:50:57.240 --> 1:51:02.240
 There are consciousnesses where every aspect of their experiences

1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:03.240
 is like that new color.

1:51:03.240 --> 1:51:05.240
 It's something utterly alien to you.

1:51:05.240 --> 1:51:07.240
 You have nothing like that.

1:51:07.240 --> 1:51:11.240
 And yet these are all possible varieties of conscious experience.

1:51:11.240 --> 1:51:14.240
 When you say there's a lot of consciousnesses,

1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:16.240
 it's a singular consciousness,

1:51:16.240 --> 1:51:20.240
 basically the set of possible experiences you can have

1:51:20.240 --> 1:51:22.240
 in that subjective way,

1:51:22.240 --> 1:51:26.240
 as opposed to the underlying mechanism.

1:51:26.240 --> 1:51:31.240
 Because you say that having an extra color receptor,

1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:34.240
 the ability to have new experiences,

1:51:34.240 --> 1:51:36.240
 that somehow a different consciousness,

1:51:36.240 --> 1:51:39.240
 is there a way to see that as all the same consciousness,

1:51:39.240 --> 1:51:41.240
 as the subjectivity itself?

1:51:41.240 --> 1:51:42.240
 Right.

1:51:42.240 --> 1:51:46.240
 Because when we have two of these conscious agents interacting,

1:51:46.240 --> 1:51:47.240
 the mathematics,

1:51:47.240 --> 1:51:49.240
 they actually satisfy the definition of a conscious agent.

1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:52.240
 So in fact, they are a single conscious agent.

1:51:52.240 --> 1:51:55.240
 So in fact, one way to think about what I'm saying,

1:51:55.240 --> 1:51:57.240
 I'm postulating with my colleagues,

1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:01.240
 Chaitanya and Chris and others, Robert Prettner and so forth.

1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:05.240
 There is one big conscious agent, infinitely complicated.

1:52:05.240 --> 1:52:08.240
 But fortunately, we can, for analytic purposes,

1:52:08.240 --> 1:52:10.240
 break it down all the way to,

1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:12.240
 in some sense, the simplest conscious agent,

1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:15.240
 which has one conscious experience, one.

1:52:15.240 --> 1:52:18.240
 This one agent can experience red 35.

1:52:18.240 --> 1:52:19.240
 That's it.

1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:20.240
 That's what it experiences.

1:52:20.240 --> 1:52:22.240
 You can get all the way down to that.

1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:27.240
 So you think it's possible that consciousness,

1:52:27.240 --> 1:52:30.240
 whatever that is,

1:52:30.240 --> 1:52:34.240
 is fundamental,

1:52:34.240 --> 1:52:37.240
 or at least much more in the direction of the fundamental

1:52:37.240 --> 1:52:40.240
 than is space time as we perceive it.

1:52:40.240 --> 1:52:42.240
 That's the proposal.

1:52:42.240 --> 1:52:47.240
 And therefore, what I have to do in terms of the heart problem of consciousness

1:52:47.240 --> 1:52:51.240
 is to show how dynamical systems of conscious agents

1:52:51.240 --> 1:52:56.240
 could lead to what we call space and time and neurons and brain activity.

1:52:56.240 --> 1:53:03.240
 In other words, we have to show how you get space time and physical objects

1:53:03.240 --> 1:53:07.240
 entirely from a theory of conscious agents outside of space time

1:53:07.240 --> 1:53:10.240
 with the dynamics outside of space time.

1:53:10.240 --> 1:53:15.240
 And I can tell you how we plan to do that, but that's the idea.

1:53:15.240 --> 1:53:16.240
 Okay.

1:53:16.240 --> 1:53:19.240
 The magic of it, the chocolate is delicious.

1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:23.240
 So there's a mathematical kind of thing that we could say here,

1:53:23.240 --> 1:53:27.240
 how it can emerge within the system of networks of conscious agents.

1:53:27.240 --> 1:53:37.240
 But is there going to be at the end of the proof why chocolate is so delicious or no?

1:53:37.240 --> 1:53:42.240
 I guess I'm going to ask different kinds of dumb questions to try to sneak up.

1:53:42.240 --> 1:53:43.240
 Sure.

1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:44.240
 Oh, well, that's the right question.

1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:47.240
 And when I say that I took conscious experiences as fundamental,

1:53:47.240 --> 1:53:51.240
 what that means is in the current version of my theory,

1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:55.240
 I'm not explaining conscious experiences where they came from.

1:53:55.240 --> 1:53:57.240
 That's the miracle.

1:53:57.240 --> 1:53:58.240
 That's one of the miracles.

1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:00.240
 So I have two miracles in my theory.

1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:06.240
 There are conscious experiences like the taste of chocolate and there's a probabilistic relationship.

1:54:06.240 --> 1:54:10.240
 When certain conscious experiences occur, others are more likely to occur.

1:54:10.240 --> 1:54:17.240
 Those are the two miracles that are possible to get beyond that

1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:22.240
 and somehow start to chip away at the miracleness of that miracle.

1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:24.240
 That chocolate is still delicious.

1:54:24.240 --> 1:54:25.240
 I hope so.

1:54:25.240 --> 1:54:27.240
 I've got my hands full with what I'm doing right now,

1:54:27.240 --> 1:54:32.240
 but I can just say at top level how I would think about that.

1:54:32.240 --> 1:54:40.240
 That would get at this consciousness without form.

1:54:40.240 --> 1:54:46.240
 This is really tough because it's consciousness without form

1:54:46.240 --> 1:54:53.240
 versus the various forms that consciousness takes for the experiences that it has.

1:54:53.240 --> 1:55:02.240
 So when I write down a probability space for these conscious experiences,

1:55:02.240 --> 1:55:06.240
 I say here's a probability space for the possible conscious experiences.

1:55:06.240 --> 1:55:09.240
 It's just like when I write down a probability space for an experiment.

1:55:09.240 --> 1:55:12.240
 I'm going to flip a coin twice.

1:55:12.240 --> 1:55:14.240
 I want to look at the probabilities of various outcomes.

1:55:14.240 --> 1:55:16.240
 So I have to write down a probability space.

1:55:16.240 --> 1:55:20.240
 There could be heads, heads, tails, tails, tails, tails, tails.

1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:25.240
 So as any class in probability, you're told write down your probability space.

1:55:25.240 --> 1:55:28.240
 If you don't write down your probability space, you can't get started.

1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:30.240
 So here's my probability space for consciousness.

1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:32.240
 How do I want to interpret that structure?

1:55:32.240 --> 1:55:34.240
 The structure is just sitting there.

1:55:34.240 --> 1:55:37.240
 There's going to be a dynamics that happens on it.

1:55:37.240 --> 1:55:39.240
 Experiences appear and then they disappear.

1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.240
 Just like heads appears and disappears.

1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:47.240
 So one way to think about that fundamental probability space

1:55:47.240 --> 1:55:52.240
 is that corresponds to consciousness without any content.

1:55:52.240 --> 1:55:58.240
 The infinite consciousness that transcends any particular content.

1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:02.240
 Well, do you think of that as a mechanism, as a thing,

1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:08.240
 like the rules that govern the dynamics of the thing outside of space time?

1:56:08.240 --> 1:56:12.240
 If you think consciousness is fundamental, isn't it essentially getting like,

1:56:12.240 --> 1:56:20.240
 it is solving the hard problem, which is like, from where does this thing pop up?

1:56:20.240 --> 1:56:23.240
 Which is the mechanism of the thing popping up.

1:56:23.240 --> 1:56:27.240
 Whatever the consciousness is, the different kinds and so on.

1:56:27.240 --> 1:56:29.240
 That mechanism.

1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:37.240
 And also the question I want to ask is how tricky do you think it is to solve that problem?

1:56:37.240 --> 1:56:42.240
 You've solved a lot of difficult problems throughout the history of humanity.

1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:52.240
 There's probably more problems to solve left than we've solved by like an infinity.

1:56:52.240 --> 1:56:57.240
 But along that long journey of intelligent species,

1:56:57.240 --> 1:57:00.240
 when will we solve this consciousness one?

1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:03.240
 Which is one way to measure the difficulty of the problem.

1:57:03.240 --> 1:57:08.240
 So I'll give two answers. There's one problem I think we can solve,

1:57:08.240 --> 1:57:09.240
 but we haven't solved yet.

1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:14.240
 And that is the reverse of what my colleagues call the hard problem.

1:57:14.240 --> 1:57:18.240
 The problem of how do you start with conscious experiences in the way that I've just described them

1:57:18.240 --> 1:57:22.240
 and the dynamics and build up space and time and brains.

1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:26.240
 That I think is a tough technical problem, but some principle solvable.

1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:27.240
 So I think we can solve that.

1:57:27.240 --> 1:57:31.240
 So we would solve the hard problem, not by showing how brains create consciousness,

1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:38.240
 but how networks of conscious agents create what we call the symbols that we call brains.

1:57:38.240 --> 1:57:41.240
 So that I think, but does that allow you to say,

1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:43.240
 that's interesting, that's an interesting idea.

1:57:43.240 --> 1:57:46.240
 Consciousness creates the brain, not the brain creates consciousness.

1:57:46.240 --> 1:57:49.240
 But does that allow you to build the thing?

1:57:49.240 --> 1:57:54.240
 My guess is that it will enable unbelievable technologies.

1:57:54.240 --> 1:57:55.240
 And I'll tell you why.

1:57:55.240 --> 1:57:58.240
 I think it plugs into the work that the physicists are doing.

1:57:58.240 --> 1:58:03.240
 So this theory of consciousness will be even deeper than the structures that the physicists are finding,

1:58:03.240 --> 1:58:05.240
 like the amplitude of a hedron.

1:58:05.240 --> 1:58:10.240
 But the other, but the other answer to your question is less positive.

1:58:10.240 --> 1:58:15.240
 As I said earlier, I think that there is no such thing as a theory of everything.

1:58:15.240 --> 1:58:21.240
 So that I think that my, the theory that my team is working on,

1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:26.240
 this conscious agent theory is just a 1.0 theory.

1:58:26.240 --> 1:58:29.240
 We're using probability of spaces and Mark Covey and Curls.

1:58:29.240 --> 1:58:34.240
 I can easily see people now saying, well, we can do better if we go to category theory.

1:58:34.240 --> 1:58:38.240
 And we can get a deeper, perhaps more interesting.

1:58:38.240 --> 1:58:41.240
 And then someone will say, well, now I'll go to topoi theory.

1:58:41.240 --> 1:58:50.240
 And then there'll be, so I imagine that there'll be, you know, conscious agents 5, 10, 3 trillion 0.0.

1:58:50.240 --> 1:58:51.240
 But I think it will never end.

1:58:51.240 --> 1:59:02.240
 I think ultimately this question that we sort of put our fingers on of how does the formless give birth to form,

1:59:02.240 --> 1:59:06.240
 to the taste, the wonderful taste of chocolate.

1:59:06.240 --> 1:59:12.240
 I think that we will always go deeper and deeper, but we will never solve that.

1:59:12.240 --> 1:59:14.240
 That in some sense, that will be a primitive.

1:59:14.240 --> 1:59:16.240
 I hope I'm wrong.

1:59:16.240 --> 1:59:22.240
 Maybe it's just the limits of my current imagination.

1:59:22.240 --> 1:59:28.240
 So I'll just say my imagination right now doesn't peer that deep.

1:59:28.240 --> 1:59:29.240
 Hopefully.

1:59:29.240 --> 1:59:37.240
 So I don't, by the way, I'm saying this, I don't want to discourage some brilliant 20 year old who then later on proves me dead wrong.

1:59:37.240 --> 1:59:39.240
 I hope to be proven dead wrong.

1:59:39.240 --> 1:59:45.240
 Just like you said, essentially from now, everything we're saying now, everything you're saying, all your theories will be laughing stock.

1:59:45.240 --> 1:59:54.240
 They will respect the puzzle solving abilities and how much we were able to do with so little.

1:59:54.240 --> 2:00:01.240
 But outside of that, it will all be just the silliness will be entertainment for a teenager.

2:00:01.240 --> 2:00:05.240
 Especially the silliness when we thought that we were so smart and we knew it all.

2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:10.240
 So it would be interesting to explore your ideas by contrasting.

2:00:10.240 --> 2:00:15.240
 You mentioned Annika, Annika Harris, you mentioned Philip Goff.

2:00:15.240 --> 2:00:24.240
 So outside of, if you're not allowed to say the fundamental disagreement is the fact that space time is fundamental.

2:00:24.240 --> 2:00:33.240
 What are interesting distinctions between ideas of consciousness between you and Annika, for example, you guys have, you've been on a podcast together.

2:00:33.240 --> 2:00:38.240
 I'm sure in private, you guys have some incredible conversations.

2:00:38.240 --> 2:00:44.240
 So where are some interesting sticking points, some interesting disagreements?

2:00:44.240 --> 2:00:47.240
 Let's say with Annika first, maybe there'll be a few other people.

2:00:47.240 --> 2:00:51.240
 Well, Annika and I just had a conversation this morning where we were talking about our ideas.

2:00:51.240 --> 2:00:57.240
 And what we discovered really in our conversation was that we're pretty much on the same page.

2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:00.240
 It was really just about consciousness.

2:01:00.240 --> 2:01:04.240
 Our ideas about consciousness are pretty much on the same page.

2:01:04.240 --> 2:01:15.240
 And she rightly has cautioned me when I talk about conscious agents to point out that the notion of agency is not fundamental in my theory.

2:01:15.240 --> 2:01:17.240
 The notion of self is not fundamental.

2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:19.240
 And that's absolutely true.

2:01:19.240 --> 2:01:25.240
 I can use this network of conscious agents, and I now use as a technical term,

2:01:25.240 --> 2:01:29.240
 conscious agents is a technical term for that probability space with the Markovian dynamics.

2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:35.240
 I can use that to build models of a self and to build models of agency, but they're not fundamental.

2:01:35.240 --> 2:01:45.240
 So she has really been very helpful in helping me to be a little bit clear about these ideas and not say things that are misleading.

2:01:45.240 --> 2:01:47.240
 Sure.

2:01:47.240 --> 2:01:56.240
 I mean, this is the interesting thing about language, actually, is that language, quite obviously, is an interface to truth.

2:01:56.240 --> 2:02:05.240
 It's so fascinating that individual words can have so much ambiguity.

2:02:05.240 --> 2:02:17.240
 And the slight, the specific choices of a word within a particular sentence within the context of a sentence can have so much such a difference in meaning.

2:02:17.240 --> 2:02:24.240
 It's quite fascinating, especially when you're talking about topics like consciousness, because it's a very loaded term.

2:02:24.240 --> 2:02:29.240
 There's a lot of things to a lot of people, and the entire concept of shrouded in mystery.

2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:37.240
 So combination of the fact that it's a loaded term and that there's a lot of mystery, people can just interpret it in all kinds of ways.

2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:48.240
 And so you have to be both precise and help them avoid getting stuck on some kind of side road of miscommunication,

2:02:48.240 --> 2:02:51.240
 loss in translation, because you used the wrong word.

2:02:51.240 --> 2:02:53.240
 That's interesting.

2:02:53.240 --> 2:03:01.240
 For a lot of people, consciousness is ultimately connected to a self.

2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:09.240
 I mean, that's our experience of consciousness is very, it's connected to this ego.

2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:13.240
 I mean, what else could it possibly be?

2:03:13.240 --> 2:03:23.240
 And how do you begin to comprehend, to visualize, to conceptualize a consciousness that's not connected to like this particular organism?

2:03:23.240 --> 2:03:30.240
 I'll have a way of thinking about this whole problem now that comes out of this framework that's different.

2:03:30.240 --> 2:03:38.240
 So we can imagine a dynamics of consciousness, not in space and time, just abstractly.

2:03:38.240 --> 2:03:43.240
 It could be cooperative for all we know, it could be very friendly, I don't know.

2:03:43.240 --> 2:03:48.240
 And you can set up a dynamics, a Markovian dynamics that is so called stationary.

2:03:48.240 --> 2:03:53.240
 And that's a technical term, which means that the entropy effectively is not increasing.

2:03:53.240 --> 2:03:55.240
 There is some entropy, but it's constant.

2:03:55.240 --> 2:03:57.240
 So there's no increasing entropy.

2:03:57.240 --> 2:04:01.240
 And in that sense, the dynamics is timeless.

2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:04.240
 There is no entropic time.

2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:16.240
 But it's a trivial theorem, three line proof, that if you have a stationary Markovian dynamics, any projection that you make of that dynamics by conditional probability.

2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:22.240
 And if you want, I can state a little bit more, even more mathematically precisely for some readers or listeners.

2:04:22.240 --> 2:04:33.240
 But if any projection you take by conditional probability, the induced image of that Markov chain will have increasing entropy.

2:04:33.240 --> 2:04:34.240
 It will have entropic time.

2:04:34.240 --> 2:04:36.240
 So I'll be very, very precise.

2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:43.240
 I have a Markov chain x1, x2 through xn, where n goes to infinity, right?

2:04:43.240 --> 2:04:52.240
 The entropy h, capital H of xn is equal to the entropy h of xn minus 1 for all n.

2:04:52.240 --> 2:04:55.240
 So the entropy is the same.

2:04:55.240 --> 2:05:10.240
 But it's a theorem that h of xn, say, given x sub 1 is greater than or equal to h of xn minus 1, given x1.

2:05:10.240 --> 2:05:11.240
 Sure.

2:05:11.240 --> 2:05:13.240
 Where does the greater come from?

2:05:13.240 --> 2:05:24.240
 Because with the theorem, the three line proof, h of xn given x1 is greater than or equal to h of xn given x1 and x2.

2:05:24.240 --> 2:05:26.240
 Because conditioning reduces.

2:05:26.240 --> 2:05:42.240
 But then h of xn minus 1 given x1, x2 is equal to h of xn given x2, xn minus 1 given x2 by the Markov property.

2:05:42.240 --> 2:05:51.240
 And then because it's stationary, it's equal to h of x, I have to write it down.

2:05:51.240 --> 2:05:52.240
 Sure, sure.

2:05:52.240 --> 2:05:55.240
 Anyway, there's a three line proof.

2:05:55.240 --> 2:05:56.240
 Sure.

2:05:56.240 --> 2:06:04.240
 But the assumption of stationarity, we're using a lot of terms that people won't understand, doesn't matter.

2:06:04.240 --> 2:06:16.240
 So there's some kind of, some Markovian dynamics is basically trying to model some kind of system with some probabilities and there's agents and they interact in some kind of way.

2:06:16.240 --> 2:06:22.240
 And you can say something about that system as it evolves, stationarity.

2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:30.240
 So stationary system is one that has certain properties in terms of entropy very well.

2:06:30.240 --> 2:06:32.240
 But we don't know if it's stationary or not.

2:06:32.240 --> 2:06:34.240
 We don't know what the properties.

2:06:34.240 --> 2:06:35.240
 Right.

2:06:35.240 --> 2:06:43.240
 You see, you have to kind of take assumptions and see, okay, well, what is, what does the systems behave like under these different properties?

2:06:43.240 --> 2:06:51.240
 The more constraints, the more assumptions you take, the more predictive, the more interesting, powerful things you can say, but sometimes they're limiting.

2:06:51.240 --> 2:06:55.240
 That said, we're talking about consciousness here.

2:06:55.240 --> 2:07:02.240
 How does that, you said cooperative, okay, competitive.

2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:04.240
 It just, I like chocolate.

2:07:04.240 --> 2:07:08.240
 I'm sitting here, I have a brain, I'm wearing a suit.

2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:11.240
 It sure as hell feels like I'm myself.

2:07:11.240 --> 2:07:12.240
 Right.

2:07:12.240 --> 2:07:14.240
 Now, what am I tuning in?

2:07:14.240 --> 2:07:16.240
 Am I plugging into something?

2:07:16.240 --> 2:07:25.240
 Am I a projection, a simple, trivial projection into space time from some much larger organism that I can't possibly comprehend?

2:07:25.240 --> 2:07:29.240
 How the hell, you're saying some, you're building up mathematical intuitions.

2:07:29.240 --> 2:07:30.240
 Fine.

2:07:30.240 --> 2:07:31.240
 Great.

2:07:31.240 --> 2:07:36.240
 But I'm just, I'm having an existential crisis here and I'm going to die soon.

2:07:36.240 --> 2:07:38.240
 We'll all die pretty quickly.

2:07:38.240 --> 2:07:42.240
 I want to figure out why chocolate is so delicious.

2:07:42.240 --> 2:07:44.240
 So help me out here.

2:07:44.240 --> 2:07:46.240
 So let's just keep sneaking up to this.

2:07:46.240 --> 2:07:47.240
 Right.

2:07:47.240 --> 2:08:07.240
 So the whole technical thing was to say this, even if the dynamics of consciousness is stationary so that there is no entropic time, any projection of it, any view of it will have the artifact of entropic time.

2:08:07.240 --> 2:08:10.240
 That's a limited resource.

2:08:10.240 --> 2:08:12.240
 Limited resources.

2:08:12.240 --> 2:08:17.240
 So the fundamental dynamics may have no limits, limited resources whatsoever.

2:08:17.240 --> 2:08:23.240
 Any projection will have certainly time as a limited resource and probably a lot of other limited resources.

2:08:23.240 --> 2:08:34.240
 Hence we could get competition and evolution and nature, red and tooth and claw as an artifact of a deeper system in which those aren't fundamental.

2:08:34.240 --> 2:08:49.240
 And in fact, I take it as something that this theory must do at some point is to show how networks of conscious agents, even if they're not resource limited, give rise to evolution by natural selection via a projection.

2:08:49.240 --> 2:09:06.240
 Yeah, but you're saying, I'm trying to understand how the limited resources that give rise to, so first the thing gives rise to time, it gives rise to limited resource, it gives rise to evolution by natural selection, how that has to do with the fact that chocolate is delicious.

2:09:06.240 --> 2:09:08.240
 Well, it's not going to do that directly.

2:09:08.240 --> 2:09:10.240
 It's going to get to this notion of self.

2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:13.240
 Oh, it's going to give you the notion of self.

2:09:13.240 --> 2:09:15.240
 Evolution gives you the notion of self.

2:09:15.240 --> 2:09:19.240
 And also of a self separate from other selves.

2:09:19.240 --> 2:09:23.240
 So the idea would be that competition has life and death, all those kinds of things.

2:09:23.240 --> 2:09:24.240
 That's right.

2:09:24.240 --> 2:09:32.240
 So it won't, I don't think, as I said, I don't think that I can tell you how the formless gives rise to the experience of chocolate.

2:09:32.240 --> 2:09:36.240
 Right now my current theory says that's one of the miracles I'm assuming.

2:09:36.240 --> 2:09:38.240
 So my theory can't do it.

2:09:38.240 --> 2:09:43.240
 And the reason my theory can't do it is because Hoffman's brain can't do it right now.

2:09:43.240 --> 2:09:52.240
 But the notion of self, yes, the notion of self can be an artifact of the projection of it.

2:09:52.240 --> 2:09:58.240
 So there's one conscious agent because anytime conscious agents interact, they form a new conscious agent.

2:09:58.240 --> 2:10:00.240
 So there's one conscious agent.

2:10:00.240 --> 2:10:08.240
 Any projection of that one conscious agent gives rise to time, even if there wasn't any time in that one conscious agent.

2:10:08.240 --> 2:10:11.240
 And it gives rise, I want to, I haven't proven this.

2:10:11.240 --> 2:10:14.240
 So now this is me guessing where the theory is going to go.

2:10:14.240 --> 2:10:15.240
 I haven't done this.

2:10:15.240 --> 2:10:16.240
 There's no paper on this yet.

2:10:16.240 --> 2:10:18.240
 So now I'm speculating.

2:10:18.240 --> 2:10:31.240
 My guess is I'll be able to show, or my brighter colleagues working with me will be able to show that we will get evolution of a natural selection, the notion of individual cells, individual physical objects, and so forth coming out as a projection of this thing.

2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:41.240
 And that the self, this then will be really interesting in terms of how it starts to interact with certain spiritual traditions, right?

2:10:41.240 --> 2:10:52.240
 Where they will say that there is a notion of self that needs to be let go, which is this finite self that's competing with other selves to get more money and prestige and so forth.

2:10:52.240 --> 2:11:10.240
 That self in some sense has to die, but there's a deeper self, which is the timeless being that precludes, that precedes, not precludes, but precedes any particular conscious experiences, the ground of all experience.

2:11:10.240 --> 2:11:13.240
 There's that notion of a deep capital self.

2:11:13.240 --> 2:11:26.240
 But our little capital lowercase s selves could be artifacts of projection, and it may be that what consciousness is doing in this framework is, right?

2:11:26.240 --> 2:11:33.240
 It's projected itself down into a self that calls itself Don and a self that calls itself Lex.

2:11:33.240 --> 2:11:53.240
 And through conversations like this, it's trying to find out about itself and eventually transcend the limits of the Don and Lex little icons that it's using and that little projection of itself through this conversation is somehow it's learning about itself.

2:11:53.240 --> 2:11:59.240
 So that thing dressed me up today in order to understand itself.

2:11:59.240 --> 2:12:03.240
 And in some sense, you and I are not separate from that thing and we're not separate from each other.

2:12:03.240 --> 2:12:04.240
 Yeah.

2:12:04.240 --> 2:12:07.240
 Well, I have to question the fashion choices on my end.

2:12:07.240 --> 2:12:08.240
 All right.

2:12:08.240 --> 2:12:15.240
 So you mentioned you agree on in terms of consciousness and a lot of things with Anika.

2:12:15.240 --> 2:12:35.240
 Is there somebody friend or friendly foe that you disagree with in some nuanced interesting way or some major way about consciousness, about these topics of reality that you return to often?

2:12:35.240 --> 2:12:47.240
 It's like Christopher Hitchens with Rabbi David Walby have had interesting conversations through years that added to the complexity and the beauty of their friendship.

2:12:47.240 --> 2:12:56.240
 Is there somebody like that that over the years has been a source of disagreement with you that strengthen your ideas?

2:12:56.240 --> 2:13:02.240
 My ideas have been really shaped by several things.

2:13:02.240 --> 2:13:12.240
 One is the physicalist framework that my scientific colleagues almost to a person have adopted and that I adopted too.

2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:22.240
 The reason I walked away from it was because it became clear that we couldn't start with unconscious ingredients and Buddha consciousness.

2:13:22.240 --> 2:13:28.240
 Can you define physicalists in contrast to reductionists?

2:13:28.240 --> 2:13:38.240
 So a physicalist, I would say, is someone who takes space time and the objects within space time as ontologically fundamental.

2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:39.240
 Right.

2:13:39.240 --> 2:13:43.240
 And then reductionist is saying the smaller, the more fundamental.

2:13:43.240 --> 2:13:45.240
 That's a methodological thing.

2:13:45.240 --> 2:13:53.240
 That's saying within space time as you go to smaller and smaller scales in space, you get deeper and deeper laws, more and more fundamental laws.

2:13:53.240 --> 2:14:01.240
 And the reduction of temperature to particle movement was an example of that.

2:14:01.240 --> 2:14:07.240
 But I think that the reason that worked was almost an artifact of the nature of our interface.

2:14:07.240 --> 2:14:13.240
 That was for a long time and your colleagues, including yourself, were physicalists and now you broke away.

2:14:13.240 --> 2:14:18.240
 I broke away because I think you can't start with unconscious ingredients and Buddha consciousness.

2:14:18.240 --> 2:14:23.240
 And so even with Roger Penrose where there's like a gray area.

2:14:23.240 --> 2:14:24.240
 Right.

2:14:24.240 --> 2:14:37.240
 And here's the challenge I would put to all of my friends and colleagues who are give one specific conscious experience that you can boot up.

2:14:37.240 --> 2:14:38.240
 Right.

2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:46.240
 So if you think that it's integrated information and this I've asked this of Julia to know me a couple of times back in the 90s and then just a couple of years ago.

2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:49.240
 I asked Julia, okay, so great integrated information.

2:14:49.240 --> 2:14:53.240
 So we're all interested in explaining some specific conscious experiences.

2:14:53.240 --> 2:15:09.240
 So what, what is, you know, pick one, the taste of chocolate, what is the integrated information, precise structure that we need for chocolate and why does that structure have to be for chocolate and why, why is it that it could not possibly be vanilla?

2:15:09.240 --> 2:15:21.240
 Is there any, last time, is there any one specific conscious experience that you can account for? Because notice they've set themselves the task of booting up conscious experiences from physical systems.

2:15:21.240 --> 2:15:23.240
 That's the task they've set themselves.

2:15:23.240 --> 2:15:31.240
 But that doesn't mean they're, I understand your intuition, but that doesn't mean they're wrong just because they can't find a way to boot it up yet.

2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:32.240
 That's right.

2:15:32.240 --> 2:15:33.240
 No, that doesn't mean that they're wrong.

2:15:33.240 --> 2:15:37.240
 It just, it just means that they haven't done it.

2:15:37.240 --> 2:15:39.240
 I think it's principled.

2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:43.240
 The reason is principled, but, but I'm happy that they're exploring it.

2:15:43.240 --> 2:15:46.240
 But the fact is the remarkable fact is there's not one theory.

2:15:46.240 --> 2:15:55.240
 So integrated information theory, orchestrated collapse of microtubules, global workspace theory.

2:15:55.240 --> 2:15:56.240
 These are all theories of consciousness.

2:15:56.240 --> 2:15:57.240
 These are all theories of consciousness.

2:15:57.240 --> 2:16:06.240
 There's not a single theory that can give you a specific conscious experience that they say here is the physical dynamics or the physical structure.

2:16:06.240 --> 2:16:09.240
 That must be the taste of chocolate or whatever one they want.

2:16:09.240 --> 2:16:11.240
 So you're saying it's impossible.

2:16:11.240 --> 2:16:13.240
 They're saying it's just hard.

2:16:13.240 --> 2:16:14.240
 Yeah.

2:16:14.240 --> 2:16:21.240
 My attitude is, okay, no one said you had to start with neurons or physical systems and boot up consciousness.

2:16:21.240 --> 2:16:22.240
 You guys are just taking that.

2:16:22.240 --> 2:16:23.240
 You chose that problem.

2:16:23.240 --> 2:16:27.240
 So since you chose that problem, how much progress have you made?

2:16:27.240 --> 2:16:35.240
 Well, when you've not been able to come up with a single specific conscious experience and you've had these brilliant people working on it for decades now.

2:16:35.240 --> 2:16:37.240
 That's not really good progress.

2:16:37.240 --> 2:16:40.240
 Let me ask you to play devil's advocate.

2:16:40.240 --> 2:16:50.240
 Can you try to steal man, steal man meaning argue the best possible case for reality, the opposite of your book title.

2:16:50.240 --> 2:16:53.240
 Or maybe just sticking to consciousness.

2:16:53.240 --> 2:16:55.240
 Can you take the physicalist view?

2:16:55.240 --> 2:17:00.240
 Can you steal man the physicalist view for a brief moment playing devil's advocate too?

2:17:00.240 --> 2:17:05.240
 Or steal man the person you used to be.

2:17:05.240 --> 2:17:06.240
 Right.

2:17:06.240 --> 2:17:07.240
 She's a physicalist.

2:17:07.240 --> 2:17:12.240
 What's a good, like saying that you might be wrong right now?

2:17:12.240 --> 2:17:17.240
 What would be a convincing argument for that?

2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:28.240
 Well, I think the argument I would give and that I believed was, look, when you have very simple physical systems, like a piece of dirt,

2:17:28.240 --> 2:17:30.240
 there's not much evidence of life for consciousness.

2:17:30.240 --> 2:17:34.240
 It's only when you get really complicated physical systems like that have brains.

2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:41.240
 And really, the more complicated the brains, the more it looks like there's consciousness and the more complicated that consciousness is.

2:17:41.240 --> 2:17:49.240
 Surely that means that simple physical systems don't create much consciousness or if maybe not any.

2:17:49.240 --> 2:17:54.240
 Or maybe panpsychists, they create the most elementary kinds of simple conscious experiences.

2:17:54.240 --> 2:18:02.240
 But you need more complicated physical systems to boot up to create more complicated consciousnesses.

2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:05.240
 I think that's the intuition that drives most of my colleagues.

2:18:05.240 --> 2:18:14.240
 And you're saying that this concept of complexity is ill defined when you ground it to space time?

2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:18.240
 Well, I think it's well defined within the framework of space time, right?

2:18:18.240 --> 2:18:26.240
 Ill defined relative to what you need to actually understand consciousness because you're grounding complexity in just in space time.

2:18:26.240 --> 2:18:27.240
 Oh, got you.

2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:39.240
 Yeah, what I'm saying is, if it were true that space time was fundamental, then I would have to agree that if there is such a thing as consciousness,

2:18:39.240 --> 2:18:49.240
 given the data that we've got that complex brains have consciousness and dirt doesn't, that somehow it's the complexity of the dynamics or organization,

2:18:49.240 --> 2:18:54.240
 the function of the physical system that somehow is creating the consciousness.

2:18:54.240 --> 2:18:57.240
 So under those assumptions, yes.

2:18:57.240 --> 2:19:03.240
 But when the physicists themselves are telling us that space time is not fundamental, then I can understand.

2:19:03.240 --> 2:19:06.240
 See, then the whole picture starts to come into focus.

2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:10.240
 Why, my colleagues are brilliant, right?

2:19:10.240 --> 2:19:11.240
 These are really smart people.

2:19:11.240 --> 2:19:16.240
 I mean, Francis Crick worked on this for the last 20 years of his life.

2:19:16.240 --> 2:19:17.240
 These are not stupid people.

2:19:17.240 --> 2:19:19.240
 These are brilliant, brilliant people.

2:19:19.240 --> 2:19:24.240
 The fact that we've come up with not a single specific conscious experience that we can explain.

2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:25.240
 And no hope.

2:19:25.240 --> 2:19:27.240
 There's no one that says, I'm really close.

2:19:27.240 --> 2:19:29.240
 I'll have it for you in a year.

2:19:29.240 --> 2:19:32.240
 There's just like, there's this fundamental gap.

2:19:32.240 --> 2:19:39.240
 So much so that Steve Pinker in one of his writings says, look, he likes the global workspace theory,

2:19:39.240 --> 2:19:43.240
 but he says the last dollop of the theory in which there's something it's like to,

2:19:43.240 --> 2:19:47.240
 he said we may have to just stipulate that as a brute fact.

2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:51.240
 Pinker is brilliant, right?

2:19:51.240 --> 2:19:57.240
 He understands the state of play on this problem of the hard problem of consciousness,

2:19:57.240 --> 2:20:02.240
 the starting with physical assumptions and then trying to boot up consciousness.

2:20:02.240 --> 2:20:04.240
 You've set yourself the problem.

2:20:04.240 --> 2:20:07.240
 I'm starting with physical stuff that's not conscious.

2:20:07.240 --> 2:20:14.240
 I'm trying to get the taste of chocolate out as maybe some kind of function of the dynamics of that.

2:20:14.240 --> 2:20:16.240
 We've not been able to do that.

2:20:16.240 --> 2:20:18.240
 And so Pinker is saying we may have to punt.

2:20:18.240 --> 2:20:21.240
 We may have to just stipulate that last bit.

2:20:21.240 --> 2:20:23.240
 He calls it the last dollop.

2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:28.240
 And just say, stipulate it as a bare fact of nature that there is something it's like.

2:20:28.240 --> 2:20:34.240
 Well, from my point of view, the whole point, the whole promise of the physicalist was we wouldn't have to stipulate.

2:20:34.240 --> 2:20:38.240
 I was going to start with the physical stuff and explain where the consciousness came from.

2:20:38.240 --> 2:20:42.240
 If I'm going to stipulate consciousness, why don't I just stipulate consciousness

2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:44.240
 and not stipulate all the physical stuff too?

2:20:44.240 --> 2:20:46.240
 So I'm stipulating less.

2:20:46.240 --> 2:20:48.240
 I'm saying, okay, I agree.

2:20:48.240 --> 2:20:49.240
 The panpsychist perspective.

2:20:49.240 --> 2:20:52.240
 Well, it's actually what I call the conscious realist perspective.

2:20:52.240 --> 2:20:55.240
 Panpsychists are effectively dualists, right?

2:20:55.240 --> 2:20:59.240
 They're saying there's physical stuff that really is fundamental and then consciousness stuff.

2:20:59.240 --> 2:21:03.240
 So I would go with Pinker and say, look, let's just stipulate the consciousness stuff,

2:21:03.240 --> 2:21:05.240
 but I'm not going to stipulate the physical stuff.

2:21:05.240 --> 2:21:10.240
 I'm going to actually now show how to boot up the physical stuff from just the consciousness stuff.

2:21:10.240 --> 2:21:12.240
 So I'll stipulate less.

2:21:12.240 --> 2:21:13.240
 Is it possible?

2:21:13.240 --> 2:21:21.240
 So if you stipulate less, is it possible for our limited brains to visualize reality

2:21:21.240 --> 2:21:25.240
 as we delve deeper and deeper and deeper?

2:21:25.240 --> 2:21:30.240
 Is it possible to visualize somehow with the tools of math, with the tools of computers,

2:21:30.240 --> 2:21:32.240
 with the tools of our mind?

2:21:32.240 --> 2:21:34.240
 Are we hopelessly lost?

2:21:34.240 --> 2:21:44.240
 You said there's ways to intuit what's true using mathematics and probability

2:21:44.240 --> 2:21:50.240
 and sort of Markovian dynamics, all that kind of stuff.

2:21:50.240 --> 2:21:52.240
 But that's not visualizing.

2:21:52.240 --> 2:21:55.240
 That's what's a kind of building intuition.

2:21:55.240 --> 2:22:02.240
 But is it possible to visualize in the way we visualize so nicely in space time in four dimensions?

2:22:02.240 --> 2:22:04.240
 In three dimensions, sorry.

2:22:04.240 --> 2:22:12.240
 Well, we really are looking through a two dimensional screen until it's what we intuit to be a three dimensional world

2:22:12.240 --> 2:22:17.240
 and also inferring dynamic stuff, making it 4D.

2:22:17.240 --> 2:22:25.240
 Anyway, is it possible to visualize some pretty pictures that give us a deeper sense of the truth of reality?

2:22:25.240 --> 2:22:29.240
 I think that we will incrementally be able to do that.

2:22:29.240 --> 2:22:39.240
 I think that, for example, the picture that we have of electrons and photons interacting and scattering,

2:22:39.240 --> 2:22:47.240
 it may have not been possible until Faraday did all of his experiments and then Maxwell wrote down his equations

2:22:47.240 --> 2:22:52.240
 and we were then sort of forced by his equations to think in a new way.

2:22:52.240 --> 2:23:02.240
 And then when Planck in 1900, desperate to try to solve the problem of black body radiation,

2:23:02.240 --> 2:23:11.240
 what they call the ultraviolet catastrophe where Newton was predicting infinite energies where there weren't infinite energies in black body radiation.

2:23:11.240 --> 2:23:20.240
 And he, in desperation, proposed packets of energy.

2:23:20.240 --> 2:23:29.240
 Then once you've done that, and then you have an Einstein come along five years later and show how that explains the photoelectric effect.

2:23:29.240 --> 2:23:33.240
 And then eventually in 1926, you get quantum theory.

2:23:33.240 --> 2:23:45.240
 And then you get this whole new way of thinking that was, from the Newtonian point of view, completely contradictory and counterintuitive, certainly.

2:23:45.240 --> 2:23:47.240
 And maybe if Giesen is right, not contradictory.

2:23:47.240 --> 2:23:50.240
 Maybe if you use intuitionist math, they're not contradictory.

2:23:50.240 --> 2:23:54.240
 But still, certainly you wouldn't have gone there.

2:23:54.240 --> 2:24:07.240
 And so here's a case where the experiments and then a desperate mathematical move, sort of we use those as a flashlight into the deep fog, right?

2:24:07.240 --> 2:24:13.240
 And so that science may be the flashlight into the deep fog.

2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:24.240
 And I wonder if it's still possible to visualize in the, like we talk about consciousness in, from a self perspective, experience it.

2:24:24.240 --> 2:24:28.240
 Hold that idea in our mind, the way you can experience things directly.

2:24:28.240 --> 2:24:33.240
 We've evolved to experience things in this 3D world.

2:24:33.240 --> 2:24:36.240
 And that's a very rich experience.

2:24:36.240 --> 2:24:49.240
 And we're thinking mathematically, you still, in the end of the day, have to project it down to low dimensional space to make, to make conclusions.

2:24:49.240 --> 2:24:55.240
 Their conclusions will be a number or a line or a plot or a visual.

2:24:55.240 --> 2:25:03.240
 So I wonder, like, how we can really touch some deep truth in a subjective way, like experience it.

2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:08.240
 Really feel the beauty of it, you know, in the way that humans feel beauty.

2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:10.240
 Right. Are we screwed?

2:25:10.240 --> 2:25:11.240
 I don't think we're screwed.

2:25:11.240 --> 2:25:17.240
 I think that we get little hints of it from psychedelic drugs and so forth.

2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:21.240
 We get hints that there are certain interventions that we can take on our interface.

2:25:21.240 --> 2:25:28.240
 I apply this chemical, which is just some element of my interface, to this other, to a brain.

2:25:28.240 --> 2:25:36.240
 I ingest it. And all of a sudden, I seem like I've opened new portals into conscious experiences.

2:25:36.240 --> 2:25:38.240
 Well, that's very, very suggestive.

2:25:38.240 --> 2:25:42.240
 That's like the black body radiation doing something that we didn't expect, right?

2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:49.240
 It doesn't go to infinity when we thought it was going to go to infinity and we're forced to propose these quanta.

2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:59.240
 So once we have a theory of conscious agents and is projection to space, I should sketch what I think that projection is.

2:25:59.240 --> 2:26:03.240
 But then I think we can then start to ask specific questions.

2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:12.240
 When you're taking DMT or you're taking LSD or something like that, now that we have this deep model,

2:26:12.240 --> 2:26:18.240
 we've reverse engineered space and time and physical particles, we've pulled them back to this theory of conscious agents.

2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:28.240
 Now we can ask ourselves in this idealized future, what are we doing to conscious agents when we apply 5MEO DMT?

2:26:28.240 --> 2:26:32.240
 What are we doing? Are we opening a new portal, right?

2:26:32.240 --> 2:26:39.240
 So when I say that, I mean, I have a portal into consciousness that I call my body of Lex Friedman that I'm creating.

2:26:39.240 --> 2:26:45.240
 And it's a genuine portal, not perfect, but it's a genuine portal I'm definitely communicating with your consciousness.

2:26:45.240 --> 2:26:51.240
 And we know that we have one technology for building new portals.

2:26:51.240 --> 2:26:54.240
 We know one technology and that is having kids.

2:26:54.240 --> 2:27:00.240
 Having kids is how we build new portals into consciousness. It takes a long time.

2:27:00.240 --> 2:27:04.240
 Can you elaborate that? Oh, oh, oh, you mean like...

2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:07.240
 Your son and your daughter didn't exist.

2:27:07.240 --> 2:27:12.240
 That was a portal that you're having contact with consciousness that you never would have had before.

2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:20.240
 But now you've got a son or a daughter, you went through this physical process, they were born, then there was all the...

2:27:20.240 --> 2:27:22.240
 But is that portal yours?

2:27:22.240 --> 2:27:29.240
 So when you have kids, are you creating new portals that are completely distinct from the portals that you've created with other consciousness?

2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:37.240
 Can you elaborate on that? To which degree are the consciousness of your kids a part of you?

2:27:37.240 --> 2:27:49.240
 Well, so every person that I see, that symbol that I see, the body that I see, is a portal potentially for me to interact with a consciousness.

2:27:49.240 --> 2:27:56.240
 And each consciousness has a unique character and we call it a personality and so forth.

2:27:56.240 --> 2:28:04.240
 So with each new kid that's born, we come in contact with a personality that we've never seen before.

2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:07.240
 A version of consciousness that we've never seen before.

2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:10.240
 At a deeper level, as I said, the theory says there's one agent.

2:28:10.240 --> 2:28:15.240
 So this is a different projection of that one agent.

2:28:15.240 --> 2:28:29.240
 So that's what I mean by a portal is within my own interface, my own projection, can I see other projections of that one consciousness?

2:28:29.240 --> 2:28:32.240
 So can I get portals in that sense?

2:28:32.240 --> 2:28:41.240
 So I think we will get a theory of that, that we will get a theory of portals and then we can ask how the psychedelics are acting.

2:28:41.240 --> 2:28:43.240
 Are they actually creating new portals or not?

2:28:43.240 --> 2:28:50.240
 If they're not, we should nevertheless then understand how we could create a new portal, right?

2:28:50.240 --> 2:28:53.240
 Maybe we have to just study what happens when we have kids.

2:28:53.240 --> 2:28:56.240
 We know that that technology creates new portals.

2:28:56.240 --> 2:29:06.240
 So we have to reverse engineer that and then say, okay, could we somehow create new portals de novo?

2:29:06.240 --> 2:29:11.240
 With something like brain computer interfaces, for example.

2:29:11.240 --> 2:29:12.240
 Maybe just a chemical or something.

2:29:12.240 --> 2:29:14.240
 It's probably more complicated than a chemical.

2:29:14.240 --> 2:29:22.240
 That's why I think that the psychedelics may because they might be affecting this portal in certain ways that it turns it around and opens up.

2:29:22.240 --> 2:29:28.240
 Whereas maybe once we understand what this thing is a portal, your body as a portal and understand all of its complexities,

2:29:28.240 --> 2:29:35.240
 maybe we'll realize that that portal can be shifted to different parts of the deeper consciousness and give new windows on it.

2:29:35.240 --> 2:29:45.240
 So in that way, maybe, yes, psychedelics could open up new portals in the sense that they're taking something that's already a complex portal and just tweaking it a bit.

2:29:45.240 --> 2:29:50.240
 Well, but creating is a very powerful difference between morphing.

2:29:50.240 --> 2:29:52.240
 Right, tweaking versus creating.

2:29:52.240 --> 2:29:53.240
 I agree.

2:29:53.240 --> 2:30:01.240
 But maybe it gives you intuition to at least the full space of the kinds of things that this particular system is capable of.

2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:05.240
 I mean, the idea of the consciousness creates brains.

2:30:05.240 --> 2:30:18.240
 I mean, that breaks my brain because I guess I'm still a physicalist in that sense because it's just much easier to intuit the world.

2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:32.240
 It's very, it's practical to think there's a neural network and what are the different ways fascinating capabilities can emerge from this neural network.

2:30:32.240 --> 2:30:33.240
 I agree.

2:30:33.240 --> 2:30:34.240
 It's easier.

2:30:34.240 --> 2:30:40.240
 And so you start to and then present yourself the problem of, okay, well, how does consciousness arise?

2:30:40.240 --> 2:30:42.240
 How does intelligence arise?

2:30:42.240 --> 2:30:45.240
 How does emotion arise?

2:30:45.240 --> 2:30:58.240
 How does memory arise in the, how do we filter within the system all the incoming sensory information we're able to allocate attention in different interesting ways?

2:30:58.240 --> 2:31:14.240
 How do all those mechanisms arise to say that there's other fundamental things we don't understand outside of space time that are actually core to how this whole thing works is a bit paralyzing because it's like, oh.

2:31:14.240 --> 2:31:17.240
 We're not, we're not 10% done.

2:31:17.240 --> 2:31:20.240
 We're like 0.001% done.

2:31:20.240 --> 2:31:22.240
 It's the immediate feeling.

2:31:22.240 --> 2:31:24.240
 I certainly understand that.

2:31:24.240 --> 2:31:38.240
 My attitude about it is, if you look at the young physicists who are searching for these structures beyond space time, like apocryphedon and so forth, they're having a ball.

2:31:38.240 --> 2:31:41.240
 Space time, that's what the old folks did.

2:31:41.240 --> 2:31:44.240
 That's what the older generation did.

2:31:44.240 --> 2:31:54.240
 We're doing something that really is fun and new and they're having a blast and they're finding all these new structures.

2:31:54.240 --> 2:32:03.240
 So I think that we're going to succeed in getting a new deeper theory.

2:32:03.240 --> 2:32:12.240
 I can just say what I'm hoping with the theory that I'm working on, I'm hoping to show that I could have this timeless dynamics of consciousness, no entropic time.

2:32:12.240 --> 2:32:21.240
 I take a projection and I show how this timeless dynamics looks like the Big Bang and the entire evolution of space time.

2:32:21.240 --> 2:32:24.240
 In other words, I see how my whole space time interface.

2:32:24.240 --> 2:32:34.240
 So not just the projection doesn't just look like space time, you can explain the whole from the origin of the universe.

2:32:34.240 --> 2:32:37.240
 That's what we have to do and that's what the physicists understand.

2:32:37.240 --> 2:32:49.240
 When they go beyond space time to the apocryphedon and the cosmological polytope, they ultimately know that they have to get back the Big Bang story and the whole evolution, that whole story where there were no living things.

2:32:49.240 --> 2:33:03.240
 There was just a point and then the explosion and then just particles at high energy and then eventually the cooling down and the differentiation and finally matter condenses and then life and then consciousness.

2:33:03.240 --> 2:33:10.240
 That whole story has to come out of something that's deeper and without time and that's what we're up to.

2:33:10.240 --> 2:33:19.240
 So the whole story that we've been telling ourselves about Big Bang and how brains evolve and consciousness will come out of a much deeper theory.

2:33:19.240 --> 2:33:24.240
 For someone like me, it's a lot.

2:33:24.240 --> 2:33:30.240
 But for the younger generation, this is like, oh wow, all the low cherries aren't picked.

2:33:30.240 --> 2:33:32.240
 This is really good stuff.

2:33:32.240 --> 2:33:43.240
 It's really new fundamental stuff that we can do so that I can't wait to read the papers of the younger generation and I want to see them.

2:33:43.240 --> 2:33:49.240
 Kids these days with their non space time assumptions.

2:33:49.240 --> 2:33:54.240
 It's just interesting looking at the philosophical tradition of those difficult ideas you struggle with.

2:33:54.240 --> 2:34:05.240
 It looks like somebody like Emanuel Kant. What are some interesting agreements and disagreements you have with a guy about the nature of reality?

2:34:05.240 --> 2:34:07.240
 So there's a lot in agreement.

2:34:07.240 --> 2:34:19.240
 So Kant was an idealist, transcendental idealist and he basically had the idea that we don't see nature as it is.

2:34:19.240 --> 2:34:23.240
 We impose a structure on nature.

2:34:23.240 --> 2:34:28.240
 And so in some sense, I'm saying something similar.

2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:31.240
 I'm saying that by the way, I don't call myself an idealist.

2:34:31.240 --> 2:34:40.240
 I call myself a conscious realist because idealism has a long history, a lot of different ideas come under idealism and there's a lot of debates and so forth.

2:34:40.240 --> 2:34:46.240
 It tends to be identified with, in many cases, anti science and anti realism.

2:34:46.240 --> 2:34:56.240
 And I don't want either connection with my ideas and so I just called my conscious realism with an emphasis on realism and not anti realism.

2:34:56.240 --> 2:35:05.240
 But one place where I would of course disagree with Kant was that he thought that Euclidean space time was a priori.

2:35:05.240 --> 2:35:08.240
 We just know that that's false.

2:35:08.240 --> 2:35:19.240
 So he went too far on that but in general, the idea that we don't start with space time, that space and time is in some sense the forms of our perceptions.

2:35:19.240 --> 2:35:21.240
 Yes, absolutely.

2:35:21.240 --> 2:35:28.240
 And I would say that there's a lot in common with Barclay in that regard.

2:35:28.240 --> 2:35:31.240
 There's a lot of ingenious arguments in Barclay.

2:35:31.240 --> 2:35:38.240
 Leibniz in his monodology understood very clearly that the hard problem was not solvable.

2:35:38.240 --> 2:35:43.240
 He posed a hard problem and basically dismissed it and just said, you can't do this.

2:35:43.240 --> 2:35:51.240
 And so if he came here and saw where we are, he said, look guys, I told you this 300 years ago and he had his monodology.

2:35:51.240 --> 2:36:00.240
 He was trying to do something like, it's different from what I'm doing, but he had these things that were not in space and time, these monads.

2:36:00.240 --> 2:36:05.240
 He was trying to build something, I'm trying to build a theory of consciousness.

2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:17.240
 My guess is that if he came here, I could just, if he saw what I was doing, he would say, he would understand it and immediately take off with it and go places that I couldn't.

2:36:17.240 --> 2:36:19.240
 He would have no problems.

2:36:19.240 --> 2:36:25.240
 Right, there would be overlap of the spirit of the ideas would be totally overlapping.

2:36:25.240 --> 2:36:28.240
 But his genius would then just run with it far faster than I could.

2:36:28.240 --> 2:36:29.240
 I love the humility here.

2:36:29.240 --> 2:36:36.240
 So let me ask you about sort of practical implications of your ideas to our world, our complicated world.

2:36:36.240 --> 2:36:46.240
 When you look at the big questions of humanity of hate, war, what else is there?

2:36:46.240 --> 2:36:53.240
 Evil, maybe there's the positive aspects of that, of meaning, of love.

2:36:53.240 --> 2:37:01.240
 What is the fact that reality is an illusion perceived?

2:37:01.240 --> 2:37:07.240
 What is the conscious realism when applied to daily life?

2:37:07.240 --> 2:37:09.240
 What kind of impact does it have?

2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:10.240
 A lot.

2:37:10.240 --> 2:37:15.240
 And it's sort of scary.

2:37:15.240 --> 2:37:24.240
 We all know that life is ephemeral and spiritual traditions have said, wake up to the fact that, you know, anything that you do here is going to disappear.

2:37:24.240 --> 2:37:27.240
 But it's even more ephemeral than perhaps we've thought.

2:37:27.240 --> 2:37:30.240
 I see this bottle because I create it right now.

2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:35.240
 As soon as I look away, that data structure has been garbage collected.

2:37:35.240 --> 2:37:38.240
 That bottle, I have to recreate it every time I look.

2:37:38.240 --> 2:37:41.240
 So I spent all my money and I buy this fancy car.

2:37:41.240 --> 2:37:45.240
 That car, I have to keep recreating it every time I look at it.

2:37:45.240 --> 2:37:46.240
 It's that ephemeral.

2:37:46.240 --> 2:37:54.240
 So all the things that we invest ourselves in, we fight over, we kill each other over, we have wars over.

2:37:54.240 --> 2:37:59.240
 These are all, it's just like people in a virtual reality simulation.

2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:02.240
 And there's this Porsche.

2:38:02.240 --> 2:38:04.240
 We all see the Porsche.

2:38:04.240 --> 2:38:07.240
 Well, that Porsche exists when I look at it.

2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:09.240
 I turn my headset and I look at it.

2:38:09.240 --> 2:38:13.240
 And then if Joe turns his headset the right way, he'll see his Porsche.

2:38:13.240 --> 2:38:15.240
 But it's not even the same Porsche that I see.

2:38:15.240 --> 2:38:17.240
 He's creating his own Porsche.

2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:20.240
 So these things are exceedingly ephemeral.

2:38:20.240 --> 2:38:25.240
 And now, just imagine saying that that's my Porsche.

2:38:25.240 --> 2:38:29.240
 Well, you can agree to say that it's your Porsche.

2:38:29.240 --> 2:38:32.240
 But really, the Porsche only exists as long as you look.

2:38:32.240 --> 2:38:38.240
 So this all of a sudden, what the spiritual traditions have been saying for a long, long time,

2:38:38.240 --> 2:38:41.240
 this gets cashed out in mathematically precise science.

2:38:41.240 --> 2:38:47.240
 It's saying ephemeral, yes, in fact, it lasts for a few milliseconds, a few hundred milliseconds while you look at it.

2:38:47.240 --> 2:38:48.240
 And then it's gone.

2:38:48.240 --> 2:38:54.240
 So the whole idea, why are we fighting?

2:38:54.240 --> 2:38:56.240
 Why do we hate?

2:38:56.240 --> 2:39:07.240
 It's, we fight over possessions because we think that we're small little objects inside this preexisting space time.

2:39:07.240 --> 2:39:12.240
 We assume that that mansion and that car exists independent of us.

2:39:12.240 --> 2:39:23.240
 And that somehow we, these little things can have our sense of self and importance enhanced by having that special car or that special house or that special person.

2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:26.240
 In fact, it's just the opposite.

2:39:26.240 --> 2:39:29.240
 You create that mansion every time you look.

2:39:29.240 --> 2:39:32.240
 You're something far deeper than that mansion.

2:39:32.240 --> 2:39:36.240
 You're the entity which can create that mansion on the fly.

2:39:36.240 --> 2:39:41.240
 And there's nothing to the mansion except what you create in this moment.

2:39:41.240 --> 2:39:56.240
 So all of a sudden, when you take this point of view, it has all sorts of implications for how we interact with each other, how we treat each other.

2:39:56.240 --> 2:40:02.240
 And again, a lot of things that spiritual traditions have said, it's a mixed bag.

2:40:02.240 --> 2:40:08.240
 Spiritual traditions are a mixed bag. So let me just be right up front about that. I'm not promoting any particular, but they do have some insights.

2:40:08.240 --> 2:40:09.240
 Yeah, they have wisdom.

2:40:09.240 --> 2:40:10.240
 They have certain wisdom.

2:40:10.240 --> 2:40:14.240
 They have, I can point to nonsense, I won't go into it, but I can also point to lots of nonsense.

2:40:14.240 --> 2:40:19.240
 So the issue is to then, to look for the key insights.

2:40:19.240 --> 2:40:28.240
 And I think they have a lot of insights about the ephemeral nature of objects in space and time and not being attached to them, including our own bodies.

2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:33.240
 And reversing that I'm not this little thing, a little consciousness trapped in the body.

2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:38.240
 And the consciousness itself is only a product of the body. So when the body dies, the consciousness disappears.

2:40:38.240 --> 2:40:42.240
 It turns completely around. The consciousness is fundamental.

2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:47.240
 The body, my hand exists right now because I'm looking at it.

2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:52.240
 My hand is gone. I have no hand. I have no brain. I have no heart.

2:40:52.240 --> 2:41:00.240
 If you looked, you'll see a heart. Whatever I am is this really complicated thing in consciousness.

2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:07.240
 That's what I am. All the stuff that I thought I was is something that I create on the fly and delete.

2:41:07.240 --> 2:41:20.240
 So this is completely a radical restructuring of how we think about possessions, about identity, about survival of death, and so forth.

2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:22.240
 This is completely transformative.

2:41:22.240 --> 2:41:32.240
 But the nice thing is that this whole approach of consciousness, unlike the spiritual traditions, which have said, in some cases, similar things, they've said it imprecisely.

2:41:32.240 --> 2:41:41.240
 This is mathematics. We can actually now begin to state precisely, here's the mathematical model of consciousness, consciousness agents.

2:41:41.240 --> 2:41:45.240
 Here's how it maps onto space time, which I should sketch really briefly.

2:41:45.240 --> 2:41:50.240
 And here's why things are ephemeral.

2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:59.240
 And here's why you shouldn't be worried about the ephemeral nature of things because you're not a little tiny entity inside space and time.

2:41:59.240 --> 2:42:02.240
 Quite the opposite. You're the author of space and time.

2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:15.240
 The I and the AM and the IAM is all kind of emergent through this whole process of evolution and so on. That's just surface waves and there's a much deeper ocean that we're trying to figure out here.

2:42:15.240 --> 2:42:21.240
 So how does you said some of the stuff you're thinking about maps the space time? How does it map the space time?

2:42:21.240 --> 2:42:25.240
 So just a very, very high level. I'll keep it brief.

2:42:25.240 --> 2:42:31.240
 The structures that the physicists are finding, like the Aplatuhedron, it turns out they're just static structure.

2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:33.240
 They're polytopes.

2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:42.240
 But they remarkably, most of the information in them is contained in permutation matrices.

2:42:42.240 --> 2:42:49.240
 So it's a matrix, like an n by n matrix that just has zeros and ones.

2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:51.240
 That contains almost all of the information.

2:42:51.240 --> 2:43:02.240
 And they have these plabic graphs and so forth that they use to boot up the scattering. You can compute those scattering amplitudes almost entirely from these permutation matrices.

2:43:02.240 --> 2:43:08.240
 So that's just, now from my point of view, I have this conscious agent dynamics.

2:43:08.240 --> 2:43:20.240
 It turns out that the stationary dynamics that I was talking about, where the entropy is increasing, all the stationary dynamics are sketched out by

2:43:20.240 --> 2:43:23.240
 permutation matrices.

2:43:23.240 --> 2:43:27.240
 So there's so called Birkhoff polytope.

2:43:27.240 --> 2:43:33.240
 All the vertices of this polytope, all the points are permutation matrices.

2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:42.240
 All the internal points are Markovian kernels that have the uniform measure as a stationary measure.

2:43:42.240 --> 2:43:46.240
 I need to intuit a little better what the heck you're talking about.

2:43:46.240 --> 2:43:54.240
 So basically, there's some complicated thing going on with the network of conscious agents.

2:43:54.240 --> 2:43:56.240
 And that's mappable to this.

2:43:56.240 --> 2:44:05.240
 You're saying a two dimensional matrix that scattering has to do with what, without a perception like that's like photon stuff.

2:44:05.240 --> 2:44:09.240
 I mean, I don't know if it's useful to sort of dig into detail.

2:44:09.240 --> 2:44:11.240
 I'll do just the high level thing.

2:44:11.240 --> 2:44:16.240
 So the high level is the long term behavior of the conscious agent dynamics.

2:44:16.240 --> 2:44:20.240
 So that's the projection of just looking at the long term behavior.

2:44:20.240 --> 2:44:23.240
 I'm hoping we'll give rise to the amplitude Hadron.

2:44:23.240 --> 2:44:27.240
 The amplitude Hadron then gives rise to space time.

2:44:27.240 --> 2:44:37.240
 So then I can just use their link to go all the way from consciousness through its asymptotics to through the amplitude Hadron into space time and get the map all the way into our interface.

2:44:37.240 --> 2:44:42.240
 And that's why you mentioned the permutation matrix because it gives you a nice thing to try to generate.

2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:44.240
 That's right. It's the connection with the amplitude Hadron.

2:44:44.240 --> 2:44:52.240
 The permutation matrices are the core of the amplitude Hadron and it turns out they're the core of the asymptotic description of the conscious agents.

2:44:52.240 --> 2:45:01.240
 So not to sort of bring up the idea of a creator, but I like, first of all, I like video games and you mentioned this kind of simulation idea.

2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:06.240
 First of all, do you think of as an interesting idea, this thought experiment that will live in a simulation?

2:45:06.240 --> 2:45:10.240
 And in general, do you think will live in a simulation?

2:45:10.240 --> 2:45:17.240
 So the Nick Bostrom's idea about the simulation is typically couched in a physicalist framework.

2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:20.240
 Yes. So there is the bottom level.

2:45:20.240 --> 2:45:30.240
 There's some programmer in a physical space time and they have a computer that they've programmed really cleverly where they've created conscious entities.

2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:38.240
 So you have the hard problem of consciousness, right? The standard hard problem. How could a computer simulation create a conscious, which isn't explained by that simulation theory.

2:45:38.240 --> 2:45:49.240
 But then the idea is that the next level, the entities that are created in the first level simulation then can write their own simulations and you get this nesting.

2:45:49.240 --> 2:46:00.240
 So the idea that this is a simulation is fine, but the idea that it starts with a physical space, I think, isn't for this.

2:46:00.240 --> 2:46:03.240
 There's different properties here, the partial rendering.

2:46:03.240 --> 2:46:23.240
 And to me, that's the interesting idea is not whether the entirety of the universe is simulated, but how efficiently can you create interfaces that are convincing to all other entities that can appreciate such interfaces?

2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:25.240
 How little does it take?

2:46:25.240 --> 2:46:36.240
 Because you said partial rendering or temporal, ephemeral rendering of stuff. Only render the tree falling in the forest when there's somebody there to see it.

2:46:36.240 --> 2:46:41.240
 It's interesting to think how can you do that superficially without having to render everything.

2:46:41.240 --> 2:46:49.240
 And that to me is one perspective on the simulation, just like it is with video games, where a video game doesn't have to render every single thing.

2:46:49.240 --> 2:46:52.240
 It's just the thing that the observer is looking at.

2:46:52.240 --> 2:46:55.240
 Right. There is actually, that's a very nice question.

2:46:55.240 --> 2:47:06.240
 And there's whole groups of researchers that are actually studying in virtual reality, what is the sort of minimal requirements on the system?

2:47:06.240 --> 2:47:14.240
 How does it have to operate to give you an immersion experience, to give you the feeling that you have a body to get you to take it real?

2:47:14.240 --> 2:47:16.240
 And there's actually a lot of really good work on that right now.

2:47:16.240 --> 2:47:22.240
 And it turns out it doesn't take that much. You do need to get the perception action loop tight.

2:47:22.240 --> 2:47:27.240
 And you have to give them the perceptions that they're expecting if you want them to.

2:47:27.240 --> 2:47:35.240
 But if you can lead them along, if you give them perceptions that are close to what they're expecting, you can then maybe move their reality around a bit.

2:47:35.240 --> 2:47:41.240
 Yeah, it's a trick engineering problem, especially when you're trying to create a product that costs little.

2:47:41.240 --> 2:47:47.240
 It feels like an engineering problem, not a deeply scientific problem, or meaning obviously it's a scientific problem.

2:47:47.240 --> 2:47:53.240
 But as a scientific problem, it's not that difficult to trick us descendants of apes.

2:47:53.240 --> 2:47:58.240
 But here's a case for just us in our own, if this is a virtual reality that we're experiencing right now.

2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:01.240
 So here's something you can try for yourself.

2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:09.240
 If you just close your eyes and look at your experience in front of you, be aware of your experience in front of you.

2:48:09.240 --> 2:48:17.240
 What you experience is just like a modeled dark gray, where there's all sort of, there's some dynamics to it, but it's just dark gray.

2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:24.240
 But now I ask you, instead of having your attention forward, put your attention backward.

2:48:24.240 --> 2:48:29.240
 What is it like behind you with your eyes closed?

2:48:29.240 --> 2:48:34.240
 And there, it's like nothing.

2:48:34.240 --> 2:48:39.240
 So what is going on here?

2:48:39.240 --> 2:48:44.240
 What am I experiencing back there?

2:48:44.240 --> 2:48:47.240
 I don't know if it's nothing.

2:48:47.240 --> 2:48:52.240
 I guess it's the absence of, it's not even like darkness or something.

2:48:52.240 --> 2:48:54.240
 It's not even darkness.

2:48:54.240 --> 2:48:58.240
 There's no qualia to it.

2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:02.240
 And yet there is a sense of being, and that's the interesting thing.

2:49:02.240 --> 2:49:04.240
 There's a sense of being back.

2:49:04.240 --> 2:49:06.240
 So I put my attention forward.

2:49:06.240 --> 2:49:14.240
 I have the quality of a gray model thing, but when I put my attention backward, there's no quality at all, but there is a sense of being.

2:49:14.240 --> 2:49:18.240
 I personally, now you haven't been to that side of the room.

2:49:18.240 --> 2:49:20.240
 I have been to that side of the room.

2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:28.240
 So for me, memories, I start playing the engine of memory replay.

2:49:28.240 --> 2:49:34.240
 Which is like, I take myself back in time and think about that place where I was hanging out in that part.

2:49:34.240 --> 2:49:36.240
 That's when I see what I'm behind.

2:49:36.240 --> 2:49:38.240
 So that's an interesting quirk of humans too.

2:49:38.240 --> 2:49:44.240
 We're collecting these experiences so we can replay them in interesting ways whenever we feel like it.

2:49:44.240 --> 2:49:48.240
 And it's almost like being there, but not really, but almost.

2:49:48.240 --> 2:49:50.240
 That's right.

2:49:50.240 --> 2:49:52.240
 And yet we can go our entire lives on this.

2:49:52.240 --> 2:49:54.240
 You're talking about the minimal thing for VR.

2:49:54.240 --> 2:50:02.240
 We can go our entire lives and not realize that all of my life, it's been like nothing behind me.

2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:12.240
 We're not even aware that all of our lives, if you just pay attention to what's behind me, you're like, holy smoke.

2:50:12.240 --> 2:50:14.240
 It's scary.

2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:16.240
 It's like nothing.

2:50:16.240 --> 2:50:18.240
 There's no quality of there at all.

2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:20.240
 How did I not notice that my entire life?

2:50:20.240 --> 2:50:22.240
 We're so immersed in the simulation.

2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:24.240
 I mean, you could see this with children, right?

2:50:24.240 --> 2:50:28.240
 With persistence, you know, you could do the peekaboo game.

2:50:28.240 --> 2:50:30.240
 You can hide from them and appear.

2:50:30.240 --> 2:50:32.240
 And they're fully tricked.

2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:34.240
 And in the same way, we're fully tricked.

2:50:34.240 --> 2:50:36.240
 There's nothing behind us.

2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:38.240
 And we assume there is.

2:50:38.240 --> 2:50:40.240
 That's really interesting.

2:50:40.240 --> 2:50:42.240
 These theories are pretty heavy.

2:50:42.240 --> 2:50:44.240
 You as a human being.

2:50:44.240 --> 2:50:46.240
 As a mortal human being.

2:50:46.240 --> 2:50:50.240
 How has these theories been to you personally?

2:50:50.240 --> 2:50:54.240
 There are good days and bad days when you wake up and look in the mirror.

2:50:54.240 --> 2:50:58.240
 And the fact that you can't see anything behind you.

2:50:58.240 --> 2:51:02.240
 The fact that it's rendered like, is there interesting quirks?

2:51:02.240 --> 2:51:08.240
 You know, Nietzsche with his, if you gaze long into the abyss, the abyss gazes into you.

2:51:08.240 --> 2:51:14.240
 How's this theories, these ideas change you as a person?

2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:16.240
 It's been very, very difficult.

2:51:16.240 --> 2:51:21.240
 The stuff is not just abstract theory building because it's about us.

2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:24.240
 Sometimes I've realized that there's this big division of me.

2:51:24.240 --> 2:51:28.240
 My mind is doing all this science and coming up with these conclusions.

2:51:28.240 --> 2:51:30.240
 And the rest of me is not integrating.

2:51:30.240 --> 2:51:32.240
 I was just like, I don't believe it.

2:51:32.240 --> 2:51:34.240
 I just don't believe this.

2:51:34.240 --> 2:51:38.240
 So as I start to take it seriously, I get scared myself.

2:51:38.240 --> 2:51:45.240
 But it's very much, then I read these spiritual traditions and realize they're saying very, very similar things.

2:51:45.240 --> 2:51:48.240
 Like, there's a lot of conversions.

2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:59.240
 So for me, I have, the first time I thought it might be possible that we're not seeing the truth was in 1986.

2:51:59.240 --> 2:52:02.240
 It was from some mathematics we were doing.

2:52:02.240 --> 2:52:06.240
 And when that hit me, it hit me like a ton of bricks.

2:52:06.240 --> 2:52:07.240
 I had to sit down.

2:52:07.240 --> 2:52:11.240
 It was, it really, it was scary.

2:52:11.240 --> 2:52:14.240
 It was really a shock to the system.

2:52:14.240 --> 2:52:26.240
 And then to realize that everything that has been important to me, like, you know, getting a house, getting a car, getting a reputation and so forth.

2:52:26.240 --> 2:52:29.240
 Well, that car is just like the car I see in the virtual reality.

2:52:29.240 --> 2:52:32.240
 It sits there when you perceive it and it's not there.

2:52:32.240 --> 2:52:36.240
 So the whole question of, you know, what am I doing and why?

2:52:36.240 --> 2:52:40.240
 What's, what's worthwhile doing in life?

2:52:40.240 --> 2:52:45.240
 Clearly getting a big house and getting a big car.

2:52:45.240 --> 2:52:48.240
 I mean, we all knew that we were going to die.

2:52:48.240 --> 2:52:50.240
 So we tend not to know that.

2:52:50.240 --> 2:52:52.240
 We tend to hide it, especially when we were young.

2:52:52.240 --> 2:52:54.240
 Before age 30, we don't believe we're going to die.

2:52:54.240 --> 2:52:59.240
 We factually maybe know that you kind of are supposed to, yeah.

2:52:59.240 --> 2:53:04.240
 But they'll figure something out and we'll believe the generation that is the first one that doesn't have to die.

2:53:04.240 --> 2:53:05.240
 That's the kind of thing.

2:53:05.240 --> 2:53:11.240
 But when you really face the fact that you're going to die.

2:53:11.240 --> 2:53:16.240
 And then when I start to look at it from this point of view that, well, this thing was an interface to begin with.

2:53:16.240 --> 2:53:21.240
 So what I'm really is what I'm really going to be doing, just taking off a headset.

2:53:21.240 --> 2:53:27.240
 So I've been playing in a virtual reality game all day and I got lost in the game when I was fighting over a Porsche.

2:53:27.240 --> 2:53:32.240
 And I shot some guys up and I punctured their tires and by got the Porsche.

2:53:32.240 --> 2:53:35.240
 Now I take the headset off and what was that for? Nothing.

2:53:35.240 --> 2:53:38.240
 It was just, it was a data structure and the data structure is gone.

2:53:38.240 --> 2:53:46.240
 So all of the wars, the fighting and the reputations and all this stuff, you know, where it's just a headset.

2:53:46.240 --> 2:53:58.240
 So now, and so my theory says that intellectually, my mind, my emotions rebel all over the place.

2:53:58.240 --> 2:54:02.240
 It's like, you know, and so I have to meditate.

2:54:02.240 --> 2:54:03.240
 I meditate a lot.

2:54:03.240 --> 2:54:16.240
 What percent of the day would you say you spend as a physicalist sort of living life, pretending your car matters, your reputation matter?

2:54:16.240 --> 2:54:19.240
 Like how much was that Tom Wade song?

2:54:19.240 --> 2:54:22.240
 I like my town with a little drop of poison.

2:54:22.240 --> 2:54:25.240
 How much poison do you allow yourself to have?

2:54:25.240 --> 2:54:27.240
 I think my default mode is physicalist.

2:54:27.240 --> 2:54:29.240
 I think that that's just the default.

2:54:29.240 --> 2:54:38.240
 I, when I'm not being conscious, consciously attentive, intellectually consciously attentive.

2:54:38.240 --> 2:54:48.240
 Because if you're just, you're still, if you're tasting coffee and not thinking or drinking or just taking it in the sunset, you're not being intellectual, but you're still experiencing it.

2:54:48.240 --> 2:54:54.240
 So it's when you turn on the like the introspective machine, that's when you can start.

2:54:54.240 --> 2:55:00.240
 And turn off the thinker when I actually just start looking without thinking.

2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:14.240
 So that's, that's when I feel like I all of a sudden I'm starting to see through sort of like, okay, part of, part of the addiction to the interface is all the stories I'm telling about.

2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:17.240
 It's really important for me to get that really important to do that.

2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:28.240
 So I'm telling all these stories and so I'm all wrapped up, almost all of the mind stuff that's going on in my head is about attachment to the interface.

2:55:28.240 --> 2:55:43.240
 And so what I found is that the essentially the only way to really detach from the interface is to literally let go of thoughts altogether.

2:55:43.240 --> 2:55:59.240
 And then all of a sudden, even my identity, you know, my whole history, my name, my education, all this stuff is almost irrelevant because it's just now here is the present moment.

2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:03.240
 And this is, this is the reality right now.

2:56:03.240 --> 2:56:06.240
 And all of that other stuff is an interface story.

2:56:06.240 --> 2:56:15.240
 But this conscious experience right now, this is the only, this is the only reality as far as I can tell the rest of it's a story.

2:56:15.240 --> 2:56:20.240
 And, but that is again, not my default.

2:56:20.240 --> 2:56:30.240
 That is, I have to make a really conscious choice to say, okay, I know intellectually this is all an interface.

2:56:30.240 --> 2:56:33.240
 I'm going to take the headset off and so forth.

2:56:33.240 --> 2:56:39.240
 And, and, and then immediately sink back into the game and just be out there playing the game and get lost.

2:56:39.240 --> 2:56:47.240
 And so I'm always lost in the game unless I literally consciously choose to stop thinking.

2:56:47.240 --> 2:56:55.240
 Isn't it terrifying to acknowledge that to look beyond the game.

2:56:55.240 --> 2:56:59.240
 Isn't it scares the hell out of me.

2:56:59.240 --> 2:57:03.240
 It really is scary because I'm so attached.

2:57:03.240 --> 2:57:04.240
 I'm attached to this body.

2:57:04.240 --> 2:57:05.240
 I'm attached to the interface.

2:57:05.240 --> 2:57:09.240
 Are you ever worried about breaking your brain a bit?

2:57:09.240 --> 2:57:26.240
 Meaning like, it's a, I mean, some of these ideas when you think about reality, even with like Einstein, just realizing, you said interface, just realizing that light,

2:57:26.240 --> 2:57:34.240
 you know, that there's a speed of light and you can't go fast in the speed of light and like what kind of things black holes and can do with light.

2:57:34.240 --> 2:57:36.240
 Even that can mess with your head.

2:57:36.240 --> 2:57:37.240
 Yes.

2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:40.240
 But that's still space time.

2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:44.240
 That's a big mess, but it's still just space time is still a property of our interface.

2:57:44.240 --> 2:57:45.240
 That's right.

2:57:45.240 --> 2:58:01.240
 But it's still like even Einstein realized that this particular thing, some of the stories you tell ourselves is constructing interfaces that are oversimplifying the way things work because it's nice.

2:58:01.240 --> 2:58:03.240
 The stories are nice.

2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:04.240
 Stories are nice.

2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:06.240
 I mean, just like video games.

2:58:06.240 --> 2:58:07.240
 They're nice.

2:58:07.240 --> 2:58:08.240
 Right.

2:58:08.240 --> 2:58:10.240
 But Einstein was a realist, right?

2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:18.240
 He was a famous realist in the sense that he was very explicit in a 1935 paper with Podolski and Rosen, the EPR paper, right?

2:58:18.240 --> 2:58:36.240
 They said, if without in any way disturbing a system, I can predict with probability one, the outcome of a measurement, then there exists in reality that element, right?

2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:37.240
 That value.

2:58:37.240 --> 2:58:42.240
 And we now know from quantum theory that that's false.

2:58:42.240 --> 2:58:47.240
 Einstein's idea of local realism is strictly speaking false.

2:58:47.240 --> 2:58:48.240
 Yeah.

2:58:48.240 --> 2:58:58.240
 And so we can predict, we can set up in quantum theory, you can set up, and there's a paper by Chris Fuchs, quantum Bayesianism, where he scouts this out.

2:58:58.240 --> 2:59:06.240
 It was done by the people, but he gives a good presentation of this where they have a sequence of like something like nine different quantum measurements that you can make.

2:59:06.240 --> 2:59:18.240
 And you can predict with probability one what a particular outcome will be, but you can actually prove that it's impossible that the value existed before you made the measurement.

2:59:18.240 --> 2:59:25.240
 So you know with probability one what you're going to get, but you also know with certainty that that value was not there until you made the measurement.

2:59:25.240 --> 2:59:32.240
 So we know from quantum theory that the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

2:59:32.240 --> 2:59:37.240
 And that is built in to what I'm saying with this theory of consciousness.

2:59:37.240 --> 2:59:42.240
 If consciousness is fundamental, space time itself is an act of fact creation.

2:59:42.240 --> 2:59:46.240
 It's an interface that we create, consciousness creates, plus all the objects in it.

2:59:46.240 --> 2:59:50.240
 So local realism is not true.

2:59:50.240 --> 2:59:54.240
 Quantum theory is established, also non contextual realism is not true.

2:59:54.240 --> 2:59:59.240
 And that fits in perfectly with this idea that consciousness is fundamental.

2:59:59.240 --> 3:00:03.240
 These things are, these exist as data structures when we create them.

3:00:03.240 --> 3:00:08.240
 As Chris Fuchs says, the act of observation is an act of fact creation.

3:00:08.240 --> 3:00:27.240
 But I must say on a personal level, I'm having to spend, I spend a couple hours a day just sitting in meditation on this and facing the rebellion in me.

3:00:27.240 --> 3:00:31.240
 It feels like it goes to the core of my being, rebelling against these ideas.

3:00:31.240 --> 3:00:36.240
 So it's very, very interesting for me to look at this because so here I'm a scientist and I'm a person.

3:00:36.240 --> 3:00:38.240
 The science is really clear.

3:00:38.240 --> 3:00:41.240
 Local realism is false, non contextual realism is false.

3:00:41.240 --> 3:00:43.240
 Space time is doomed.

3:00:43.240 --> 3:00:44.240
 It's very, very clear.

3:00:44.240 --> 3:00:46.240
 It couldn't be clearer.

3:00:46.240 --> 3:00:50.240
 And my emotions rebel left and right.

3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:54.240
 When I sit there and say, okay, I am not something in space and time.

3:00:54.240 --> 3:00:57.240
 Something inside of me says, you're crazy.

3:00:57.240 --> 3:00:58.240
 Of course you are.

3:00:58.240 --> 3:01:00.240
 And I'm completely attached to it.

3:01:00.240 --> 3:01:02.240
 I'm completely attached to all this stuff.

3:01:02.240 --> 3:01:03.240
 I'm attached to my body.

3:01:03.240 --> 3:01:04.240
 I'm attached to the headset.

3:01:04.240 --> 3:01:06.240
 I'm attached to my car.

3:01:06.240 --> 3:01:07.240
 Attached to people.

3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:09.240
 I'm attached to all of it.

3:01:09.240 --> 3:01:14.240
 And yet I know as an absolute fact, I'm going to walk away from all of it.

3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:16.240
 I'm going to die.

3:01:16.240 --> 3:01:21.240
 It'll, you know, in fact, I almost died last year.

3:01:21.240 --> 3:01:23.240
 COVID almost killed me.

3:01:23.240 --> 3:01:26.240
 I, I, I sent a goodbye text to my wife.

3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:29.240
 So I was, I thought, I really did.

3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:30.240
 I sent her a goodbye.

3:01:30.240 --> 3:01:39.240
 I thought I was in the emergency room and it had attacked my heart and it had been at 190 beats per minute for 36 hours.

3:01:39.240 --> 3:01:41.240
 I couldn't last much longer.

3:01:41.240 --> 3:01:43.240
 I knew I couldn't stop it.

3:01:43.240 --> 3:01:46.240
 So that was, that was it.

3:01:46.240 --> 3:01:47.240
 So that was it.

3:01:47.240 --> 3:01:50.240
 So, so I texted her goodbye from the emergency room.

3:01:50.240 --> 3:01:51.240
 I love you.

3:01:51.240 --> 3:01:52.240
 Goodbye kind of thing.

3:01:52.240 --> 3:01:53.240
 Yeah.

3:01:53.240 --> 3:01:54.240
 Right.

3:01:54.240 --> 3:01:55.240
 Yeah.

3:01:55.240 --> 3:01:56.240
 And that was it.

3:01:56.240 --> 3:01:57.240
 So, so were you afraid?

3:01:57.240 --> 3:01:58.240
 Yeah.

3:01:58.240 --> 3:01:59.240
 It scares the hell out of you.

3:01:59.240 --> 3:02:00.240
 Right.

3:02:00.240 --> 3:02:03.240
 But there, there is, there was, you're just feeling so bad anyway.

3:02:03.240 --> 3:02:11.240
 That all, you know, you, that, that sort of you're scared, but you're just feeling so bad that in some sense you just want to stop anyway.

3:02:11.240 --> 3:02:17.240
 So, so I've, I've, I've been there and faced it just, just a year ago.

3:02:17.240 --> 3:02:19.240
 How did that change you, by the way?

3:02:19.240 --> 3:02:25.240
 Having, having this intellectual reality that's so challenging that you meditate on a year, it's just an interface.

3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:35.240
 And one of the, one of the hardest things to come to terms with is that, that means that, you know, it's going to end.

3:02:35.240 --> 3:02:38.240
 How did I change you having come so close to the reality of it?

3:02:38.240 --> 3:02:40.240
 It's not just an intellectual reality.

3:02:40.240 --> 3:02:43.240
 It's, it's a reality of death.

3:02:43.240 --> 3:02:47.240
 It's, it's forced, I've, I've meditated for 20 years now.

3:02:47.240 --> 3:02:52.240
 And then I would say averaging three or four hours a day.

3:02:52.240 --> 3:03:04.240
 But it's put a new urgency, but as it, urgency is not the right word because that, that it's, it, it's riveted my attention.

3:03:04.240 --> 3:03:05.240
 I'll put it that way.

3:03:05.240 --> 3:03:07.240
 It's really riveted my attention.

3:03:07.240 --> 3:03:15.240
 And I've really paid, I spent a lot more time looking at what spiritual traditions say.

3:03:15.240 --> 3:03:21.240
 I don't, by the way, again, not taking it with the, you know, take it all with a green assault.

3:03:21.240 --> 3:03:24.240
 But on the other hand, I think it's stupid for me to ignore it.

3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:34.240
 So I try to listen to the best ideas and, and to sort out nonsense from, and it's just, we all have to do it for ourselves, right?

3:03:34.240 --> 3:03:35.240
 It's not easy.

3:03:35.240 --> 3:03:37.240
 So what makes sense?

3:03:37.240 --> 3:03:43.240
 And I have the advantage of some science so I can look at what science says and try to compare with spiritual tradition.

3:03:43.240 --> 3:03:45.240
 I try to sort it out for myself.

3:03:45.240 --> 3:03:52.240
 And, but then I also look and realize that there's another aspect to me, which is this whole emotional aspect.

3:03:52.240 --> 3:04:01.240
 The, I seem to be wired up as evolutionary psychology says, I'm wired up, right?

3:04:01.240 --> 3:04:07.240
 All these defensive mechanisms, you know, I'm inclined to lie if I need to.

3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:19.240
 I'm inclined to, to be angry, to protect myself, to have an in group and an out group, to try to make my reputation as big as possible, to try to demean the out group.

3:04:19.240 --> 3:04:23.240
 There's all these things that evolutionary psychology is spot on.

3:04:23.240 --> 3:04:26.240
 It's really brilliant about the human condition.

3:04:26.240 --> 3:04:34.240
 And yet I think evolution, as I said, evolutionary theory is a projection of a deeper theory where there may be no competition.

3:04:34.240 --> 3:04:42.240
 So how, so I'm in this very interesting position where I feel like, okay, according to my own theory, I'm consciousness.

3:04:42.240 --> 3:04:47.240
 And maybe this is what it means for consciousness to wake up.

3:04:47.240 --> 3:04:48.240
 It's not easy.

3:04:48.240 --> 3:04:54.240
 It's, it's, it's almost like I have, I feel like I have real skin in the game.

3:04:54.240 --> 3:04:55.240
 It really is scary.

3:04:55.240 --> 3:04:58.240
 I really was scared when I was about to die.

3:04:58.240 --> 3:05:02.240
 It really was hard to say goodbye to my wife.

3:05:02.240 --> 3:05:04.240
 It really, it really pained.

3:05:04.240 --> 3:05:12.240
 And to then look at that and then look at the fact that I'm going to walk away from this anyway, and it's just an interface.

3:05:12.240 --> 3:05:22.240
 How do I, so it's, it's trying to put all this stuff together and really grok it, so to speak, not just intellectually, but grok it at an emotional level.

3:05:22.240 --> 3:05:23.240
 Yeah, what are you afraid of?

3:05:23.240 --> 3:05:29.240
 You silly evolved organism that's gotten way too attached to the interface.

3:05:29.240 --> 3:05:31.240
 What are you really afraid of?

3:05:31.240 --> 3:05:32.240
 That's right.

3:05:32.240 --> 3:05:36.240
 Is there a very personal, you know, it's very, very personal.

3:05:36.240 --> 3:05:37.240
 Yeah.

3:05:37.240 --> 3:05:38.240
 Yeah.

3:05:38.240 --> 3:05:43.240
 I mean, speaking of the text, what do you think is this whole love thing?

3:05:43.240 --> 3:05:48.240
 What's the role of love in our human condition?

3:05:48.240 --> 3:05:57.240
 This interface thing we have this, is this somehow interweaved, interconnected with consciousness, this attachment we have to other humans and this deep.

3:05:57.240 --> 3:06:07.240
 But there's some quality to it that seems very interesting, peculiar.

3:06:07.240 --> 3:06:10.240
 Well, there are two levels I would think about that.

3:06:10.240 --> 3:06:15.240
 There's love in the sexual sense and there's love in a deeper sense.

3:06:15.240 --> 3:06:20.240
 And in the sexual sense, we can give an evolutionary account of that and so forth.

3:06:20.240 --> 3:06:24.240
 And I think that's pretty clear to people.

3:06:24.240 --> 3:06:27.240
 In this deeper sense.

3:06:27.240 --> 3:06:28.240
 Right.

3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:33.240
 So of course, I'm married, I love my wife in a sexual sense, but there is a deeper sense as well.

3:06:33.240 --> 3:06:38.240
 When I was saying goodbye to her, there was a deeper, much deeper love that was really at play there.

3:06:38.240 --> 3:06:44.240
 That's one place where I think that the mixed bag from spiritual traditions has something right.

3:06:44.240 --> 3:06:49.240
 When they say, you know, love your neighbor as yourself, that in some sense, love is fundamental.

3:06:49.240 --> 3:06:53.240
 I think that they're onto something, something very, very deep and profound.

3:06:53.240 --> 3:06:58.240
 And every most of all, I can get a personal glimpse of that.

3:06:58.240 --> 3:07:03.240
 Especially when I'm in the space with no thought.

3:07:03.240 --> 3:07:11.240
 When I can really let go of thoughts, I get little glimpses of a love in the sense that I'm not separate.

3:07:11.240 --> 3:07:16.240
 It's a love in the sense that I'm not different from that.

3:07:16.240 --> 3:07:25.240
 You and I are separate, then I can fight you, but if you and I are the same, if there's a union there.

3:07:25.240 --> 3:07:27.240
 The togetherness of it.

3:07:27.240 --> 3:07:29.240
 Who's God?

3:07:29.240 --> 3:07:36.240
 All those gods, the stories that have been told throughout history, you said through the spiritual traditions.

3:07:36.240 --> 3:07:38.240
 What do you think that is?

3:07:38.240 --> 3:07:44.240
 Is that us trying to find that common thing at the core?

3:07:44.240 --> 3:07:50.240
 Well, in many traditions, not all.

3:07:50.240 --> 3:07:54.240
 The one I was raised in, so my dad was a Protestant minister.

3:07:54.240 --> 3:07:59.240
 We tend to think of God as a being.

3:07:59.240 --> 3:08:02.240
 But I think that that's not right.

3:08:02.240 --> 3:08:12.240
 I think the closest way to think about God is being, period, not a being, but being, the very ground of being itself is God.

3:08:12.240 --> 3:08:14.240
 I think that's the deep.

3:08:14.240 --> 3:08:17.240
 And from my point of view, that's the ground of consciousness.

3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:22.240
 So the ground of conscious being is what we might call God.

3:08:22.240 --> 3:08:28.240
 But the word God has always been, for example, you don't believe the same God as my God, so I'm going to fight you.

3:08:28.240 --> 3:08:36.240
 We'll have wars over, because the specific being that you call God is different from the being that I call God, and so we fight.

3:08:36.240 --> 3:08:46.240
 Whereas if it's not a being, but just being, and you and I share being, then you and I are not separate, and there's no reason to fight.

3:08:46.240 --> 3:08:53.240
 We're both part of that one being, and loving you is loving myself, because we're all part of that one being.

3:08:53.240 --> 3:09:01.240
 The spiritual traditions that point to that, I think, are pointing in a very interesting direction.

3:09:01.240 --> 3:09:11.240
 And that does seem to match with the mathematics of the conscious agent stuff that I've been working on as well, that it really fits with that, although that wasn't my goal.

3:09:11.240 --> 3:09:28.240
 You mentioned that the young physicist that you talk to or whose work you follow have quite a lot of fun breaking with the traditions of the past, the assumptions of the past.

3:09:28.240 --> 3:09:32.240
 What advice would you give to young people today in high school and college?

3:09:32.240 --> 3:09:46.240
 Not just physicists, but in general, how to have a career they can be proud of, how they can have a life they can be proud of, how to make their way in the world from the lessons, from the wins and the losses in your own life.

3:09:46.240 --> 3:09:49.240
 What little insights could you pull out?

3:09:49.240 --> 3:10:00.240
 I would say the universe is a lot more interesting than you might expect, and you are a lot more special and interesting than you might expect.

3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:15.240
 You might think that you're just a little tiny, irrelevant, 100 pound, 200 pound person in a vast billions of light years across space, and that's not the case.

3:10:15.240 --> 3:10:21.240
 You are, in some sense, the being that's creating that space all the time, every time you look.

3:10:21.240 --> 3:10:31.240
 So waking up to who you really are outside of space and time as the author of space and time is the author of everything that you see.

3:10:31.240 --> 3:10:35.240
 The author of space and time.

3:10:35.240 --> 3:10:45.240
 You're the author of space and time, and I'm the author of space and time, and space and time is just one little data structure. Many other consciousnesses are creating other data structures.

3:10:45.240 --> 3:10:48.240
 They're authors of various other things.

3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:57.240
 So realizing, and then realizing that I had this feeling of growing up, reading all these texts, but oh man, it's all been done.

3:10:57.240 --> 3:11:03.240
 If I'd just been there 50 years ago, I could have discovered this stuff, but it's all in the textbooks now.

3:11:03.240 --> 3:11:11.240
 Well, believe me, the textbooks are going to look silly in 50 years, and it's your chance to write the new textbook.

3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:20.240
 So of course, study the current textbooks. You have to understand them. There's no way to progress until you understand what's been done.

3:11:20.240 --> 3:11:26.240
 But then the only limit is your imagination, frankly. That's the only limit.

3:11:26.240 --> 3:11:31.240
 The greatest books, the greatest textbooks ever written on earth are yet to be written.

3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:32.240
 Exactly.

3:11:32.240 --> 3:11:40.240
 What do you think is the meaning of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life from your limited interface?

3:11:40.240 --> 3:11:48.240
 Can you figure it all out? Like why? So you said the universe is kind of trying to figure itself out through us.

3:11:48.240 --> 3:11:53.240
 Why? Why?

3:11:53.240 --> 3:12:02.240
 That's the closest I've come. So I will say that I don't know. But here's my guess, right?

3:12:02.240 --> 3:12:05.240
 That's a good first sentence. That's a good starting point.

3:12:05.240 --> 3:12:10.240
 And maybe that's going to be a profound part of the final answer is to start with the I don't know.

3:12:10.240 --> 3:12:15.240
 It's quite possible that that's really important to start with the I don't know.

3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:23.240
 My guess is that if consciousness is fundamental, and if girdle, girdle's incompleteness theorem holds here,

3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:34.240
 and there's infinite variety of structures for consciousness to some sense explore,

3:12:34.240 --> 3:12:39.240
 that maybe that's what it's about. This is something that Onika and I talked about a little bit,

3:12:39.240 --> 3:12:44.240
 and she doesn't like this way of talking about it. And so I'm going to have to talk with her some more about this way of talking.

3:12:44.240 --> 3:12:49.240
 And now I'll just put it this way and I'll have to talk with her more and see if I can say it more clearly.

3:12:49.240 --> 3:13:02.240
 But the way I'm talking about it now is that there's a sense in which there's being,

3:13:02.240 --> 3:13:10.240
 and then there's experiences or forms that come out of being. That's one deep, deep mystery.

3:13:10.240 --> 3:13:15.240
 The question that you asked, what's it all about? Somehow it's related to that.

3:13:15.240 --> 3:13:22.240
 Why does being, why doesn't it just stay without any forms? Why do we have experiences?

3:13:22.240 --> 3:13:29.240
 Why not just have, when you close your eyes and pay attention to what's behind you, there's nothing.

3:13:29.240 --> 3:13:37.240
 But there's being. Why don't we just stop there? Why didn't we just stop there?

3:13:37.240 --> 3:13:45.240
 Why did we create all tables and chairs and the sun and moon and people, all this really complicated stuff? Why?

3:13:45.240 --> 3:13:53.240
 And all I can guess right now, and I'll probably kick myself in a couple of years and say that was dumb,

3:13:53.240 --> 3:14:00.240
 but all I can guess right now is that somehow consciousness wakes up to itself by knowing what it's not.

3:14:00.240 --> 3:14:09.240
 But here I am, I'm not this body. And I sort of saw that, it was sort of in my face when I sent a text goodbye,

3:14:09.240 --> 3:14:15.240
 but then as soon as I'm better, it's sort of like, okay, I sort of don't want to go there, right?

3:14:15.240 --> 3:14:22.240
 Okay, so I am my body. I go back to the standard thing, I am my body, and I want to get that car,

3:14:22.240 --> 3:14:27.240
 and even though I was just about to die a year ago, so that comes rushing back.

3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:40.240
 So consciousness immerses itself fully into a particular headset, gets lost in it, and then slowly wakes up.

3:14:40.240 --> 3:14:44.240
 Just so it can escape, and that is the waking up, but it needs to have a negative.

3:14:44.240 --> 3:14:50.240
 It needs to know what it's not. It needs to know what you are. You have to say, oh, I'm not that, I'm not that.

3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:52.240
 That wasn't important, that wasn't important.

3:14:52.240 --> 3:15:00.240
 That's really powerful. Don, let me just say that because I've been a long term fan of yours,

3:15:00.240 --> 3:15:05.240
 and we're supposed to have a conversation doing this very difficult moment in your life,

3:15:05.240 --> 3:15:11.240
 let me just say you're a truly special person, and I for one, I know there's a lot of others that agree.

3:15:11.240 --> 3:15:14.240
 I'm glad that you're still here with us on this earth.

3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:26.240
 If for a short time, so whatever the universe, whatever plan it has for you that brought you close to death,

3:15:26.240 --> 3:15:34.240
 to maybe enlighten you some kind of way, I think has an interesting plan for you.

3:15:34.240 --> 3:15:38.240
 You're one of the truly special humans, and it's a huge honor that you sit and talk with me today.

3:15:38.240 --> 3:15:39.240
 Thank you so much.

3:15:39.240 --> 3:15:42.240
 Thank you very much, Lex. I really appreciate that. Thank you.

3:15:42.240 --> 3:15:45.240
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Donald Hoffman.

3:15:45.240 --> 3:15:49.240
 To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description.

3:15:49.240 --> 3:15:53.240
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Albert Einstein,

3:15:53.240 --> 3:15:56.240
 relevant to the ideas discussed in this conversation.

3:15:56.240 --> 3:16:04.240
 Time and space are modes by which we think, and not conditions in which we live.

3:16:04.240 --> 3:16:16.240
 Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
