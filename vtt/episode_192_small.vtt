00:00.000 --> 00:03.200
 The following is a conversation with Charles Hoskinson,

00:03.200 --> 00:06.760
 founder of Cardano, cofounder of Ethereum,

00:06.760 --> 00:09.800
 and a mathematician who's one of the most well read

00:09.800 --> 00:12.200
 and knowledgeable people on the technical side

00:12.200 --> 00:15.600
 of cryptocurrency that I've ever spoken to.

00:15.600 --> 00:20.600
 Quick mention of our sponsors, Gala Games, All Form, Indeed,

00:20.640 --> 00:23.280
 ExpressVPN, and ASleep.

00:23.280 --> 00:26.840
 Check them out in the description to support this podcast.

00:26.840 --> 00:29.040
 As a side note, let me say that Charles

00:29.040 --> 00:32.360
 is not just a mathematician or cryptocurrency innovator,

00:32.360 --> 00:37.360
 but also a Colorado based farmer of bison and mushrooms,

00:38.600 --> 00:41.800
 a gamer, a fisherman, and a world traveler.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.800
 When I asked him if he has a nice professional picture

00:44.800 --> 00:48.240
 of himself, he sent me a picture of him in Mongolia

00:48.240 --> 00:50.400
 with a hawk on his shoulder,

00:50.400 --> 00:52.640
 meeting the Mongolian president.

00:52.640 --> 00:54.440
 That to me pretty much says it all,

00:54.440 --> 00:57.280
 speaking to the humor and the intelligence

00:57.280 --> 00:59.480
 of a man who's bold, innovative,

00:59.480 --> 01:01.960
 and does not shy away from a bit of fun

01:01.960 --> 01:04.000
 and a bit of controversy,

01:04.000 --> 01:06.400
 which makes him a fascinating human being

01:06.400 --> 01:08.280
 to explore ideas with.

01:08.280 --> 01:10.640
 I do want to say in terms of ideas

01:10.640 --> 01:13.560
 that at least to me, cryptocurrency is much bigger

01:13.560 --> 01:16.920
 than just a way for a few Americans to make a quick buck

01:16.920 --> 01:19.160
 through meme driven speculation.

01:19.160 --> 01:22.440
 It is technology that enables freedom from oppression

01:22.440 --> 01:26.680
 from suffering in the world because money is power.

01:26.680 --> 01:30.040
 Mongolia, for example, was a reminder of that for me.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.840
 Next day after talking with Charles,

01:31.840 --> 01:35.560
 I spoke with Wyoming Park, who's a North Korean defector

01:35.560 --> 01:39.240
 and who spent time in Mongolia as many defectors do

01:39.240 --> 01:42.200
 in her and their escape from North Korea.

01:42.200 --> 01:44.920
 Her story, the story of North Korea,

01:44.920 --> 01:47.840
 the story of atrocities throughout the 20th century

01:47.840 --> 01:50.920
 committed by Hitler, Stalin, and others

01:50.920 --> 01:54.480
 is a reminder that the world is full of darkness,

01:54.480 --> 01:57.640
 but it is also full of beauty and love,

01:57.640 --> 01:59.920
 and it is a world worth fighting for

01:59.920 --> 02:01.900
 in every way we know how.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.800
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast,

02:04.800 --> 02:08.260
 and here is my conversation with Charles Hoskinson.

02:09.480 --> 02:11.040
 Let's start with a fun question.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.520
 If we're living in a simulation,

02:13.520 --> 02:16.240
 what programming language do you think it's written in?

02:16.240 --> 02:19.200
 And maybe from a software engineering perspective,

02:19.200 --> 02:21.000
 what do you think are some of the design principles

02:21.000 --> 02:22.360
 that it operates under?

02:22.360 --> 02:24.800
 There are a lot of really lovely papers.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.600
 One came out of MSR, the Autodidactic Universe.

02:27.600 --> 02:29.160
 Did you have a chance to see that?

02:29.160 --> 02:30.000
 Oh, you gotta read it.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.640
 It's like April of 2021, it's just brand new.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.440
 But basically the idea is that the universe

02:34.440 --> 02:36.840
 is like some sort of giant self learning system

02:36.840 --> 02:39.520
 that can self evolve, almost like Nomek.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.240
 And then you have Wolf Ram running around saying,

02:41.240 --> 02:43.440
 hey, we can come up with like very simple rules

02:43.440 --> 02:45.200
 and we can reconstruct all of reality

02:45.200 --> 02:47.680
 at some arbitrary point.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.600
 So I have absolutely no idea what's right.

02:50.600 --> 02:52.880
 I look at it kind of like a formal system and I say,

02:52.880 --> 02:54.920
 well, if you're stuck within the system,

02:54.920 --> 02:56.320
 it's hard to actually understand

02:56.320 --> 02:57.840
 that you're inside the system.

02:57.840 --> 03:01.680
 It's kind of like an object language to a meta language.

03:01.680 --> 03:03.760
 There's this thing that is outside of it,

03:03.760 --> 03:06.720
 but because you're constrained and limited by the simulation,

03:06.720 --> 03:09.160
 you can't really understand the nature of the thing

03:09.160 --> 03:10.800
 that's outside of it.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.040
 It's almost like Minecraft.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.880
 You can build these redstone computers within Minecraft

03:14.880 --> 03:16.600
 and simulate and emulate things within it,

03:16.600 --> 03:19.360
 but you really can't go outside of that environment.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.120
 The people outside of it can formally prove

03:21.120 --> 03:22.760
 that it's correct or whatever,

03:22.760 --> 03:24.680
 but the creatures inside of the system

03:24.680 --> 03:27.200
 can't hope to perfectly understand

03:27.200 --> 03:28.800
 and improve something about it.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.080
 Well, also the question is, it's a computation question.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.240
 Does P equal NP?

03:33.240 --> 03:35.280
 Because you'd have to be able to emulate all of these.

03:35.280 --> 03:36.240
 How long will it take?

03:36.240 --> 03:37.080
 Yeah, exactly.

03:37.080 --> 03:39.800
 And so I have no clue what type of language

03:39.800 --> 03:41.120
 it would have to look like,

03:41.120 --> 03:44.680
 but it would probably not be anything we're used to

03:44.680 --> 03:45.520
 at the moment.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.520
 It'd have to be something else.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.640
 And we'd have to have some more fundamental resolution

03:48.640 --> 03:50.760
 of the relationship of these formal systems

03:50.760 --> 03:52.200
 and how they get extended.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.680
 So that's like a 22nd century question instead of a 21st century.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.800
 Do you like, do you find this Steven Wolfram idea compelling?

03:58.800 --> 04:01.440
 It's a very different way of programming,

04:01.440 --> 04:03.120
 which is you set some rules,

04:03.120 --> 04:05.120
 you set some initial conditions and let it run

04:05.120 --> 04:06.080
 and see what happens.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.560
 Yeah, and it's not a new concept.

04:07.560 --> 04:09.680
 I mean, like the Santa Fe Institute's been doing that

04:09.680 --> 04:12.720
 for a long time and you can use it for economic modeling

04:12.720 --> 04:14.600
 and you can show that in certain cases,

04:14.600 --> 04:16.280
 there's this concept of simple rules

04:16.280 --> 04:18.120
 evolving into a complex system

04:18.120 --> 04:20.240
 is somewhat more predictive

04:20.240 --> 04:23.520
 than trying to build a complex top down model for things.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.880
 And I guess there's some analogies, these things in AI

04:25.880 --> 04:27.520
 where you start with some simple things

04:27.520 --> 04:29.520
 and then somehow it just figures stuff out

04:29.520 --> 04:30.920
 in its environment over time

04:30.920 --> 04:32.760
 and much better than if you actually tried to model it

04:32.760 --> 04:35.720
 with prologue or something like that.

04:35.720 --> 04:40.720
 So that is exciting because you get to just do a few things,

04:40.800 --> 04:43.120
 let the thing run and then see what happens.

04:43.120 --> 04:43.960
 And that's a lot of fun.

04:43.960 --> 04:46.440
 In fact, it got so exciting Wolfram came to us

04:46.440 --> 04:48.400
 and he said, hey, let's do an NFT marketplace.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.240
 So I said, what do you want to do?

04:49.240 --> 04:51.480
 And he said, I got all these universes to sell.

04:51.480 --> 04:54.640
 I said, okay, well, that's going to be fun.

04:54.640 --> 04:56.120
 So we're going to set up an auction system

04:56.120 --> 04:57.280
 or something like that with him.

04:57.280 --> 05:00.000
 And I think maybe end of this month or next month,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.800
 we'll figure out how to do NFTs on Cardano

05:02.800 --> 05:04.520
 with Wolfram universes.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.840
 So as soon as we can sell one, I'll give you one.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.880
 And then we can all just claim that we're living

05:08.880 --> 05:10.680
 in some sort of Wolfram simulation.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.120
 I don't know how much money I have,

05:12.120 --> 05:15.360
 but I'm going to give everything I have to get rule 30,

05:15.360 --> 05:18.240
 which is one of his universes that he's created.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.760
 One of the ones, one of the first ones

05:19.760 --> 05:24.240
 where he discovered some interesting complexities.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.920
 I think world 30 is turned complete or is that 45?

05:26.920 --> 05:28.600
 I can't remember which one.

05:28.600 --> 05:29.680
 You know your stuff.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.160
 Actually, I'm not sure if they proved anything

05:31.160 --> 05:33.280
 about rule 30 in terms of whether it's turned complete

05:33.280 --> 05:35.920
 or not, but there's fun competitions on it,

05:35.920 --> 05:38.080
 which is trying to predict something about rule 30

05:38.080 --> 05:39.280
 about the way it evolves.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.440
 And so far, nobody's been able to do it.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.320
 Just like looking at the middle column,

05:43.320 --> 05:45.520
 try to predict as the system evolves,

05:45.520 --> 05:49.480
 say anything like conclusive about the future

05:49.480 --> 05:50.920
 of the system as it evolves.

05:50.920 --> 05:51.880
 It's fascinating.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.560
 It's both beautiful that simple rules

05:54.560 --> 05:56.600
 can create that kind of complexity.

05:56.600 --> 06:01.600
 And it's also sad that we can't make perfect sense of it,

06:03.160 --> 06:05.880
 like perfectly predict the future.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.200
 Even though it's all simple and deterministic,

06:08.200 --> 06:09.760
 we can't say something conclusive

06:09.760 --> 06:12.240
 about when the thing will end.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.160
 When will this little cellular automata

06:14.160 --> 06:15.680
 like evolve in a certain way

06:15.680 --> 06:17.320
 and then nuclear weapons will be invented

06:17.320 --> 06:18.280
 and they blow each other up

06:18.280 --> 06:21.440
 and then it'll just be this empty 1D cellular automata.

06:21.440 --> 06:23.200
 Well, doesn't that make it fun though?

06:24.200 --> 06:27.160
 Yeah, it's fun, but when you're trying to create

06:27.160 --> 06:32.160
 and we'll talk about something that operates the economy

06:32.880 --> 06:36.000
 and the way humans transact and cooperate

06:36.000 --> 06:39.360
 and fall in love and work together,

06:39.360 --> 06:41.160
 then you'd like to be a little bit more formal

06:41.160 --> 06:42.800
 and try to say something conclusive.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.920
 If this entire universe is just cellular automata,

06:45.920 --> 06:49.480
 then being conclusive is kind of hopeless,

06:49.480 --> 06:50.440
 generally speaking.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.960
 And the hope is, I guess,

06:51.960 --> 06:56.960
 that there will be pockets within the cellular automata

06:57.360 --> 06:58.760
 where you could be predictive,

06:58.760 --> 07:01.960
 where you can formally show that something is true

07:01.960 --> 07:03.600
 and then you can rely on that.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.400
 You'll be resilient and all those kinds of things,

07:05.400 --> 07:08.760
 even though the rest of the thing is a giant mess

07:08.760 --> 07:09.600
 that's unpredictable.

07:09.600 --> 07:11.160
 They call that Laplace's demon.

07:11.160 --> 07:14.520
 Yes, I wonder what the demon's up to these days.

07:14.520 --> 07:17.440
 Okay, thank you for entertaining me with that.

07:17.440 --> 07:19.480
 But sticking on philosophy,

07:19.480 --> 07:22.120
 you've also mentioned, among others,

07:22.120 --> 07:24.720
 that Bertrand Russell and Saul Kripke

07:24.720 --> 07:26.920
 are two of your favorite philosophers.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.080
 Maybe you can comment on what ideas of theirs

07:30.080 --> 07:33.800
 you find insightful and also what to use the difference

07:33.800 --> 07:37.320
 because you're both an engineer and a thinker.

07:37.320 --> 07:38.520
 So what to use the difference

07:38.520 --> 07:40.640
 between philosophy and computer science?

07:40.640 --> 07:44.000
 Yeah, so yeah, there's both a deeply human element

07:44.000 --> 07:45.480
 to both Russell and Saul.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.800
 And then there's this, of course, amazing work

07:47.800 --> 07:50.960
 that they did in the late 19th and 20th century.

07:50.960 --> 07:54.400
 And you can't really talk about Russell or Saul

07:54.400 --> 07:57.880
 without also mentioning Wittgenstein and Tarski,

07:58.880 --> 08:00.840
 because when you actually look at these guys

08:00.840 --> 08:01.680
 and you put them together,

08:01.680 --> 08:02.880
 what they were attempting to do

08:02.880 --> 08:05.120
 was increase the level of precision we had

08:05.120 --> 08:06.880
 in analyzing both formal languages

08:06.880 --> 08:09.000
 and also language in general.

08:09.000 --> 08:11.560
 And so Wittgenstein makes no sense at all to me.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.640
 So there's amazing people out there

08:13.640 --> 08:15.480
 that somehow can parse that, but...

08:15.480 --> 08:17.280
 He doesn't make sense to himself either.

08:17.280 --> 08:18.280
 I think you're right about that.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.280
 However, Kripke has Kripkenstein, you know,

08:20.280 --> 08:24.560
 is he has his whole building on that, right?

08:24.560 --> 08:25.840
 And he built a whole higher,

08:25.840 --> 08:27.640
 and at least there I have modal logic

08:27.640 --> 08:30.440
 and I have the little boxes and I have the diamonds

08:30.440 --> 08:31.800
 and I can do a computation

08:31.800 --> 08:33.840
 and I can kind of reason about things

08:33.840 --> 08:35.600
 that our people are saying.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.280
 But it really was all just about precision

08:38.280 --> 08:39.640
 and the nature of truth,

08:39.640 --> 08:42.000
 precision and the nature of necessity and possibility.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.520
 And the magic of these statements is that

08:44.520 --> 08:47.480
 you can then start getting a better understanding

08:47.480 --> 08:52.120
 of basically how far a formal language can take you.

08:52.120 --> 08:53.720
 And so that's the work of it.

08:53.720 --> 08:55.720
 And David Hilbert also did the same thing.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.760
 And in Russell, he got his career started

08:57.760 --> 08:59.080
 working with Alfred North Whitehead.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.480
 He was a logician and there was this whole desire

09:01.480 --> 09:04.680
 in late 19th century mathematics to formalize mathematics

09:04.680 --> 09:07.760
 in a completely new and better way.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.000
 And they started with geometry

09:09.000 --> 09:11.600
 and Hilbert's geometry was like a complete system,

09:11.600 --> 09:13.280
 although recently we've discovered

09:13.280 --> 09:14.560
 there's a few holes in that.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.200
 But for the most part is complete

09:16.200 --> 09:20.480
 and the axioms are independent and they're consistent.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.080
 And they said, oh, well now we can do this

09:22.080 --> 09:23.120
 for all of mathematics.

09:23.120 --> 09:26.680
 And Russell and Whitehead wrote this huge set of books

09:26.680 --> 09:28.960
 like two big books, Principia Mathematica,

09:28.960 --> 09:32.240
 a thousand pages and the conclusions one plus one equals two.

09:32.240 --> 09:34.400
 So they linked set theory and arithmetic

09:34.400 --> 09:36.440
 and logic all in these beautiful ways.

09:36.440 --> 09:40.320
 Then little by little as we entered the 20th century,

09:40.320 --> 09:42.600
 logicians started chipping away at this idea

09:42.600 --> 09:43.680
 that you could actually construct

09:43.680 --> 09:45.960
 a complete system of mathematics.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.240
 First with Girdle and then later

09:47.240 --> 09:49.480
 with the work of Turing and Church and others.

09:49.480 --> 09:52.080
 They said, oh, you're not complete, you're not decidable.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.480
 And so suddenly Russell was left in this really bad position

09:55.480 --> 09:59.240
 where his early life's work was basically forgotten.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.840
 So he had to kind of reinvent himself.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.080
 And so he went into ethics

10:02.080 --> 10:03.640
 and he went into different fields of philosophy.

10:03.640 --> 10:05.640
 He became just Titan in analytic philosophy

10:05.640 --> 10:08.040
 and he was also a great pacifist

10:08.040 --> 10:10.400
 and he was just a phenomenal writer.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.920
 You know, if you read Why I'm Not a Christian

10:12.920 --> 10:16.000
 or any of his other attacks on metaphysics, you know,

10:16.000 --> 10:18.480
 he said, look, I can only deal with the world I'm in

10:18.480 --> 10:19.920
 in the senses that I have.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.880
 And if I can deduce it, I believe it.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.320
 If it's outside of that,

10:23.320 --> 10:25.920
 I really can't make meaningful statements about it.

10:25.920 --> 10:28.280
 And he said it in a lovely English prose

10:28.280 --> 10:30.240
 that you would expect of a man of his stature.

10:30.240 --> 10:33.240
 Now, Sol Crickory, it was like the complete opposite.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.560
 This guy's really down to earth, dude,

10:35.560 --> 10:36.920
 not aristocratic at all.

10:36.920 --> 10:38.680
 And, you know, he was one of those guys

10:38.680 --> 10:40.280
 that just could have done anything

10:40.280 --> 10:42.080
 because he was so, he's so brilliant.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.160
 I guess he's still alive.

10:43.160 --> 10:44.280
 I think he's 80 something.

10:44.280 --> 10:45.640
 Yeah, exactly.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.120
 Yeah, he's getting up there, man.

10:47.120 --> 10:49.040
 But I mean, literally when he was in high school,

10:49.040 --> 10:52.000
 he wrote these papers and logic and Harvard contacted him

10:52.000 --> 10:55.080
 and said, hey, could you teach graduate courses at Harvard?

10:55.080 --> 10:57.160
 And he said, no, I really would like to finish high school

10:57.160 --> 10:59.880
 first before I go and teach grad school at Harvard.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.400
 And so this is just one of those guys

11:01.400 --> 11:03.400
 that you can see through his work

11:03.400 --> 11:05.160
 that he can think deeply about anything.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.200
 He's like the Galois of philosophy.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.920
 And he chose to try to clean up a lot of the messes

11:10.920 --> 11:12.720
 that Tarski and others couldn't resolve.

11:12.720 --> 11:15.280
 He said, let's really get serious about the nature of truth.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.640
 Let's really try to resolve paradoxes.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.920
 Let's really try to build things in such a way

11:19.920 --> 11:21.920
 that the work that we leave behind

11:21.920 --> 11:23.520
 can actually be built upon

11:23.520 --> 11:26.680
 and it's not thrown away every 50 years or 100 years.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.400
 And it was the same for Tarski, he comes in,

11:28.400 --> 11:31.280
 he says, we mathematicians love this concept of truth,

11:31.280 --> 11:33.880
 but yet we've never really created a nice rigorous definition

11:33.880 --> 11:36.560
 that doesn't have paradoxes embedded inside of it.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.160
 So he had to invent meta languages and object languages,

11:39.160 --> 11:40.840
 all these notions and so forth.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.440
 So I really like those four if you think about them

11:43.440 --> 11:46.000
 and there's a lot of great lessons.

11:46.000 --> 11:49.560
 And where it's relevant today is you have human beings

11:49.560 --> 11:50.400
 and you have computers

11:50.400 --> 11:52.000
 and they're trying to understand each other.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.680
 And computers live in the formal world

11:53.680 --> 11:56.000
 and human beings live in the natural language world

11:56.000 --> 11:58.280
 and those bridges between those two

11:58.280 --> 12:00.920
 are still not completely clear.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.120
 And so a lot of the work that these guys were doing

12:03.120 --> 12:04.280
 the 20th century, 19th century

12:04.280 --> 12:06.160
 had nothing at all to do with that

12:06.160 --> 12:09.040
 but gives you hope that perhaps a bridge can exist

12:09.040 --> 12:10.040
 between those two worlds.

12:10.040 --> 12:11.960
 And maybe there are some nice tools

12:11.960 --> 12:13.600
 for that bridge to be built upon.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.080
 And maybe that in some way will allow computers

12:16.080 --> 12:17.080
 to better understand us.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.120
 I mean, they've even created languages,

12:19.120 --> 12:21.760
 natural spoken languages that are completely ambiguity free

12:21.760 --> 12:23.800
 like Logebon and things like that.

12:23.800 --> 12:24.640
 What?

12:24.640 --> 12:25.480
 Yeah, right.

12:25.480 --> 12:27.560
 L O J B A N Logebon.

12:27.560 --> 12:29.240
 It's based on a language called log land

12:29.240 --> 12:30.960
 and it's a spoken language

12:30.960 --> 12:33.320
 that's equivalent to first order predicate calculus.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.160
 Oh, interesting.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.160
 So no ambiguities.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.640
 It's logically consistent.

12:36.640 --> 12:37.640
 Yeah.

12:37.640 --> 12:38.480
 Logebon.

12:38.480 --> 12:40.080
 But can you still have fun in it?

12:40.080 --> 12:40.920
 You can get very...

12:40.920 --> 12:42.240
 Can you write poetry or what?

12:42.240 --> 12:44.560
 There's people who actually write poetry in Logebon.

12:44.560 --> 12:46.560
 I'm gonna switch to that and start tweeting in it.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.120
 Yeah, there you go.

12:48.120 --> 12:49.920
 So, you know, there's a lot there

12:49.920 --> 12:52.120
 and they're just fun to study and think about.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.320
 And unfortunately, if you go down that rabbit hole,

12:54.320 --> 12:56.840
 you'll spend way, way too much time

12:56.840 --> 12:58.000
 and there's diminishing returns.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.280
 Now, the second question you asked was one on

13:00.280 --> 13:03.280
 theoretical computer science to, I guess, engineering.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.120
 Philosophy.

13:04.120 --> 13:04.960
 No, no, no, no.

13:04.960 --> 13:05.800
 Plus.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.640
 So first step, you said humans and computers.

13:07.640 --> 13:08.480
 Right.

13:08.480 --> 13:11.520
 So theoretical computer science is theory of the computer

13:11.520 --> 13:14.440
 and philosophy is the theory of the human.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.560
 And then we can dissect different stuff about the computer,

13:17.560 --> 13:20.520
 but in terms of these two worlds of the theory of the human,

13:20.520 --> 13:22.880
 which is philosophy and the theory of the computer,

13:22.880 --> 13:23.840
 which is computer science,

13:23.840 --> 13:25.560
 what do you think is the difference?

13:25.560 --> 13:29.240
 Like, as we try to bridge that gap, as you mentioned,

13:29.240 --> 13:33.040
 what is going to be the biggest challenge?

13:33.040 --> 13:35.800
 Like, can we formalize love?

13:35.800 --> 13:39.280
 Can we formalize music, art, poetry, all that kind of stuff?

13:39.280 --> 13:42.040
 Or is that a human nonsense that we need to get rid of?

13:42.040 --> 13:43.760
 No, I don't think it's human nonsense at all.

13:43.760 --> 13:44.960
 I mean, there's even attempts

13:44.960 --> 13:47.360
 to create algorithmically generated music.

13:47.360 --> 13:50.440
 And, you know, the question is love just strictly

13:50.440 --> 13:54.720
 a chemical phenomenon or something like metaphysical about it

13:54.720 --> 13:59.040
 or transcendent of some sort of formal system.

13:59.040 --> 14:00.600
 I mean, computer science is just saying,

14:00.600 --> 14:03.840
 hey, we have this notion of computing.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.040
 We have this brain that we've constructed,

14:06.040 --> 14:08.240
 this formal system that we've built.

14:08.240 --> 14:11.360
 And given that we have it, what can we do with it?

14:11.360 --> 14:13.440
 And so some people worry about the roots

14:13.440 --> 14:14.920
 of the tree of knowledge,

14:14.920 --> 14:17.080
 the great Yggdrasil of computer science.

14:17.080 --> 14:18.160
 They worry about the roots and say,

14:18.160 --> 14:20.080
 how far can we grow them?

14:20.080 --> 14:22.880
 And let's keep adding these new models of computation.

14:22.880 --> 14:25.560
 And other people worry about the trunk of the tree

14:25.560 --> 14:28.000
 and some people worry about the leaves of the tree.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.560
 And the more advanced the field gets,

14:30.560 --> 14:32.400
 the closer and closer it gets

14:32.400 --> 14:34.920
 to the people who constructed it, us.

14:34.920 --> 14:37.600
 You know, we have better image processing.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.000
 We have better ways of handling speech to text.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.680
 And we have better ways of computers kind of understanding

14:42.680 --> 14:45.160
 the intent of what a human being is saying.

14:45.160 --> 14:46.760
 And then the question is, well,

14:46.760 --> 14:50.120
 how will a computer understand love or poetry or music?

14:50.120 --> 14:52.840
 Well, it'll understand it the same way we understand it.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.840
 You have to get a computer to grow up to a point

14:54.840 --> 14:56.360
 where it can learn the way we learn

14:56.360 --> 14:58.400
 or as close to it as possible.

14:58.400 --> 15:00.360
 Then you just expose it to the things

15:00.360 --> 15:01.480
 that we were exposed with.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.320
 And then at some point,

15:02.320 --> 15:04.720
 the computer will start creating things.

15:04.720 --> 15:07.120
 So the question is, well, how do you quantify creativity?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.360
 And I have no clue about that.

15:09.360 --> 15:10.200
 But it's just...

15:10.200 --> 15:12.160
 You make it into an NFT and see how much it sells for.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.440
 That's one way.

15:14.440 --> 15:15.280
 Yeah.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.360
 But basically, yeah, there's so much of a subjective.

15:18.360 --> 15:21.240
 And that that's a fascinating whole area of,

15:21.240 --> 15:23.560
 that I'm fascinated with this human robot interaction

15:23.560 --> 15:27.360
 is how do we create compelling experiences

15:27.360 --> 15:28.560
 that are subjectively compelling,

15:28.560 --> 15:31.120
 whether it's art or just two humans talking

15:31.120 --> 15:33.440
 or two humans interacting in some kind of way

15:33.440 --> 15:36.880
 to maximize the richness of the subjective experience.

15:36.880 --> 15:38.960
 And I think that could be an optimization problem

15:38.960 --> 15:39.780
 that could be solved.

15:39.780 --> 15:40.840
 We're solving it all the time.

15:40.840 --> 15:41.680
 Right.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.640
 Human civilization is constantly trying to,

15:43.640 --> 15:46.880
 we're constantly trying to impress each other.

15:46.880 --> 15:48.600
 We're younger trying to get laid.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.920
 Right.

15:49.920 --> 15:53.080
 Whatever, fall in love, impress your boss at work

15:53.080 --> 15:54.200
 by all the awesome stuff you do.

15:54.200 --> 15:56.360
 I mean, we're trying to optimize that problem

15:56.360 --> 15:59.440
 that's purely, for the most part, subjective.

15:59.440 --> 16:00.280
 Right.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.600
 Did you ever watch Blade Runner 2049?

16:01.600 --> 16:02.440
 Yes.

16:02.440 --> 16:03.280
 Yeah.

16:03.280 --> 16:05.240
 Did you remember the whole relationship between joy and K?

16:05.240 --> 16:06.400
 You know, and like,

16:06.400 --> 16:08.760
 did she really love him, the hologram or not?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.840
 Was it like fake love or real love?

16:10.840 --> 16:13.680
 Fake it till you make it is my view on love.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.720
 No comment from Charles.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.560
 So let's go to the difference

16:17.560 --> 16:22.560
 between theoretical computer science and software engineering.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.840
 Or I don't know if you draw a distinction,

16:24.840 --> 16:27.200
 but if we look into this computer world now,

16:27.200 --> 16:29.720
 is there a difference between theory,

16:29.720 --> 16:31.400
 things you can say formally,

16:31.400 --> 16:34.800
 and the pragmatic implementation of that theory

16:34.800 --> 16:36.920
 into actual systems that people use?

16:36.920 --> 16:37.760
 Yeah.

16:37.760 --> 16:40.200
 Which I guess we'll call software engineering.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.840
 So, you know, the engineer,

16:41.840 --> 16:43.320
 they're obsessed with the domain of,

16:43.320 --> 16:44.520
 well, what do you want to accomplish

16:44.520 --> 16:46.280
 and who are you accomplishing it for?

16:46.280 --> 16:48.520
 So they live in the world of people,

16:48.520 --> 16:49.840
 if they're good engineers.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.200
 And they say, okay, what's the experience?

16:52.200 --> 16:54.280
 You know, how are we going to use this?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.720
 Why are we going to use this?

16:55.720 --> 16:57.240
 What's the commercial application?

16:57.240 --> 16:59.320
 What's the noncommercial application?

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
 And you collect all these business requirements.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.360
 And once you've done all of that,

17:03.360 --> 17:04.800
 the better job you do,

17:04.800 --> 17:07.880
 the more self evident it is of how do we apply

17:07.880 --> 17:10.440
 the toys and tools of computer science

17:10.440 --> 17:13.200
 and other such things to actually resolve that.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.760
 And the point of theoretical computer science

17:15.760 --> 17:17.560
 from the software engineering domain

17:17.560 --> 17:20.120
 is it can tell you kind of where your guardrails are.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.320
 It won't make perfect programs.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.240
 And there's no such thing as that.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.960
 But rather it can give you a good notion and sense

17:26.960 --> 17:30.720
 that your program has some desirable properties.

17:30.720 --> 17:33.320
 Like maybe it'll, you can prove that it can terminate

17:33.320 --> 17:34.960
 if you're dealing with total programs

17:34.960 --> 17:37.880
 or maybe you can prove you'll never have a buffer overflow

17:37.880 --> 17:40.280
 or, you know, you'll demote divide by zero somewhere

17:40.280 --> 17:41.160
 or something like that.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.120
 You know, some event won't occur

17:43.120 --> 17:45.640
 that'll cause a catastrophic failure in your system.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.680
 But there's always this combinatorial explosion

17:47.680 --> 17:50.720
 between what you can test and think about

17:50.720 --> 17:52.840
 and what you can actually code.

17:52.840 --> 17:55.080
 So the stuff on the left hand side lives

17:55.080 --> 17:57.680
 in a different cartonality, a different universe.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.880
 There's something significantly larger there.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.800
 And the tools on the right hand side, you know,

18:01.800 --> 18:04.600
 we have property based testing and these SAT solvers.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.760
 We have all this great stuff here in formal methods land

18:07.760 --> 18:09.560
 and computer science theory land,

18:09.560 --> 18:11.720
 but there's only a small subset of things

18:11.720 --> 18:14.600
 that they actually give you good answers about.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.200
 So the balance of the two things is basically saying,

18:17.200 --> 18:18.880
 well, what do you care about

18:18.880 --> 18:20.920
 and what are you okay throwing away?

18:20.920 --> 18:22.680
 That's the art of engineering

18:22.680 --> 18:24.800
 and building these types of things.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.360
 So, you know, cryptocurrencies,

18:26.360 --> 18:28.840
 we deal with these complex distributed systems

18:28.840 --> 18:33.000
 that have cryptography and game theory and Byzantine actors.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
 So the balance there is saying,

18:35.000 --> 18:37.840
 okay, what can't fail in that system?

18:37.840 --> 18:39.120
 And that's the kind of stuff

18:39.120 --> 18:42.360
 that you want to apply as heavy a tool set as you can,

18:42.360 --> 18:44.120
 because when that stuff fails,

18:44.120 --> 18:46.240
 you either have the loss of billions of dollars,

18:46.240 --> 18:48.560
 privacy or potentially even life,

18:48.560 --> 18:50.840
 depending on how these systems get adopted.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.920
 But then other things, you know, what can fail?

18:52.920 --> 18:55.360
 Is it okay if the block doesn't get made, you know,

18:55.360 --> 18:58.240
 every now and then, is it okay if your latency goes up

18:58.240 --> 19:01.280
 or your network suddenly becomes asynchronous

19:01.280 --> 19:02.920
 and, you know, you disconnect from it,

19:02.920 --> 19:05.400
 you have to restart the computer or something like that.

19:05.400 --> 19:06.560
 That's probably okay.

19:06.560 --> 19:09.040
 It's an inconvenience and burden to the user.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.880
 And if you actually try to chase that tail,

19:10.880 --> 19:13.640
 you'll end up spending 10 years chasing phantoms and ghosts.

19:13.640 --> 19:16.200
 And meanwhile, the whole world moves on.

19:16.200 --> 19:18.280
 So it's really figuring out those balance of the two.

19:18.280 --> 19:21.680
 And what's really beautiful is that the formal methods tools

19:21.680 --> 19:24.280
 have gotten so much better over the last 20 years

19:24.280 --> 19:27.680
 in particular, mostly because of incredibly high investments

19:27.680 --> 19:31.080
 from Microsoft and Google and big universities,

19:31.080 --> 19:34.960
 because these guys are building these gargantuan systems.

19:34.960 --> 19:36.200
 If you look at the Googleplex

19:36.200 --> 19:37.920
 or what Amazon has or others,

19:37.920 --> 19:40.720
 and they have so much value, so many users,

19:40.720 --> 19:41.800
 so many things going on,

19:41.800 --> 19:44.520
 and no person can keep that in their head.

19:44.520 --> 19:46.440
 And so you're talking about systems

19:46.440 --> 19:48.440
 may have 10 million lines of code,

19:48.440 --> 19:51.880
 15 million lines of code, millions of nodes connecting,

19:51.880 --> 19:53.640
 faulty processes happening all the time,

19:53.640 --> 19:56.080
 hackers breaking in on a regular basis.

19:56.080 --> 19:58.080
 So when you're trying to model all of that,

19:58.080 --> 19:59.240
 trying to ask yourself,

19:59.240 --> 20:01.760
 what formal guarantees and properties can I get

20:01.760 --> 20:04.440
 to simplify this system as much as possible?

20:04.440 --> 20:06.440
 So instead of the applications of formal methods

20:06.440 --> 20:08.080
 slowing you down, in many cases,

20:08.080 --> 20:11.200
 it actually massively reduces your debugging time

20:11.200 --> 20:13.200
 and your ability to find where errors occur.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.480
 In some cases, you can't find where errors occur

20:15.480 --> 20:17.320
 and set these massive concurrent systems.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.320
 And you say, well, where are cryptocurrencies going?

20:19.320 --> 20:21.480
 We're talking about just the same thing,

20:21.480 --> 20:23.560
 but we're talking about a much more hostile

20:23.560 --> 20:25.880
 operating environment where instead of it running

20:25.880 --> 20:28.760
 in a pristine data center in California somewhere,

20:28.760 --> 20:30.280
 it's running on your cell phone.

20:30.280 --> 20:31.480
 It's running on your mom's phone.

20:31.480 --> 20:32.520
 It's running your dad's phone.

20:32.520 --> 20:35.360
 It's running on some computer in Mongolia

20:35.360 --> 20:37.640
 that may have good internet on Tuesday,

20:37.640 --> 20:39.160
 but not any other day.

20:39.160 --> 20:40.800
 So when you live in that kind of environment,

20:40.800 --> 20:42.760
 you really do need to think carefully

20:42.760 --> 20:44.880
 about a whole new class of protocols.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.160
 And then you need to think carefully

20:46.160 --> 20:48.240
 about a whole new class of tools and techniques

20:48.240 --> 20:50.680
 to test the reliability of those systems.

20:50.680 --> 20:53.000
 And you need to separate the world and say,

20:53.000 --> 20:55.200
 what is high assurance and cannot fail?

20:55.200 --> 20:57.440
 Because if it fails, people lose money.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.720
 And what is low assurance?

20:58.720 --> 21:01.320
 And it's okay if that falls apart.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.600
 The other thing I'll mention is there are

21:02.600 --> 21:05.360
 perverse financial incentives in our industry.

21:05.360 --> 21:07.800
 Because the reality is when something blows up,

21:07.800 --> 21:09.600
 the people who built those things that blow up

21:09.600 --> 21:11.320
 usually get paid up front.

21:11.320 --> 21:13.800
 So what they're focusing on is time to market,

21:13.800 --> 21:16.200
 speed to market, and getting tokens out

21:16.200 --> 21:17.920
 and getting them liquid.

21:17.920 --> 21:20.120
 I mean, and then people come in, they buy it,

21:20.120 --> 21:22.640
 but if there's a nisiant bug in some DeFi protocol,

21:22.640 --> 21:24.520
 it'll probably be discovered six months later

21:24.520 --> 21:25.600
 or something like that.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.000
 It blows up who suffers, the users.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.640
 They already got the people that created that

21:29.640 --> 21:30.480
 already got paid.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.000
 Exactly, that's why you pay the guy

21:32.000 --> 21:34.880
 who makes the break software for your train last.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.200
 And you make sure he writes the train every day.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.880
 So that you're basically describing

21:40.880 --> 21:43.680
 the complexity of a distributed system

21:43.680 --> 21:45.920
 that's fundamentally game theoretic.

21:45.920 --> 21:48.280
 And if you think about turtles all the way down,

21:48.280 --> 21:50.200
 it's humans all the way down.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.840
 At the very bottom, it's still human nature.

21:52.840 --> 21:56.920
 Is there something you can say formally

21:56.920 --> 21:59.200
 about human nature to try?

21:59.200 --> 22:01.080
 You said there are certain parts of the system

22:01.080 --> 22:02.880
 that can't fail.

22:02.880 --> 22:05.800
 Some people talk about nuclear war in that same kind of way.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.160
 That there's this game theoretic construction

22:08.160 --> 22:11.160
 of mutually assured destruction with that rhymes.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.160
 See, I'm a poet.

22:12.160 --> 22:13.480
 That system can't fail

22:13.480 --> 22:15.920
 because you're gonna blow everyone up,

22:15.920 --> 22:20.560
 but you can't formally say for sure it's not going to fail.

22:20.560 --> 22:24.200
 So you're basically trying to chase,

22:24.200 --> 22:26.200
 like statistically reduce the probability

22:26.200 --> 22:29.480
 that these particular critical aspects will fail.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.400
 And then you test, I guess, by deploying in the real world

22:32.400 --> 22:35.040
 at small scale to see where things go wrong.

22:35.040 --> 22:36.360
 Yeah, it's a great question.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.280
 And the problem with game theory and mechanism design

22:39.280 --> 22:42.120
 is that you can develop this concept of a rational actor.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.120
 And I don't think in my life

22:43.120 --> 22:44.920
 I've ever met a rational actor.

22:44.920 --> 22:46.400
 There's a rational actor on Tuesday,

22:46.400 --> 22:49.040
 but any other day of the week, who the hell knows?

22:49.040 --> 22:50.920
 And there's even, I think there was a book Freakonomics

22:50.920 --> 22:51.880
 and there's a few of these things

22:51.880 --> 22:53.400
 where it just shows again and again

22:53.400 --> 22:55.560
 where people behave in ways

22:55.560 --> 22:57.400
 that are against their best interest.

22:57.400 --> 22:59.040
 So then you have these protocol designers,

22:59.040 --> 23:00.720
 and they say, well, we need an honest majority

23:00.720 --> 23:02.400
 for this thing to work.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.200
 And they say, okay, well, we'll create this incentive model

23:05.200 --> 23:08.560
 and rational actors will behave with that incentive model.

23:08.560 --> 23:10.360
 And I say, well, the individual won't do that,

23:10.360 --> 23:13.960
 but the firm, the government, the entity will.

23:13.960 --> 23:16.240
 The problem with that is we have a lot of counter examples

23:16.240 --> 23:20.280
 where the system was actually behaving in weird ways.

23:20.280 --> 23:21.840
 Like we almost completely eradicated

23:21.840 --> 23:24.720
 the human population twice in the 20th century.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.400
 Once during the Cuban Missile Crisis.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.200
 And again, in the 1980s, there was a Russian colonel

23:29.200 --> 23:31.200
 and they installed a new satellite system.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.160
 And it said, hey, the Americans are launching missiles at us.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.280
 You need to turn the key and launch all the missiles

23:36.280 --> 23:37.120
 in the silo.

23:37.120 --> 23:37.960
 And he said, oh, that's not right.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.440
 That doesn't seem right.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.560
 And he was reprimanded for not launching the missiles.

23:42.560 --> 23:45.840
 So in both cases, a single person stood

23:45.840 --> 23:48.320
 against the systems of superpowers

23:48.320 --> 23:50.960
 between us and nuclear annihilation.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.360
 So in general, we're really bad

23:53.360 --> 23:55.360
 at building these types of things.

23:55.360 --> 23:57.080
 So what you look for instead is say,

23:57.080 --> 23:59.120
 can the system be self correcting?

23:59.120 --> 24:01.440
 It's not about avoiding a problem.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.440
 It's more about can the problem be resolved?

24:04.440 --> 24:06.360
 And that's how nature engineers things.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.720
 It gives you an immune system.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.360
 It gives you the ability to heal.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.160
 If a rainforest has a fire or some catastrophic event,

24:13.160 --> 24:16.560
 the ecosystem will find a way to patch things up.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.800
 So it's a better question of how do you align the incentives

24:18.800 --> 24:20.480
 over the long term of a system

24:20.480 --> 24:22.560
 where all the actors within the system,

24:22.560 --> 24:24.880
 when an event occurs that disrupts it,

24:24.880 --> 24:26.440
 have an incentive to push it back

24:26.440 --> 24:29.520
 into a healthy, productive, useful state,

24:29.520 --> 24:32.240
 which is going back kind of to that complexity theory,

24:32.240 --> 24:33.640
 stuff that we began with,

24:33.640 --> 24:37.560
 and a little bit about how do you handle modern economics?

24:37.560 --> 24:41.160
 Like for example, we knew this coming into the COVID crisis

24:41.160 --> 24:43.960
 that there would be catastrophic economic disruption

24:43.960 --> 24:45.080
 throughout the entire world.

24:45.080 --> 24:46.920
 And the developed world,

24:46.920 --> 24:49.520
 it was print lots of money and hope to God it works.

24:49.520 --> 24:52.080
 And the developing of world is try not to starve to death.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.240
 Over a hundred million people

24:53.240 --> 24:55.400
 were pushed into acute starvation.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.200
 So acute hunger, it's a terrible situation.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.520
 But every economist knew we were going into that.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.240
 So the question is how do you restart the system?

25:02.240 --> 25:04.240
 How do you realign the system and so forth

25:04.240 --> 25:08.200
 and make sure that it doesn't collapse at some point?

25:08.200 --> 25:11.200
 So it's an imperfect, inexact science.

25:11.200 --> 25:12.280
 And that's actually one of the things

25:12.280 --> 25:14.040
 that makes our industry so much fun

25:14.040 --> 25:16.840
 is that these are kind of like micro experiments

25:16.840 --> 25:18.960
 for the macro.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.480
 In the years past,

25:20.480 --> 25:24.000
 you never got a chance to experiment with monetary policy.

25:24.000 --> 25:25.720
 I mean, it's like every 20 years, 30 years,

25:25.720 --> 25:26.720
 they'd have some conference,

25:26.720 --> 25:28.840
 usually in a cool island like Jamaica,

25:28.840 --> 25:31.160
 and be like, okay, let's go talk about monetary policy

25:31.160 --> 25:33.080
 and like amend the Bretton Woods Agreement.

25:33.080 --> 25:35.600
 And these would be nation states, invitation only.

25:35.600 --> 25:38.240
 And now you have over 8,000 cryptocurrencies floating around

25:38.240 --> 25:40.600
 all with their own monetary policy and their rules.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.120
 And it's very Darwinian.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.320
 A lot are dying, some are succeeding.

25:44.320 --> 25:46.360
 Anomalies happen like doge coin.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.720
 And you say, God, is this temporary, is this permanent?

25:48.720 --> 25:51.000
 Why doesn't this horrible thing die?

25:51.000 --> 25:54.240
 And then other things you think would be absolutely successful

25:54.240 --> 25:56.360
 and just take off and be in the top 10,

25:56.360 --> 25:57.840
 don't really get as much traction.

25:57.840 --> 26:00.000
 Like Al Grant is a great example of that.

26:00.000 --> 26:03.120
 I mean, Silvio, he's incredibly bright guy.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.920
 Every time I go to MIT, we have dinner

26:04.920 --> 26:07.840
 and his work is legendary

26:07.840 --> 26:09.440
 and it's just beautiful and elegant.

26:09.440 --> 26:11.560
 And he literally has all the people.

26:11.560 --> 26:15.320
 He went and hired Tal Robin and she got an IBM research

26:15.320 --> 26:16.160
 and Craig Gentry,

26:16.160 --> 26:18.600
 the guy did homomorph encryption under Dan Bonet's there.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.960
 There's all these amazing people on that team.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.880
 And they have money in the VCs.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.440
 So you'd say, okay, that's a contender.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.720
 But if you look at market adoption,

26:27.720 --> 26:30.160
 theorem classic sometimes is above it.

26:30.160 --> 26:31.480
 And other things are above it.

26:31.480 --> 26:34.120
 Then there's this weird Darwinian evolution

26:34.120 --> 26:36.360
 produced doge coin organism

26:36.360 --> 26:38.800
 that's just like stomping all around.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.040
 Evolution doesn't make sense.

26:40.040 --> 26:43.560
 Exactly, but maybe it's worth a problem, not evolution.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.720
 Cause the market's the market.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.800
 And you can scream and cry and pout

26:48.800 --> 26:50.920
 and stamp your foot and said, this makes no sense.

26:50.920 --> 26:52.880
 But that's the way the world works.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.560
 There's plenty of mountain climbers

26:54.560 --> 26:56.400
 that didn't want gravity to apply to them.

26:56.400 --> 26:58.480
 And it's the same situation here.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.560
 There's plenty of people in these marketplaces

27:00.560 --> 27:01.760
 that had the best of intentions,

27:01.760 --> 27:03.600
 the best team, the best technology.

27:03.600 --> 27:06.800
 And for whatever reason, they didn't get that adoption.

27:06.800 --> 27:08.440
 So the question isn't the local,

27:08.440 --> 27:10.440
 it should be the longterm.

27:10.440 --> 27:13.840
 And will the system over time converge to a state

27:13.840 --> 27:16.720
 that actually is useful and meaningful to society

27:16.720 --> 27:18.480
 and actually solve problems for it.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.080
 And that's what we try to figure out is,

27:21.080 --> 27:22.840
 how do we perturb these things in a way

27:22.840 --> 27:24.800
 to kind of push them in that direction?

27:24.800 --> 27:27.800
 So before we go into this fascinating

27:27.800 --> 27:31.240
 Darwinian evolution of cryptocurrencies,

27:31.240 --> 27:34.360
 let me ask you sort of a basic programming question.

27:34.360 --> 27:37.160
 There's a fascinating aspect to your work with Cardano

27:37.160 --> 27:41.160
 that use Haskell to build the infrastructure.

27:41.160 --> 27:44.880
 But even stepping back more, looking at this landscape,

27:44.880 --> 27:48.680
 another place where Darwinian evolution operates,

27:48.680 --> 27:51.640
 looking at this landscape of programming languages,

27:51.640 --> 27:55.520
 you as an engineer, you as a philosopher, both,

27:55.520 --> 27:58.760
 what programming languages do you think are interesting?

27:58.760 --> 28:01.160
 And more practically, what programming languages,

28:01.160 --> 28:05.040
 if you were to advise students today, should they learn?

28:05.040 --> 28:08.680
 Yeah, so there's the pedagogy of learning how to program

28:08.680 --> 28:11.120
 and to express the theory of computer science.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.960
 Like you have to learn how to write algorithms,

28:12.960 --> 28:14.800
 you have to learn what data structures are,

28:14.800 --> 28:16.960
 you have to be able to do analysis of these things.

28:16.960 --> 28:20.600
 And that probably the, I think the debate is over,

28:20.600 --> 28:24.160
 Python is probably the best language or JavaScript

28:24.160 --> 28:26.160
 to get started with, because they're very useful.

28:26.160 --> 28:27.480
 The libraries are amazing.

28:27.480 --> 28:29.840
 There's just tons of online materials.

28:29.840 --> 28:32.240
 Even MIT is now teaching their introduction

28:32.240 --> 28:34.520
 to computer science and Python.

28:34.520 --> 28:35.640
 And they used to do Lisp.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.400
 I mean, these guys were hardcore.

28:37.400 --> 28:38.240
 I still love Lisp.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.600
 Oh man, it's great.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.040
 These are your father's parentheses.

28:41.040 --> 28:44.800
 They're elegant weapons from a time long ago.

28:44.800 --> 28:46.720
 But you know, that's a great starting point.

28:46.720 --> 28:49.280
 And it's not about falling in love with a language,

28:49.280 --> 28:51.000
 it's just falling in love with computing.

28:51.000 --> 28:53.600
 It's about falling in love with having a dialogue

28:53.600 --> 28:55.280
 with a computer and thinking about,

28:55.280 --> 28:56.520
 well, how would I solve that?

28:56.520 --> 28:57.880
 How would I interact with that?

28:57.880 --> 28:59.720
 What does this need to look like?

29:00.920 --> 29:02.800
 Functional programming is what we've chosen to use

29:02.800 --> 29:05.680
 for Cardano, mostly because we're living

29:05.680 --> 29:08.080
 in the academic world, we've written 105 papers.

29:08.080 --> 29:11.640
 And the problem is you have to translate that work into code.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.040
 And the gap between an imperative language

29:14.040 --> 29:18.320
 like a C++ or C and these academic rigorous papers

29:18.320 --> 29:20.240
 is extremely large.

29:20.240 --> 29:22.600
 And so there's gonna be a lot of semantical ambiguity

29:22.600 --> 29:23.600
 between those two.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.120
 And what I mean by that is that you might end up

29:26.120 --> 29:28.840
 implementing a wrong thing.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.520
 You might think that what you've built is the paper,

29:31.520 --> 29:33.760
 but the computer's not going to tell you that

29:33.760 --> 29:35.240
 because the paper's written in pros

29:35.240 --> 29:37.560
 and maybe typed up in late tech or something.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.200
 But there's no proof chain, evidence chain

29:40.200 --> 29:42.360
 that you can show that there's no ambiguity.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.680
 When you look at a functional language,

29:43.680 --> 29:45.560
 you're a little closer to math.

29:45.560 --> 29:49.040
 And so as a consequence, the translation of the papers

29:49.040 --> 29:51.040
 that we spent so damn long writing

29:51.040 --> 29:53.040
 and writing proofs about and so forth

29:53.040 --> 29:55.440
 to code is much smaller.

29:55.440 --> 29:57.280
 Now the downside is these functional languages

29:57.280 --> 29:58.680
 tend to be a bit more academic

29:58.680 --> 30:00.640
 and they tend to have not necessarily

30:00.640 --> 30:03.200
 the best windows support and the libraries aren't so good.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.920
 And also they tend to be a little slower

30:04.920 --> 30:07.360
 when compared as a whole on average

30:07.360 --> 30:09.960
 to languages like C for example.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.800
 So it's really a question of okay,

30:11.800 --> 30:14.040
 what are you designing for for version one?

30:14.040 --> 30:16.160
 Are you designing for performance

30:16.160 --> 30:18.960
 and are you designing for developer accessibility?

30:18.960 --> 30:21.080
 Are you designing for correctness

30:21.080 --> 30:26.080
 and are you designing for a high fidelity representation

30:26.760 --> 30:27.800
 of the protocol?

30:27.800 --> 30:32.080
 Okay, so Haskell was chosen as kind of the version one

30:32.080 --> 30:34.120
 because we knew that the kinds of people

30:34.120 --> 30:36.320
 who think about that are also the kinds of people

30:36.320 --> 30:38.200
 that would have an easy time reading a paper

30:38.200 --> 30:40.360
 like a war of oris and working their way

30:40.360 --> 30:41.400
 through all of this.

30:41.400 --> 30:43.160
 And they would do a pretty good job

30:43.160 --> 30:45.000
 running a formal specification

30:45.000 --> 30:47.600
 and then translating that into running code.

30:47.600 --> 30:49.800
 Then once you have that, you have a blueprint

30:49.800 --> 30:52.360
 that you can actually reason about, maintain.

30:52.360 --> 30:53.520
 And if you really wanted to,

30:53.520 --> 30:55.840
 you could then turn that into a Rust code base

30:55.840 --> 30:57.600
 or into a Java code base.

30:57.600 --> 30:59.440
 Going the other way around would be

30:59.440 --> 31:01.920
 kind of pointless and counterproductive.

31:01.920 --> 31:03.200
 The other side of it is that

31:03.200 --> 31:07.560
 Haskell code or functional code

31:07.560 --> 31:09.600
 tends to be significantly more concise.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.000
 And I actually have a real life example of that.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.040
 So if you take a look at Mantis,

31:14.040 --> 31:17.880
 we implemented a full Ethereum node in Scala.

31:17.880 --> 31:21.080
 It's only about 14 or 15,000 lines of code.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.400
 And you compare that with like C++ Bitcoin,

31:23.400 --> 31:26.560
 I think that's 120, 150,000 lines of code.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.640
 So it's almost 10 times smaller.

31:28.640 --> 31:31.120
 And so less code, less to read.

31:31.120 --> 31:33.160
 And you tend to read code significantly more

31:33.160 --> 31:36.520
 than you would read write code.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.280
 So it's always an advantage for a maintenance,

31:39.280 --> 31:42.800
 understandability, documentation and others of things

31:42.800 --> 31:45.000
 when you have more concise code bases.

31:45.000 --> 31:49.200
 And also it's a lot easier for you to apply

31:49.200 --> 31:52.080
 stronger tools to a functional code base,

31:52.080 --> 31:54.640
 like static analysis or property based testing

31:54.640 --> 31:57.320
 or these types of things than an imperative code base.

31:57.320 --> 31:59.520
 But you know, the thing is it's almost like a religion.

31:59.520 --> 32:00.880
 It's like say, or language.

32:00.880 --> 32:03.840
 It's like saying what's French versus Russian versus English.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.040
 Everybody has their adherence.

32:05.040 --> 32:07.360
 They say, oh, they have the best poetry here.

32:07.360 --> 32:08.600
 Russian, yeah.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.240
 There you go, always are in Russian.

32:10.240 --> 32:11.920
 Everybody has their favorite tools

32:11.920 --> 32:14.000
 and their favorite languages,

32:14.000 --> 32:16.160
 but it just comes down to what problems are you trying

32:16.160 --> 32:18.200
 to solve and what problem domain do you live in?

32:18.200 --> 32:21.280
 If you're inventing new protocols based on science,

32:21.280 --> 32:23.120
 you're gonna take the time to write a paper,

32:23.120 --> 32:25.320
 go through the peer review process.

32:25.320 --> 32:27.520
 As you've done personally, you know how hard it can be

32:27.520 --> 32:29.320
 to get into a conference and go through that

32:29.320 --> 32:33.040
 and get your ass kicked, then you also have to apply

32:33.040 --> 32:35.880
 the exact same level of care to the engineering side

32:35.880 --> 32:37.520
 in terms of implementation of that,

32:37.520 --> 32:39.000
 or else you will make a mistake

32:39.000 --> 32:41.640
 and that mistake will probably be an exploit in the system

32:41.640 --> 32:44.600
 that destroys the security properties of the system.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.000
 So we really had no choice,

32:46.000 --> 32:48.240
 but to go to some notion of functional,

32:48.240 --> 32:50.560
 the question was what's the Goldilocks language?

32:50.560 --> 32:53.520
 Do you use a hybrid language like Scala and F sharp

32:53.520 --> 32:56.400
 or closure where you still have some connection

32:56.400 --> 33:00.040
 to understandable things like.NET or the JVM?

33:00.040 --> 33:03.880
 Or do you go to an overly academic language like Idris

33:03.880 --> 33:06.160
 or Agda or Isabel?

33:06.160 --> 33:09.120
 And there you can really dial up the correctness

33:09.120 --> 33:10.800
 and write all kinds of crazy proofs.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.720
 But by the way, it's like the seven people

33:12.720 --> 33:15.080
 who write your code, they go on vacation a lot,

33:15.080 --> 33:16.680
 you'll never get anything done.

33:16.680 --> 33:19.320
 So Haskell kind of felt like a nice middle ground

33:19.320 --> 33:22.160
 between those two where we needed to pull into the left,

33:22.160 --> 33:24.160
 we could, if you wanted to pull into the right,

33:24.160 --> 33:25.280
 you could as well.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.040
 That said, it's really amazing to see

33:27.040 --> 33:28.520
 what the hybrid languages have done.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.560
 If I was a new student in computer science

33:30.560 --> 33:34.880
 and I said, learn any language to grow your career from,

33:34.880 --> 33:37.760
 Scala three is probably the language to go with.

33:37.760 --> 33:38.600
 Yeah, it's great.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.000
 Cause it's like you want it to be like Java, it's Java.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.680
 And it looks kind of like a Java program.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.840
 You want it to be like Python and scripted

33:44.840 --> 33:46.960
 and you use a REPL, you can do that.

33:46.960 --> 33:50.280
 You want to go hardcore dot, you know,

33:50.280 --> 33:52.800
 dependent object types and do like weird proofs

33:52.800 --> 33:55.160
 and stuff in the functional, you do all that.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.920
 You have access to all of these things.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.760
 And Martin Edersky is a brilliant guy.

33:58.760 --> 34:01.320
 He's done some phenomenal work basically,

34:01.320 --> 34:03.440
 cause he was one guy who created the JVM

34:03.440 --> 34:06.320
 and he's worked on compilers for over 20 years.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.640
 He did a lot of really hardcore work

34:08.640 --> 34:12.080
 and trying to build a concise, nice, modern language

34:12.080 --> 34:13.920
 that does a little bit of everything.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.560
 And it's got great applications in data science and AI.

34:17.560 --> 34:20.240
 And it's also heavily used in modern companies

34:20.240 --> 34:21.960
 like Netflix uses Scala for all

34:21.960 --> 34:23.520
 of their microservice architecture.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.760
 Yeah, so that's a great language.

34:25.760 --> 34:28.720
 And it's easy to pick up and it's easy to hire people into it.

34:28.720 --> 34:30.440
 You just find these Eastern European guys

34:30.440 --> 34:32.560
 who are Java programmers for 10 years, 15 years

34:32.560 --> 34:34.920
 and they got tired of making $20 an hour.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.240
 So they picked up Scala so they can make $35 an hour

34:38.240 --> 34:39.920
 and they're really good at it, you know?

34:39.920 --> 34:41.400
 And that's a great gateway drug

34:41.400 --> 34:43.360
 cause you have a quick check in Haskell,

34:43.360 --> 34:45.080
 you have Scala check in Scala.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.280
 You know, you can also do model checking.

34:47.280 --> 34:49.640
 You can also go and use a TLA spec

34:49.640 --> 34:52.000
 and make it work with Scala and so forth.

34:52.000 --> 34:54.640
 So it gets you a little bit of everything

34:54.640 --> 34:57.520
 and you know, you can then move around

34:57.520 --> 34:59.880
 that entire design space in a beautiful way.

35:01.280 --> 35:05.720
 So the recommendation is maybe if you wanna go Vanilla,

35:05.720 --> 35:07.360
 go Python and JavaScript.

35:07.360 --> 35:08.360
 When you're getting started.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.200
 It's getting started.

35:09.200 --> 35:10.040
 Cause that'll get you everything.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.880
 You can do web scrapers and anything.

35:11.880 --> 35:12.720
 It's just fun.

35:12.720 --> 35:13.920
 All this experiment with drugs

35:13.920 --> 35:16.480
 and undergrad that's where Scala 3 comes in.

35:16.480 --> 35:18.280
 It's a gateway drug to then potentially

35:18.280 --> 35:21.360
 more hardcore functional languages like Haskell.

35:21.360 --> 35:24.240
 Do you think C and C++, C++ still has a role?

35:24.240 --> 35:26.080
 No, I think Rust is completely Rust.

35:26.080 --> 35:26.920
 It's the need for them.

35:26.920 --> 35:27.760
 Go and Rust.

35:27.760 --> 35:30.120
 You know, those are the two twins of Doom.

35:30.120 --> 35:33.320
 I mean, Google created Go just to get rid of C.

35:33.320 --> 35:34.680
 They hated C that much.

35:34.680 --> 35:37.400
 And then Rust is just a phenomenal language as well.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.200
 It can be a great motivator.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.920
 Let me ask a question from Reddit on this topic.

35:41.920 --> 35:43.200
 We're going depth first today.

35:43.200 --> 35:44.040
 Sure.

35:45.320 --> 35:47.720
 As a developer, why should I be incentivized

35:47.720 --> 35:50.040
 to create Cardano based applications?

35:50.040 --> 35:52.480
 What is on the Cardano developer roadmap?

35:52.480 --> 35:53.520
 Any other language?

35:53.520 --> 35:55.440
 I guess this is the key question I want to ask.

35:55.440 --> 35:56.280
 Right.

35:56.280 --> 35:58.640
 Any other language support other than Haskell?

35:58.640 --> 36:00.360
 The example this person gives us,

36:00.360 --> 36:04.320
 TypeScript, Go, Java, Python, et cetera.

36:04.320 --> 36:06.600
 Also, have you considered a yearly conference

36:06.600 --> 36:08.760
 focused through on developers?

36:08.760 --> 36:10.200
 Yeah, we saw the Plutus Fest.

36:10.200 --> 36:14.800
 And we did the first one in 2018, 2019, I can't remember.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.400
 And we were going to do one last year, but then COVID hit.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.480
 So we'll bring it back and we'll probably do it annually

36:19.480 --> 36:22.040
 at the University of Wyoming for their hackathon there.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.400
 And in fact, it just so happens

36:23.400 --> 36:25.040
 that coincides with the Gogan Summit.

36:25.040 --> 36:28.160
 So we're doing that, I think the third week of September.

36:28.160 --> 36:29.920
 But yeah, it's great to do an annual conference.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.520
 You can bring a lot of cool people together

36:31.520 --> 36:34.800
 and you can do hackathons and awards and so forth.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.520
 But to the question in particular,

36:36.520 --> 36:38.600
 Plutus is like any other language.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.080
 Plutus Core, you can compile things into it.

36:41.080 --> 36:43.640
 So it's entirely possible to write a Scala

36:43.640 --> 36:46.200
 to Plutus Core compiler or a TypeScript compiler

36:46.200 --> 36:47.400
 or something like that.

36:47.400 --> 36:51.360
 But I'm a big believer of separation of concerns

36:51.360 --> 36:54.720
 and we don't live in a single chain model anymore.

36:54.720 --> 36:59.040
 So you have a situation where you probably want to have

36:59.040 --> 37:01.680
 different execution environments and different chains.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.280
 So you have different virtual machines there.

37:03.280 --> 37:04.600
 And that's why we worked so closely

37:04.600 --> 37:05.600
 with the University of Illinois

37:05.600 --> 37:08.080
 or about a Champagne, Kugori Roshu's team

37:08.080 --> 37:09.440
 at runtime verification.

37:09.440 --> 37:10.360
 What they did is they said,

37:10.360 --> 37:12.840
 let's start with something very familiar, LLVM,

37:12.840 --> 37:14.440
 which has been around for a really long time

37:14.440 --> 37:17.400
 and they happen to have created it there with Apple.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.480
 And let's take that and translate that

37:19.480 --> 37:21.120
 into the blockchain space.

37:21.120 --> 37:23.040
 Okay, then when you have it,

37:23.040 --> 37:27.040
 then it's very easy to modify compilers of standard languages

37:27.040 --> 37:29.480
 like the Cs and C++s and other sort of things

37:29.480 --> 37:33.080
 that do compile to LLVM already and have them run there.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.680
 So that's a different execution model

37:34.680 --> 37:36.240
 than what we tried to build for Plutus,

37:36.240 --> 37:38.280
 which focuses on correctness.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.840
 Okay, so then all you have to really do is say,

37:40.840 --> 37:44.320
 can both of these models coexist within the same ecosystem?

37:44.320 --> 37:45.160
 Because then you kind of,

37:45.160 --> 37:46.360
 and I did a video, it was called

37:46.360 --> 37:48.080
 like the island, the ocean, the pond.

37:48.080 --> 37:49.880
 And the basic idea was say,

37:49.880 --> 37:51.760
 you have an island where everything's perfect,

37:51.760 --> 37:54.920
 Calypso lives there, life is great,

37:54.920 --> 37:56.400
 people feed you grapes every day,

37:56.400 --> 37:58.960
 but maybe you can't do everything on the island.

37:58.960 --> 38:01.480
 And the ocean's big, it has everything,

38:01.480 --> 38:04.080
 but the ocean's got sea monsters and sharks

38:04.080 --> 38:08.280
 and Bodhi McBoatface and all kinds of crazy stuff, right?

38:08.280 --> 38:10.000
 So that's what yellow is about.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.160
 It's basically this,

38:11.160 --> 38:12.760
 bring LLVM into our world.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.440
 And at some point in the next three to five year time horizon,

38:15.440 --> 38:18.360
 we can bring modern programming languages in,

38:18.360 --> 38:20.440
 but they're gonna come in with all their flaws

38:20.440 --> 38:22.160
 and their warts and their problems.

38:22.160 --> 38:25.400
 And then the pond was the idea

38:25.400 --> 38:26.640
 of the Ethereum virtual machine.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.200
 There's some network effect around it

38:28.200 --> 38:29.320
 and there's some great tooling

38:29.320 --> 38:31.080
 that's a materialized and evolved.

38:31.080 --> 38:33.560
 And it's not clear if that's the standard yet

38:33.560 --> 38:35.680
 or if like MySpace or BlackBerry

38:35.680 --> 38:37.680
 or all these other things, it'll fade away.

38:37.680 --> 38:39.880
 Well, if it becomes the standard, okay,

38:39.880 --> 38:42.960
 don't fight nature, just support it.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.680
 And the same thing that gives you the ability

38:44.680 --> 38:48.800
 to bolt on the LLVM will also give you the ability

38:48.800 --> 38:51.440
 to bolt on the EVM and they can run with their own models

38:51.440 --> 38:54.920
 and they're encapsulated, bulkheaded, separated systems,

38:54.920 --> 38:57.480
 but you can move ADA applications,

38:57.480 --> 38:59.880
 information between those two systems.

38:59.880 --> 39:01.760
 And so your main chain will always stay

39:01.760 --> 39:04.480
 somewhat conservative and have the minimum viable amount

39:04.480 --> 39:06.320
 of expressiveness required on it

39:06.320 --> 39:08.880
 to do all kinds of interesting things.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.360
 And also for interoperability,

39:10.360 --> 39:12.880
 be able to talk to all kinds of interesting things,

39:12.880 --> 39:15.080
 but it's not trying to be everything to everyone.

39:15.080 --> 39:18.120
 There's never gonna be an ice cream store in the island.

39:18.120 --> 39:19.800
 You'll have the grapes and the beautiful women,

39:19.800 --> 39:21.440
 but no ice cream.

39:21.440 --> 39:23.680
 Now you're just like distracting me with the ice cream.

39:23.680 --> 39:26.800
 So just for, because we'll throw around a bunch of terms

39:26.800 --> 39:28.400
 for the record, what is Plutus?

39:28.400 --> 39:29.760
 So Plutus is a programming language.

39:29.760 --> 39:33.520
 It's kind of a DSL that we built on top of Haskell.

39:33.520 --> 39:37.120
 And basically we wrote it after spending

39:37.120 --> 39:40.080
 about three years thinking about all smart contracts.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.880
 We were trying to figure out like,

39:41.880 --> 39:44.480
 what is the ideal language to express a smart contract?

39:44.480 --> 39:45.320
 And then we started thinking, well,

39:45.320 --> 39:46.440
 what is a smart contract?

39:46.440 --> 39:48.120
 Is it the whole application

39:48.120 --> 39:50.960
 or is it just like a sub module within an application?

39:50.960 --> 39:54.120
 And usually it's the latter more than a former.

39:54.120 --> 39:56.840
 You can build a self contained program like a script,

39:56.840 --> 39:58.640
 but usually what's happening is you'll have it

39:58.640 --> 40:00.640
 like a video game, let's say World of Warcraft

40:00.640 --> 40:01.720
 or something like that.

40:01.720 --> 40:04.600
 You say, hey, maybe I want to actually create gold

40:04.600 --> 40:07.840
 in World of Warcraft that's actually a currency.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.760
 Okay, so I'm going to issue a token.

40:09.760 --> 40:11.640
 Well, and then maybe I want to create some mechanics

40:11.640 --> 40:14.360
 behind how people are going to trade that amongst each other.

40:14.360 --> 40:16.600
 So that would be like a smart contract layer

40:16.600 --> 40:18.000
 and issue an asset.

40:18.000 --> 40:20.320
 So you have this centralized server running

40:20.320 --> 40:23.880
 and proprietary software controlled by a single company,

40:23.880 --> 40:26.480
 but then you've opened your application up

40:26.480 --> 40:27.960
 to a broader world.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.960
 And we've done now is added a blockchain layer

40:29.960 --> 40:32.160
 and the blockchain handles the accounting of that asset

40:32.160 --> 40:34.520
 and the spending policy of that stuff.

40:34.520 --> 40:37.480
 So that is a much smaller program

40:37.480 --> 40:40.800
 than what Blizzard is doing with World of Warcraft.

40:40.800 --> 40:43.400
 So the point of Plutus was let's create a language

40:43.400 --> 40:46.760
 where you can write these small to mid size programs

40:46.760 --> 40:48.280
 and have a high degree of confidence

40:48.280 --> 40:50.240
 that they behave with correctness.

40:50.240 --> 40:52.920
 And also they give you deterministic results

40:52.920 --> 40:54.200
 on the consumption of resources.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.960
 You can run things locally

40:55.960 --> 40:57.920
 and you actually understand what it costs to run.

40:57.920 --> 41:01.240
 And that doesn't change when you deploy it on the system.

41:01.240 --> 41:03.720
 If you dial up the expressiveness of the system

41:03.720 --> 41:05.120
 and like Ethereum does

41:05.120 --> 41:07.720
 in these big mutable account systems,

41:07.720 --> 41:09.360
 the problem is you have to have global state.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.040
 So whatever you test locally

41:11.040 --> 41:13.320
 doesn't actually necessarily translate

41:13.320 --> 41:15.320
 to what you've deployed.

41:15.320 --> 41:18.040
 So we spent a long time asking like

41:18.040 --> 41:19.600
 where's the Goldilocks zone?

41:19.600 --> 41:22.120
 Bitcoin script was too restrictive

41:22.120 --> 41:24.640
 and every single time Satoshi tried to dial it up

41:24.640 --> 41:26.200
 it led to mega problems.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.240
 Like there was a beautiful thing

41:27.240 --> 41:29.880
 called the value overflowing incident in 2010

41:29.880 --> 41:32.480
 which led to the creation of billions of Bitcoin.

41:32.480 --> 41:33.760
 They had to quickly clean that up

41:33.760 --> 41:34.680
 and sweep it under the rug

41:34.680 --> 41:36.400
 and pretend like it didn't exist.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.720
 But that was mostly because of an issue

41:38.720 --> 41:41.320
 with how the scripting language was implemented.

41:41.320 --> 41:43.560
 And when you look at Ethereum

41:43.560 --> 41:48.040
 it's like this pure game of stomping down these skirmishers

41:48.040 --> 41:49.320
 where every update there's something

41:49.320 --> 41:50.680
 they have to change or tune

41:50.680 --> 41:54.120
 and then it's not clear how you shard such a model.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.920
 So we said let's build something that's in the middle of this

41:56.920 --> 41:58.720
 and that's what Plutus basically is.

41:58.720 --> 42:01.040
 And it's really designed to play very nicely

42:01.040 --> 42:02.440
 with off chain infrastructure

42:02.440 --> 42:04.320
 as much as on chain infrastructure.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.000
 So you can look at all those different examples

42:06.000 --> 42:09.440
 whether it's Wolfram wants to auction off their universes

42:09.440 --> 42:12.240
 or Blizzard wants to issue an in game currency

42:12.240 --> 42:14.440
 or you're Uber and you wanna start putting

42:14.440 --> 42:17.160
 peer to peer dynamics inside your system

42:17.160 --> 42:20.720
 you're gonna gracefully connect to that on chain code

42:20.720 --> 42:23.120
 and it's very clear how those two things connect together.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.640
 Just so happens Haskell's really good for this.

42:25.640 --> 42:26.800
 They have template Haskell

42:26.800 --> 42:30.120
 and it makes it very easy to embed domain specific languages

42:30.120 --> 42:32.360
 and it makes it very easy to wire your Haskell code

42:32.360 --> 42:34.240
 onto off chain infrastructure.

42:34.240 --> 42:37.000
 So in the future you'll be able to have your off chain

42:37.000 --> 42:39.280
 run a node or the job of virtual machine

42:39.280 --> 42:40.760
 or a dot net application

42:40.760 --> 42:42.600
 and they'll just be this beautiful interface

42:42.600 --> 42:44.280
 and then it can talk to all your on chain code

42:44.280 --> 42:45.960
 and that's written in that DSL

42:45.960 --> 42:49.320
 and you have a high degree of assurance that it's right.

42:49.320 --> 42:52.240
 Is there like a Hello World program in Plutus

42:52.240 --> 42:55.080
 that reveals the beauty of this balance

42:55.080 --> 42:57.720
 that you're referring to sort of a simple

42:57.720 --> 42:59.960
 but not too simple Einstein idea.

42:59.960 --> 43:03.000
 Yeah, so we did do our first Hello World program

43:03.000 --> 43:04.240
 actually today because we...

43:04.240 --> 43:05.080
 Yeah, I heard about this.

43:05.080 --> 43:08.560
 Yeah, but there you'd want to have the whole round trip.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.320
 So you'd like to have an interaction

43:10.320 --> 43:12.440
 and I think a video game would probably show it the best.

43:12.440 --> 43:14.320
 Like if we could reimplement crypto kitties

43:14.320 --> 43:15.800
 or something like that on it

43:15.800 --> 43:17.400
 and you have this off chain infrastructure

43:17.400 --> 43:18.840
 and you have your GUI and your front end

43:18.840 --> 43:21.080
 it's running on your phone or a browser

43:21.080 --> 43:22.840
 and most of that lives off chain

43:22.840 --> 43:24.880
 and then but your crypto kitties they'd live

43:24.880 --> 43:27.920
 on the blockchain the whole round trip end to end

43:27.920 --> 43:30.080
 with relatively low fees and low latency

43:30.080 --> 43:33.000
 and high availability of service.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.200
 It never goes down.

43:34.200 --> 43:35.960
 That would probably be the best thing to do

43:35.960 --> 43:37.800
 and we'll have something like that by August.

43:37.800 --> 43:39.160
 It's pretty easy to build this stuff.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.760
 So what kind of off chain interactions

43:40.760 --> 43:41.920
 are supported with Plutus?

43:41.920 --> 43:43.960
 What are the limits you want to put on the thing

43:43.960 --> 43:45.080
 so it doesn't get chaotic?

43:45.080 --> 43:46.000
 That's the beautiful thing.

43:46.000 --> 43:48.160
 When you have a less expressive model on chain

43:48.160 --> 43:50.720
 it means you can do anything you want off chain.

43:50.720 --> 43:52.560
 So you started talking about smart contracts

43:52.560 --> 43:55.920
 but let's zoom back out

43:55.920 --> 43:59.880
 and ask the big question here is what is a blockchain

43:59.880 --> 44:02.200
 and what is a cryptocurrency?

44:02.200 --> 44:04.200
 So a blockchain is just a ledger

44:04.200 --> 44:05.880
 and really it has three nice properties.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.280
 Your time stamp you're immutable and auditable

44:08.280 --> 44:10.240
 either in a global or a local sense.

44:10.240 --> 44:13.480
 And so there's all kinds of things mankind has invented

44:13.480 --> 44:16.040
 where it's really important that you

44:16.040 --> 44:17.680
 when you put some information down

44:17.680 --> 44:20.560
 it doesn't change and other people can see it

44:20.560 --> 44:23.280
 and that you know when it was put down.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.680
 For example, a property ledger.

44:24.680 --> 44:26.280
 So when you buy a land

44:26.280 --> 44:28.000
 or you have rights associated with land

44:28.000 --> 44:31.040
 like mineral rights or water rights or these things

44:31.040 --> 44:33.680
 you'd like to transitively see how does it go

44:33.680 --> 44:36.400
 from Alice to Bob to Charlie to Jim and so forth

44:36.400 --> 44:38.520
 and what was the state of these things

44:38.520 --> 44:39.600
 as they were transitioning?

44:39.600 --> 44:41.960
 So how much did they pay?

44:41.960 --> 44:44.080
 When did it occur, et cetera, et cetera

44:44.080 --> 44:46.120
 the metadata that follows that.

44:46.120 --> 44:48.520
 Okay, well normally these types of ledgers

44:48.520 --> 44:50.160
 are so important that they're managed

44:50.160 --> 44:52.400
 either by governments or regulated entities.

44:52.400 --> 44:55.840
 And the issues are that while they can be efficient

44:55.840 --> 44:58.960
 they're generally brittle to political manipulation

44:58.960 --> 45:02.080
 and they're brittle to geopolitical events.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.480
 For example, when Syria fell apart

45:04.480 --> 45:06.600
 the very first thing ISIS did is they started saying

45:06.600 --> 45:08.640
 hey, the ownership of the land

45:08.640 --> 45:10.400
 it's gonna fundamentally change.

45:10.400 --> 45:12.400
 We've decided that this guy over here

45:12.400 --> 45:13.680
 now owns all these things.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.160
 And then when peace comes like how do you unwind

45:16.160 --> 45:18.440
 all of that put it all back together.

45:18.440 --> 45:21.240
 So the power of a blockchain is that it gives you

45:21.240 --> 45:25.120
 a transnational way of sorting all these details out

45:25.120 --> 45:29.680
 putting all together in a place that you know

45:29.680 --> 45:33.360
 that even if it's inconvenient to a very powerful actor

45:33.360 --> 45:35.680
 that it will still stay preserved.

45:35.680 --> 45:38.800
 This is an asymmetry we haven't had as a society

45:38.800 --> 45:40.880
 usually kings and empires

45:40.880 --> 45:43.280
 they have the ability to decide what's true.

45:43.280 --> 45:45.440
 And then suddenly you have this asymmetrical thing

45:45.440 --> 45:49.040
 that is above them kind of like a synthetic laws of physics

45:49.040 --> 45:50.880
 and once something goes in there

45:50.880 --> 45:53.560
 you know that that's there, okay.

45:53.560 --> 45:54.800
 So that's the first part of it.

45:54.800 --> 45:59.520
 The second part of it is that it's auditable

45:59.520 --> 46:02.720
 meaning that instead of saying only the high cleric

46:02.720 --> 46:05.160
 or the president or you know

46:05.160 --> 46:07.280
 some very special club of people

46:07.280 --> 46:08.960
 get to see what's going on

46:08.960 --> 46:10.920
 suddenly now all the people

46:10.920 --> 46:13.320
 can actually see who owns what where.

46:13.320 --> 46:15.240
 Like imagine a tax system where you know

46:15.240 --> 46:17.960
 the public club just leaked the taxes

46:17.960 --> 46:19.120
 of all these different billionaires

46:19.120 --> 46:21.320
 and said well how much they make and how much they pay

46:21.320 --> 46:22.760
 well imagine a tax system

46:22.760 --> 46:24.680
 where that's just done by default

46:24.680 --> 46:26.600
 or other social systems

46:26.600 --> 46:29.160
 where this type of information is put in by default.

46:29.160 --> 46:32.800
 So it's tremendously useful this type of structure

46:32.800 --> 46:35.400
 and all kinds of things medical records, supply chains

46:35.400 --> 46:37.720
 you know just a good thought experiment is

46:37.720 --> 46:41.040
 I travel a lot of into 52 countries in the last five years

46:41.040 --> 46:43.440
 imagine if I got sick and Zimbabwe

46:43.440 --> 46:44.960
 you know I hit by a car or something

46:44.960 --> 46:47.280
 and I'm unconscious and a Zimbabwean doctor

46:47.280 --> 46:49.000
 calls my doctor in Colorado and says

46:49.000 --> 46:51.440
 hey you know I need all Charles's medical records

46:51.440 --> 46:53.480
 you know he's unconscious right now

46:53.480 --> 46:56.360
 but I need it to treat him because he's quite ill.

46:56.360 --> 46:58.280
 They'd say who is this person in Zimbabwe

46:58.280 --> 47:00.840
 well I don't know you I can't give you his records

47:00.840 --> 47:02.560
 I need his consent oh no he's unconscious

47:02.560 --> 47:04.240
 in the hospital can't do it.

47:04.240 --> 47:06.320
 Well a broker system that would allow the movement

47:06.320 --> 47:07.840
 of medical records would it be an example

47:07.840 --> 47:09.440
 of what a blockchain could potentially do

47:09.440 --> 47:10.840
 in the foreseeable future.

47:10.840 --> 47:12.720
 Cryptocurrency is just an application

47:12.720 --> 47:14.240
 that runs on top of blockchain

47:14.240 --> 47:16.520
 because it turns out that when you issue property

47:16.520 --> 47:18.880
 you also can issue tokens of value

47:18.880 --> 47:20.440
 and then you could have a monetary policy

47:20.440 --> 47:22.680
 it could be inflationary or deflationary

47:22.680 --> 47:25.080
 you know demarrage where it decays over time

47:25.080 --> 47:27.320
 or whatever have you

47:27.320 --> 47:29.960
 and the very same mechanics that would ensure

47:29.960 --> 47:31.480
 your property records are secure

47:31.480 --> 47:33.440
 or your medical record access is secure

47:33.440 --> 47:35.160
 could also be applied for the ownership

47:35.160 --> 47:36.680
 of the cryptocurrency and again

47:36.680 --> 47:38.800
 you can either be completely transparent

47:38.800 --> 47:40.240
 and everybody can see what everybody owns

47:40.240 --> 47:41.640
 and that's what Bitcoin does

47:41.640 --> 47:44.240
 or you can be as opaque as you seek to be

47:44.240 --> 47:46.440
 that's what Zcash basically attempts to do

47:46.440 --> 47:49.120
 it says hey let's keep these things as private as possible

47:49.120 --> 47:50.760
 but they have relatively the same mechanics

47:50.760 --> 47:52.720
 in terms of those properties of auditability

47:52.720 --> 47:54.720
 and time stamping and immutability

47:54.720 --> 47:56.440
 you know things won't be reversed

47:56.440 --> 47:57.920
 you know that people aren't gonna manipulate

47:57.920 --> 48:01.200
 the time stamps and you can audit at least enough

48:01.200 --> 48:03.240
 to know that the ownership is right.

48:03.240 --> 48:06.520
 But the way if you think about physics and the universe

48:06.520 --> 48:07.960
 the universe has figured out a way

48:07.960 --> 48:11.480
 to update the ledger of physics in a way

48:11.480 --> 48:13.440
 where like a lot of people can be updating it

48:13.440 --> 48:16.120
 and it stays consistent

48:16.120 --> 48:19.640
 is there something you can say about the task

48:19.640 --> 48:21.880
 of updating the ledger when a bunch of people

48:21.880 --> 48:22.720
 are trying to do it

48:22.720 --> 48:24.480
 or a bunch of entities are trying to do it?

48:24.480 --> 48:26.200
 That's the whole point of a consensus algorithm

48:26.200 --> 48:28.200
 so whatever ledger you're running

48:28.200 --> 48:32.040
 there has to be some mechanism to decide who's in charge

48:32.040 --> 48:33.680
 and that's what proof of work does

48:33.680 --> 48:35.800
 and proof of stake does and all these other systems

48:35.800 --> 48:37.840
 and you break them down to basically three steps

48:37.840 --> 48:40.560
 and so we'll use Eve for kind of step number one

48:40.560 --> 48:42.080
 hi Eve, how you doing?

48:42.080 --> 48:44.320
 And we're gonna use Wally for step number two

48:44.320 --> 48:47.160
 and I need the monkey, give me the monkey.

48:47.160 --> 48:49.000
 What's the monkey's name?

48:49.000 --> 48:49.840
 Daisy.

48:49.840 --> 48:50.960
 Daisy the monkey, okay.

48:50.960 --> 48:52.320
 I like Daisy.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.560
 Daisy is a very confused monkey.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.720
 It's partnering its own mortality just saying.

48:56.720 --> 49:00.200
 Right and so anyway the first step is all about

49:00.200 --> 49:03.160
 basically deciding who's in charge for that moment.

49:03.160 --> 49:05.040
 So blockchain is just a sequence of events

49:05.040 --> 49:08.080
 the heart has to beat, the metronome has to click

49:08.080 --> 49:09.840
 so somebody has to be in charge

49:09.840 --> 49:11.960
 and so generally you have this notion of a resource

49:11.960 --> 49:14.200
 so there's some pool of resource out there

49:14.200 --> 49:16.080
 and it can be a token and in that case

49:16.080 --> 49:18.760
 it's a plutocratic system and that's what proof of stake does

49:18.760 --> 49:21.680
 or it can be computation but there can be other resources

49:21.680 --> 49:23.320
 but computation is what proof of work does

49:23.320 --> 49:25.040
 and so you make so many hashes

49:25.040 --> 49:27.120
 and then eventually somebody wins

49:27.120 --> 49:29.360
 and that person who wins is now the person

49:29.360 --> 49:32.040
 who basically gets to decide the order of transactions

49:32.040 --> 49:34.360
 and put them all together from their perspective

49:34.360 --> 49:35.480
 in the system.

49:35.480 --> 49:37.920
 Then once that person wins they'll make the block

49:37.920 --> 49:41.240
 that's step two and after it's made, transmit it

49:41.240 --> 49:43.080
 and it gets validated and accepted.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.480
 So actually it's quite fortuitous you have the magnifying glass

49:45.480 --> 49:48.720
 because at this stage people are trying to decide

49:48.720 --> 49:51.080
 is what I'm looking at correct or not.

49:51.080 --> 49:54.360
 Now there are other ways to potentially conceive of this

49:54.360 --> 49:57.520
 but this particular model gives you a kind of a way

49:57.520 --> 50:02.520
 of thinking of all consensus algorithms in one setting.

50:02.600 --> 50:06.080
 You can be Algorand, you can be a classic BFT protocol

50:06.080 --> 50:08.040
 you can be Paxos, you can be Raft,

50:08.040 --> 50:10.280
 you can be proof of work, you can be proof of stake.

50:10.280 --> 50:12.320
 It's always the same idea.

50:12.320 --> 50:16.000
 You have to find someone or some group to be in charge,

50:16.000 --> 50:18.560
 they'll reach a consensus on order,

50:18.560 --> 50:21.200
 they have to then do some work,

50:21.200 --> 50:23.520
 change the state of the system, update it

50:23.520 --> 50:26.440
 and then the network has to accept that that's valid.

50:26.440 --> 50:29.400
 So even if this process works well, this side will say,

50:29.400 --> 50:31.040
 oh, you created a Bitcoin at a thin air,

50:31.040 --> 50:32.040
 you're not allowed to do that.

50:32.040 --> 50:33.640
 So that's rejected.

50:33.640 --> 50:36.640
 So there's checks and balances and guards all the way through.

50:36.640 --> 50:39.800
 There's a meta question of fairness in all of this.

50:39.800 --> 50:42.120
 So the proof of work people, they're kind of a cult

50:42.120 --> 50:44.960
 and they say that this is the only truth

50:44.960 --> 50:47.720
 and everything out here, any other resources

50:47.720 --> 50:50.720
 not legitimate or valid and there's not a lot

50:50.720 --> 50:52.720
 of evidence to that but that's what they believe.

50:52.720 --> 50:54.920
 The proof of stake people, the downside and weakest

50:54.920 --> 50:57.080
 they have is it's a plutocratic model.

50:57.080 --> 50:59.000
 The more ownership of the system you have,

50:59.000 --> 51:01.240
 the more control you have over that system

51:01.240 --> 51:03.280
 and it suffers from the same thing

51:03.280 --> 51:04.760
 the shareholder models suffer from

51:04.760 --> 51:07.640
 whereas you may maximize short term gain

51:07.640 --> 51:09.880
 over the long term viability of the system.

51:09.880 --> 51:11.320
 So a really cool question is,

51:11.320 --> 51:14.000
 can you build systems that are multi resource?

51:14.000 --> 51:16.680
 So instead of just pulling from one resource

51:16.680 --> 51:20.040
 to select who wins, this 25% of the time

51:20.040 --> 51:22.000
 and maybe this 25%, you can do that.

51:22.000 --> 51:25.240
 In fact, the cryptocurrency space did that a long time ago.

51:25.240 --> 51:27.920
 There was a cryptocurrency called Peercoin in 2011

51:27.920 --> 51:30.400
 and it was a hybrid proof of work proof of stake.

51:30.400 --> 51:31.760
 So some of the blocks were made

51:31.760 --> 51:34.720
 with the token ownership distribution

51:34.720 --> 51:36.680
 and some of the blocks were made with proof of work

51:36.680 --> 51:39.480
 but you could keep adding, you could put in like,

51:39.480 --> 51:41.320
 hey, I want hard disk in my thing,

51:41.320 --> 51:43.400
 you could put permacoin in or something like that.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.000
 So create incentive for hard drives

51:45.000 --> 51:45.840
 and then you could say, oh no,

51:45.840 --> 51:48.760
 I wanna do like a human system, like a proof of merit.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.120
 Oh my God, now we're up to four

51:50.120 --> 51:51.360
 and you just keep adding

51:51.360 --> 51:54.120
 and each of these pools will have different adherents

51:54.120 --> 51:56.520
 and actors and then you can actually balance out

51:56.520 --> 51:57.360
 the whole thing.

51:57.360 --> 51:59.920
 So as opposed to having one cult, you have many cults.

51:59.920 --> 52:00.760
 Exactly.

52:00.760 --> 52:01.600
 And they argue.

52:01.600 --> 52:02.440
 And the cults argue with each other

52:02.440 --> 52:03.440
 and we call that a government.

52:03.440 --> 52:05.160
 By the way, not all cults are bad.

52:05.160 --> 52:06.760
 Physics is a cult too.

52:06.760 --> 52:08.240
 And it's sometimes bad.

52:08.240 --> 52:10.920
 It's honest at least.

52:10.920 --> 52:12.080
 Nature is a cult.

52:13.560 --> 52:15.640
 Nature is metal, check out the Instagram.

52:15.640 --> 52:17.640
 So that's really the crux of it.

52:17.640 --> 52:20.480
 You have a ledger and the ledger is just all about saying,

52:20.480 --> 52:22.000
 hey, we need to put some stuff in here

52:22.000 --> 52:24.560
 and once it's put in here, you can't turn it back.

52:24.560 --> 52:26.920
 And you know when it was put in

52:26.920 --> 52:29.280
 and everybody can see it or some group can see it

52:29.280 --> 52:31.680
 and then you need to pick somebody to modify that.

52:31.680 --> 52:33.160
 So all this chaos will happen,

52:33.160 --> 52:35.200
 all these transactions are all around the world

52:35.200 --> 52:37.320
 and our perception of them are different.

52:37.320 --> 52:38.920
 There's a beautiful paper from Lamport

52:38.920 --> 52:40.800
 that kind of talks about this from the 70s.

52:40.800 --> 52:43.320
 It's like one of the most classic papers ever

52:43.320 --> 52:44.240
 in computer science.

52:44.240 --> 52:47.000
 I think it's been cited like 50,000 times

52:47.000 --> 52:47.840
 or something like that.

52:47.840 --> 52:48.880
 It's crazy paper.

52:48.880 --> 52:50.680
 But basically you have to figure out, okay,

52:50.680 --> 52:51.960
 well, somebody has to be in charge.

52:51.960 --> 52:53.600
 Some group has to be in charge.

52:53.600 --> 52:55.680
 You can do it with a meritocratic,

52:55.680 --> 52:58.040
 hash or cratic computation thing.

52:58.040 --> 53:00.920
 You can say, well, if you have coins 25, 25% of supply,

53:00.920 --> 53:03.080
 25% of the time on average,

53:03.080 --> 53:04.880
 you'll be selected to have the right to do this

53:04.880 --> 53:06.240
 or give it to somebody else.

53:06.240 --> 53:07.920
 Or you can search for other resources.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.200
 They can even be human resources,

53:09.200 --> 53:12.080
 like some notion of merit or social benefit.

53:12.080 --> 53:13.440
 Maybe you get a token for that

53:13.440 --> 53:15.760
 and you can weight it with these other systems.

53:15.760 --> 53:18.040
 And that's where everything's going.

53:18.040 --> 53:21.120
 We're getting to a point where we've really optimized

53:21.120 --> 53:22.160
 all the properties here.

53:22.160 --> 53:24.240
 We've proven all these nice things about it.

53:24.240 --> 53:25.760
 And there's a lot of competition

53:25.760 --> 53:28.840
 to basically build like the perfect proof of stake system,

53:28.840 --> 53:30.960
 whether you're Polkadot or Algorand

53:30.960 --> 53:32.880
 or any of these other guys.

53:32.880 --> 53:34.680
 But now the next step is say, well,

53:34.680 --> 53:36.880
 why don't we just have one?

53:36.880 --> 53:39.080
 We should have multiple resources.

53:39.080 --> 53:40.480
 And the point is each of these

53:40.480 --> 53:42.240
 has different trade off profiles.

53:42.240 --> 53:43.680
 And so they balance each other

53:43.680 --> 53:45.680
 and you end up building a much more resilient system.

53:45.680 --> 53:49.280
 So it's not winner take all with one particular demand.

53:49.280 --> 53:50.960
 Okay, so there's a million questions

53:50.960 --> 53:52.440
 that spring up right there.

53:52.440 --> 53:54.440
 But first, linger on this topic and say,

53:54.440 --> 53:55.520
 what is proof of work?

53:55.520 --> 53:56.840
 What is proof of stake?

53:56.840 --> 53:59.480
 Just zooming in on each of those.

53:59.480 --> 54:01.480
 And what are the differences?

54:01.480 --> 54:03.920
 Okay, so they all have the same three properties

54:03.920 --> 54:06.680
 of pick someone in charge, do something and validate it.

54:06.680 --> 54:08.880
 The difference is that the picking mechanism

54:08.880 --> 54:11.440
 for proof of work is you have to solve a puzzle.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.640
 So it's basically like buying lottery tickets.

54:13.640 --> 54:16.520
 And you can buy a certain amount every second

54:16.520 --> 54:18.080
 with your computing devices.

54:18.080 --> 54:19.720
 And some of them are ASIC resistance.

54:19.720 --> 54:22.080
 You run them on like a laptop or a GPU.

54:22.080 --> 54:24.440
 And some of them are you specialized hardware

54:24.440 --> 54:26.320
 that you have to either manufacture

54:26.320 --> 54:28.680
 or buy from someone who sells it to you.

54:28.680 --> 54:31.200
 And that's just how many tickets per second you can get.

54:31.200 --> 54:32.960
 And eventually you hit those magic numbers.

54:32.960 --> 54:35.400
 And when you do, it means you have the right

54:35.400 --> 54:36.360
 to make the block.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.280
 And generally you bundle the block making

54:38.280 --> 54:39.960
 with the proof of work system.

54:39.960 --> 54:43.000
 Now you can do this looking for a single

54:43.000 --> 54:44.600
 or you can do this to actually shard it

54:44.600 --> 54:47.520
 and look for multiple block makers at the same time.

54:47.520 --> 54:49.160
 So there are sharded proof of work protocols

54:49.160 --> 54:50.840
 like Prism is an example of that.

54:50.840 --> 54:53.760
 And actually Ethereum got started this way

54:53.760 --> 54:56.360
 with Spectre and Ghost and Phantom,

54:56.360 --> 54:59.680
 the Avi Zahar's work and Yonatan Samlopinsky.

54:59.680 --> 55:02.360
 But the basic idea is you pick some collection of people.

55:02.360 --> 55:03.480
 They make some collection of things.

55:03.480 --> 55:04.880
 And there's some way to sort it all out,

55:04.880 --> 55:07.680
 serialize it and prevent double spends, great.

55:07.680 --> 55:11.160
 Proof of stake is the same, but it's a synthetic resource.

55:11.160 --> 55:13.080
 So instead of doing things, they say,

55:13.080 --> 55:15.200
 well, if you had 25% of the hash power

55:15.200 --> 55:17.120
 on average over a long period of time,

55:17.120 --> 55:19.520
 you'd probably win 25% of the time.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.760
 Well, why don't we just introduce some randomness in

55:21.760 --> 55:24.280
 from some source and then 25% of the time

55:24.280 --> 55:26.880
 on average over a long period of time, you'll win.

55:26.880 --> 55:28.800
 So it's a synthetic resource,

55:28.800 --> 55:30.520
 but you still have to do the other two things.

55:30.520 --> 55:31.840
 You still have to make the block

55:31.840 --> 55:33.880
 and you still have to validate the block.

55:33.880 --> 55:36.920
 The big difference is this step in the proof of work world

55:36.920 --> 55:38.760
 is horrendously expensive.

55:38.760 --> 55:41.520
 You use more energy than the nation of Switzerland.

55:41.520 --> 55:43.000
 And the problem with that is that you have

55:43.000 --> 55:45.000
 less resources for the other two.

55:45.000 --> 55:46.400
 And the other problem with that is that

55:46.400 --> 55:48.240
 if this is horrendously expensive,

55:48.240 --> 55:50.460
 you have an economy of scale, Kecan.

55:50.460 --> 55:52.480
 So what ends up happening is the system becomes

55:52.480 --> 55:54.400
 less decentralized over time

55:54.400 --> 55:56.800
 because you have these vertically integrated operations.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.000
 I mean, not everybody can go build a mining facility

55:59.000 --> 56:00.800
 on a volcano in El Salvador.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.840
 Not everybody can go to Mongolia

56:02.840 --> 56:05.080
 and set up a five gigawatt power plant

56:05.080 --> 56:06.280
 and a huge data thing.

56:06.280 --> 56:08.920
 Not everybody has access to the patent basics

56:08.920 --> 56:10.080
 that people produce.

56:10.080 --> 56:11.320
 Cause what if I don't sell it to you

56:11.320 --> 56:12.600
 and I have the patent on it?

56:12.600 --> 56:15.240
 Or what if I control the supply chain for these things?

56:15.240 --> 56:17.660
 So you'll end up having centralization

56:17.660 --> 56:20.640
 around maybe 10 or five major operations

56:20.640 --> 56:23.280
 as we've seen historically with proof of work.

56:23.280 --> 56:27.080
 And that means you end up having like a ruling class

56:27.080 --> 56:29.360
 of a mining oligarchy in the system.

56:29.360 --> 56:32.280
 Proof of stake, if you design the parameters correctly,

56:32.280 --> 56:34.960
 you actually get more decentralized over time

56:34.960 --> 56:37.200
 because as the currency goes up in value,

56:37.200 --> 56:39.960
 the distribution of the currency tends to get

56:39.960 --> 56:43.120
 more egalitarian.

56:43.120 --> 56:45.600
 For example, Bill Gates, when he started Microsoft,

56:45.600 --> 56:47.480
 he had 64% of the shares.

56:47.480 --> 56:49.860
 Now he has less than 5% of the shares.

56:49.860 --> 56:52.040
 So there's founder drift over time

56:52.040 --> 56:54.120
 as the value goes up, divestment occurs.

56:54.120 --> 56:56.600
 You have more and more and more people coming in.

56:56.600 --> 56:58.280
 That means there's more people who can participate

56:58.280 --> 56:59.280
 in the consensus.

56:59.280 --> 57:01.160
 You can even tune economic parameters.

57:01.160 --> 57:03.920
 And this is what we did with Cardano and Ouroboros.

57:03.920 --> 57:06.680
 We created this concept of K in the system

57:06.680 --> 57:07.600
 and it's just a parameter.

57:07.600 --> 57:09.640
 And it's like a forcing factor

57:09.640 --> 57:12.200
 that tends to accumulate a certain amount of stake pool.

57:12.200 --> 57:15.200
 So you can set it to 200 and then 500 and 1,000

57:15.200 --> 57:16.120
 and so forth.

57:16.120 --> 57:19.280
 But the basic idea is as the price of 80 goes up,

57:19.280 --> 57:23.080
 you make K larger and then you end up in practical terms

57:23.080 --> 57:25.720
 having a larger and larger set of actors

57:25.720 --> 57:28.600
 making blocks that are unique and distinct.

57:28.600 --> 57:31.420
 And the other good thing is this is a virtual resource

57:31.420 --> 57:32.960
 instead of a physical resource,

57:32.960 --> 57:35.840
 which means it's portable by the click of a button.

57:35.840 --> 57:37.880
 So let's say China says mining is bad.

57:37.880 --> 57:39.000
 We're gonna shut it all down.

57:39.000 --> 57:40.960
 And it looks like they're moving in that direction.

57:40.960 --> 57:42.160
 You have all these people in WeChat

57:42.160 --> 57:44.080
 just like trying to sell miners

57:44.080 --> 57:46.640
 or trying to figure out how the hell do I move miners?

57:46.640 --> 57:48.200
 Cause they have these huge data centers

57:48.200 --> 57:49.040
 they've constructed.

57:49.040 --> 57:50.720
 You can't exactly go and grab a server

57:50.720 --> 57:52.440
 and like take it with you, it's huge.

57:52.440 --> 57:53.280
 It's a lot of work.

57:53.280 --> 57:54.320
 And if the government sees it,

57:54.320 --> 57:56.000
 well it's their property now.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.920
 A virtual resource, you can click a button

57:57.920 --> 58:00.800
 and redeploy it to a different jurisdiction.

58:00.800 --> 58:03.520
 So to me, for a virtual asset,

58:03.520 --> 58:06.120
 it makes a lot more sense to try to tie your security

58:06.120 --> 58:09.000
 to something endogenous, something within the system

58:09.000 --> 58:11.040
 because it's just like the asset.

58:11.040 --> 58:13.200
 It can move anywhere at a click of a button

58:13.200 --> 58:15.160
 and human beings have a much harder time

58:15.160 --> 58:16.520
 attacking something like that.

58:16.520 --> 58:19.560
 Well, so people, maybe you could certainly devil's advocate

58:19.560 --> 58:21.600
 and say, what is the strength of proof of work system?

58:21.600 --> 58:24.640
 Because some people would argue that proof of work

58:24.640 --> 58:28.000
 has, because it's outside the system,

58:28.000 --> 58:31.240
 it's tied to physical resources, it's more secure.

58:31.240 --> 58:36.240
 It's less prone to attack by large groups of people.

58:36.520 --> 58:37.840
 Yeah, that's a great question.

58:37.840 --> 58:39.920
 And the first question we had was,

58:39.920 --> 58:41.800
 could proof of stake actually work or not?

58:41.800 --> 58:44.760
 So the problem was that the engineers kind of led

58:44.760 --> 58:46.080
 when the science should have led.

58:46.080 --> 58:48.200
 And so there were all these POS protocols

58:48.200 --> 58:50.440
 that came out in the early 2010s

58:50.440 --> 58:54.280
 like Peercoin was the first and then NXT and others came out.

58:54.280 --> 58:55.920
 And there they had suffered from things like

58:55.920 --> 58:57.560
 the random number generation wasn't good.

58:57.560 --> 58:59.800
 They had grinding attacks and nothing at stake

58:59.800 --> 59:00.760
 and all these other things.

59:00.760 --> 59:02.560
 And there's a lot of beautiful properties

59:02.560 --> 59:04.400
 for proof of work from a theoretical sense.

59:04.400 --> 59:06.800
 We even wrote a paper called GKL,

59:06.800 --> 59:09.640
 named after the author is Juan Grey,

59:09.640 --> 59:11.800
 Nickelodeon artist and Aguilos Gassis,

59:11.800 --> 59:13.080
 our chief scientist.

59:13.080 --> 59:17.280
 It's got 1,100 citations now and it's published in 2015.

59:17.280 --> 59:19.400
 But basically all it did is just modeled a blockchain

59:19.400 --> 59:21.240
 and created some security properties for it.

59:21.240 --> 59:22.480
 And then it started talking about,

59:22.480 --> 59:24.640
 well, what does proof of work actually do for you?

59:24.640 --> 59:26.280
 And it turns out it does a lot.

59:26.280 --> 59:28.080
 It's an asynchronous system.

59:28.080 --> 59:29.680
 You can bootstrap from Genesis.

59:29.680 --> 59:34.080
 So if Eve joins the network and Wally joins the network

59:34.080 --> 59:36.920
 and Daisy joined the network,

59:36.920 --> 59:39.520
 then you give them some different chains

59:39.520 --> 59:41.320
 like five or 10 different chains.

59:41.320 --> 59:43.000
 They can run a calculation

59:43.000 --> 59:45.160
 and they will always pick the longest chain,

59:45.160 --> 59:47.240
 the heaviest chain inside the system.

59:47.240 --> 59:49.520
 That's a great property of proof of work

59:49.520 --> 59:52.920
 until we published Orbor's Genesis in 2018.

59:52.920 --> 59:54.880
 You actually needed to solve that in proof of stake

59:54.880 --> 59:56.600
 with a trusted checkpoint.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.840
 So some actor had to be observing,

59:58.840 --> 1:00:00.960
 watching the whole thing and creating checkpoints.

1:00:00.960 --> 1:00:02.600
 And then when new people joined in,

1:00:02.600 --> 1:00:05.080
 they would only be able to distinguish between a chain

1:00:05.080 --> 1:00:07.800
 based upon a checkpoint telling them that.

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:10.200
 So you have to do a lot of really wonky crazy math

1:00:10.200 --> 1:00:12.920
 to show and create this notion of like density

1:00:12.920 --> 1:00:14.800
 to be able to show that that's possible.

1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:16.640
 But there's a lot of properties of proof of work

1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:19.040
 that were super hard to replicate and emulate

1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:20.960
 in the proof of stake world.

1:00:20.960 --> 1:00:24.600
 Macaulay kind of revolutionized the whole VRF thing.

1:00:24.600 --> 1:00:26.160
 There was a group out of Cornell

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:28.120
 that talked about better network conditions.

1:00:28.120 --> 1:00:30.400
 They wrote a paper called Sleepy.

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:32.000
 We did Genesis.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:34.800
 We also did the very first Prupuli secure protocol.

1:00:34.800 --> 1:00:37.320
 But that was six years of work and like 12 papers.

1:00:37.320 --> 1:00:38.160
 And it's still not done.

1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:39.880
 There's still a few polishing things

1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:41.760
 that have to be cleaned up

1:00:41.760 --> 1:00:44.960
 because this is a physical resource

1:00:44.960 --> 1:00:46.440
 and there's something there.

1:00:46.440 --> 1:00:48.200
 But there's a flaw to proof of work

1:00:48.200 --> 1:00:49.560
 that is a little problematic.

1:00:49.560 --> 1:00:51.240
 It's a winner take all type of a system.

1:00:51.240 --> 1:00:54.760
 So maximalism is kind of philosophically

1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:56.680
 and computationally built into it.

1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:00.000
 Let's say you have two proof of work systems

1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:03.240
 and they have roughly the same market cap and hash rate

1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:05.360
 and they use the same algorithm.

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:08.000
 Then the problem is if the miner comes in

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.840
 and let's say the miner has enough resources

1:01:09.840 --> 1:01:13.560
 to have 51% for any of these chains,

1:01:13.560 --> 1:01:15.120
 they actually have a perverse incentive

1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:18.080
 to come and destroy one chain

1:01:18.080 --> 1:01:19.640
 and short sell the asset.

1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:21.240
 It's called a gold finger attack

1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:23.360
 and then go mine the other asset

1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:25.400
 because they're not bound to that asset.

1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:26.840
 They're not loyal to it.

1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:29.720
 And they can make just as much profit mining this

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:31.880
 as they can make mining the other system

1:01:31.880 --> 1:01:33.520
 and the markets allow them to profit

1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:35.240
 from the destruction of a system.

1:01:35.240 --> 1:01:37.840
 So that's something that proof of stake doesn't suffer from

1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:39.760
 because the only way you can participate

1:01:39.760 --> 1:01:42.200
 in a proof of stake system is you have to actually own equity

1:01:42.200 --> 1:01:44.200
 and you have to have ownership in that system.

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:46.960
 So if you go and destroy Daisy's chain,

1:01:46.960 --> 1:01:50.560
 it would just be a net loss for the most part.

1:01:50.560 --> 1:01:51.920
 Unless you have really messed up markets

1:01:51.920 --> 1:01:53.160
 or something like that.

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:55.080
 So there's always trade offs and all these things.

1:01:55.080 --> 1:01:57.200
 And this is why I like this concept of going one to N

1:01:57.200 --> 1:01:58.960
 and having multiple resources

1:01:58.960 --> 1:02:00.640
 because why not have proof of work

1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:02.200
 and proof of stake together?

1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.440
 If the proof of work is useful, not wasted computation

1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:06.640
 and why not add other things

1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:08.800
 like create incentives for network relay.

1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:10.480
 Right now there's no incentives in the system

1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:12.440
 for you to run peer to peer nodes and share data.

1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:13.600
 Right now it's not a problem,

1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:16.520
 but if you're running like Amazon web services level

1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:19.200
 at bandwidth it could cost you like $5,000 a month

1:02:19.200 --> 1:02:21.400
 in bandwidth just to run a full node or something like that.

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:22.520
 No one would do it.

1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:26.160
 So then your system will centralize along the weakest link

1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:28.600
 whether it be the storage layer, the computation layer

1:02:28.600 --> 1:02:31.200
 or the network layer of the system.

1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:33.520
 So if you can incentivize the resources differently

1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:35.080
 then you'll be in a beautiful position

1:02:35.080 --> 1:02:37.720
 where you end up having a resilient system

1:02:37.720 --> 1:02:39.520
 that pays its own bills.

1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:43.440
 So how does Cardano solve the consensus problem?

1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:46.840
 Do you tend to eventually wanting to solve it

1:02:46.840 --> 1:02:50.400
 in the hybrid approach of proof of stake and proof of work?

1:02:50.400 --> 1:02:52.280
 Yeah, this was a philosophical difference

1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:54.480
 between Vitalik and myself.

1:02:54.480 --> 1:02:56.520
 The problem with the people in the Ethereum side

1:02:56.520 --> 1:02:59.000
 is they're really bright and these really bright people

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.960
 what they do is they try to do everything all at once

1:03:01.960 --> 1:03:03.280
 because they're really, really smart

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:05.480
 and they keep going until they run up against the wall

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:07.960
 and they realize the problem is a lot harder.

1:03:07.960 --> 1:03:09.400
 If you're more experienced

1:03:09.400 --> 1:03:11.480
 and that's why we brought in proper academics

1:03:11.480 --> 1:03:13.680
 like Agilos and others, because they'd been beaten up

1:03:13.680 --> 1:03:16.600
 through life, Agilos worked with David Chom

1:03:16.600 --> 1:03:19.680
 and these other, there's really hard work with those guys

1:03:19.680 --> 1:03:22.240
 and they'd already been humiliated and yelled at

1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:24.040
 and had chalk thrown at them and all that stuff.

1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:25.160
 And so they were humble enough to say,

1:03:25.160 --> 1:03:27.200
 I'm not smart enough to solve the big problem.

1:03:27.200 --> 1:03:28.280
 So don't even try.

1:03:28.280 --> 1:03:30.600
 What you do is you decompose it and you say, okay

1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:33.680
 what's the first problem to solve in a chain of problems

1:03:33.680 --> 1:03:37.200
 that you can compose your way up to a working system?

1:03:37.200 --> 1:03:39.240
 And once you get far enough along

1:03:39.240 --> 1:03:41.520
 you have something that's pretty good

1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:43.680
 and then you have an obvious path forward

1:03:43.680 --> 1:03:45.920
 of how do you iterate and improve that system?

1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:47.760
 That's why we started with GKL 15

1:03:47.760 --> 1:03:48.600
 because it was just saying,

1:03:48.600 --> 1:03:51.280
 we don't know what a fucking blockchain is.

1:03:51.280 --> 1:03:52.400
 What is this thing, right?

1:03:52.400 --> 1:03:53.960
 What's the security properties of stuff?

1:03:53.960 --> 1:03:55.680
 Like what did we really mean?

1:03:55.680 --> 1:03:57.280
 Then we did Orboros Classic,

1:03:57.280 --> 1:03:59.720
 the original Orboros protocol in 2017.

1:03:59.720 --> 1:04:02.120
 And that protocol was like a synchronous system

1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:05.160
 and it assumed the nodes were always on and it worked

1:04:05.160 --> 1:04:08.040
 but it was useless because that's not real life.

1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:10.560
 Then PROS came out and then suddenly we relaxed things.

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:11.640
 These are all by the way names

1:04:11.640 --> 1:04:12.920
 for consensus algorithms and computations.

1:04:12.920 --> 1:04:14.520
 Yeah, the papers that we published

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:17.240
 and they were all peer reviewed like GKL was EuroCrypt.

1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:19.080
 That's a very hard conference to get into

1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:20.600
 and Orboros Classic was crypto

1:04:20.600 --> 1:04:24.560
 and PROS was EuroCrypt and Genesis was CCS.

1:04:24.560 --> 1:04:27.720
 So basically every step of the way was first

1:04:27.720 --> 1:04:29.840
 at academic validation that there was some merit

1:04:29.840 --> 1:04:31.280
 to the work that was done.

1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:34.080
 Second, it solved a particular class of problems

1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:36.800
 either showing the feasibility of the entire problem.

1:04:36.800 --> 1:04:38.680
 Because when I said, let's do the model first

1:04:38.680 --> 1:04:40.360
 because let's see if we can do an FLP thing.

1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:42.200
 Let's see if we can get a possibility theorem.

1:04:42.200 --> 1:04:43.680
 That's great because you're done.

1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:45.920
 It's like those short math papers were like,

1:04:45.920 --> 1:04:47.240
 I found a counter example.

1:04:47.240 --> 1:04:49.360
 It's like, okay, this whole thing has fallen apart

1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:51.800
 because you have a two line proof, thank you.

1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:53.000
 So that's what we were looking for

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:54.640
 in the beginning of the agenda was

1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:57.760
 let's either prove it's possible in a strawman case

1:04:57.760 --> 1:05:00.120
 or show that there exists an impossibility result

1:05:00.120 --> 1:05:02.240
 in which case we can just abandon the entire inquiry.

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:03.800
 Proof of stake is impossible.

1:05:03.800 --> 1:05:06.120
 And then once you've gotten past that threshold,

1:05:06.120 --> 1:05:08.480
 it goes from theory to practicality.

1:05:08.480 --> 1:05:10.880
 What actual network conditions are you looking at?

1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:13.360
 Are you okay with living with an external clock

1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:15.320
 or do you want to build time from within?

1:05:15.320 --> 1:05:17.960
 How are you generating random numbers, et cetera, et cetera?

1:05:17.960 --> 1:05:19.920
 And every step of the way, each paper,

1:05:19.920 --> 1:05:22.440
 you're solving one particular class of problems.

1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:23.800
 With Prism, it said,

1:05:23.800 --> 1:05:26.720
 probably shouldn't know ahead of time who Eve is.

1:05:26.720 --> 1:05:28.840
 You probably shouldn't know who's making those blocks.

1:05:28.840 --> 1:05:30.920
 That should be something after the fact.

1:05:30.920 --> 1:05:32.800
 But if you know ahead of time, you can attack them,

1:05:32.800 --> 1:05:35.760
 you can DDoS them, you cause all kinds of problems.

1:05:35.760 --> 1:05:38.520
 So adaptive security also,

1:05:38.520 --> 1:05:41.600
 we moved from an MPC random number generation,

1:05:41.600 --> 1:05:44.160
 which was great, but very heavy and very slow.

1:05:44.160 --> 1:05:46.480
 And you can't scale to large amounts of people

1:05:46.480 --> 1:05:48.680
 to a VRF based system, which is super fast,

1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:49.760
 but a little dirtier,

1:05:49.760 --> 1:05:52.120
 because Algorand actually did some great work there.

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:53.440
 There was some good knowledge there.

1:05:53.440 --> 1:05:54.800
 What are the really hard problems that you,

1:05:54.800 --> 1:05:56.760
 maybe if you just linger on a little bit,

1:05:56.760 --> 1:05:58.520
 what are some of the really hard problems

1:05:58.520 --> 1:06:01.440
 you have to solve along this chain of papers, ideas,

1:06:01.440 --> 1:06:03.080
 the evolution of the consensus algorithm?

1:06:03.080 --> 1:06:04.960
 Yeah, not only are they really hard problems,

1:06:04.960 --> 1:06:06.720
 they actually require different cryptographers,

1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:10.560
 because you're moving from mathematician style cryptographers,

1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:12.720
 like the Neil Coplitz's and the Addie Chameer's,

1:06:12.720 --> 1:06:14.920
 and the people that like start as proper mathematicians,

1:06:14.920 --> 1:06:16.880
 they really love theory.

1:06:16.880 --> 1:06:17.720
 And that's their thing.

1:06:17.720 --> 1:06:19.600
 And the proofs are dense and they're thick

1:06:19.600 --> 1:06:23.680
 and they're beautiful to practical applied work,

1:06:23.680 --> 1:06:24.920
 where you're saying, okay,

1:06:24.920 --> 1:06:27.080
 now this is something an engineer can look at

1:06:27.080 --> 1:06:28.640
 and say, I know how to build that.

1:06:28.640 --> 1:06:30.120
 I know how to think about that.

1:06:30.120 --> 1:06:33.360
 So that transition from GKL to,

1:06:33.360 --> 1:06:35.640
 or of course, classic to PRAUSE,

1:06:35.640 --> 1:06:38.840
 I'd say the biggest leap was classic to PRAUSE,

1:06:38.840 --> 1:06:40.920
 because that was going from a system

1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:43.600
 that would only work in a consortium chain like fabric,

1:06:43.600 --> 1:06:45.800
 to a system that would actually work and is working.

1:06:45.800 --> 1:06:47.920
 That's what's implementing Cardano today.

1:06:47.920 --> 1:06:50.680
 50 billion dollar cryptocurrency and all these people,

1:06:50.680 --> 1:06:52.200
 that was a huge leap.

1:06:52.200 --> 1:06:54.200
 But that paper alone wasn't enough.

1:06:54.200 --> 1:06:56.920
 We also had to layer on the economic model,

1:06:56.920 --> 1:06:58.960
 because we said, well, hang on a second here,

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.080
 not everybody's gonna be online all the time

1:07:01.080 --> 1:07:03.400
 to be available to make a block,

1:07:03.400 --> 1:07:05.400
 so you need some notion of delegation.

1:07:05.400 --> 1:07:06.880
 The minute you have a notion of delegation,

1:07:06.880 --> 1:07:09.320
 you have these stake pools, what the hell does that mean?

1:07:09.320 --> 1:07:12.880
 And so this is a beautiful kind of interdisciplinary notion

1:07:12.880 --> 1:07:16.040
 that layers computer science and biology together.

1:07:16.040 --> 1:07:18.040
 And minute that complexity starts going up,

1:07:18.040 --> 1:07:20.400
 you start seeing cell specialization.

1:07:20.400 --> 1:07:23.200
 So you go from single cell organisms to organisms

1:07:23.200 --> 1:07:26.000
 where you have eyeballs and brains and hearts,

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.080
 and each of these tissues do different things.

1:07:28.080 --> 1:07:30.800
 Well, analogously, complex distributed systems

1:07:30.800 --> 1:07:32.080
 start getting specialization.

1:07:32.080 --> 1:07:34.280
 You move from the single cell thing,

1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:35.800
 Bitcoin, where everything's a full node,

1:07:35.800 --> 1:07:37.520
 they all have the same rights and responsibilities,

1:07:37.520 --> 1:07:39.480
 a lot of homogeneity in that system,

1:07:39.480 --> 1:07:41.000
 but you're only as good as your weakest link,

1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:45.040
 you're only as capable as whatever the basic cell can do,

1:07:45.040 --> 1:07:47.760
 to a specialized system where you start having these actors

1:07:47.760 --> 1:07:50.240
 in the system that are actually a little different

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:51.080
 than the other actors.

1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:53.320
 So you introduce this concept of the stake pool,

1:07:53.320 --> 1:07:54.720
 and suddenly now you have this actor

1:07:54.720 --> 1:07:57.640
 where you're probably gonna be online 24 seven.

1:07:57.640 --> 1:08:00.120
 You're probably gonna have extra relay infrastructure.

1:08:00.120 --> 1:08:03.640
 There's a trust relationship where you don't own the ADA,

1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:05.840
 but you have a right to use it for something,

1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:08.520
 and a person's made that choice to endow you with that.

1:08:08.520 --> 1:08:10.960
 The minute that you introduce specialization, though,

1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:12.560
 the system gets more complicated,

1:08:12.560 --> 1:08:14.560
 the game theory gets more complicated,

1:08:14.560 --> 1:08:16.320
 and then you start having to think really deeply

1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:18.800
 and carefully about, okay, well,

1:08:18.800 --> 1:08:20.920
 can this now introduce a new attack vector

1:08:20.920 --> 1:08:22.480
 that we didn't have before?

1:08:22.480 --> 1:08:24.960
 So that leap from classic to prowess,

1:08:24.960 --> 1:08:26.680
 and adding in stake pools and figuring out

1:08:26.680 --> 1:08:29.080
 how to handle the game theory there was exceedingly hard,

1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:30.560
 but two years to do that.

1:08:30.560 --> 1:08:33.480
 So stake pools allows for multiple parties

1:08:33.480 --> 1:08:36.800
 to delegate their staking capabilities to others.

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:38.440
 Can you describe a little bit how this works?

1:08:38.440 --> 1:08:39.280
 It's kind of fascinating.

1:08:39.280 --> 1:08:40.600
 It's a super simple concept.

1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:42.840
 So you register a pool, and then the pool is there,

1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:46.280
 and basically they advertise,

1:08:46.280 --> 1:08:48.920
 and they're actually registered on chain with a certificate,

1:08:48.920 --> 1:08:50.720
 and then in the wallet software itself,

1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:53.400
 you can see all of the pools that have registered.

1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:56.120
 There's over 3,000 of them now inside the system,

1:08:56.120 --> 1:08:57.720
 and then you can click a little tile,

1:08:57.720 --> 1:08:59.000
 and it shows you all the metadata

1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:00.040
 that's in the certificate,

1:09:00.040 --> 1:09:02.280
 and it says, hey, I have my own pool.

1:09:02.280 --> 1:09:05.280
 It's called Rats, I'm king of the rats.

1:09:05.280 --> 1:09:07.440
 So you can see all the stuff that's described there,

1:09:07.440 --> 1:09:08.920
 and pools have an operating fee,

1:09:08.920 --> 1:09:09.960
 because they're like a business,

1:09:09.960 --> 1:09:11.880
 and they say, well, if you delegate to me,

1:09:11.880 --> 1:09:13.160
 I'll charge this much.

1:09:13.160 --> 1:09:15.760
 So if you get like 100 bucks in rewards,

1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:19.120
 I'll give you 9D, and I'll take 10 or something like that,

1:09:19.120 --> 1:09:20.480
 and then you make your decision,

1:09:20.480 --> 1:09:21.600
 and whichever one you select,

1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:24.360
 you click delegate, push the button,

1:09:24.360 --> 1:09:28.520
 and then you have now given your staking rights to them

1:09:28.520 --> 1:09:30.960
 until revoked, okay, so it lived there,

1:09:30.960 --> 1:09:33.760
 and then the stake pool's weight in the system

1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:35.600
 is proportional to the amount of stake

1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:37.240
 that they have delegated to them,

1:09:37.240 --> 1:09:39.440
 and then we have this other limiting factor, K,

1:09:39.440 --> 1:09:41.520
 which says that you get diminishing returns

1:09:41.520 --> 1:09:42.760
 with the more stake you have,

1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:44.360
 so it's kind of like an S function,

1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:46.920
 so you kind of go up and up and then eventually caps,

1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:48.640
 and then at some point you get no rewards

1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:50.000
 beyond a certain threshold,

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.800
 so there's an incentive to split pools

1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:54.440
 to different owners after some point.

1:09:54.440 --> 1:09:57.080
 Yeah, and so that's a complex thing,

1:09:57.080 --> 1:09:59.160
 and you have to actually model the game theory out

1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:01.560
 to understand where those parameters should be set,

1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:02.840
 and we didn't know how to do that,

1:10:02.840 --> 1:10:04.880
 so what we did is we bought talent,

1:10:04.880 --> 1:10:07.560
 we went to Oxford, and we hired this guy named Elias Casupis,

1:10:07.560 --> 1:10:08.920
 he's an algorithmic game theorist,

1:10:08.920 --> 1:10:11.560
 and we said, hey, would you like to do some game theory work

1:10:11.560 --> 1:10:13.760
 in crypto, and he's like, that sounds fun,

1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:15.240
 so he spent a year and a half,

1:10:15.240 --> 1:10:16.680
 we built all these beautiful models,

1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:18.560
 and we kind of figured out what those curves needed

1:10:18.560 --> 1:10:19.400
 to look like.

1:10:19.400 --> 1:10:20.240
 So figure out like the S curve, though,

1:10:20.240 --> 1:10:22.880
 resulted in a nice distribution of responsibility,

1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:26.240
 so not everybody delegates to the king of their ads.

1:10:26.240 --> 1:10:27.080
 Exactly.

1:10:27.080 --> 1:10:28.600
 How does it feel to be royalty, by the way?

1:10:28.600 --> 1:10:31.880
 It's not a very impressive kingdom,

1:10:31.880 --> 1:10:33.280
 but you're nevertheless a king.

1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:35.240
 I'll take it, because I think it's the kindest thing

1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:37.280
 people call me in this space.

1:10:37.280 --> 1:10:39.200
 Oh, yeah, people love you.

1:10:39.200 --> 1:10:41.840
 So, okay, so that, I mean, so is that,

1:10:41.840 --> 1:10:43.880
 would you say a solved problem?

1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:45.480
 The game theory of stake pools?

1:10:45.480 --> 1:10:48.040
 No, it's the starting, and then I was getting back

1:10:48.040 --> 1:10:48.880
 to my original point,

1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:50.480
 that you build things in iterations,

1:10:50.480 --> 1:10:53.040
 every step, if you've done it right,

1:10:53.040 --> 1:10:55.840
 is an invitation for 10 more sexy, fascinating,

1:10:55.840 --> 1:10:57.800
 fun problems, and this is why we have such a great time

1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:00.040
 building labs, you know, we started in Edinburgh,

1:11:00.040 --> 1:11:02.400
 now we're at Tokyo Tech, and University of Wyoming,

1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:05.240
 and Athens, and we're setting up more labs this year,

1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:06.920
 and all these academics want to work with us, hey,

1:11:06.920 --> 1:11:09.080
 because we write a lot of really fascinating papers,

1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:12.240
 but B, because we're focused on all these really cool,

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:14.080
 sexy, interdisciplinary problems.

1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:15.080
 We're actually running the problems

1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:17.040
 where we don't even know where to publish the paper,

1:11:17.040 --> 1:11:17.960
 because you'll have this paper

1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:20.360
 where there's like these PL guys working with crypto guys,

1:11:20.360 --> 1:11:23.080
 working with systems guys, working with economists,

1:11:23.080 --> 1:11:23.920
 and you put it all together,

1:11:23.920 --> 1:11:26.080
 and you have this Frankenstein paper monster,

1:11:26.080 --> 1:11:27.680
 and we're like, where do we submit this?

1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:28.920
 You know, where does this go?

1:11:28.920 --> 1:11:29.760
 Nature.

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:30.680
 Yeah, there we go.

1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:32.840
 Nature or quanta or something, I don't know.

1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:33.680
 It'll write a nice little.

1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:36.560
 So the sexy problems multiply exponentially.

1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:38.960
 Exactly, and we've now gotten to a point

1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:42.000
 where we're starting to work on refinements to the system,

1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:44.920
 rather than fundamental things that are like,

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:47.440
 if you don't solve it, the system just simply doesn't work.

1:11:47.440 --> 1:11:49.880
 For example, you can run all of this with NTP

1:11:49.880 --> 1:11:50.840
 as your clock server,

1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:52.680
 but you actually can create an ocean of time within.

1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:55.480
 We wrote a paper called World War's Chronos for that, okay?

1:11:55.480 --> 1:11:58.280
 But that's not necessary for the system.

1:11:58.280 --> 1:11:59.520
 It's just a nice to have thing.

1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:00.400
 It's a nice property.

1:12:00.400 --> 1:12:02.120
 Optimization of the random number generation

1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:03.040
 is another example of that.

1:12:03.040 --> 1:12:04.680
 You can run it with a heavier thing.

1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:06.080
 You just have more blockchain bloat

1:12:06.080 --> 1:12:08.440
 and slower time and transition.

1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:09.920
 We have this concept of epic.

1:12:09.920 --> 1:12:13.840
 So you elect leaders to run the system

1:12:13.840 --> 1:12:15.760
 every five days with Cardano,

1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:17.120
 but there's been derivative work.

1:12:17.120 --> 1:12:18.120
 We didn't even do this.

1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:19.960
 This work occurred at University of Illinois,

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:21.080
 and that derivative work said,

1:12:21.080 --> 1:12:22.320
 well, you don't actually need to do that.

1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:24.520
 You can do it on a block by block basis.

1:12:24.520 --> 1:12:26.120
 It's like, oh, that's pretty cool.

1:12:26.120 --> 1:12:27.560
 So that's the other point about doing things

1:12:27.560 --> 1:12:28.880
 in a very rigorous way,

1:12:28.880 --> 1:12:32.480
 is that that way is creates a lingual franca

1:12:32.480 --> 1:12:33.880
 for what you're trying to solve

1:12:33.880 --> 1:12:36.400
 with the totality of the academic community.

1:12:36.400 --> 1:12:38.320
 So suddenly people that you've never met,

1:12:38.320 --> 1:12:40.440
 you know, nothing about have read your papers,

1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:43.000
 cited your papers, and start writing their own papers,

1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.680
 either to try to attack and destroy things you've done,

1:12:45.680 --> 1:12:48.120
 or to build on top of the things that you've done.

1:12:48.120 --> 1:12:50.360
 So people are trying to figure out ways to attack this.

1:12:50.360 --> 1:12:51.200
 Exactly.

1:12:51.200 --> 1:12:52.920
 As rigorous as you are trying to do that.

1:12:52.920 --> 1:12:54.120
 And I don't have to pay them.

1:12:54.120 --> 1:12:55.280
 That's the beautiful thing.

1:12:55.280 --> 1:12:56.120
 It's fun.

1:12:56.120 --> 1:12:57.440
 It's fun to try to destroy,

1:12:57.440 --> 1:12:58.480
 and that's how we grow stronger.

1:12:58.480 --> 1:12:59.840
 And it's how you build your career, too.

1:12:59.840 --> 1:13:02.280
 There's plenty of people that they've gotten tenure

1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:04.840
 just kicking the hell out of Intel SGX.

1:13:04.840 --> 1:13:06.120
 You go to CCS every year,

1:13:06.120 --> 1:13:06.960
 there's some guy there,

1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:09.360
 and he's having a hell of a time making Intel cry.

1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:13.320
 Can we pull back historically speaking,

1:13:13.320 --> 1:13:14.760
 and in terms of the big picture

1:13:14.760 --> 1:13:16.160
 of cryptocurrency real quick,

1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:19.040
 and ask the question, what is Cardano?

1:13:19.040 --> 1:13:20.440
 We started talking about already

1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:23.480
 the consensus algorithm Cardano takes,

1:13:23.480 --> 1:13:26.320
 but maybe when you look at the history books,

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:28.800
 you know, sort of a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy,

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:31.200
 and Cardano will have one sentence.

1:13:31.200 --> 1:13:33.320
 What's that one sentence going to be?

1:13:33.320 --> 1:13:35.320
 And in general, what's like the vision

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:37.520
 in the context of the history of cryptocurrency?

1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:39.560
 You have like this whiteboard overview video

1:13:39.560 --> 1:13:42.240
 that you talk about the three generations

1:13:42.240 --> 1:13:44.400
 of cryptocurrency where Cardano is the third.

1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:47.680
 So that's like five different questions

1:13:47.680 --> 1:13:49.040
 we've asked in the exact same thing

1:13:49.040 --> 1:13:50.840
 you can answer however the hell you want.

1:13:50.840 --> 1:13:55.320
 You know, I always term Cardano as like a FOSS,

1:13:55.320 --> 1:13:56.840
 a financial operating system,

1:13:56.840 --> 1:13:57.880
 and nobody likes it,

1:13:57.880 --> 1:14:00.000
 and everybody picks on me for using that term.

1:14:00.000 --> 1:14:01.560
 But basically the idea is that, you know,

1:14:01.560 --> 1:14:03.120
 the world runs on systems,

1:14:03.120 --> 1:14:04.360
 especially the financial world.

1:14:04.360 --> 1:14:07.840
 You have the BIS and SWIFT and all this other stuff,

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:11.640
 and these protocols allow you to move value around

1:14:11.640 --> 1:14:13.400
 and represent things like identity,

1:14:13.400 --> 1:14:17.040
 and allow you to express yourself in some way.

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:19.920
 And those protocols for the most part work well

1:14:19.920 --> 1:14:22.040
 for people in rich countries,

1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:23.840
 and they don't work so well for people

1:14:23.840 --> 1:14:25.560
 who aren't in rich countries.

1:14:25.560 --> 1:14:28.360
 And so the point of what we do,

1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:30.560
 or at least what I do, and what my company does,

1:14:30.560 --> 1:14:32.800
 is we think a lot about how do we build

1:14:32.800 --> 1:14:35.400
 a universal protocol that does all the stuff

1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:36.560
 the legacy system has,

1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:38.440
 but just does it better, faster, and cheaper

1:14:38.440 --> 1:14:39.840
 for everybody in the world?

1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:42.080
 And everybody has equal access to it, you know?

1:14:42.080 --> 1:14:43.760
 So it's the people's protocol, you know?

1:14:43.760 --> 1:14:46.240
 You have a situation where the guy in Senegal

1:14:46.240 --> 1:14:48.800
 has the same access that I do, or Bill Gates does,

1:14:48.800 --> 1:14:50.480
 or someone else who's kind of higher

1:14:50.480 --> 1:14:52.880
 on the spectrum of wealth and power.

1:14:52.880 --> 1:14:56.760
 And so that is what we seek to achieve,

1:14:56.760 --> 1:14:59.480
 but then the question is, well, is Cardano the solution?

1:14:59.480 --> 1:15:01.480
 You know, is that that thing?

1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:02.680
 And the answer is no,

1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:05.520
 because you need a lot more evolution.

1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:06.960
 You need decades of evolution

1:15:06.960 --> 1:15:08.880
 to kind of work your way there,

1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:11.160
 and in many ways the work is never quite done,

1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:13.960
 but it's better than what came before.

1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:14.800
 Why?

1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:17.160
 Because you have a realization that first,

1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:19.760
 the control of the system needs to be more balanced

1:15:19.760 --> 1:15:23.640
 and nuanced, and it needs to be more democratic.

1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:25.800
 So there's this sustainability component of,

1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:28.400
 well, who's in charge, and how do you pay for things?

1:15:28.400 --> 1:15:30.040
 Well, the system can print its own money,

1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:31.920
 so it always has the ability to have a budget.

1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:34.200
 Okay, so there's a treasury idea,

1:15:34.200 --> 1:15:35.800
 and then there's a voting thing.

1:15:35.800 --> 1:15:38.040
 Well, the same things that allow you to move money around,

1:15:38.040 --> 1:15:39.320
 allow you to represent votes,

1:15:39.320 --> 1:15:42.200
 so you can do eVoting with the type of system, okay?

1:15:42.200 --> 1:15:44.840
 And, you know, if you played NOMIC in the 1980s,

1:15:44.840 --> 1:15:46.600
 and you're a Peter Super fan or any of these things,

1:15:46.600 --> 1:15:48.280
 you can build a self evolving system.

1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:50.040
 You can actually create a game where the rules

1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:52.920
 can be voted on and changed in the game itself.

1:15:52.920 --> 1:15:56.080
 Great, okay, so that exists there.

1:15:56.080 --> 1:15:57.440
 And then you say, okay, well,

1:15:57.440 --> 1:15:59.760
 but this thing still has to touch the legacy world,

1:15:59.760 --> 1:16:01.720
 there has to be cash in and cash out,

1:16:01.720 --> 1:16:02.840
 and these types of things.

1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:04.520
 So there's this interoperability thing,

1:16:04.520 --> 1:16:07.120
 that you need a wifi or a Bluetooth moment for the industry,

1:16:07.120 --> 1:16:08.680
 because nothing understands each other right now.

1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.720
 And all these chains are blind deaf and dumb to each other.

1:16:11.720 --> 1:16:12.560
 And then there's this thing

1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:14.400
 that it has to work at a huge scale,

1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:15.720
 like billions of people.

1:16:15.720 --> 1:16:16.560
 And we've done that,

1:16:16.560 --> 1:16:18.680
 but we've done that with large multinational

1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:21.240
 trillion dollar companies with centralized infrastructure.

1:16:21.240 --> 1:16:24.320
 We've never really done that with one master protocol

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:25.480
 that somehow does it for everyone.

1:16:25.480 --> 1:16:28.040
 The closest approximation is probably BitTorrent.

1:16:28.040 --> 1:16:31.480
 And there is, you know, it's a cool protocol,

1:16:31.480 --> 1:16:34.040
 but it doesn't have all the oomph necessary

1:16:34.040 --> 1:16:36.480
 to necessary to do something like this.

1:16:36.480 --> 1:16:38.840
 So Cardano is just our first approximation.

1:16:38.840 --> 1:16:40.880
 And like any good system,

1:16:40.880 --> 1:16:42.600
 we wanted it to be self evolving.

1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:43.960
 So once you get the philosophy out of,

1:16:43.960 --> 1:16:46.560
 where's the target of what do you want to do?

1:16:46.560 --> 1:16:47.840
 Then you build a community,

1:16:47.840 --> 1:16:49.720
 you know, it's over a million people strong,

1:16:49.720 --> 1:16:51.320
 and that community keeps growing,

1:16:51.320 --> 1:16:52.840
 and they keep pushing the system

1:16:52.840 --> 1:16:54.280
 in that particular direction.

1:16:54.280 --> 1:16:55.440
 And what's nice about it is you,

1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:57.720
 if you build the right philosophy within the system,

1:16:57.720 --> 1:16:58.880
 it doesn't need founders.

1:16:58.880 --> 1:17:00.480
 This is the great lesson of Satoshi.

1:17:00.480 --> 1:17:02.840
 It doesn't need founders to be able to get there.

1:17:02.840 --> 1:17:07.840
 So, you know, if you look at the academic side,

1:17:07.920 --> 1:17:09.720
 that's very decentralized.

1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:11.680
 We have more than 30 different contributors

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:14.280
 for the 105 papers, and that set keeps growing

1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:15.240
 within the next five years.

1:17:15.240 --> 1:17:18.080
 It'll probably be two, three, 400 different scientists

1:17:18.080 --> 1:17:19.720
 from all across the world,

1:17:19.720 --> 1:17:21.480
 some from Russia and some from India,

1:17:21.480 --> 1:17:23.480
 some from China and some from Japan

1:17:23.480 --> 1:17:25.920
 and America and Africa and South America.

1:17:25.920 --> 1:17:28.800
 And the faces change, the language has changed,

1:17:28.800 --> 1:17:32.480
 the culture has changed, but the process stays the same.

1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:34.360
 And that is a permanent organ

1:17:34.360 --> 1:17:36.880
 within what we have constructed as a system.

1:17:36.880 --> 1:17:38.920
 It's the same situation entering marketplaces,

1:17:38.920 --> 1:17:40.440
 like we entered Ethiopia.

1:17:40.440 --> 1:17:41.280
 What are we doing there?

1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:43.000
 We have five million people in Ethiopia.

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:44.800
 We're getting them digital identity

1:17:44.800 --> 1:17:47.120
 and we're dragging that digital identity into the system

1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:48.400
 because that's the most fundamental thing

1:17:48.400 --> 1:17:50.080
 of a financial operating system.

1:17:50.080 --> 1:17:51.680
 You need to know who people are

1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:53.280
 in order to be able to do business with them,

1:17:53.280 --> 1:17:56.120
 give them credit, be able to give them economic agency

1:17:56.120 --> 1:17:56.960
 and so the thing.

1:17:56.960 --> 1:17:58.960
 But once they're there, they're gonna grow up

1:17:58.960 --> 1:18:00.240
 with that system.

1:18:00.240 --> 1:18:02.240
 They're gonna deploy applications on that system.

1:18:02.240 --> 1:18:03.440
 They're gonna build on that system.

1:18:03.440 --> 1:18:05.240
 We're gonna use it every day for getting a loan

1:18:05.240 --> 1:18:06.520
 or payments and so forth.

1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:08.000
 And if they have pain points,

1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.520
 what they're gonna do is evolve that system

1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:13.600
 to be able to mitigate, manage those particular pain points

1:18:13.600 --> 1:18:16.360
 to a point where the system is competitive for it.

1:18:16.360 --> 1:18:19.800
 So my job is to be, we have this tagline

1:18:19.800 --> 1:18:21.920
 in our company, cascading disruption.

1:18:21.920 --> 1:18:23.760
 My job is to be the first domino.

1:18:23.760 --> 1:18:26.600
 Just kind of knock it over and watch the cascade

1:18:26.600 --> 1:18:28.400
 and it kind of blows and blows and blows up

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:31.320
 until eventually it gets to where we need to go.

1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:33.560
 And what I was trying to think about with Cardano

1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:38.240
 was how do you build the minimum viable set of tools

1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:42.120
 and social processes that once we push the domino,

1:18:42.120 --> 1:18:43.920
 the system will just evolve to a point

1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:46.240
 where eventually you can grow to fill that need,

1:18:46.240 --> 1:18:49.400
 not out of charity, but out of self interest.

1:18:49.400 --> 1:18:51.920
 People want things better, faster, cheaper.

1:18:51.920 --> 1:18:54.760
 People want to have economic agency,

1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:56.320
 especially when they lack it.

1:18:56.320 --> 1:18:59.240
 Nobody wants to grow up in a world where they're unbanked

1:18:59.240 --> 1:19:01.120
 and they have no access to marketplaces.

1:19:01.120 --> 1:19:03.240
 They're going to seek it, look at Mpasa.

1:19:03.240 --> 1:19:06.240
 It's a great example of that, like cell phone minutes.

1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:07.840
 They're using it as a currency.

1:19:07.840 --> 1:19:09.760
 So that's where we're at.

1:19:09.760 --> 1:19:11.640
 And I say a few more years, I think we'll have

1:19:11.640 --> 1:19:15.120
 that right minimum viable set of dynamics inside the system.

1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:16.920
 And then it's inevitable, in my view,

1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:20.200
 that it'll kind of grow and consume and become this concept.

1:19:20.200 --> 1:19:21.640
 And what's really cool is there's competition

1:19:21.640 --> 1:19:22.760
 in the systems and concepts.

1:19:22.760 --> 1:19:24.760
 So China is trying to do the same thing.

1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:26.800
 They're saying, how do we de dollarize the world

1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:28.280
 and create a digital yuan?

1:19:28.280 --> 1:19:30.160
 So they have a very top down notion

1:19:30.160 --> 1:19:32.200
 of how to apply this technology and bring it in.

1:19:32.200 --> 1:19:33.440
 And they even have an identity system

1:19:33.440 --> 1:19:35.720
 they're building in parallel called social credit.

1:19:35.720 --> 1:19:37.440
 We have an identity system, a teleprism,

1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:38.280
 that we're putting in.

1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:40.280
 Ours is bottom up and you own your own identity,

1:19:40.280 --> 1:19:41.760
 social credit, you have no idea.

1:19:41.760 --> 1:19:43.960
 You just have a number and some computers giving it to you.

1:19:43.960 --> 1:19:46.160
 But they're both trying to do the exact same thing.

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:49.040
 And it's going to be this clash of cultures at some point

1:19:49.040 --> 1:19:53.160
 between the open fosters and the top down authoritarian fosters

1:19:53.160 --> 1:19:56.040
 and probably some Hegelian dialectic actions that happen.

1:19:56.040 --> 1:19:59.080
 We'll create some sort of somewhat closed,

1:19:59.080 --> 1:20:02.760
 somewhat authoritarian, libertarian utopia.

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:05.560
 Yeah, most likely it would be AI's battling

1:20:05.560 --> 1:20:06.640
 in the space of fosters.

1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:09.000
 So I really like this idea of financial operating system,

1:20:09.000 --> 1:20:13.520
 but the letter F, so financial,

1:20:13.520 --> 1:20:18.040
 is this just a basic mechanism

1:20:18.040 --> 1:20:21.000
 with which you can have social interaction there for,

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:22.320
 or all kinds of interactions,

1:20:22.320 --> 1:20:23.720
 therefore have an identity?

1:20:23.720 --> 1:20:26.200
 Like is F essential to this?

1:20:26.200 --> 1:20:28.240
 Yeah, because that's how people care.

1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:31.360
 You need resources to survive and finances

1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:34.640
 is kind of like this field of managing your resources

1:20:34.640 --> 1:20:36.160
 in an intelligent way.

1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:38.720
 And you could call it SOFI too, social finance.

1:20:38.720 --> 1:20:42.400
 The nomenclature hasn't exactly been settled

1:20:42.400 --> 1:20:44.440
 for our industry and that's fun.

1:20:44.440 --> 1:20:48.800
 But basically the concept is that you have something

1:20:48.800 --> 1:20:51.280
 and you want to be able to store it, transform it,

1:20:51.280 --> 1:20:54.040
 trade it and use it to survive.

1:20:54.040 --> 1:20:56.760
 And the question is what rails do you do that on?

1:20:56.760 --> 1:20:59.400
 Do you do those on centralized controlled rails

1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:01.320
 where there are these third parties

1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:04.480
 that are basically able to live off those things,

1:21:04.480 --> 1:21:06.080
 come very fat and epitistic,

1:21:06.080 --> 1:21:07.160
 or do you want to do it on rails

1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:08.640
 where there's no middleman?

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:10.000
 You have a direct relationship

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.320
 with whoever you're doing business

1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:13.200
 and if you invite more people to the transaction,

1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:15.600
 they're middleman of value, not necessity.

1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:16.680
 And that's really the,

1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:19.280
 I would like to say the resonant of our space,

1:21:19.280 --> 1:21:21.640
 that the reason we exist is to try to figure out a way

1:21:21.640 --> 1:21:24.280
 to kill the middleman and try to figure out a way

1:21:24.280 --> 1:21:27.040
 that we can better quantify value and transform it,

1:21:27.040 --> 1:21:28.480
 move it, manipulate it.

1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:30.240
 And in many ways we've actually discovered

1:21:30.240 --> 1:21:32.760
 some amazing things in the last 10 years as an industry.

1:21:32.760 --> 1:21:35.440
 Like we've kind of created the financial stem cell.

1:21:35.440 --> 1:21:37.920
 This idea of a token can now just as well be

1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:39.880
 a national currency as a CBDC

1:21:39.880 --> 1:21:42.560
 as it can represent a crypto kitty.

1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:46.080
 The same architecture can do stuff at the nation scale,

1:21:46.080 --> 1:21:48.400
 can do stuff for a 12 year old kid in Texas.

1:21:48.400 --> 1:21:50.000
 It's pretty amazing to see that.

1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:54.960
 But sort of in that whiteboard presentation,

1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:57.960
 you gave these three phases

1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:01.120
 and you're kind of implying that there'll be end phases

1:22:01.120 --> 1:22:02.800
 to this whole evolution.

1:22:02.800 --> 1:22:05.400
 And Cardano is just like the cutting edge.

1:22:05.400 --> 1:22:08.800
 But if you look back to Bitcoin,

1:22:08.800 --> 1:22:12.320
 how would you compare Cardano versus Bitcoin?

1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:16.200
 Sort of where we are, how we started and how it's going.

1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:17.280
 Okay.

1:22:17.280 --> 1:22:19.080
 So what I did in that video

1:22:19.080 --> 1:22:21.360
 and I've done in a lot of media interviews

1:22:21.360 --> 1:22:23.000
 because I think it really helps people

1:22:23.000 --> 1:22:24.880
 understand where we're at in the clock

1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:27.760
 is face things in terms of generations.

1:22:27.760 --> 1:22:30.000
 And so I said, well, the first generation is Bitcoin.

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.800
 And really the problem Bitcoin was trying to solve

1:22:31.800 --> 1:22:34.880
 is saying every time we want to represent or move value,

1:22:34.880 --> 1:22:39.000
 we need some sort of trusted third party to facilitate that.

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:40.480
 So can we build some sort of system

1:22:40.480 --> 1:22:42.320
 where we can create some notion of value

1:22:42.320 --> 1:22:44.880
 that can be teleported around the world

1:22:44.880 --> 1:22:47.240
 and it doesn't require a trusted third party?

1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:49.720
 That's it. And it's done in a beautiful way

1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:52.480
 because it didn't try to be anything else.

1:22:52.480 --> 1:22:54.520
 It just was, you only have Bitcoin,

1:22:54.520 --> 1:22:56.760
 you can only do one type of thing, you can only push it.

1:22:56.760 --> 1:22:58.720
 You can do some things on the encumbrances

1:22:58.720 --> 1:23:00.680
 of like multi sig and other things.

1:23:00.680 --> 1:23:04.200
 But that's a one trick pony as a system.

1:23:04.200 --> 1:23:05.280
 And it wasn't really clear

1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:07.280
 if that was going to work or not for a long time.

1:23:07.280 --> 1:23:09.800
 It took several years to build up enough network effect

1:23:09.800 --> 1:23:12.120
 and for Bitcoins to actually become valuable.

1:23:12.120 --> 1:23:15.160
 And I'd say the inflection point was 2013.

1:23:15.160 --> 1:23:17.720
 And at that point, it became a billion dollar market cap.

1:23:17.720 --> 1:23:20.000
 There were like Silicon Valley startups,

1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:21.920
 real exchanges were forming.

1:23:21.920 --> 1:23:23.640
 And it got to a point where there was legitimacy

1:23:23.640 --> 1:23:25.480
 behind the concept and people started getting,

1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:27.560
 this is a really incredible idea

1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:29.640
 because I can have a capital controls

1:23:29.640 --> 1:23:32.800
 with that I can like move $10 billion of something

1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:35.080
 from one country to another country in five minutes.

1:23:35.080 --> 1:23:36.800
 It's like, I could never do that before.

1:23:36.800 --> 1:23:38.960
 And you know, this is incredible.

1:23:38.960 --> 1:23:42.000
 Okay. The problem is the minute that people validate

1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:46.280
 the idea, they immediately want something they don't have.

1:23:46.280 --> 1:23:48.640
 So like the minute Elon can land a rocket,

1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:50.480
 you know, there's the next big thing, right?

1:23:50.480 --> 1:23:53.600
 You've landed the Falcon 9, now you're on the Starship.

1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:56.360
 Similarly, you say, okay, I want programmability

1:23:56.360 --> 1:23:57.480
 with this thing.

1:23:57.480 --> 1:23:59.800
 It's kind of like when JavaScript came to the web browser,

1:23:59.800 --> 1:24:02.240
 you went from these static, perhaps pretty,

1:24:02.240 --> 1:24:05.480
 but ultimately static non interactive pages

1:24:05.480 --> 1:24:08.080
 to YouTube and Google and Facebook

1:24:08.080 --> 1:24:10.840
 and these amazing, rich, incredible experiences

1:24:10.840 --> 1:24:13.280
 because now you can actually interact with the user.

1:24:13.280 --> 1:24:15.560
 You can program things, stuff runs on their side,

1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:16.800
 stuff runs on your side.

1:24:16.800 --> 1:24:19.160
 It's a beautiful two way relationship.

1:24:19.160 --> 1:24:21.280
 So that's what Ethereum effectively did.

1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:24.120
 They bolted a programming language onto a blockchain

1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:27.640
 and they went from a certain use case

1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:30.040
 to whatever your imagination can have,

1:24:30.040 --> 1:24:31.760
 you know, like sunshine and rainbows

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:33.440
 and unicorns and these types of things.

1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:35.840
 So you're saying as Bitcoin is HTML

1:24:35.840 --> 1:24:37.440
 and Ethereum is JavaScript?

1:24:37.440 --> 1:24:39.360
 Basically, yeah, it was like when JavaScript came

1:24:39.360 --> 1:24:41.000
 and with like JavaScript,

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.160
 it has all kinds of problems and issues.

1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.240
 I wonder who's flash in this analogy.

1:24:45.240 --> 1:24:47.120
 Well, that's metaphor, but let's not go.

1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:49.440
 Well, actually there were plenty of active Xs and flashes.

1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:52.080
 NXT was an example of a fail to start

1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:54.080
 and BitShares was another example.

1:24:54.080 --> 1:24:56.080
 There were a lot of people who tried to add some notion

1:24:56.080 --> 1:24:58.560
 of programmability and or a different view

1:24:58.560 --> 1:25:00.160
 of how these things should be done

1:25:00.160 --> 1:25:02.000
 and they were not as competitive.

1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.280
 Ethereum kind of came out at that JavaScript moment.

1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:05.360
 Okay, the minute you have that,

1:25:05.360 --> 1:25:08.880
 then suddenly you have ICOs and DeFi and STOs

1:25:08.880 --> 1:25:11.960
 and NFTs and all these word salads of things

1:25:11.960 --> 1:25:13.880
 and then people start using to get frustrated.

1:25:13.880 --> 1:25:16.560
 Why? Because it's too slow, it's too expensive,

1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:18.720
 it doesn't talk to the things they want it to talk to

1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:21.800
 and also it gets too big to manage itself.

1:25:21.800 --> 1:25:25.080
 When you're small, you have founders and foundations

1:25:25.080 --> 1:25:27.360
 and you have trusted actors and core developers

1:25:27.360 --> 1:25:29.200
 and you can feed them with pizzas.

1:25:29.200 --> 1:25:30.680
 You know them, you can meet them,

1:25:30.680 --> 1:25:32.680
 you can shake their hands at conferences.

1:25:33.560 --> 1:25:36.160
 When you're a multi billion person system,

1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:39.880
 you're too large to be able to do that.

1:25:39.880 --> 1:25:42.880
 For example, we had the Shelley summit last year,

1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:44.880
 we invited Vint Cerf to come to the summit.

1:25:44.880 --> 1:25:47.560
 Vint's a brilliant guy and he created the internet

1:25:47.560 --> 1:25:49.200
 with Bob and the rest of the gang

1:25:49.200 --> 1:25:52.000
 and back in those days, it was such a simple,

1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:55.480
 small system that one of their students,

1:25:55.480 --> 1:25:56.760
 they said, hey, you need to test it,

1:25:56.760 --> 1:25:58.400
 you created a video game, just kind of test the thing

1:25:58.400 --> 1:25:59.920
 and you could call the guy on the other side

1:25:59.920 --> 1:26:00.920
 and say, are you seeing this?

1:26:00.920 --> 1:26:01.840
 Are you getting the signal?

1:26:01.840 --> 1:26:03.520
 They used to have an actual address book

1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:05.000
 for email addresses.

1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:07.680
 Yeah, so you'd open up the books, look it up

1:26:07.680 --> 1:26:08.520
 and now look at the internet.

1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:10.040
 It's like, who's in charge of that?

1:26:10.040 --> 1:26:12.880
 It's this gargantuan network

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:15.360
 and there's no group of people you can bring in

1:26:15.360 --> 1:26:18.520
 and thus the internet evolves very slowly.

1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:20.040
 You see, and so that's the problem

1:26:20.040 --> 1:26:21.360
 is that you have this situation

1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:23.360
 where you wanna do lots of utility,

1:26:23.360 --> 1:26:24.200
 you wanna do a lot of things,

1:26:24.200 --> 1:26:26.120
 you wanna be a financial operating system

1:26:26.120 --> 1:26:28.800
 and be everything to everyone,

1:26:28.800 --> 1:26:30.680
 but then your rate of evolution slows down

1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:32.560
 as your rate of adoption speeds up.

1:26:32.560 --> 1:26:35.040
 So that's one of the other design goals

1:26:35.040 --> 1:26:35.880
 of the third generation.

1:26:35.880 --> 1:26:37.040
 It's not good enough just to do things

1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:39.840
 better, faster, cheaper and have consistent cost

1:26:39.840 --> 1:26:42.560
 with your population growing or talk to everything,

1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:43.880
 your wifi moment.

1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:46.480
 You also need a system that can govern itself

1:26:46.480 --> 1:26:48.280
 at a scale of millions to billions of people

1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:49.760
 who have divergent interest.

1:26:49.760 --> 1:26:52.400
 Some cases, ice pick and eye divergent interest.

1:26:52.400 --> 1:26:55.400
 They really hate each other and they don't get along.

1:26:55.400 --> 1:26:56.800
 And so that's what we termed

1:26:56.800 --> 1:26:58.360
 a third generation cryptocurrency

1:26:58.360 --> 1:27:00.920
 and there's a lot of people attempting to compete

1:27:00.920 --> 1:27:01.760
 in that space.

1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:05.080
 You know, there's Taizos and Algran, ICP and Polkadot

1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:07.120
 and so forth, and each and every one of them

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:09.640
 kind of brings a different blend of things that they value.

1:27:09.640 --> 1:27:12.560
 So it's not completely equal between scalability,

1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:14.640
 interoperability and sustainability.

1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:17.280
 Some people were very focused on high throughput,

1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:19.200
 lots of transactions per second.

1:27:19.200 --> 1:27:21.720
 Other people very focused on governance,

1:27:21.720 --> 1:27:24.880
 like Taizos is like the governance chain

1:27:24.880 --> 1:27:27.320
 and they were one of the first to do a self amending ledger.

1:27:27.320 --> 1:27:30.120
 And other people are like Aeon or Polkadot,

1:27:30.120 --> 1:27:31.560
 they're really thinking carefully about

1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:34.080
 how do we build a nice interoperable ecosystem?

1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:35.600
 With Cardano, we tried to actually tackle

1:27:35.600 --> 1:27:36.840
 all three at the same time,

1:27:36.840 --> 1:27:37.680
 which was one of the reasons

1:27:37.680 --> 1:27:39.960
 why we were a little slower out of the gate.

1:27:39.960 --> 1:27:41.360
 We had to write a lot more protocols,

1:27:41.360 --> 1:27:43.000
 but we think we've kind of come up

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.960
 with a beautiful interlocking design for all of them.

1:27:45.960 --> 1:27:48.200
 And again, the point is not to get it perfect,

1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:52.080
 but rather get those just right set of evolutionary factors

1:27:52.080 --> 1:27:54.680
 that when you click the domino,

1:27:54.680 --> 1:27:57.560
 it just self evolves into what you need it to get to.

1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:01.840
 Allow me to stretch the metaphor further.

1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:04.960
 If Bitcoin is HTML, there's HTML5,

1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:06.440
 if Ethereum is JavaScript,

1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:08.880
 JavaScript with V8 has become quite fast,

1:28:08.880 --> 1:28:11.240
 quite runs much of the internet.

1:28:11.240 --> 1:28:15.120
 So the argument could be that eventually

1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:17.080
 everything will be JavaScript,

1:28:17.080 --> 1:28:20.600
 or maybe you could say eventually everything would be HTML

1:28:20.600 --> 1:28:22.160
 and it'd just be a bunch of different tools

1:28:22.160 --> 1:28:23.800
 that generate that HTML.

1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:28.280
 So is it possible that just like we were so,

1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:32.000
 we eventually return to generation one, Bitcoin,

1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:35.200
 or we return to generation two, Ethereum,

1:28:37.800 --> 1:28:39.320
 at the end of this journey?

1:28:39.320 --> 1:28:40.800
 You know, the problem is your tail

1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:42.920
 is wagging the dog there.

1:28:42.920 --> 1:28:45.680
 You have a situation where you're so focused

1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:48.640
 on the technology that you're failing to understand

1:28:48.640 --> 1:28:51.800
 that there's still Daisy here, you still have the user.

1:28:51.800 --> 1:28:53.120
 And where's the app store?

1:28:53.120 --> 1:28:54.760
 Where's the one click install?

1:28:54.760 --> 1:28:56.120
 Where's the use and utility?

1:28:56.120 --> 1:28:58.040
 You know, all these layer two protocols

1:28:58.040 --> 1:28:59.880
 and these DeFi applications in five years

1:28:59.880 --> 1:29:03.200
 that are completely protocol and blockchain agnostic.

1:29:03.200 --> 1:29:04.040
 Because at the end of the day

1:29:04.040 --> 1:29:06.000
 they care about liquidity, operating cost,

1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:07.360
 and user experience.

1:29:07.360 --> 1:29:10.320
 It's so preposterous and absurd for somebody to say,

1:29:10.320 --> 1:29:13.000
 oh well, I'm gonna go build my application,

1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:14.840
 get on the Apple store,

1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:17.480
 and I'm gonna use Amazon as my web host.

1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:20.440
 And no matter what happens, I will always use Amazon,

1:29:20.440 --> 1:29:22.200
 even if the operating cost is crazy.

1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:23.280
 I see. You see?

1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:25.920
 And so we're just in a unique period of history

1:29:25.920 --> 1:29:27.160
 where there's a network effect

1:29:27.160 --> 1:29:29.120
 around some initial infrastructure

1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:30.840
 and people tend to be building around that.

1:29:30.840 --> 1:29:34.920
 But every single one of the top DeFi providers

1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:36.680
 are, if they're getting successful

1:29:36.680 --> 1:29:38.000
 into a certain network effect,

1:29:38.000 --> 1:29:40.400
 they're having the multi chain conversation.

1:29:40.400 --> 1:29:42.560
 So I don't really believe in a winner takes all,

1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:45.120
 a maximless view of well, there's gonna be some protocol

1:29:45.120 --> 1:29:46.360
 that becomes the God protocol.

1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:48.400
 First, because they evolved too quickly.

1:29:48.400 --> 1:29:50.880
 Second, the incentives aren't aligned for that.

1:29:50.880 --> 1:29:53.240
 TCPIP didn't have a token connected to it.

1:29:53.240 --> 1:29:55.000
 There was no financial incentive

1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:57.320
 where if TCPIP got adopted over something else,

1:29:57.320 --> 1:30:00.160
 they would make some big company crazy amounts of money.

1:30:00.160 --> 1:30:02.680
 It was a useful piece of infrastructure.

1:30:02.680 --> 1:30:05.080
 So I think that the third generation

1:30:05.080 --> 1:30:07.600
 is gonna be as defined by the social components

1:30:07.600 --> 1:30:09.080
 and the usability components

1:30:09.080 --> 1:30:12.360
 as it is by the technological capabilities of the system.

1:30:12.360 --> 1:30:14.680
 Really what these technological capabilities gave you

1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:18.040
 was the ability to demonstrate a proof of concept

1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:19.240
 and say these things are possible.

1:30:19.240 --> 1:30:22.560
 Kind of like Xerox PARC, when Steve and Bill came in,

1:30:22.560 --> 1:30:25.200
 they said, wow, you have networked computers,

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:28.480
 object oriented programming and a GUI.

1:30:28.480 --> 1:30:30.360
 And this is like, what, was it 70s?

1:30:30.360 --> 1:30:31.960
 It's like, wow, it's incredible.

1:30:31.960 --> 1:30:33.480
 But none of that was an actual product.

1:30:33.480 --> 1:30:34.560
 That wasn't a Macintosh.

1:30:34.560 --> 1:30:37.200
 But it was enough to get the idea

1:30:37.200 --> 1:30:39.320
 and then it was a race to how do we productize

1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:40.280
 something like that.

1:30:40.280 --> 1:30:43.080
 And in that case, it actually took several decades

1:30:43.080 --> 1:30:45.200
 to roll out that vision that those guys had.

1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:47.680
 And I think that's what Bitcoin and Ethereum did.

1:30:47.680 --> 1:30:50.400
 But what's unique about this is normally you throw away

1:30:50.400 --> 1:30:51.720
 the prior experiments.

1:30:51.720 --> 1:30:54.040
 With these things, these are self evolving systems.

1:30:54.040 --> 1:30:57.480
 So it's entirely possible to, Joe Rogan quote,

1:30:57.480 --> 1:31:01.080
 to evolve Bitcoin to a point where it could become

1:31:01.080 --> 1:31:02.960
 a third generation system as desired

1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:05.720
 as some amalgamation of layer one and layer two protocols.

1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:06.920
 And it's the same for Ethereum.

1:31:06.920 --> 1:31:09.080
 In fact, Vitalik is throwing away Ethereum

1:31:09.080 --> 1:31:10.960
 and replacing with Ethereum too.

1:31:10.960 --> 1:31:12.760
 Because he recognizes he needs to upgrade

1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:13.800
 and evolve the system.

1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:15.040
 And that's what makes it fun

1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:17.840
 because the techniques and methodologies

1:31:17.840 --> 1:31:20.560
 that they've chosen to evolve and upgrade this system

1:31:20.560 --> 1:31:24.280
 are distinctly different from the ones that we've chosen.

1:31:24.280 --> 1:31:26.760
 And we have no idea which one's actually going to win.

1:31:26.760 --> 1:31:28.240
 But we learn from each other

1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:29.960
 and we co evolve from each other.

1:31:29.960 --> 1:31:32.520
 So you're running like all these experiments in real time

1:31:32.520 --> 1:31:33.880
 in a giant marketplace.

1:31:33.880 --> 1:31:35.680
 And maybe they'll consolidate,

1:31:35.680 --> 1:31:36.880
 maybe they'll stay divergent.

1:31:36.880 --> 1:31:38.080
 I mean, look at big tech.

1:31:38.080 --> 1:31:40.280
 You have Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook,

1:31:40.280 --> 1:31:42.880
 they all coexist and they're a trillion dollar companies.

1:31:42.880 --> 1:31:46.400
 Some cases with TCP, it consolidates to one standard.

1:31:46.400 --> 1:31:47.680
 That's what we end up using.

1:31:47.680 --> 1:31:52.680
 So what's your intuition with Cardano having the proof of stake

1:31:52.960 --> 1:31:55.520
 and then eventually smart contracts

1:31:55.520 --> 1:31:59.000
 versus the Bitcoin with layer two technologies,

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:01.000
 this kind of evolving creature.

1:32:02.120 --> 1:32:04.120
 Again, you said you can't really predict the future,

1:32:04.120 --> 1:32:05.440
 but what's your intuition?

1:32:05.440 --> 1:32:10.440
 Why one might be more successful than the other?

1:32:10.440 --> 1:32:14.960
 So the problem with Bitcoin is it is so slow.

1:32:14.960 --> 1:32:17.960
 It's like the mainframe programming of the past.

1:32:17.960 --> 1:32:19.680
 And it's the only reason it's still around

1:32:19.680 --> 1:32:22.240
 is because there was so much invested in keeping it around

1:32:22.240 --> 1:32:24.160
 that we just kind of have to leave it there

1:32:24.160 --> 1:32:27.120
 and one day Cobol will die, you know?

1:32:27.120 --> 1:32:29.720
 It's a, it's, it's,

1:32:29.720 --> 1:32:32.560
 there's nothing about it from a collection of USPs

1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:34.160
 that's particularly desirable.

1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:36.040
 You have extremely long settlement time.

1:32:36.040 --> 1:32:38.200
 You have extremely low programmability.

1:32:38.200 --> 1:32:39.720
 It is not aware of any other system.

1:32:39.720 --> 1:32:42.400
 There's no native way of issuing an asset in that system.

1:32:42.400 --> 1:32:44.200
 You can't even do a poll transaction.

1:32:44.200 --> 1:32:47.160
 You can't do anything that's interesting or unique there.

1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:49.000
 And yeah, all due respect.

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.240
 It's, you know, mafia, all due respect.

1:32:51.240 --> 1:32:54.240
 Oh, you got some problems.

1:32:54.240 --> 1:32:55.080
 You need to lose the weight.

1:32:55.080 --> 1:32:56.640
 You come to me on the day of my daughter's wedding.

1:32:56.640 --> 1:32:57.480
 I know, I know.

1:32:57.480 --> 1:32:59.480
 So, you know, all due respect to the Bitcoin people.

1:32:59.480 --> 1:33:03.280
 It's like an amazing, incredible first generation thing.

1:33:03.280 --> 1:33:06.520
 And it really, we're all here because of Bitcoin,

1:33:06.520 --> 1:33:08.640
 but the problem is you have to upgrade the damn thing.

1:33:08.640 --> 1:33:11.600
 You know, just because you were a high school football star

1:33:11.600 --> 1:33:13.920
 doesn't mean that 30 years later,

1:33:13.920 --> 1:33:16.320
 you're still a high school football star in the same shape.

1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:17.720
 You got the beer belly, you're old,

1:33:17.720 --> 1:33:18.920
 you're not doing this thing again.

1:33:18.920 --> 1:33:20.480
 That's what Bitcoin has to do.

1:33:20.480 --> 1:33:22.000
 There's fundamental improvements

1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:25.600
 that I think Bitcoin can make at the protocol level

1:33:25.600 --> 1:33:28.280
 that would actually make it an incredibly competitive system.

1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:30.560
 Like if they wanted to keep Nakamoto consensus,

1:33:30.560 --> 1:33:33.320
 proof of work, there's ways to enhance proof of work.

1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:36.040
 I mean, Mingen Seer did this with Bitcoin NG,

1:33:36.040 --> 1:33:38.640
 Promotivus Wanus did this with Prism,

1:33:38.640 --> 1:33:40.320
 make it 10,000 times faster

1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:43.000
 and you don't compromise the fundamental security assumptions

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:44.160
 that the system has.

1:33:44.160 --> 1:33:46.040
 You can add programmability to it.

1:33:46.040 --> 1:33:48.480
 Blockstream created a language called simplicity.

1:33:48.480 --> 1:33:50.520
 And so there's actual ways to extend,

1:33:50.520 --> 1:33:53.360
 and we did this with Cardano with the extended UTXO model,

1:33:53.360 --> 1:33:55.680
 there's ways to extend what Bitcoin has,

1:33:55.680 --> 1:33:57.440
 keep the philosophy, the accounting,

1:33:57.440 --> 1:33:59.640
 the way of thinking about transactions,

1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:02.440
 but then suddenly you can now do DeFi and other things.

1:34:02.440 --> 1:34:03.520
 But what they've done is said,

1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:06.200
 we will not evolve the base layer at all

1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:08.760
 and we're just gonna build all this layer two stuff,

1:34:08.760 --> 1:34:11.600
 which is usually highly fragile and centralized

1:34:11.600 --> 1:34:13.080
 and requires enormous effort

1:34:13.080 --> 1:34:14.640
 at the base level to do anything.

1:34:14.640 --> 1:34:15.800
 There's, it's not a coincidence

1:34:15.800 --> 1:34:17.840
 Vitalik started as a color coins guy

1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:20.240
 and a master coin guy hanging out in those circles.

1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:22.800
 He was trying to innovate and do things in Bitcoin

1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:24.880
 and it was so hard and difficult

1:34:24.880 --> 1:34:27.200
 that he started diverging and going and doing things

1:34:27.200 --> 1:34:29.600
 in a different system entirely.

1:34:29.600 --> 1:34:31.520
 You know, I knew the master coin guys,

1:34:31.520 --> 1:34:33.720
 Jared and all these people, they were maximalists.

1:34:33.720 --> 1:34:35.480
 They really wanted to build something cool

1:34:35.480 --> 1:34:37.880
 and exciting for Bitcoin and anything they did,

1:34:37.880 --> 1:34:39.240
 the developers would attack them.

1:34:39.240 --> 1:34:41.360
 They say, oh, you're misusing op return.

1:34:41.360 --> 1:34:43.080
 You're doing this at, it was a holy war

1:34:43.080 --> 1:34:44.680
 anytime you wanted to evolve.

1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:46.720
 So I think it's its own worst enemy.

1:34:46.720 --> 1:34:49.000
 It has the network effect, it has the brand name,

1:34:49.000 --> 1:34:50.960
 it has the regulatory approval,

1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:53.680
 but there's no way to change the system,

1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:56.680
 even correcting obvious downsides in that system.

1:34:56.680 --> 1:34:59.040
 Now, what's really cool is Ethereum doesn't suffer

1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:00.320
 from that problem.

1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:02.480
 It's getting to a point where it has

1:35:02.480 --> 1:35:04.200
 a similar network effect to Bitcoin,

1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:08.000
 but the community there is completely different in culture.

1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.920
 They love evolving, they love upgrading,

1:35:09.920 --> 1:35:11.840
 sometimes a little too much.

1:35:11.840 --> 1:35:15.040
 And so that means that if you look at the trajectory

1:35:15.040 --> 1:35:17.320
 of things, if I had to bet just those two systems,

1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:20.400
 Bitcoin or Ethereum, I would say nine times out of 10,

1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:23.360
 Ethereum is going to win the fight against Bitcoin

1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:25.200
 if it was the only competitor.

1:35:25.200 --> 1:35:26.200
 But obviously we're here

1:35:26.200 --> 1:35:27.560
 and a lot of other people are here,

1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:29.600
 so there's different things going on.

1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:31.520
 So it's a much more complex game.

1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:33.360
 But I think that's always the key,

1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:35.160
 zooming out a little bit.

1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:36.640
 Set the technology aside

1:35:36.640 --> 1:35:38.560
 and the word salad of cryptography aside,

1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:39.760
 because it's too much.

1:35:39.760 --> 1:35:41.040
 We have to always do is say,

1:35:41.040 --> 1:35:44.040
 what incentive does the system have to evolve?

1:35:44.040 --> 1:35:46.640
 And when you look at things like Android and the App Store

1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:48.920
 and these analogous platforms,

1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:51.120
 you say, ah, the evolution is user driven

1:35:51.120 --> 1:35:52.360
 and there's a financial incentive

1:35:52.360 --> 1:35:53.800
 for the user to participate.

1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:56.200
 So if I had to look at the trajectory of this thing,

1:35:56.200 --> 1:35:57.720
 come back 10 years later,

1:35:57.720 --> 1:35:59.840
 probably gonna have millions of applications

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:01.680
 and lots of stuff going on

1:36:01.680 --> 1:36:04.200
 because that's the way the system was constructed.

1:36:04.200 --> 1:36:05.520
 Okay, it makes sense.

1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:06.360
 When you look at Bitcoin,

1:36:06.360 --> 1:36:09.240
 you say what is the incentive to evolve the system?

1:36:09.240 --> 1:36:10.520
 There's none.

1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:12.320
 What is the incentive for the system

1:36:12.320 --> 1:36:13.680
 to get more competitive?

1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:14.520
 It's none.

1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:15.340
 In fact, it's the opposite.

1:36:15.340 --> 1:36:16.520
 They've turned it into a religion.

1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:19.480
 I was in Miami at this Bitcoin conference there.

1:36:19.480 --> 1:36:21.520
 I had a toilet paper roll thrown at me

1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:23.080
 that had shit coin written on it.

1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:25.480
 You have Max Kaiser out on the stage,

1:36:25.480 --> 1:36:29.440
 doing his best Rick James impression, you know.

1:36:29.440 --> 1:36:31.520
 We'll see the guy that did the FE on.

1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:35.000
 Yes, yes, yes, and so you're watching this stuff

1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:36.080
 and you say, okay, first,

1:36:36.080 --> 1:36:37.840
 why would anybody want to join that?

1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:40.560
 And then second, where is the conversation

1:36:40.560 --> 1:36:42.560
 about how do we achieve something?

1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:44.480
 I started with Cardano the end in mind.

1:36:44.480 --> 1:36:47.040
 I said, we really want to sit down

1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:49.000
 and build this financial operating system.

1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:51.000
 And the definition of success is

1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:52.340
 the poorest person in the world

1:36:52.340 --> 1:36:53.920
 has access the same system

1:36:53.920 --> 1:36:55.480
 as the richest person in the world.

1:36:55.480 --> 1:36:57.720
 And they both get treated fairly.

1:36:57.720 --> 1:36:59.160
 We've never had that happen before.

1:36:59.160 --> 1:37:00.040
 Okay, that's something.

1:37:00.040 --> 1:37:01.320
 You can agree with it, disagree with it,

1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:03.200
 say it's boiling the ocean, it's impossible.

1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:04.480
 At least I have something.

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:06.320
 I can't for the life of me understand

1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:08.080
 what the hell is the point of Bitcoin?

1:37:08.080 --> 1:37:11.120
 When I joined the Bitcoin space way back in the day,

1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:13.600
 it was, hey, we hate the dollar and, you know,

1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:14.880
 hey, we like gold a lot.

1:37:14.880 --> 1:37:15.920
 Let's create digital gold.

1:37:15.920 --> 1:37:17.760
 Let's build a payment system.

1:37:17.760 --> 1:37:20.020
 And then it just kind of went all these different directions

1:37:20.020 --> 1:37:22.660
 and nobody can actually tell you what Bitcoin is for.

1:37:22.660 --> 1:37:24.520
 It's a store of value, okay?

1:37:25.360 --> 1:37:27.200
 You know, if there's some proof of work thing

1:37:27.200 --> 1:37:29.200
 where maybe you're like incentivizing

1:37:29.200 --> 1:37:31.600
 that alternative energy to be pretty, I don't know.

1:37:31.600 --> 1:37:33.680
 It's like, nobody really knows the philosophy.

1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:35.080
 There's no direction.

1:37:35.080 --> 1:37:38.280
 And they say, but don't worry, just buy and hold

1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:40.280
 and everything will sort its way out.

1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:41.320
 I believe it's hoddle.

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:42.560
 Yeah, hoddle.

1:37:42.560 --> 1:37:44.400
 What about the idea of digital gold?

1:37:44.400 --> 1:37:46.880
 So trying to replace that particular physical material

1:37:46.880 --> 1:37:49.160
 that is gold, the transfer into the digital space.

1:37:49.160 --> 1:37:50.120
 That's something.

1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:51.680
 Okay, let's do that then.

1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:52.840
 And just say that's all it does.

1:37:52.840 --> 1:37:54.080
 Then why are we doing lightning?

1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:55.280
 Why are we doing any of these other things?

1:37:55.280 --> 1:37:57.720
 You don't really need with, you know, a commodity,

1:37:57.720 --> 1:38:00.080
 a digital commodity, high throughput.

1:38:00.080 --> 1:38:01.320
 You can have slow settlement.

1:38:01.320 --> 1:38:02.760
 You can have high transaction fees,

1:38:02.760 --> 1:38:03.600
 all these types of things.

1:38:03.600 --> 1:38:05.020
 And, you know, that's fine.

1:38:05.020 --> 1:38:06.600
 Okay, that's something.

1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:07.440
 Pick it.

1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:09.920
 Well, the idea is to try to come up with technology

1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:12.640
 like the Lightning Network that could have something

1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:16.040
 like gold, but then still build an economy around it.

1:38:16.040 --> 1:38:18.080
 Something with high throughput transactions.

1:38:18.080 --> 1:38:21.120
 And have we ever built a successful banking credit system

1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:22.400
 off of gold?

1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:23.240
 Never.

1:38:23.240 --> 1:38:25.560
 It never works because there's too much volatility

1:38:25.560 --> 1:38:26.760
 in the underlying asset.

1:38:26.760 --> 1:38:29.000
 Would you take a gold denominated loan for something?

1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:30.880
 And so he says, okay, I'll give you five bars of gold

1:38:30.880 --> 1:38:34.640
 to go buy this car and pay me back five and a half bars

1:38:34.640 --> 1:38:35.460
 of gold.

1:38:35.460 --> 1:38:36.600
 Nobody would know in five years

1:38:36.600 --> 1:38:38.240
 where they come out in that kind of a range.

1:38:38.240 --> 1:38:39.640
 The idea is that the gold is used

1:38:39.640 --> 1:38:41.280
 for the settlement of transactions.

1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:43.960
 And then you're operating, the actual economy

1:38:43.960 --> 1:38:46.000
 is operating outside of gold.

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.520
 And then you kind of connect back to gold for that.

1:38:48.520 --> 1:38:49.880
 So you have to go back to the gold reserve.

1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:51.960
 And we tried that for a long time.

1:38:51.960 --> 1:38:53.800
 It didn't really work in a modern global economy.

1:38:53.800 --> 1:38:55.040
 We had the Brent Woods Agreement,

1:38:55.040 --> 1:38:55.920
 all these other things.

1:38:55.920 --> 1:38:57.920
 And so I understand what you're saying.

1:38:57.920 --> 1:38:59.960
 And maybe there's some merit to that.

1:38:59.960 --> 1:39:02.200
 But if that was really in earnest where they want to go,

1:39:02.200 --> 1:39:03.960
 then the conversation should be about,

1:39:03.960 --> 1:39:06.440
 well, how do we make it easy for later two protocols

1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:08.160
 to interact with Bitcoin?

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:10.320
 So why is simplicity not built into it?

1:39:10.320 --> 1:39:12.240
 Why is it taking so long to do snorkegs?

1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:15.000
 Why is it taking so long to do all these obvious upgrades

1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:18.720
 which are cryptographically low danger, also NEPA POWs.

1:39:18.720 --> 1:39:20.320
 Not interactive proofs of proof of work.

1:39:20.320 --> 1:39:21.920
 There's no cost to doing that.

1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:23.720
 It's just a property of proof of work

1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:26.960
 where certain puzzles are more special than other puzzles.

1:39:26.960 --> 1:39:29.760
 And by noticing that, you can create these beautiful proofs

1:39:29.760 --> 1:39:32.040
 that allow you to have side chains and like clients.

1:39:32.040 --> 1:39:34.160
 It's not compromising security to system.

1:39:34.160 --> 1:39:36.560
 It's just something you get for free with proof of work.

1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:38.160
 Those came out in 2016.

1:39:38.160 --> 1:39:40.320
 There's derivative work, fly client floating around.

1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:41.800
 What the hell is it?

1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:43.840
 This is the frustration that I have is like,

1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:45.920
 if you really are serious about this whole lightning

1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:48.760
 and gold economy thing, I love choice.

1:39:48.760 --> 1:39:50.080
 I'm a libertarian by nature.

1:39:50.080 --> 1:39:51.600
 I love competition.

1:39:51.600 --> 1:39:53.080
 And I read all those books.

1:39:53.080 --> 1:39:56.000
 I read Louis von Mises's work and Murray Rothbard's works.

1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.680
 And I love what Hayek had to say about private currencies.

1:39:58.680 --> 1:39:59.760
 Let's go try it.

1:39:59.760 --> 1:40:00.520
 That's great.

1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:03.160
 But then you have to have some focus and commitment

1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:04.160
 as an ecosystem.

1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:07.080
 And the excuse they use is, well, no, we don't

1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:08.320
 because we're decentralized.

1:40:08.320 --> 1:40:11.400
 And because we're decentralized, we don't need that.

1:40:11.400 --> 1:40:14.040
 As if there's some sort of guiding swarm intelligence

1:40:14.040 --> 1:40:16.200
 that will naturally push the system

1:40:16.200 --> 1:40:17.920
 in that particular direction.

1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:19.760
 But then you ask, well, how do people

1:40:19.760 --> 1:40:21.640
 measure the success of Bitcoin?

1:40:21.640 --> 1:40:23.120
 Is it the fact that they've actually

1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:26.280
 achieved lots of transactions and lots

1:40:26.280 --> 1:40:28.680
 of actual economic activity and lots of businesses

1:40:28.680 --> 1:40:32.000
 accepting Bitcoin is the price?

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.120
 That's what they do.

1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:34.760
 And that's the only thing they pay attention.

1:40:34.760 --> 1:40:37.080
 That's why this is the most attended Bitcoin conference

1:40:37.080 --> 1:40:37.960
 in history.

1:40:37.960 --> 1:40:40.520
 Not because somehow Bitcoin got so much more adoption.

1:40:40.520 --> 1:40:42.840
 It's because this is the highest price point

1:40:42.840 --> 1:40:46.000
 Bitcoin has ever been this year, over 30,000.

1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:49.880
 So first of all, let me state that Charles, for the most part,

1:40:49.880 --> 1:40:51.400
 is purely objective.

1:40:51.400 --> 1:40:54.200
 The bias that comes in for the record,

1:40:54.200 --> 1:40:57.360
 I want to say, that I have heard because you mentioned

1:40:57.360 --> 1:41:00.840
 the mafia, that you prefer good fellows over the godfather.

1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:04.360
 So a man who prefers good fellows over godfather,

1:41:04.360 --> 1:41:09.560
 you take it for that opinion for what it is.

1:41:09.560 --> 1:41:11.880
 I actually have to think about that one for quite a bit.

1:41:11.880 --> 1:41:12.760
 Oh, come on.

1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:14.080
 Joe Pesci was so good at that.

1:41:14.080 --> 1:41:15.320
 He's incredible.

1:41:15.320 --> 1:41:18.280
 I also love casino and those big glasses on the denier.

1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:19.440
 I love it.

1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:20.440
 We'll share on stone.

1:41:20.440 --> 1:41:21.960
 But we could talk about that for hours.

1:41:21.960 --> 1:41:23.960
 But let me ask you about the Bitcoin conference

1:41:23.960 --> 1:41:28.440
 because it is kind of, I would say, an important moment

1:41:28.440 --> 1:41:29.360
 in human history.

1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:33.200
 It was quite exciting in terms of size and kind

1:41:33.200 --> 1:41:35.160
 of turmoil and all those kinds of things.

1:41:35.160 --> 1:41:36.240
 And you were there.

1:41:36.240 --> 1:41:37.320
 And what is it?

1:41:37.320 --> 1:41:39.160
 Hot and humaned Miami?

1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:41.400
 I believe it's the way you introduced it.

1:41:41.400 --> 1:41:46.160
 So what do you make of the community of Bitcoin

1:41:46.160 --> 1:41:49.080
 or that particular event in human history?

1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:51.640
 What makes me sad is I remember the old Bitcoin community.

1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:53.120
 And I've seen what it's become.

1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:54.880
 And the old community was really fun,

1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:57.080
 like the San Jose conference in 2013

1:41:57.080 --> 1:41:59.400
 or subsequent conferences.

1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:00.920
 There was just a lot of people.

1:42:00.920 --> 1:42:02.120
 They had no money.

1:42:02.120 --> 1:42:05.920
 And they just really love this idea of decentralized money.

1:42:05.920 --> 1:42:09.120
 They love this idea of decentralization in particular.

1:42:09.120 --> 1:42:11.720
 And you could strike up a conversation with everyone.

1:42:11.720 --> 1:42:13.400
 There was no ego at all.

1:42:13.400 --> 1:42:16.240
 But what was really fun is you could really

1:42:16.240 --> 1:42:18.800
 get intimate friendships and relationships

1:42:18.800 --> 1:42:21.760
 and great conversations with people there.

1:42:21.760 --> 1:42:23.240
 It's kind of like the early days of AI.

1:42:23.240 --> 1:42:25.080
 They all met in Dartmouth and all these other places.

1:42:25.080 --> 1:42:25.760
 Very intimate.

1:42:25.760 --> 1:42:26.440
 There was no egos.

1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:28.640
 Everybody was just trying to do some really cool stuff.

1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:30.920
 Now, just like those early days, there

1:42:30.920 --> 1:42:34.440
 was an overestimate of how robust the solutions would be.

1:42:34.440 --> 1:42:36.680
 So we believed, oh, yeah, 10 years.

1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:38.600
 We're going to rule the whole world.

1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:39.640
 Didn't exactly happen.

1:42:39.640 --> 1:42:44.080
 On the other hand, Bitcoin grew from nothing in just 11 years

1:42:44.080 --> 1:42:46.560
 to, I'm in Mongolia riding camels.

1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:50.080
 And the camel herder has Bitcoin in the desert.

1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:52.560
 So that's telling you that's a pretty pervasive technology

1:42:52.560 --> 1:42:54.720
 if you have that level of adoption that quickly.

1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:57.680
 When I went to Miami, it was unrecognizable.

1:42:57.680 --> 1:42:59.000
 Everything was so commercial.

1:42:59.000 --> 1:43:02.240
 Half of the vendors at the conference

1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:06.240
 were like watches that cost half a million dollars

1:43:06.240 --> 1:43:07.840
 and they were covered in diamonds.

1:43:07.840 --> 1:43:09.520
 So when you see that kind of materialism

1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:12.000
 leak its way in, it's first is repulsive.

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.280
 The other thing was there was no,

1:43:14.280 --> 1:43:16.160
 like I remember one of the first conferences,

1:43:16.160 --> 1:43:19.000
 Mo Levin's conference in January of 2014,

1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:20.320
 the North American Bitcoin Conference,

1:43:20.320 --> 1:43:22.120
 ironically in Miami.

1:43:22.120 --> 1:43:24.880
 There was a Bitcoin Help Center at Booth.

1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:27.640
 Dima ran it and a few of the other Bitcoin OGs ran it.

1:43:27.640 --> 1:43:29.240
 The core developers actually came over,

1:43:29.240 --> 1:43:31.920
 like Jeff and others, who were there and sat at the booth.

1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:33.920
 And anybody come up, ask a question.

1:43:33.920 --> 1:43:35.520
 Anything you want to ask about Bitcoin.

1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:36.840
 It was like, that was the culture.

1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:38.640
 Just help people welcome it.

1:43:38.640 --> 1:43:40.800
 There was no help booth there.

1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:42.000
 There was no notion of that.

1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:45.480
 There were six hour lines and superstars and things like that.

1:43:45.480 --> 1:43:47.520
 And again, again, it was always the same thing.

1:43:47.520 --> 1:43:50.720
 Look how much money all these people have made.

1:43:50.720 --> 1:43:52.800
 And the whole point of Bitcoin was to redefine

1:43:52.800 --> 1:43:55.800
 the notion of money, redefine the notion of value.

1:43:55.800 --> 1:43:57.200
 You know, these types of things.

1:43:57.200 --> 1:43:59.640
 So it just, I'm no longer part of that.

1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:02.800
 And it made me sad because I really enjoyed being part of it.

1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:04.840
 How I got started was a Bitcoin education project.

1:44:04.840 --> 1:44:05.960
 I did a class on Udemy.

1:44:05.960 --> 1:44:07.040
 I gave it away for free.

1:44:07.040 --> 1:44:09.880
 I had 80,000 students and they would email me.

1:44:09.880 --> 1:44:12.920
 I got 5,000 emails before I stopped answering them.

1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:16.400
 And everyone come in and ask me some question about something,

1:44:16.400 --> 1:44:18.720
 sometimes arcane, sometimes trivial.

1:44:18.720 --> 1:44:21.200
 And I take the time to sit down and answer the question

1:44:21.200 --> 1:44:22.800
 or forward the email to somebody I knew

1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:25.160
 who could answer that particular type of question.

1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:27.080
 And there were some amazing people in the early days,

1:44:27.080 --> 1:44:29.080
 like Mike Hearn and Gavin and others.

1:44:29.080 --> 1:44:31.480
 And they were just super committed.

1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:33.560
 And they, Mike's case, he knew Satoshi.

1:44:33.560 --> 1:44:35.240
 He actually emailed them back and forth.

1:44:35.240 --> 1:44:37.600
 Because he was around 2009, 2010.

1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:39.720
 He did the Bitcoin Jaffa client.

1:44:39.720 --> 1:44:40.760
 And Satoshi was all excited.

1:44:40.760 --> 1:44:43.160
 He said, oh, wow, Bitcoin can come to a cell phone.

1:44:43.160 --> 1:44:45.520
 This is really cool and exciting.

1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:46.360
 And then what happened?

1:44:46.360 --> 1:44:50.240
 Mike left Bitcoin in 2013 over the whole big block debate

1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:51.360
 that happened.

1:44:51.360 --> 1:44:53.080
 They just treated him like dirt.

1:44:53.080 --> 1:44:54.920
 Like he was subhuman or something.

1:44:54.920 --> 1:44:55.760
 So I don't know.

1:44:55.760 --> 1:44:57.440
 The culture has changed a lot.

1:44:57.440 --> 1:44:59.880
 And if they like it, it's good for them.

1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:02.840
 They can enjoy their religion, but it's not for me.

1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:06.240
 And where I like being is, like I had a guy who used to work

1:45:06.240 --> 1:45:08.240
 for me, Alex Cherpanoi.

1:45:08.240 --> 1:45:10.320
 And he created this beautiful project called Ergo.

1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:13.480
 To me, that is the spiritual successor to Bitcoin.

1:45:13.480 --> 1:45:15.920
 Ergo is really special because it has the same culture.

1:45:15.920 --> 1:45:17.360
 It has the same mentality.

1:45:17.360 --> 1:45:20.360
 And the technology is kind of like a natural evolution

1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:22.760
 of what you would do if you knew about Bitcoin

1:45:22.760 --> 1:45:24.760
 and you wanted to build the next big thing.

1:45:24.760 --> 1:45:26.360
 So it's still a proof of work system.

1:45:26.360 --> 1:45:28.040
 It's still a UTXO system.

1:45:28.040 --> 1:45:30.440
 But he added UTXO with some smart contracts.

1:45:30.440 --> 1:45:32.520
 It's this Sigma protocol idea.

1:45:32.520 --> 1:45:35.240
 On the proof of work side, Satoshi had this one CPU,

1:45:35.240 --> 1:45:36.280
 one vote idea.

1:45:36.280 --> 1:45:38.560
 So Alex tried to create non outsourcible puzzles

1:45:38.560 --> 1:45:40.520
 to make it impossible to have mining pools.

1:45:40.520 --> 1:45:42.360
 And there's all these other beautiful little things.

1:45:42.360 --> 1:45:45.000
 And he's this brilliant Russian programmer.

1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:47.040
 And he's surrounded himself with all these other brilliant

1:45:47.040 --> 1:45:47.680
 people.

1:45:47.680 --> 1:45:48.840
 He has zero ego.

1:45:48.840 --> 1:45:50.320
 He's like, he has negative ego.

1:45:50.320 --> 1:45:51.840
 When you put him with a person with ego,

1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:53.880
 your ego goes down.

1:45:53.880 --> 1:45:57.080
 And everything about Alex is always like, how do I solve this?

1:45:57.080 --> 1:45:57.960
 How do I do that?

1:45:57.960 --> 1:45:59.880
 And he gets legitimately excited when

1:45:59.880 --> 1:46:04.080
 he meets somebody that he can collaborate with or learn from.

1:46:04.080 --> 1:46:06.640
 That's where Bitcoin was in the beginning.

1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:08.760
 Everybody set their egos aside, whether it

1:46:08.760 --> 1:46:10.280
 was Hal Finney or whatever.

1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:11.880
 And they would just say, how can I help?

1:46:11.880 --> 1:46:12.600
 What can I do?

1:46:12.600 --> 1:46:14.960
 And it was all about coming up with some cool new thing

1:46:14.960 --> 1:46:17.320
 or solving some cool new problem.

1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:19.160
 I don't see any of that in Bitcoin today.

1:46:19.160 --> 1:46:21.360
 So quite a few people are excited about Ergo and excited

1:46:21.360 --> 1:46:25.120
 about the fact that you kind of appreciate Alex and Ergo.

1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:28.920
 Do you see Cardano potentially utilizing the proof of work

1:46:28.920 --> 1:46:33.560
 mechanism from Ergo as part of this pool

1:46:33.560 --> 1:46:35.280
 for the consensus mechanism?

1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:36.440
 I mean, anything's possible.

1:46:36.440 --> 1:46:39.400
 And there's a lot of evolution Ergo has to go through.

1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:43.640
 And Ergo was kind of like, when the Xbox 360 first came out,

1:46:43.640 --> 1:46:45.600
 while they were prototyping it, Microsoft

1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:46.920
 needed a development environment.

1:46:46.920 --> 1:46:49.800
 They ironically purchased a lot of Apple computers

1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:51.880
 to do that, because Apple was moving away from the Power

1:46:51.880 --> 1:46:52.720
 PC to Intel.

1:46:52.720 --> 1:46:54.880
 And Microsoft was moving towards the Power PC,

1:46:54.880 --> 1:46:56.640
 just this weird intersection of history.

1:46:56.640 --> 1:46:59.040
 So at that time, the largest order of Mac computers

1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:01.120
 made was done by Microsoft.

1:47:01.120 --> 1:47:02.680
 And they were using it for Xbox stuff.

1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:04.280
 So Ergo, we viewed the same way.

1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:06.800
 So we said, well, we have this extended UTXO model.

1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:09.480
 The only thing that's as sufficiently close to it

1:47:09.480 --> 1:47:12.960
 where we can beta test contracts is actually with Ergo.

1:47:12.960 --> 1:47:16.120
 And Alex just was a little faster in getting certain things

1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:18.120
 out, because we were doing things in a slightly more

1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:20.560
 rigorous way and slightly more expressive way.

1:47:20.560 --> 1:47:23.320
 So we actually tested a stablecoin and Oracle and other things

1:47:23.320 --> 1:47:24.080
 on Ergo.

1:47:24.080 --> 1:47:26.520
 And it has just incredible community.

1:47:26.520 --> 1:47:28.960
 And when we said, hey, we're coming here to work and build

1:47:28.960 --> 1:47:30.760
 that, oh, yeah, we love work with you guys.

1:47:30.760 --> 1:47:32.240
 This is so cool.

1:47:32.240 --> 1:47:33.960
 The other thing is Alex used to work for us.

1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:36.280
 And he had this lovely project called ScoreX.

1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:39.080
 And it was all about a pedagogical framework

1:47:39.080 --> 1:47:40.520
 for building blockchains.

1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:42.720
 And if you want to do prototyping or academic research,

1:47:42.720 --> 1:47:43.440
 it was great.

1:47:43.440 --> 1:47:44.520
 It was super modular.

1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:47.680
 And it separated the consensus network and transaction layer

1:47:47.680 --> 1:47:49.680
 from each other in just the right way

1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:52.120
 so that you can make it modular and mix and mix things.

1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:54.480
 So you can put secure academia in or maybe a different network

1:47:54.480 --> 1:47:57.400
 layer and a different consensus protocol like proof of work

1:47:57.400 --> 1:47:59.400
 to another proof of work and so forth.

1:47:59.400 --> 1:48:02.400
 So we loved having that kind of IP sitting around,

1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:04.720
 because it gave us the ability to kind of play around

1:48:04.720 --> 1:48:07.640
 with ideas in a matter of weeks instead of months or years.

1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:10.480
 And then he just took that concept and he gave it away.

1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:12.640
 The Wave protocol was built on it.

1:48:12.640 --> 1:48:14.480
 That was Sasha Ivanov.

1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:15.000
 He did that.

1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:17.400
 And I think there's two or three other cryptocurrencies that

1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:18.400
 were launched from ScoreX.

1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:22.000
 And then Alex took that and built Ergo from it.

1:48:22.000 --> 1:48:23.680
 So there was a nice intersection where

1:48:23.680 --> 1:48:27.560
 there was overlapping technology with Ergo with our technology.

1:48:27.560 --> 1:48:30.360
 And the other thing was that the community was so open and friendly.

1:48:30.360 --> 1:48:31.360
 It was just a no brainer.

1:48:31.360 --> 1:48:33.840
 Just go in and start building some things there.

1:48:33.840 --> 1:48:37.040
 Now, in terms of evolving ideas, the whole Sigma protocol idea

1:48:37.040 --> 1:48:39.080
 is very different and it's very interesting.

1:48:39.080 --> 1:48:42.080
 And there's a guy at a Boston University.

1:48:42.080 --> 1:48:46.120
 His name will come to me in a segment who came up with this stuff.

1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:48.080
 And I think there's some merit there,

1:48:48.080 --> 1:48:50.400
 especially as we start moving closer

1:48:50.400 --> 1:48:53.040
 to this idea of blockchains being used to validate

1:48:53.040 --> 1:48:54.600
 proofs instead of running computations.

1:48:54.600 --> 1:48:56.200
 What's the Sigma protocol, brother?

1:48:56.200 --> 1:48:58.840
 So it's just a way of expressing scripts.

1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:03.880
 And basically, you get these concise representations of proofs.

1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:06.080
 And then you can say, OK, the script is correct,

1:49:06.080 --> 1:49:07.800
 but you don't have to run the whole program.

1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:10.160
 So I'm not doing the topic justice.

1:49:10.160 --> 1:49:11.240
 There's a lot more to it.

1:49:11.240 --> 1:49:12.880
 But that's the basic concept.

1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:14.920
 And in a Redeemer Validator model,

1:49:14.920 --> 1:49:18.960
 you need stuff like that because as your model gets more complex

1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:21.240
 and a lot more things happen, you

1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:25.000
 don't want to have a situation where I have to run, replay

1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:28.640
 a huge amount of the UTXO graph to be able to get to a point where

1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:30.000
 I have the state of the system.

1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.200
 You need some mathematical artifact that

1:49:32.200 --> 1:49:34.200
 gives you the state of the system quickly.

1:49:34.200 --> 1:49:37.360
 And then you say, OK, I now know what computation thread I

1:49:37.360 --> 1:49:41.360
 need to run to get enough to be able to redeem this transaction.

1:49:41.360 --> 1:49:43.600
 So he just found a more compressed representation of it.

1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:45.480
 And the math doesn't matter.

1:49:45.480 --> 1:49:49.280
 What matters is there's a whole beautiful field that

1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:51.240
 thinks about this type of stuff.

1:49:51.240 --> 1:49:55.160
 And it was never once linked before into our industry.

1:49:55.160 --> 1:49:57.160
 The brilliance of Alex was to actually realize

1:49:57.160 --> 1:49:59.680
 you could do that and pull those things together.

1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:01.360
 And it may actually have some merit.

1:50:01.360 --> 1:50:03.840
 But by no means is the only guy that does this stuff.

1:50:03.840 --> 1:50:07.760
 There's actually other approaches in verified computing

1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:08.960
 that have explored that.

1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:10.880
 Like my favorite came out of Microsoft Research

1:50:10.880 --> 1:50:12.280
 is a project called Pinocchio.

1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:14.040
 And there was a follow up called Gepetto.

1:50:14.040 --> 1:50:17.480
 And the basic idea was that it's fortuitous

1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:21.680
 that you have these computer science problems like hashing

1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.040
 where you can do all this computation.

1:50:26.040 --> 1:50:27.480
 And once you've done all of it, you

1:50:27.480 --> 1:50:29.600
 found this magic number that you can verify

1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:31.680
 that the computation was done correctly.

1:50:31.680 --> 1:50:33.280
 So proof of work works this way.

1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:34.560
 Hard to do the proof of work.

1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:37.120
 Easy to check the proof of work.

1:50:37.120 --> 1:50:38.640
 Cryptography also works this way.

1:50:38.640 --> 1:50:40.800
 You have some trap door where you can verify something's

1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:41.300
 correct.

1:50:41.300 --> 1:50:44.800
 But to get that thing done, if you're doing it brute force,

1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:46.720
 it takes an enormous amount of computation.

1:50:46.720 --> 1:50:48.320
 Well, not all problems are like this.

1:50:48.320 --> 1:50:49.520
 Like protein folding.

1:50:49.520 --> 1:50:51.400
 To verify the protein is folded correctly,

1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:52.480
 you have to fold the protein.

1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:53.840
 You have to redo the work.

1:50:53.840 --> 1:50:56.640
 But what if, for arbitrary computation,

1:50:56.640 --> 1:50:58.680
 you could take a problem and then you

1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:01.320
 could generate a proof that you've done that computation

1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:04.160
 correctly and the proof validates in logarithmic time

1:51:04.160 --> 1:51:05.160
 or constant time.

1:51:05.160 --> 1:51:06.960
 Wow, that's incredible, right?

1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:09.240
 Well, Microsoft actually wrote a paper on how to do that.

1:51:09.240 --> 1:51:10.320
 It's called Pinocchio.

1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:12.240
 So that's another example of these types of things,

1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:14.720
 these rollups of things where instead of doing

1:51:14.720 --> 1:51:16.280
 the computation on chain or trying

1:51:16.280 --> 1:51:18.080
 to create some sort of replicated machine that

1:51:18.080 --> 1:51:20.720
 does all this stuff, you instead just say, OK,

1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:22.440
 only thing I'm going to use the blockchain for

1:51:22.440 --> 1:51:23.840
 is to check your proof.

1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:25.760
 But I'm going to turn it into a distributed computing

1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:27.680
 problem and any person in the world

1:51:27.680 --> 1:51:31.360
 can do the problem on any server, untrusted server even.

1:51:31.360 --> 1:51:33.400
 Because you don't have to trust the output.

1:51:33.400 --> 1:51:34.480
 You trust the proof.

1:51:34.480 --> 1:51:36.360
 And the proof is deterministic.

1:51:36.360 --> 1:51:37.640
 It tells you these things.

1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:40.680
 So whether you're using zero knowledge or sigma protocols

1:51:40.680 --> 1:51:42.640
 or some other mechanism, it's moving you

1:51:42.640 --> 1:51:45.880
 in that particular direction to turn it from a replicated

1:51:45.880 --> 1:51:48.480
 to a distributed problem and go from I'm doing the work

1:51:48.480 --> 1:51:50.120
 to I'm checking that the work was done correctly.

1:51:50.120 --> 1:51:50.920
 That's fascinating.

1:51:50.920 --> 1:51:54.760
 And all of a sudden, we're back to the P equals NP thing

1:51:54.760 --> 1:51:57.240
 where for many very interesting problems,

1:51:57.240 --> 1:52:00.680
 the checking is efficient, is much more efficient

1:52:00.680 --> 1:52:01.640
 than the solving.

1:52:01.640 --> 1:52:02.040
 Right.

1:52:02.040 --> 1:52:04.000
 And also, do you want complete determinism

1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:05.560
 or is it probabilistic?

1:52:05.560 --> 1:52:07.680
 Because if you relax that requirement a little bit,

1:52:07.680 --> 1:52:10.440
 then suddenly, actually, you have a broader class of things

1:52:10.440 --> 1:52:12.320
 you can construct this stuff for.

1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:14.160
 You mentioned UTXO.

1:52:14.160 --> 1:52:18.120
 There's a paper titled The Extended UTXO Model.

1:52:18.120 --> 1:52:21.920
 It writes in the introduction, Bitcoin and Ethereum,

1:52:21.920 --> 1:52:23.640
 hosting the two currently most valuable

1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:25.280
 and popular cryptocurrencies,

1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:28.360
 used two rather different ledger models known

1:52:28.360 --> 1:52:33.160
 as the UTXO model and the account model respectively.

1:52:33.160 --> 1:52:35.720
 At the same time, these two public blockchains

1:52:35.720 --> 1:52:37.600
 differ strongly in the expressiveness

1:52:37.600 --> 1:52:41.120
 of the smart contracts that they support.

1:52:41.120 --> 1:52:42.320
 This is no coincidence.

1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:45.080
 Ethereum chose the account model explicitly

1:52:45.080 --> 1:52:47.640
 to facilitate more expressive smart contracts.

1:52:47.640 --> 1:52:49.920
 On the other hand, Bitcoin chose UTXO

1:52:49.920 --> 1:52:53.560
 also for good reasons, including that its semantic model

1:52:53.560 --> 1:52:55.440
 stays simple in a complex, concurrent,

1:52:55.440 --> 1:52:57.240
 and distributed computing environment.

1:52:57.240 --> 1:52:59.800
 This raises the question of whether it is possible

1:52:59.800 --> 1:53:01.480
 to have expressive smart contracts

1:53:01.480 --> 1:53:06.240
 while keeping the semantic simplicity of the UTXO model.

1:53:06.240 --> 1:53:07.000
 OK.

1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.560
 So what's the fuck that means?

1:53:08.560 --> 1:53:09.840
 Exactly.

1:53:09.840 --> 1:53:11.560
 What is UTXO?

1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:13.160
 What is the account model?

1:53:13.160 --> 1:53:17.680
 And what is the idea of the extended UTXO model?

1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:19.520
 So I guess the easiest way of visualizing it

1:53:19.520 --> 1:53:22.760
 is that UTXO is kind of like cash register accounting.

1:53:22.760 --> 1:53:25.000
 So let's assume you don't have credit cards,

1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.000
 you just have cash.

1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.560
 And so when you go and buy some milk and potatoes

1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:30.360
 or whatever and you go to the cashier,

1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:33.240
 you pull out your $20 bill, you give it to them,

1:53:33.240 --> 1:53:35.200
 and let's say that comes up to $17.50,

1:53:35.200 --> 1:53:36.520
 they have to make change.

1:53:36.520 --> 1:53:40.720
 So you don't tear your $20 bill and cut a piece of it off

1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:42.280
 and say, here's part of my $20.

1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:44.800
 You give them the entire $20 bill,

1:53:44.800 --> 1:53:46.680
 and then they give you something back.

1:53:46.680 --> 1:53:48.040
 And the things that they give you back

1:53:48.040 --> 1:53:49.320
 are also atomic units.

1:53:49.320 --> 1:53:51.000
 They don't cut those things up.

1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:53.920
 So that's kind of what UTXO is all about in a nutshell,

1:53:53.920 --> 1:53:55.400
 is that there's inputs and outputs.

1:53:55.400 --> 1:53:57.120
 Your inputs to that $20, and your outputs

1:53:57.120 --> 1:53:59.960
 will be the $17.50 that goes to them,

1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:02.680
 and then the remaining change that goes back to you.

1:54:02.680 --> 1:54:03.760
 OK.

1:54:03.760 --> 1:54:05.520
 The problem with this particular model

1:54:05.520 --> 1:54:08.160
 is that the way it was implemented with Bitcoin,

1:54:08.160 --> 1:54:12.840
 there was no notion of how do we run complex predicates,

1:54:12.840 --> 1:54:16.720
 complex contracts on this thing, where instead of just saying,

1:54:16.720 --> 1:54:19.160
 OK, I'm just going to push value to you,

1:54:19.160 --> 1:54:21.200
 I want to put lots of terms and conditions

1:54:21.200 --> 1:54:22.840
 into the movement of that value.

1:54:22.840 --> 1:54:25.960
 Like, you only get this if I mow your lawn on Tuesday,

1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:29.560
 or you only get this if some event happens,

1:54:29.560 --> 1:54:32.480
 like the Broncos win the Super Bowl or something like that.

1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:33.080
 OK.

1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:35.400
 So you need some notion of programmability with it.

1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:37.960
 So a lot of people are trying to figure out in the early days

1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:40.040
 of Bitcoin, how could we improve

1:54:40.040 --> 1:54:41.800
 the expressiveness of the system?

1:54:41.800 --> 1:54:43.720
 And one of the ways of doing it is you

1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:48.240
 can go to a different accounting model, bank style accounting.

1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:52.280
 So in a bank ledger, every time you do a withdrawal or deposit,

1:54:52.280 --> 1:54:54.240
 it's a mutable system.

1:54:54.240 --> 1:54:55.840
 With the cash register accounting,

1:54:55.840 --> 1:54:57.560
 you don't tear up the bills, but the bank.

1:54:57.560 --> 1:55:00.200
 You can deduct or add a ledger all the time.

1:55:00.200 --> 1:55:02.680
 So Ethereum kind of works in that bank accounting system,

1:55:02.680 --> 1:55:05.720
 where you just send messages, you send transactions,

1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:07.160
 and you're going up or down.

1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:10.240
 And so you can trigger programs the same way.

1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:14.040
 So what we did is we said, OK, if you take the UTXO model,

1:55:14.040 --> 1:55:16.400
 and you have some data to it, and instead of saying

1:55:16.400 --> 1:55:20.120
 it's just a digital signature, but it's in a script,

1:55:20.120 --> 1:55:22.960
 you can basically create something that's still

1:55:22.960 --> 1:55:24.520
 the same as cash register.

1:55:24.520 --> 1:55:25.960
 But now you have programmability,

1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:28.880
 and the big difference is local versus global.

1:55:28.880 --> 1:55:32.600
 So in the case of UTXO, your scripts are your concerns.

1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:34.760
 So whatever is going on in that cash register

1:55:34.760 --> 1:55:37.840
 has no bearing or impact on the other cash registers.

1:55:37.840 --> 1:55:39.520
 But when you look at bank accounting,

1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:42.000
 you have to know the state of the entire banking world

1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:43.120
 to be able to make that work.

1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:43.360
 Why?

1:55:43.360 --> 1:55:45.400
 Because if that transaction is inbound,

1:55:45.400 --> 1:55:46.720
 that wire transfer is inbound, you

1:55:46.720 --> 1:55:48.400
 have to know those funds are actually there.

1:55:48.400 --> 1:55:50.080
 That thing is actually happening.

1:55:50.080 --> 1:55:52.320
 So when you have a global state for a program,

1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:54.160
 it's like you can do a lot more with it,

1:55:54.160 --> 1:55:55.320
 but it's a lot more dangerous.

1:55:55.320 --> 1:55:57.040
 And so you have to build all these mechanisms

1:55:57.040 --> 1:55:58.760
 to try to protect yourself from it.

1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:02.040
 So what we did is we said, OK, add data, add a programmability,

1:56:02.040 --> 1:56:03.840
 and you're kind of in this nice Goldilocks zone

1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:06.480
 between what Ethereum did with an account style model

1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:09.600
 and a global state system, and you're not as restrictive

1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:12.120
 as Bitcoin, but you're still an attorney in complete world.

1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:14.080
 You can still run all kinds of things.

1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:17.120
 And then any standard mathematician, they'll say, OK,

1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:19.920
 well, is it isomorphic?

1:56:19.920 --> 1:56:21.080
 Is there a mapping between this?

1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:23.120
 What type of function can I actually

1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:25.640
 take something expressed in one structure

1:56:25.640 --> 1:56:27.480
 and transmit it to the other structure

1:56:27.480 --> 1:56:28.840
 and properties are preserved?

1:56:28.840 --> 1:56:29.640
 So we wrote a paper.

1:56:29.640 --> 1:56:30.880
 It's called Clymeric Ledgers, where

1:56:30.880 --> 1:56:34.840
 we actually show that UTXO, extended UTXO, and accounts

1:56:34.840 --> 1:56:38.440
 are somewhat similar in that you could map things that happen

1:56:38.440 --> 1:56:40.360
 in one system to the other system.

1:56:40.360 --> 1:56:42.480
 The properties are preserved between the two.

1:56:42.480 --> 1:56:45.720
 So in practice, what's nice about extended UTXO

1:56:45.720 --> 1:56:48.680
 is that you can put infrastructure on top of it

1:56:48.680 --> 1:56:51.360
 to make the development experience relatively similar

1:56:51.360 --> 1:56:54.960
 to the development experience of what you would do with Ethereum,

1:56:54.960 --> 1:56:58.240
 but you don't have to worry about this global state.

1:56:58.240 --> 1:56:59.960
 So when you talk about sharding, it's

1:56:59.960 --> 1:57:01.320
 a lot easier to do that.

1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:02.720
 It's a lot more conceivable to that.

1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:05.280
 And also, you get determinism in the system.

1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:07.000
 So when I have a Plutus smart contract,

1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:09.120
 whatever I run locally is exactly what

1:57:09.120 --> 1:57:11.280
 I expect to run in the system.

1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:13.640
 When you have a concept of this mutable global state

1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:15.240
 in the system, whatever you run locally

1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:17.600
 is not necessarily what you're going to get when you actually

1:57:17.600 --> 1:57:18.880
 push it into the system.

1:57:18.880 --> 1:57:21.720
 So you may misprice things and the contract will fail.

1:57:21.720 --> 1:57:23.920
 It doesn't ever happen in the Plutus world.

1:57:23.920 --> 1:57:26.320
 So you get a lot of advantages with this particular model.

1:57:26.320 --> 1:57:29.000
 The downside is that it's a little bit less

1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.960
 expressive on the boundaries and a little bit harder

1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:34.880
 to write certain types of software with it.

1:57:34.880 --> 1:57:37.080
 But again, how you resolve that is

1:57:37.080 --> 1:57:40.680
 you kind of build higher level languages and other such things

1:57:40.680 --> 1:57:43.560
 that compensate for these types of things and design patterns

1:57:43.560 --> 1:57:45.360
 that compensate for these types of things.

1:57:45.360 --> 1:57:48.080
 The other advantage that we have that's really fun and exciting

1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:50.320
 is that Bitcoin lives in this model

1:57:50.320 --> 1:57:52.720
 and there are other UTXO based systems.

1:57:52.720 --> 1:57:55.360
 And so they're all talking about smart contracts as well.

1:57:55.360 --> 1:57:58.640
 And they would like to continue working in the UTXO model.

1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:01.360
 So if you're a Bitcoin contract developer or other things,

1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:02.840
 there's actually already a group of people

1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:04.160
 that understand this very well.

1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:07.040
 And that's still a fairly large part of the mindshare

1:58:07.040 --> 1:58:08.480
 of the entire space.

1:58:08.480 --> 1:58:09.800
 So there are no silver bullets.

1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:11.600
 And anytime you pick a particular model,

1:58:11.600 --> 1:58:13.080
 there's an upside and a downside.

1:58:13.080 --> 1:58:14.400
 And there's different ways of doing things

1:58:14.400 --> 1:58:16.320
 from cash register accounting or bank accounting.

1:58:16.320 --> 1:58:18.240
 You can even do different accounting models.

1:58:18.240 --> 1:58:21.640
 But we felt this was kind of the best first step

1:58:21.640 --> 1:58:24.720
 to go into because we started with something very familiar

1:58:24.720 --> 1:58:27.320
 that had a long history behind it.

1:58:27.320 --> 1:58:29.160
 And it maps very beautifully

1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:30.880
 to functional programming principles,

1:58:30.880 --> 1:58:33.120
 this concept of immutability and these things

1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:36.160
 and much more strict management of state

1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:39.560
 and no notion of having this global concept

1:58:39.560 --> 1:58:40.760
 that you have to kind of manage

1:58:40.760 --> 1:58:42.680
 as you break up the system.

1:58:43.880 --> 1:58:46.840
 Now in practice, what does this mean to the developer?

1:58:46.840 --> 1:58:50.320
 And when they actually start real writing an application,

1:58:50.320 --> 1:58:53.240
 not too much, there's gonna be a little bit of retooling

1:58:53.240 --> 1:58:54.720
 and some new patterns you have to learn.

1:58:54.720 --> 1:58:56.520
 But in practice, you can still do the same things.

1:58:56.520 --> 1:58:59.400
 You can implement a uniswaptile style thing.

1:58:59.400 --> 1:59:00.680
 In fact, we even wrote that code

1:59:00.680 --> 1:59:01.920
 with the Plutus Pioneers program.

1:59:01.920 --> 1:59:03.880
 So you can go to YouTube and watch a lecture

1:59:03.880 --> 1:59:05.320
 and see how that's done.

1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:07.960
 You can do a stable coin, you can do an Oracle,

1:59:07.960 --> 1:59:10.040
 you can do interactive contracts.

1:59:10.040 --> 1:59:12.160
 It's just, it has to be done a little differently

1:59:12.160 --> 1:59:14.320
 than the way that you would do it in an account style model.

1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:16.640
 Just like you could write an application Java,

1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:18.680
 you can write an application in Haskell,

1:59:18.680 --> 1:59:20.040
 they both can do the same thing,

1:59:20.040 --> 1:59:21.400
 but the code is gonna look different.

1:59:21.400 --> 1:59:24.360
 And the kind of the conical way of looking at things

1:59:24.360 --> 1:59:25.200
 is different.

1:59:25.200 --> 1:59:27.600
 So in terms of Oracle, Oracle networks,

1:59:27.600 --> 1:59:29.040
 what do you have thoughts about chain link

1:59:29.040 --> 1:59:32.240
 and external off chain data sources?

1:59:32.240 --> 1:59:34.600
 And everything we've been talking about now

1:59:34.600 --> 1:59:37.960
 with the external, with the extended UTXO model.

1:59:37.960 --> 1:59:41.840
 Yeah, I mean, trying to do smart contracts without oracles

1:59:41.840 --> 1:59:43.640
 like trying to have sex with your pants on.

1:59:43.640 --> 1:59:45.640
 I mean, it's not really fun.

1:59:45.640 --> 1:59:47.640
 It's not exactly the best of things.

1:59:47.640 --> 1:59:49.120
 That's the way I've been doing it all these years.

1:59:49.120 --> 1:59:49.960
 I didn't know.

1:59:49.960 --> 1:59:52.080
 For any other person Lex, I wouldn't believe you,

1:59:52.080 --> 1:59:52.920
 but for you.

1:59:52.920 --> 1:59:55.640
 That's why I'm single.

1:59:55.640 --> 1:59:57.120
 This makes so much sense though.

1:59:57.120 --> 2:00:01.440
 Okay, so anyway, you need the outside world

2:00:01.440 --> 2:00:03.640
 to be ejected into your system, right?

2:00:03.640 --> 2:00:06.320
 I'm trying to keep a straight face.

2:00:06.320 --> 2:00:07.160
 It's great.

2:00:07.160 --> 2:00:09.520
 You need the outside world to make your system useful.

2:00:09.520 --> 2:00:12.040
 It's like all the kinds of things that you care to do

2:00:12.040 --> 2:00:14.760
 with a smart contract usually involve human beings

2:00:14.760 --> 2:00:17.400
 and information streams aggregating and doing something.

2:00:17.400 --> 2:00:20.960
 So the Oracle is a super important component in practice

2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:24.120
 for any smart contract involving any notion of value.

2:00:24.120 --> 2:00:25.480
 You need to know when things have happened,

2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:28.920
 how they happen, who won, who lost, et cetera, et cetera.

2:00:28.920 --> 2:00:31.280
 So first, where do you get the data from?

2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:32.880
 So what's the aggregator?

2:00:32.880 --> 2:00:34.880
 This is why we love our relationship with Wolfram,

2:00:34.880 --> 2:00:36.920
 because if one of the things you'll know about Wolfram

2:00:36.920 --> 2:00:39.320
 as you get to know the guy is he's a data pack rat.

2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:40.960
 Every email, every communication,

2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:43.200
 every interaction he's archived somewhere.

2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:44.440
 Like last time I talked to him,

2:00:44.440 --> 2:00:46.440
 oh yeah, I have emails from you from 2012.

2:00:46.440 --> 2:00:48.080
 It's like, you still have those?

2:00:48.080 --> 2:00:50.240
 Yeah, every keystroke is written down

2:00:50.240 --> 2:00:51.320
 and stored somewhere.

2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:52.720
 So if you use Wolfram Alpha,

2:00:52.720 --> 2:00:55.120
 it's a simulacrum of the way his mind thinks.

2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:57.440
 And so you can query the system and be like,

2:00:57.440 --> 2:00:59.960
 oh, how many shipwrecks have happened in Florida

2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:02.560
 between 1950 and 2000 that have resulted

2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:04.680
 in more than a billion dollars of cargo loss

2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:06.600
 and at least one fatality?

2:01:06.600 --> 2:01:08.160
 And it'll return an answer.

2:01:08.160 --> 2:01:10.320
 I mean, it has this incredible source of data

2:01:10.320 --> 2:01:11.280
 that's computable.

2:01:11.280 --> 2:01:12.120
 For people who don't know,

2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:14.800
 Wolfram Alpha is more than just the thing

2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:18.160
 that assists you with your math homework in high school.

2:01:18.160 --> 2:01:20.360
 It's actually this giant network of data

2:01:20.360 --> 2:01:24.240
 of like weather data, of location data, just statistics,

2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:26.400
 all kinds of, it's doing the aggregation

2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:30.600
 in a way that you can query across data sets.

2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:33.280
 And it's exactly this kind of idea.

2:01:34.320 --> 2:01:36.680
 It basically represents the very kind of thing

2:01:36.680 --> 2:01:39.960
 you would hope to be able to query off chain

2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:41.520
 as part of the smart contracts.

2:01:41.520 --> 2:01:45.080
 Right, but the only downside is it's centralized.

2:01:45.080 --> 2:01:47.040
 And that's always the Achilles Heel of Wolfram

2:01:47.040 --> 2:01:49.120
 is he tends to like proprietary things

2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:50.600
 and he tends to like centralizing things

2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:53.080
 and mostly because he likes running the things.

2:01:53.080 --> 2:01:56.240
 And then everybody can have an opinion on that.

2:01:56.240 --> 2:01:59.640
 The thing though is that after you've done aggregation,

2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:00.920
 there's a question of injection.

2:02:00.920 --> 2:02:04.120
 How do you get that data into the system?

2:02:04.120 --> 2:02:05.960
 And you can do that in a very naive way

2:02:05.960 --> 2:02:07.680
 where you can say, oh, I'm just gonna attach a public key

2:02:07.680 --> 2:02:10.400
 to it and it'll sign for that data feed, that injection.

2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:13.320
 And then somehow I'll just trust it as it is.

2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:16.560
 Or you could try to make it more complicated.

2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:18.840
 You could weight data feeds from different sources

2:02:18.840 --> 2:02:20.680
 and have some notion of truthiness

2:02:20.680 --> 2:02:23.320
 or a veracity metric or something like that.

2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:27.200
 So chain link is just one of many different philosophies

2:02:27.200 --> 2:02:29.000
 that was born out of the academy.

2:02:29.000 --> 2:02:30.920
 I believe Ari Joule was connected to it

2:02:30.920 --> 2:02:33.000
 and there's some good people on that side.

2:02:33.000 --> 2:02:36.360
 And it has a philosophy about how do you aggregate

2:02:36.360 --> 2:02:38.520
 a philosophy about how do you inject

2:02:38.520 --> 2:02:39.920
 and how do you create incentives

2:02:39.920 --> 2:02:43.440
 so that that process over time gets more federated

2:02:43.440 --> 2:02:46.000
 or more decentralized instead of centralizing

2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:47.880
 around one particular setup.

2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:52.880
 Now closely related corollary to this is computation off chain.

2:02:52.880 --> 2:02:54.800
 So as I mentioned, smart contracts

2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:56.640
 are intimately connected to Oracle.

2:02:56.640 --> 2:02:58.320
 The question is how much pre processing

2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:01.400
 and state management are you gonna do outside of the system

2:03:01.400 --> 2:03:03.840
 versus what do you do inside of the system?

2:03:03.840 --> 2:03:07.440
 So it's a very interesting balance between these two.

2:03:07.440 --> 2:03:09.600
 And they were thinking about this stuff for a long time.

2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:11.960
 There's a great paper called Town Crier came out

2:03:11.960 --> 2:03:13.320
 way back in the day at Cornell

2:03:13.320 --> 2:03:16.640
 and that was all about using like SGX to scrape things

2:03:16.640 --> 2:03:20.600
 and you can rely on trusted hardware to give you good data.

2:03:20.600 --> 2:03:22.600
 And but you could also use those SGX cores

2:03:22.600 --> 2:03:24.120
 to do contract processing.

2:03:24.120 --> 2:03:25.720
 Because if it runs in trusted hardware

2:03:25.720 --> 2:03:28.960
 then it's very unlikely to be tampered with or manipulated.

2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:31.520
 And because of that you don't have to federate it

2:03:31.520 --> 2:03:33.880
 or decentralize it, you can run it on a single device

2:03:33.880 --> 2:03:35.960
 as if it was running on a cryptocurrency.

2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:38.680
 So there seems to be a desire in that community

2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:42.280
 to capture more and more of the smart contract stack

2:03:42.280 --> 2:03:43.800
 and pull more and more of that stack

2:03:43.800 --> 2:03:45.160
 into that layer two infrastructure

2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:47.120
 from running on layer one.

2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:49.120
 Why? Because you have cost reduction

2:03:49.120 --> 2:03:51.320
 and potentially because your trust model collapses

2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:54.000
 to whatever chain link is offering,

2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.760
 you're not gaining anything by doing the computation

2:03:56.760 --> 2:04:00.600
 on Ethereum or another platform.

2:04:00.600 --> 2:04:02.760
 Because you ever watch The Simpsons,

2:04:02.760 --> 2:04:04.120
 there was this beautiful episode

2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:06.920
 where Mr. Burns wants to turn the power off in Springfield

2:04:06.920 --> 2:04:09.960
 and it's the perfect analogy for information security.

2:04:09.960 --> 2:04:12.760
 So he and Smithers, they go through this elaborate series

2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:15.800
 of doors and secret passages and guard dogs

2:04:15.800 --> 2:04:18.640
 and robots and shit to get to the center of the power plant

2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:20.000
 to turn off the power.

2:04:20.000 --> 2:04:21.920
 And when they arrive at the center of the plant

2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:25.360
 there's like this stray dog that's inside the room.

2:04:25.360 --> 2:04:27.200
 And there's this wicker door that,

2:04:27.200 --> 2:04:29.160
 a screen door that leads to the outside.

2:04:29.160 --> 2:04:30.680
 And you're like, well, why the hell did you go through

2:04:30.680 --> 2:04:32.160
 this elaborate series of doors and things

2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:34.200
 if there's like a back door into your system?

2:04:34.200 --> 2:04:36.680
 Well, that's basically a real life analogy

2:04:36.680 --> 2:04:40.640
 of the relationship between the Oracle and the smart contract.

2:04:40.640 --> 2:04:42.440
 You're only as good in your infrasick model

2:04:42.440 --> 2:04:44.640
 as your weakest link and it doesn't matter

2:04:44.640 --> 2:04:46.560
 if all of your computation is decentralized

2:04:46.560 --> 2:04:48.920
 if you're at the mercy of your data feed.

2:04:48.920 --> 2:04:50.120
 Because I can just manipulate that

2:04:50.120 --> 2:04:52.720
 and break the entire security model of the system, okay?

2:04:52.720 --> 2:04:55.440
 You'll perfectly execute the wrong answer.

2:04:55.440 --> 2:04:57.280
 So they say, well, if you're trusting us anyway,

2:04:57.280 --> 2:04:59.920
 why don't you pull more of what you're doing on chain

2:04:59.920 --> 2:05:02.040
 into our stack, which creates more transaction fees

2:05:02.040 --> 2:05:04.120
 for them and more value for them.

2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:06.200
 But there are many different ways you can do oracles

2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:08.520
 and earlier I was talking about the biology

2:05:08.520 --> 2:05:10.920
 of these things, cell differentiation.

2:05:10.920 --> 2:05:14.480
 The minute that you admit heterogeneity in your system

2:05:14.480 --> 2:05:16.960
 and you start having cells like stake pools

2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:19.920
 or things that are on in 24 seven,

2:05:19.920 --> 2:05:22.520
 then you can start asking the what if question.

2:05:22.520 --> 2:05:26.000
 Why don't you guys just also provide data feeds?

2:05:26.000 --> 2:05:28.160
 Why don't you guys also provide state channels

2:05:28.160 --> 2:05:30.120
 or payment channels or generate random numbers for me

2:05:30.120 --> 2:05:32.280
 or whatever and you're now a service provider.

2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:34.000
 You're making the blockchain full time

2:05:34.000 --> 2:05:35.280
 but part time you're doing this.

2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:36.280
 And if you're making bagels,

2:05:36.280 --> 2:05:38.960
 you could probably make donuts, that type of a concept.

2:05:38.960 --> 2:05:42.000
 So I think that type of competition is going to be

2:05:42.000 --> 2:05:47.000
 very difficult for a lot of these layer two protocols

2:05:47.200 --> 2:05:49.600
 that aren't tightly coupled with the protocol

2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:52.320
 because the ones that are tightly coupled

2:05:52.320 --> 2:05:54.560
 with the protocol, they have a built in trust advantage.

2:05:54.560 --> 2:05:56.320
 They've already built a commercial reputation.

2:05:56.320 --> 2:05:58.920
 There's already an increasingly more decentralized set.

2:05:58.920 --> 2:06:00.960
 The other thing is you don't need a token.

2:06:00.960 --> 2:06:04.200
 You can just use ADA, you don't need an oracle coin

2:06:04.200 --> 2:06:05.480
 for these types of things to work.

2:06:05.480 --> 2:06:08.600
 And by the way, that's just for the injection component

2:06:08.600 --> 2:06:10.600
 and the veracity attestation.

2:06:10.600 --> 2:06:12.120
 So is it true or not?

2:06:12.120 --> 2:06:13.800
 That's not about the aggregation.

2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:15.960
 That's still a tremendously time intensive,

2:06:15.960 --> 2:06:17.140
 expensive proposition.

2:06:17.140 --> 2:06:18.760
 There's only a few people in the world

2:06:18.760 --> 2:06:21.520
 that have what Steve has with Wolfram.

2:06:21.520 --> 2:06:24.960
 And those guys by just cutting off those supply

2:06:24.960 --> 2:06:27.200
 to replicate what they have is something that would cost

2:06:27.200 --> 2:06:29.040
 hundreds of millions or billions of dollars.

2:06:29.040 --> 2:06:30.760
 And so it's an interesting question of,

2:06:30.760 --> 2:06:32.920
 how do you incentivize the centralized aggregation

2:06:32.920 --> 2:06:33.760
 of information?

2:06:33.760 --> 2:06:36.120
 That's kind of what Towncry or another protocols

2:06:36.120 --> 2:06:37.320
 we're trying to achieve.

2:06:37.320 --> 2:06:39.720
 So maybe you can say how Towncry works

2:06:39.720 --> 2:06:41.800
 because it's like, what's your vision?

2:06:41.800 --> 2:06:44.720
 You're not partnering with Wolfram, Wolfram Alpha

2:06:44.720 --> 2:06:49.520
 and sort of exploring this partnership of data

2:06:49.520 --> 2:06:51.800
 and the blockchain.

2:06:51.800 --> 2:06:54.080
 What's your vision for a possible distributed

2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:56.160
 version of Wolfram Alpha?

2:06:56.160 --> 2:06:59.880
 Well, the first step is just say, can we use this as a feed

2:06:59.880 --> 2:07:02.720
 and they can be what Bloomberg is to the financial markets.

2:07:02.720 --> 2:07:04.400
 So you have a terminal and you have something

2:07:04.400 --> 2:07:06.920
 and there's always a value of at least offering choice.

2:07:06.920 --> 2:07:08.640
 And so where it's not like we're anti chain link

2:07:08.640 --> 2:07:10.840
 or picking winners and losers, it's an open protocol.

2:07:10.840 --> 2:07:11.680
 It's an open system.

2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:14.320
 So if we're successful, chain link will migrate

2:07:14.320 --> 2:07:17.160
 or it will at least support us because they like money.

2:07:17.160 --> 2:07:19.040
 They like users, they like liquidity.

2:07:19.040 --> 2:07:20.520
 It's a disservice to their community

2:07:20.520 --> 2:07:23.080
 not to support a potential customer set.

2:07:23.080 --> 2:07:25.240
 But you're gonna have a spectrum from the desire

2:07:25.240 --> 2:07:29.680
 to do a completely decentralized aggregation,

2:07:29.680 --> 2:07:33.000
 curation, injection, and veracity attestation

2:07:33.000 --> 2:07:36.360
 to a completely centralized, vertically integrated set.

2:07:36.360 --> 2:07:38.200
 You need to be able to have that whole spectrum

2:07:38.200 --> 2:07:40.400
 and offer that to the smart contract developer

2:07:40.400 --> 2:07:42.920
 to decide what makes sense.

2:07:42.920 --> 2:07:44.400
 By the way, a lot of cases,

2:07:44.400 --> 2:07:45.840
 they're gonna be their own Oracle.

2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:48.160
 So for example, the World of Warcraft example

2:07:48.160 --> 2:07:51.240
 that I gave, it's a completely centralized thing.

2:07:51.240 --> 2:07:54.120
 It's a video game run by a single company.

2:07:54.120 --> 2:07:55.600
 There's no sense in saying that we're somehow

2:07:55.600 --> 2:07:56.960
 going to decentralize that.

2:07:56.960 --> 2:07:59.240
 What they're just trying to do is extend their currency

2:07:59.240 --> 2:08:02.720
 or NFTs or whatever into new marketplaces.

2:08:02.720 --> 2:08:07.360
 So the minting of that is controlled by a single entity

2:08:07.360 --> 2:08:08.840
 and the world state of that,

2:08:08.840 --> 2:08:10.280
 you just have to trust Blizzard

2:08:10.280 --> 2:08:12.040
 to inject that into the system.

2:08:12.040 --> 2:08:14.680
 You could try to imagine some sort of like,

2:08:14.680 --> 2:08:16.960
 sentinel group of people within the game

2:08:16.960 --> 2:08:19.840
 who keep Blizzard honest, but it's completely unnecessary

2:08:19.840 --> 2:08:22.400
 because they can change the rules of the system arbitrarily.

2:08:22.400 --> 2:08:26.400
 So in that case, you're optimizing around efficiency

2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:27.600
 and cost reduction.

2:08:27.600 --> 2:08:29.560
 So you'd want a single feed

2:08:29.560 --> 2:08:32.200
 that gets injected into the system from them.

2:08:32.200 --> 2:08:34.720
 If you look at a stable coin that's algorithmic

2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:37.200
 and it's basing its value on the aggregation

2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:38.920
 of many different exchanges,

2:08:38.920 --> 2:08:41.280
 that's the polar opposite example.

2:08:41.280 --> 2:08:42.400
 Because there you're saying, okay,

2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:45.480
 what's the price of my asset relative to some basket?

2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:47.920
 But how do I know that the price feeds

2:08:47.920 --> 2:08:49.400
 I'm looking at are accurate?

2:08:49.400 --> 2:08:51.200
 You'd have to look at Binance and Vitrix

2:08:51.200 --> 2:08:52.040
 and all these other things

2:08:52.040 --> 2:08:53.600
 or maybe there's conventional Forex exchanges

2:08:53.600 --> 2:08:54.680
 or something like that.

2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:57.200
 Okay, well, how do you weight that?

2:08:57.200 --> 2:08:58.640
 And how do you clip outliers?

2:08:58.640 --> 2:08:59.680
 And these types of things,

2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:01.360
 that's a completely different conversation.

2:09:01.360 --> 2:09:04.360
 And there's a lot more mechanics you have to put in

2:09:04.360 --> 2:09:06.560
 for that bundling and attestation

2:09:06.560 --> 2:09:08.200
 of the veracity of the data feed.

2:09:08.200 --> 2:09:09.840
 And what happens if you get it wrong?

2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:12.080
 Your stable coin gets mispriced

2:09:12.080 --> 2:09:13.800
 and everything goes to hell.

2:09:13.800 --> 2:09:15.880
 And the markets will eventually correct it

2:09:15.880 --> 2:09:17.600
 for arbitrage seeking behavior,

2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:19.640
 but anything that was built on that will fail

2:09:19.640 --> 2:09:21.280
 in the short term.

2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:23.440
 So Oracle's really just a game of,

2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:25.080
 you have to build a standardized interfaces

2:09:25.080 --> 2:09:27.720
 and make it as easy as possible for people to do that

2:09:27.720 --> 2:09:31.040
 and then let people choose how they want to inject data

2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:34.120
 and what level of assurance do they need behind that?

2:09:34.120 --> 2:09:36.280
 And the question is how much do you leave to the user

2:09:36.280 --> 2:09:38.720
 versus how much does the protocol take care of for you?

2:09:38.720 --> 2:09:40.920
 And it's a difficult design question.

2:09:40.920 --> 2:09:43.960
 For our part, we love working with Steve and Wolfram

2:09:43.960 --> 2:09:45.080
 and they're a great company

2:09:45.080 --> 2:09:47.120
 and they really have some bright people there.

2:09:47.120 --> 2:09:49.880
 And we know on the data set that they're second to none

2:09:49.880 --> 2:09:51.520
 because not only they have it, it's computable.

2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:53.320
 You can do all kinds of things and manipulate

2:09:53.320 --> 2:09:55.320
 with a very rich query language.

2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:56.520
 So that's a great thing.

2:09:56.520 --> 2:09:58.400
 And we want to make sure that that's accessible

2:09:58.400 --> 2:10:00.600
 to developers and Cardano.

2:10:00.600 --> 2:10:01.840
 But remember they're like Bloomberg,

2:10:01.840 --> 2:10:04.320
 it's a centralized speed in that respect.

2:10:04.320 --> 2:10:06.920
 So if you want to build a chain link as competitor,

2:10:06.920 --> 2:10:09.560
 there's other protocols you could do for that.

2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:10.720
 Now you asked about Tom Crier

2:10:10.720 --> 2:10:14.720
 and that was an attempt to kind of sweep the oceans

2:10:14.720 --> 2:10:19.720
 with the net, get the data through a decentralized way.

2:10:19.960 --> 2:10:20.880
 And that was just saying,

2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:23.120
 hey, let's use trusted hardware to go read law,

2:10:23.120 --> 2:10:24.520
 all kinds of websites and other things.

2:10:24.520 --> 2:10:26.080
 And because it's trusted hardware,

2:10:26.080 --> 2:10:28.680
 the scraping is nonbiased.

2:10:28.680 --> 2:10:30.080
 If you find something inconvenient

2:10:30.080 --> 2:10:32.520
 to whatever the person who's scraping is,

2:10:32.520 --> 2:10:34.200
 the trusted hardware will still do it

2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:35.280
 and it can't be changed.

2:10:35.280 --> 2:10:37.920
 You'd have to manipulate SGX to do that.

2:10:37.920 --> 2:10:40.360
 So that's great, but you still run into the problem

2:10:40.360 --> 2:10:42.080
 of how do you wire that together?

2:10:42.080 --> 2:10:44.960
 The underlying websites still don't have any notion

2:10:44.960 --> 2:10:47.360
 of veracity or reputation behind them.

2:10:47.360 --> 2:10:49.480
 And then you also have the issue of storage

2:10:49.480 --> 2:10:51.280
 or the hell do you put all of it?

2:10:51.280 --> 2:10:54.760
 If you have exabytes of data, what's the incentive for that?

2:10:54.760 --> 2:10:56.600
 That's the dream of the semantic web.

2:10:56.600 --> 2:10:58.840
 I still think it's a fascinating idea

2:10:58.840 --> 2:11:00.440
 ought to basically convert the internet

2:11:00.440 --> 2:11:04.560
 into a court, like a knowledge base

2:11:04.560 --> 2:11:07.400
 that you can query, you can integrate

2:11:07.400 --> 2:11:08.920
 in the same way you did with Wolfram Alpha,

2:11:08.920 --> 2:11:11.320
 but much bigger.

2:11:11.320 --> 2:11:15.280
 But that means basically revolutionizing the way

2:11:15.280 --> 2:11:17.440
 we put the internet together,

2:11:17.440 --> 2:11:22.440
 which I think these ideas of off chain data

2:11:22.440 --> 2:11:25.160
 will motivate people

2:11:25.160 --> 2:11:27.680
 because there's a lot of money to be made.

2:11:27.680 --> 2:11:30.920
 Finally, there's money to be made with a semantic web.

2:11:30.920 --> 2:11:32.840
 So that'll be an interesting kind of future.

2:11:32.840 --> 2:11:35.080
 I do wanna ask you about video games really quick

2:11:35.080 --> 2:11:36.000
 as a small tangent,

2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000
 because you said this really interesting idea

2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.320
 of Blizzard being centralized control,

2:11:40.320 --> 2:11:44.600
 is it possible to have items in the game

2:11:44.600 --> 2:11:48.760
 that are not controlled by Blizzard?

2:11:48.760 --> 2:11:49.600
 Sure.

2:11:49.600 --> 2:11:52.560
 Being controlled in a decentralized fashion.

2:11:52.560 --> 2:11:55.560
 Like what is it, the grandfather sword in Diablo?

2:11:56.520 --> 2:11:58.080
 What was it really?

2:11:58.080 --> 2:11:59.200
 Somebody was criticizing me.

2:11:59.200 --> 2:12:01.120
 I said, I was saying all these kinds of nice things

2:12:01.120 --> 2:12:03.480
 about Diablo III and they said Diablo II

2:12:03.480 --> 2:12:05.720
 resurrected is coming out, they need to check it out.

2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:07.680
 There's a lot of camps and wars on the internet.

2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:09.360
 Well, come on, we both know that Diablo II

2:12:09.360 --> 2:12:10.480
 was far better than Diablo II.

2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:11.520
 That's what they're saying.

2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:12.960
 This is the war that they're having.

2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:15.800
 Okay, so we'll play it, it's coming out soon,

2:12:15.800 --> 2:12:17.040
 I'll play it, fine.

2:12:17.040 --> 2:12:20.200
 But nevertheless, those items are owned by Blizzard.

2:12:20.200 --> 2:12:23.280
 Is it possible to create video games

2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:28.040
 where items are owned by the people outside of Blizzard?

2:12:28.040 --> 2:12:32.640
 And do you think in like a half century from now,

2:12:32.640 --> 2:12:34.240
 we will all live in those games

2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:36.000
 and we'll forget the physical space even exists?

2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:37.440
 Well, yeah, that's definitely possible.

2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:39.720
 I look at crypto kitties, that's a great example of that.

2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:41.160
 Can you explain what crypto kitties is?

2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:42.680
 Well, it's basically just a video game

2:12:42.680 --> 2:12:44.200
 that kind of lives on a blockchain

2:12:44.200 --> 2:12:46.520
 and the creatures within the game

2:12:46.520 --> 2:12:48.960
 can breed with each other and create new crypto kitties

2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:50.200
 and you can own them.

2:12:50.200 --> 2:12:53.000
 So it's like some sort of dystopian Tamagotchi

2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:54.160
 with lots of money behind.

2:12:54.160 --> 2:12:58.240
 But anyway, the thing is those assets

2:12:58.240 --> 2:13:00.880
 actually have a blockchain based representation.

2:13:00.880 --> 2:13:03.080
 And so whether the infrastructure

2:13:03.080 --> 2:13:05.840
 that hoists up that game off chain goes on or off

2:13:05.840 --> 2:13:09.760
 because that ledger exists outside of the game,

2:13:09.760 --> 2:13:12.760
 any person can come in, replicate it, restore it

2:13:12.760 --> 2:13:16.760
 and turn it back on, sans intellectual property.

2:13:16.760 --> 2:13:18.720
 So yeah, it's completely possible

2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:20.760
 to break your architecture up

2:13:20.760 --> 2:13:24.160
 where you have a notion of the player part

2:13:24.160 --> 2:13:27.200
 and then you have a notion of the experience part

2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:29.960
 and you can interchange experiences

2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:31.800
 almost like you do cascading style sheets

2:13:31.800 --> 2:13:33.800
 or something for different presentations

2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:36.760
 and the ownership of the underlying layers, the players.

2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:38.080
 So yeah, that's definitely doable.

2:13:38.080 --> 2:13:40.520
 And frankly, that's what's gonna happen in the gaming world

2:13:40.520 --> 2:13:42.040
 because there's so much value in that.

2:13:42.040 --> 2:13:45.640
 I mean, everybody wants play and right now the model is

2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:47.640
 you make a game, you sell licenses

2:13:47.640 --> 2:13:50.440
 and you have a huge surge of people

2:13:50.440 --> 2:13:52.360
 at the beginning of the game buying the video game

2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:54.080
 and then you have this long tail

2:13:54.080 --> 2:13:56.400
 but you've gotten almost 95% of your value

2:13:56.400 --> 2:13:57.320
 in the first six months.

2:13:57.320 --> 2:13:58.840
 You have a huge churn rate.

2:13:58.840 --> 2:14:00.160
 The odds are the vast majority of people

2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:02.440
 won't be playing the game within 12 months.

2:14:02.440 --> 2:14:04.160
 But if you can create an interactive game

2:14:04.160 --> 2:14:06.160
 where there's an actual economy inside the game,

2:14:06.160 --> 2:14:08.440
 then you have Eve online or Second Life

2:14:08.440 --> 2:14:09.920
 or any of these things where you have people playing

2:14:09.920 --> 2:14:11.640
 for 10 years and there's like people buying

2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:13.720
 virtual real estate and all these other things.

2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:15.680
 You as a game developer actually don't have

2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:17.640
 to create a lot of content.

2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:20.360
 So your long tail gets a lot fatter

2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:21.920
 and it generates a lot more revenue

2:14:21.920 --> 2:14:23.760
 and your cost of operating system

2:14:23.760 --> 2:14:25.880
 is fairly fixed or diminishing.

2:14:25.880 --> 2:14:28.080
 So the economics align for doing exactly

2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:29.680
 what you're talking about.

2:14:29.680 --> 2:14:30.800
 And I think it'll get done.

2:14:30.800 --> 2:14:34.280
 Well, I just saw recently sort of this calculation

2:14:34.280 --> 2:14:39.280
 that people played WoW and Fortnite for 140 billion hours.

2:14:40.240 --> 2:14:41.400
 Yeah.

2:14:41.400 --> 2:14:44.840
 So, and that's without the economic incentives there.

2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:47.840
 So do you think it's possible that like most of our economy

2:14:47.840 --> 2:14:52.680
 in the future will be people playing video games essentially?

2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:56.480
 Like, okay, so one vision of the future,

2:14:56.480 --> 2:14:58.160
 especially with AI and automation

2:14:58.160 --> 2:15:01.520
 that people like that would get wealthier and wealthier.

2:15:01.520 --> 2:15:04.640
 There's this kind of rising GDP for the entire world.

2:15:04.640 --> 2:15:06.760
 And then people are losing their jobs

2:15:06.760 --> 2:15:08.720
 but they're still well off enough

2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:11.320
 to be able to have a high quality of life.

2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:12.760
 So we're all looking for meaning

2:15:12.760 --> 2:15:14.960
 and the meaning we'll find is by playing video games

2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:17.120
 and now there's this extra levels.

2:15:17.120 --> 2:15:19.680
 Like you can be a Bill Gates within a video game world

2:15:19.680 --> 2:15:22.600
 in the digital world as opposed to the physical world.

2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:24.760
 Is that, do you think that's the future?

2:15:24.760 --> 2:15:26.080
 You just wanna have the Westworld

2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:27.240
 if you can't tell the difference.

2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:29.400
 Does it matter why I'm uttered to you?

2:15:29.400 --> 2:15:32.840
 Did you ever interview Yvonne Harari?

2:15:32.840 --> 2:15:34.240
 Not yet, eventually.

2:15:34.240 --> 2:15:35.800
 Well, yeah, I guess, you know,

2:15:35.800 --> 2:15:38.480
 Homo Diaz, that's kind of like the roadmap there.

2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:40.880
 This hedonistic dystopia

2:15:40.880 --> 2:15:44.960
 where everybody just lives wired into some simulation.

2:15:44.960 --> 2:15:47.320
 And there's some movies about that ready player one

2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:50.240
 and the other one was surrogate and so forth.

2:15:50.240 --> 2:15:52.960
 So, yeah, Hollywood has certainly visualized

2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:54.160
 what this could be.

2:15:54.160 --> 2:15:58.360
 But, you know, I'm not so pessimistic in that respect.

2:15:58.360 --> 2:16:00.160
 I do believe that the video game world

2:16:00.160 --> 2:16:01.640
 is evolving at an amazing pace.

2:16:01.640 --> 2:16:03.720
 If you look at where Unreal is at,

2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:06.240
 is just incredible, the latest Unreal Engine.

2:16:06.240 --> 2:16:09.120
 And within one or two more ticks of that clock,

2:16:09.120 --> 2:16:11.400
 the iterations, so five to 10 years,

2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:13.400
 the photo realism will be so good

2:16:13.400 --> 2:16:16.840
 that it'll be hard distinguish between real life

2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:18.880
 and video games.

2:16:18.880 --> 2:16:20.960
 And, you know, the hardware is almost there.

2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:22.920
 So, the question is then,

2:16:22.920 --> 2:16:25.240
 when you have photorealistic experiences

2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:27.960
 where you've successfully traversed the uncanny valley

2:16:27.960 --> 2:16:29.800
 to a point where it's good enough,

2:16:29.800 --> 2:16:33.960
 then will virtual reality be more desirable

2:16:33.960 --> 2:16:35.880
 than actual reality?

2:16:35.880 --> 2:16:37.160
 And for the vast majority of people,

2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:38.520
 the answer is probably yes,

2:16:38.520 --> 2:16:42.080
 because for actual reality it's tough, it's hard, you know?

2:16:42.080 --> 2:16:46.760
 But then, your knowledge that you live in a virtual world

2:16:46.760 --> 2:16:48.960
 actually becomes a problem for you.

2:16:48.960 --> 2:16:52.160
 So, there's gonna be this kind of sad, dark industry

2:16:52.160 --> 2:16:54.120
 where people try to create amnesia

2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:56.960
 where they're not aware that they're inside the virtual world.

2:16:56.960 --> 2:16:58.000
 And so, that's an interesting...

2:16:58.000 --> 2:16:58.840
 Why is it sad?

2:16:58.840 --> 2:17:00.400
 I mean, it's almost like...

2:17:00.400 --> 2:17:02.600
 Because, you know, it's not real.

2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:05.040
 But if you could forget that it's not real,

2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:07.760
 then you believe what you're experiencing is real.

2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:09.440
 Yeah, but yeah, so what?

2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:12.840
 You forget, like, you forget all the ugly parts of life,

2:17:12.840 --> 2:17:15.000
 which is the physicals, the meat space,

2:17:15.000 --> 2:17:16.720
 and then you should get to enjoy video games.

2:17:16.720 --> 2:17:18.160
 But it's always lurking in the back of your mind

2:17:18.160 --> 2:17:19.200
 that you're in the matrix.

2:17:19.200 --> 2:17:20.040
 Well, that's...

2:17:20.040 --> 2:17:20.880
 You have to not be in the matrix.

2:17:20.880 --> 2:17:23.040
 That's just why the bald dude in the matrix was like,

2:17:23.040 --> 2:17:25.200
 I wanna be rich and have a beautiful wife

2:17:25.200 --> 2:17:27.000
 and eat a steak every day.

2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:29.040
 You know, he didn't wanna know he was in the matrix.

2:17:29.040 --> 2:17:31.080
 So, you would take the red pill, not the blue pill?

2:17:31.080 --> 2:17:34.560
 Well, no, hang on, it depends on

2:17:34.560 --> 2:17:36.280
 how good the virtual world is, Lex.

2:17:36.280 --> 2:17:38.320
 Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

2:17:38.320 --> 2:17:40.960
 I mean, isn't that what most of the beautiful experiences

2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:45.960
 about human life are, is forgetting for a moment,

2:17:46.200 --> 2:17:48.600
 for a time, like the mess of it?

2:17:48.600 --> 2:17:49.440
 Yeah.

2:17:49.440 --> 2:17:51.360
 I mean, that's what love is, is you forget.

2:17:51.360 --> 2:17:53.440
 Like, all of a sudden, everything is beautiful.

2:17:53.440 --> 2:17:55.480
 But like, the reality is you're gonna lose that person.

2:17:55.480 --> 2:17:57.120
 Most likely, love will fade.

2:17:57.120 --> 2:17:59.400
 And no matter what, even if it doesn't,

2:17:59.400 --> 2:18:01.240
 you're both gonna be dead soon.

2:18:01.240 --> 2:18:02.240
 Jesus Christ.

2:18:02.240 --> 2:18:06.000
 So I'm taking the blue pill on that one.

2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:08.000
 You went full Ernest Becker on me, man.

2:18:09.440 --> 2:18:10.680
 Okay.

2:18:10.680 --> 2:18:12.360
 But you know, I get what you're saying, though.

2:18:12.360 --> 2:18:14.840
 And actually, but then it begs the question,

2:18:14.840 --> 2:18:17.000
 how do we, and goes back to the very first question

2:18:17.000 --> 2:18:18.480
 you asked in this interview, which is like,

2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:20.000
 how do we know we're not in a simulation?

2:18:20.000 --> 2:18:24.680
 Or is this Bostrom's concepts or these ideas like real?

2:18:24.680 --> 2:18:26.520
 Well, it's entirely possible that we are

2:18:26.520 --> 2:18:28.520
 and that we desire to be

2:18:28.520 --> 2:18:32.240
 because the real world is horrifically dystopian or bad

2:18:32.240 --> 2:18:34.160
 or maybe we're actually don't exist.

2:18:34.160 --> 2:18:36.600
 We're completely virtual and does it matter?

2:18:36.600 --> 2:18:38.280
 And I'd argue that it probably doesn't.

2:18:38.280 --> 2:18:41.400
 At some certain point, if you're at the end of your life

2:18:41.400 --> 2:18:43.600
 and you're 90s dying of cancer,

2:18:43.600 --> 2:18:45.800
 the fact that you can live out being young, healthy

2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:48.080
 and 25 is probably a desirable thing.

2:18:48.080 --> 2:18:50.040
 And no one would ever complain about that.

2:18:50.040 --> 2:18:53.160
 Where it becomes problematic is if the vast majority

2:18:53.160 --> 2:18:57.600
 of society enters this virtual simulacra of reality

2:18:57.600 --> 2:18:59.640
 and as a consequence, nothing works

2:18:59.640 --> 2:19:01.240
 because there's no one to do anything.

2:19:01.240 --> 2:19:03.600
 Society falls apart in that respect.

2:19:03.600 --> 2:19:05.800
 There's no desire to do anything in the real world.

2:19:05.800 --> 2:19:07.280
 Innovation stops.

2:19:07.280 --> 2:19:09.120
 The desire to actually do real work stops

2:19:09.120 --> 2:19:12.280
 because you're always inside this virtual economy.

2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:13.120
 So I don't know.

2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:14.680
 It's an interesting question,

2:19:14.680 --> 2:19:18.600
 but drawing it back more to where we're at today,

2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:20.480
 the evolution factors are there.

2:19:20.480 --> 2:19:22.880
 VR is evolving at a very rapid rate.

2:19:22.880 --> 2:19:25.760
 The game engines are just incredible today

2:19:25.760 --> 2:19:27.840
 and they're really doing amazing things.

2:19:27.840 --> 2:19:30.640
 And there seems to be an overwhelming desire

2:19:30.640 --> 2:19:33.440
 for people to escape the harshness of where they live

2:19:33.440 --> 2:19:36.040
 just by evidence by how many billions of hours

2:19:36.040 --> 2:19:37.320
 have been spent playing video games.

2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:39.120
 People still play Skyrim.

2:19:39.120 --> 2:19:41.080
 Yeah, it's a good game.

2:19:41.080 --> 2:19:42.920
 It's probably my favorite game

2:19:42.920 --> 2:19:44.640
 of the whole Elder Scrolls series,

2:19:44.640 --> 2:19:47.840
 but it's fascinating because smart contracts

2:19:47.840 --> 2:19:49.680
 is actually the mechanism by which we take

2:19:49.680 --> 2:19:52.760
 a lot of the meat space stuff and move it to the digital world.

2:19:52.760 --> 2:19:55.760
 So all the stuff we've been talking about

2:19:55.760 --> 2:19:59.720
 is really probably the mechanisms which take us there,

2:19:59.720 --> 2:20:03.120
 which I find that world not dystopian.

2:20:03.120 --> 2:20:04.320
 I find that world quite utopian

2:20:04.320 --> 2:20:05.520
 because there's so many opportunities

2:20:05.520 --> 2:20:07.240
 to create beautiful experiences.

2:20:08.920 --> 2:20:11.360
 But since we're talking about the future,

2:20:11.360 --> 2:20:13.040
 let me ask you the timeline question

2:20:14.080 --> 2:20:15.560
 or even just like definitional.

2:20:15.560 --> 2:20:16.680
 What is Alonzo?

2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:20.920
 You mentioned some fun Hello World experiments going on.

2:20:22.240 --> 2:20:26.360
 And how and when will Cardano get smart contracts?

2:20:26.360 --> 2:20:28.360
 Yeah, so Alonzo Church is a famous,

2:20:28.360 --> 2:20:30.520
 famous mathematician, computer science guy

2:20:30.520 --> 2:20:32.200
 and he was a contemporary of Turing.

2:20:32.200 --> 2:20:34.360
 And there was like these three different views

2:20:34.360 --> 2:20:36.480
 of computing recursive functions from Kirtle

2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:37.880
 and Turing machines from Turing.

2:20:37.880 --> 2:20:39.680
 And you know, church had lambda calculus

2:20:39.680 --> 2:20:40.680
 and they're all equivalent

2:20:40.680 --> 2:20:42.840
 and they all give you the ability to build a computer.

2:20:42.840 --> 2:20:45.160
 So we like functional programming.

2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:46.000
 So we decided.

2:20:46.000 --> 2:20:47.840
 That's your favorite church.

2:20:47.840 --> 2:20:49.440
 So we had to name something after church

2:20:49.440 --> 2:20:52.040
 and it's just weird that, you know, we never did.

2:20:52.040 --> 2:20:54.640
 So we said, okay, Alonzo is a good release name.

2:20:54.640 --> 2:20:56.600
 Basically it was bringing smart contracts to Cardano.

2:20:56.600 --> 2:20:58.200
 It took us a long time to get here

2:20:58.200 --> 2:21:00.040
 and we'll be there in the next 90 days.

2:21:00.040 --> 2:21:03.960
 You know, it's like everything we do, there's a process.

2:21:03.960 --> 2:21:05.720
 And so there's all the colors of the rainbow.

2:21:05.720 --> 2:21:09.480
 We start with Alonzo blue and then white and purple.

2:21:09.480 --> 2:21:11.280
 And each step you do some more things,

2:21:11.280 --> 2:21:12.640
 you bring more users in

2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:14.440
 and then eventually you get to a threshold

2:21:14.440 --> 2:21:17.040
 where you say, okay, everything works the way intended

2:21:17.040 --> 2:21:18.240
 and you push a button

2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:20.200
 and we initiate what's called a hard for commentator event

2:21:20.200 --> 2:21:22.720
 and boom, the system has smart contracts.

2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:24.280
 You just wake up and it's there.

2:21:24.280 --> 2:21:25.840
 It's like it's in your house.

2:21:25.840 --> 2:21:28.160
 So it's like when I got my blue check mark on Twitter,

2:21:28.160 --> 2:21:29.520
 I woke up and I had it.

2:21:29.520 --> 2:21:30.840
 It's just like Christmas came.

2:21:30.840 --> 2:21:31.800
 And you were never the same.

2:21:31.800 --> 2:21:33.240
 You can't go back.

2:21:33.240 --> 2:21:34.800
 It's like hard fork.

2:21:34.800 --> 2:21:36.080
 It's a hard fork of Charles.

2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:36.920
 Yeah, exactly.

2:21:36.920 --> 2:21:37.760
 You got blue mark.

2:21:37.760 --> 2:21:39.400
 Well, actually I think you can take it away,

2:21:39.400 --> 2:21:41.200
 but can they take my check mark away?

2:21:41.200 --> 2:21:42.040
 I think so.

2:21:44.040 --> 2:21:47.400
 But that'd be like a hard fork backwards, I guess.

2:21:47.400 --> 2:21:48.840
 Okay, so great.

2:21:48.840 --> 2:21:53.840
 So that's, but currently there's a testing procedure

2:21:55.440 --> 2:21:58.520
 going on to see what does that look like

2:21:58.520 --> 2:22:00.080
 and what will give you confidence

2:22:00.080 --> 2:22:01.000
 that things are working well.

2:22:01.000 --> 2:22:02.960
 Yeah, so first you start with the Mary era,

2:22:02.960 --> 2:22:04.920
 which is where we're right now multi assets.

2:22:04.920 --> 2:22:08.080
 So you can do metadata and issue tokens on Cardano,

2:22:08.080 --> 2:22:11.160
 but you'd have limited programmability on chain.

2:22:11.160 --> 2:22:13.280
 Alonzo adds the programmability end,

2:22:13.280 --> 2:22:15.200
 but we already have most of the foundations

2:22:15.200 --> 2:22:17.600
 of the extended UTXO model and the smart contract model.

2:22:17.600 --> 2:22:19.320
 It's just those things aren't ready.

2:22:19.320 --> 2:22:21.480
 So the first step is say fork it.

2:22:21.480 --> 2:22:23.240
 So all those rules are now there.

2:22:23.240 --> 2:22:25.440
 Okay, so that's what we did with Alonzo blue.

2:22:25.440 --> 2:22:27.840
 We forked a test net based layer

2:22:27.840 --> 2:22:31.760
 and it successfully survived going from Mary to Alonzo,

2:22:31.760 --> 2:22:33.400
 which means that you can move transactions

2:22:33.400 --> 2:22:35.800
 from one side to the other, both systems work.

2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:36.920
 And then the next step is say,

2:22:36.920 --> 2:22:39.040
 okay, well, are the stake pull operators,

2:22:39.040 --> 2:22:40.200
 people run the infrastructure,

2:22:40.200 --> 2:22:42.800
 able to run this test net just like they run Cardano.

2:22:42.800 --> 2:22:44.200
 And that's what we're doing right now with blue.

2:22:44.200 --> 2:22:45.960
 We're bringing all these SPOs in

2:22:45.960 --> 2:22:47.400
 and then are we able to submit

2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:49.440
 and runs smart contracts on the system?

2:22:49.440 --> 2:22:51.280
 And they actually return around trip.

2:22:51.280 --> 2:22:53.000
 You send something, you get something back.

2:22:53.000 --> 2:22:54.760
 Yeah, okay.

2:22:54.760 --> 2:22:55.600
 So that's where we're at.

2:22:55.600 --> 2:22:57.720
 And then what you do is each step,

2:22:57.720 --> 2:22:58.880
 so the next is white,

2:22:58.880 --> 2:23:01.560
 you go from like 50 people to several hundred

2:23:01.560 --> 2:23:03.880
 and then purples and open test net

2:23:03.880 --> 2:23:05.680
 where we want every single person,

2:23:05.680 --> 2:23:07.080
 the entire ecosystem to use it.

2:23:07.080 --> 2:23:08.600
 And it's also a dev net.

2:23:08.600 --> 2:23:10.400
 So that means that people are writing

2:23:10.400 --> 2:23:12.840
 with plus playground and local interpreters,

2:23:12.840 --> 2:23:16.000
 their smart contracts can actually start testing them now

2:23:16.000 --> 2:23:17.480
 on the public infrastructure.

2:23:17.480 --> 2:23:20.600
 So it's kind of like releasing dev kits to the Xbox

2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:21.440
 or something like that.

2:23:21.440 --> 2:23:22.800
 You send them out to game developers

2:23:22.800 --> 2:23:24.000
 before you release the Xbox

2:23:24.000 --> 2:23:25.320
 so they can test their video games

2:23:25.320 --> 2:23:28.000
 in anticipation of the release of the system.

2:23:28.000 --> 2:23:29.360
 So you run that for at least a month.

2:23:29.360 --> 2:23:31.720
 And as long as it doesn't blow up in your face

2:23:31.720 --> 2:23:33.040
 and oh God, what have we done?

2:23:33.040 --> 2:23:35.280
 Hindenburg, oh the humanity.

2:23:35.280 --> 2:23:37.480
 You release it and you ship it.

2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:39.640
 The problem is it's no longer in our control.

2:23:39.640 --> 2:23:42.280
 There's over a hundred exchanges that have listed Cardano,

2:23:42.280 --> 2:23:43.800
 there's lots of wallet infrastructure,

2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:45.960
 there are thousands of different constituencies.

2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:49.000
 So it's less of a technological problem now

2:23:49.000 --> 2:23:51.000
 and it's more of a coordination problem.

2:23:51.000 --> 2:23:54.640
 So you have to evolve in a very methodical way

2:23:54.640 --> 2:23:56.800
 and each step of the way you bring new actors in,

2:23:56.800 --> 2:23:58.000
 they get ready for it,

2:23:58.000 --> 2:23:59.800
 they upgrade their infrastructure to it

2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:00.960
 and then like shells,

2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:03.360
 eventually you get to the outer shell

2:24:03.360 --> 2:24:05.320
 which is the hard fork for the general public.

2:24:05.320 --> 2:24:07.120
 And if we've done it right,

2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:08.280
 like that blue check mark,

2:24:08.280 --> 2:24:10.560
 they wake up and it's exactly the same.

2:24:10.560 --> 2:24:12.000
 They just get a little update,

2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:13.200
 they update your client.

2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:16.040
 They start demanding Wagyu beef.

2:24:16.040 --> 2:24:17.480
 Is there stuff you're worried about

2:24:17.480 --> 2:24:21.040
 in terms of like when something's this tricky,

2:24:22.280 --> 2:24:25.640
 goes up several orders of magnitudes in terms of scale?

2:24:25.640 --> 2:24:27.440
 Are there problems that you foresee?

2:24:27.440 --> 2:24:30.960
 Is there like we said, there's game theoretic aspects,

2:24:30.960 --> 2:24:32.400
 all those kinds of things.

2:24:32.400 --> 2:24:33.880
 Like what worries you the most?

2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:35.440
 I mean, I sleep like a baby.

2:24:35.440 --> 2:24:37.120
 I wake up every two hours crying.

2:24:40.120 --> 2:24:41.680
 Oh, damn, that's a good line.

2:24:41.680 --> 2:24:43.000
 You're full of good lines.

2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:45.320
 I mean, there's a lot to it.

2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:47.840
 You just made me realize that expression makes no sense.

2:24:47.840 --> 2:24:50.040
 I slept like a baby, but go ahead.

2:24:50.040 --> 2:24:51.720
 Yeah, exactly right.

2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:53.840
 Messing your whole world up right now, Alex.

2:24:55.000 --> 2:24:56.800
 No, I mean, there's so much that keeps me up at night.

2:24:56.800 --> 2:24:59.000
 You know, it's like you're in a cold sweat every day

2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:00.560
 when you have an ecosystem like this

2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:03.480
 because the other thing is you're judged as much

2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:05.480
 by the applications people build on the platform

2:25:05.480 --> 2:25:08.280
 as you are by the platform you've constructed.

2:25:08.280 --> 2:25:10.520
 So, you know, one of the most unfair things

2:25:10.520 --> 2:25:11.840
 that happened in our industry

2:25:11.840 --> 2:25:14.560
 was blaming Vitalik for the Dow hack.

2:25:14.560 --> 2:25:15.400
 He didn't write the code.

2:25:15.400 --> 2:25:16.520
 He wasn't responsible for it.

2:25:16.520 --> 2:25:18.640
 It's completely independent, different team.

2:25:18.640 --> 2:25:19.600
 And because it blew up,

2:25:19.600 --> 2:25:21.280
 a lot of people just developed this idea.

2:25:21.280 --> 2:25:22.720
 Ethereum is not secure.

2:25:22.720 --> 2:25:24.240
 EVM is fundamentally broken.

2:25:24.240 --> 2:25:26.960
 And it's true, there are some issues there, but come on.

2:25:26.960 --> 2:25:29.200
 That's like saying, oh, well, you know,

2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:32.080
 Photoshop didn't work, fuck Bill Gates, you know?

2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:36.600
 And that's the issue is you get as a platform developer,

2:25:36.600 --> 2:25:40.000
 you know, coupled with the wins and losses

2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:41.200
 of your application developer.

2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:43.720
 So if they go do amazing things, it's like,

2:25:43.720 --> 2:25:45.800
 oh yeah, Windows is great, we love it.

2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:47.280
 And if they go do terrible things, they're like,

2:25:47.280 --> 2:25:50.280
 oh man, I guess he's trying to kill all of us.

2:25:50.280 --> 2:25:53.280
 So what we're kept up at night about

2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:55.120
 is not just what we've constructed,

2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:58.040
 but also how do we curate an ecosystem

2:25:58.040 --> 2:25:59.680
 and foster the development of an ecosystem

2:25:59.680 --> 2:26:02.040
 where you have assurance baked into the application.

2:26:02.040 --> 2:26:04.360
 And that's somehow expressible to the user.

2:26:04.360 --> 2:26:06.520
 So when you download your smart contract

2:26:06.520 --> 2:26:08.000
 or you click your one click install,

2:26:08.000 --> 2:26:10.680
 you use your Uniswap clone or whatever the hell it is

2:26:10.680 --> 2:26:12.400
 that's deployed on Cardano,

2:26:12.400 --> 2:26:14.200
 you have a little green check mark or something

2:26:14.200 --> 2:26:16.440
 that indicates to you that somebody audited the code

2:26:16.440 --> 2:26:18.240
 or followed a specification.

2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:19.920
 The lack of that is problematic

2:26:19.920 --> 2:26:22.480
 because then first there's impersonations,

2:26:22.480 --> 2:26:23.920
 the whole my ether wallet thing,

2:26:23.920 --> 2:26:26.160
 or like your videos or my videos are the same.

2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:28.120
 Every comment there's a bot that says,

2:26:28.120 --> 2:26:30.720
 hey, give me some money or something like that.

2:26:30.720 --> 2:26:31.840
 That kind of stuff happens,

2:26:31.840 --> 2:26:34.000
 but then just protocol level flaws,

2:26:34.000 --> 2:26:35.680
 like what happened with the Dow hack.

2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:37.120
 That's what really keeps me up at night.

2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:38.840
 How do you resolve that problem?

2:26:38.840 --> 2:26:40.440
 Because I don't hire these people,

2:26:40.440 --> 2:26:41.720
 I don't tell them what to do,

2:26:41.720 --> 2:26:44.280
 I didn't tell them how to build things on the platform.

2:26:44.280 --> 2:26:46.120
 They may have tons of experience and knowledge

2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:47.680
 that can be Simon Payton Jones,

2:26:47.680 --> 2:26:50.440
 or they could have absolutely no knowledge whatsoever

2:26:50.440 --> 2:26:51.520
 and they read one tutorial

2:26:51.520 --> 2:26:53.880
 and they've written three lines of code their entire life

2:26:53.880 --> 2:26:56.680
 and they've deployed something horribly broken copy paste

2:26:56.680 --> 2:26:58.120
 and suddenly it all goes to hell.

2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:00.120
 I'm judged by both.

2:27:00.120 --> 2:27:01.640
 That's what really keeps me up at night.

2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:03.640
 And we're as a company trying to figure out

2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:06.280
 and as the ecosystem trying to figure out standards,

2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:07.480
 like at University of Wyoming,

2:27:07.480 --> 2:27:10.480
 we're setting up the smart contract engineering institute.

2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:12.120
 We're negotiating with them right now.

2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:14.960
 And the goal there is just to create some standards

2:27:14.960 --> 2:27:17.240
 for how to certify smart contracts

2:27:17.240 --> 2:27:19.240
 and so that you can get that green check mark

2:27:19.240 --> 2:27:22.520
 and know that it actually has some assurance level behind it.

2:27:22.520 --> 2:27:24.920
 But God, that's a huge coordination problem

2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:27.120
 and it's a huge information presentation problem

2:27:27.120 --> 2:27:29.040
 and incentives problem and so forth.

2:27:29.040 --> 2:27:31.920
 And unfortunately, people who value being first to market

2:27:31.920 --> 2:27:35.120
 will kind of piss in the pool for everybody else.

2:27:35.120 --> 2:27:37.440
 In terms of maybe you can comment

2:27:37.440 --> 2:27:40.800
 on the topic of decentralized exchanges.

2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:43.840
 What kind of decentralized exchanges, Dex,

2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:45.000
 is what are they first of all

2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:48.800
 and what kind would you like to see built around Cardano?

2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:51.080
 Yeah, so people want to create exchanges

2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:52.960
 that don't have custodial risk.

2:27:52.960 --> 2:27:55.760
 The point of exchange is to build you a marketplace

2:27:55.760 --> 2:27:57.880
 where bids and ass can find each other,

2:27:57.880 --> 2:28:00.400
 market people can meet and trade.

2:28:00.400 --> 2:28:02.440
 You can find a price and you can get liquidity.

2:28:02.440 --> 2:28:05.840
 So you got gold, you want to turn your gold into dollars.

2:28:05.840 --> 2:28:08.160
 Okay, well, somebody has to create a marketplace for that.

2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:10.480
 So like Coinbase is an example of marketplace,

2:28:10.480 --> 2:28:11.320
 but centralized.

2:28:11.320 --> 2:28:13.080
 But the problem is you have custodial risk.

2:28:13.080 --> 2:28:15.160
 So when you put your gold and your dollars,

2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:17.280
 your digital representations of these things

2:28:17.280 --> 2:28:22.040
 into the exchange, what if Wally, he was,

2:28:22.040 --> 2:28:24.280
 Eve broke up with him and now he's really sad

2:28:24.280 --> 2:28:25.880
 and he's gone to the dark side

2:28:25.880 --> 2:28:27.640
 and he's become Wally the hacker.

2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:29.440
 Okay, so he can go and sneak his way in

2:28:29.440 --> 2:28:32.040
 and hack into Coinbase and steal all your gold

2:28:32.040 --> 2:28:32.880
 and your tokens.

2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:34.720
 So instead of you actually being able to swap these things,

2:28:34.720 --> 2:28:36.320
 you've lost all your money.

2:28:36.320 --> 2:28:37.360
 And there's other problems too.

2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:41.400
 Like let's say, Daisy has now come in

2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:42.720
 and become a regulator and said,

2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:44.360
 oh, I don't like these exchanges anymore.

2:28:44.360 --> 2:28:46.080
 I'm just gonna shut them all down.

2:28:46.080 --> 2:28:47.640
 Yeah, and then you have no access to it.

2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:48.760
 So you have sovereign risk.

2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:50.040
 You have the risk of threat.

2:28:50.040 --> 2:28:51.560
 You have regulatory risk.

2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:54.360
 You have the issue of banks maybe cutting you out.

2:28:54.360 --> 2:28:57.240
 So it's been in our industry for more than 10 years.

2:28:57.240 --> 2:28:59.520
 Mount Gox was the most famous example of that.

2:28:59.520 --> 2:29:01.920
 They collapsed, I believe, in 2013

2:29:01.920 --> 2:29:05.000
 and hundreds of millions of dollars was lost

2:29:05.000 --> 2:29:06.560
 over the course of a while.

2:29:06.560 --> 2:29:07.920
 So the point of a dex is saying,

2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:10.880
 can we do what a marketplace does,

2:29:10.880 --> 2:29:13.240
 but not have Coinbase,

2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:16.200
 not have a central actor run this thing.

2:29:16.200 --> 2:29:17.520
 And there's a lot of problems with that

2:29:17.520 --> 2:29:22.600
 because exchanges are generally creatures of latency.

2:29:22.600 --> 2:29:24.240
 High frequency trading, for example,

2:29:24.240 --> 2:29:25.560
 these things, the nanosecond,

2:29:25.560 --> 2:29:28.400
 they co locate their infrastructure with the exchange

2:29:28.400 --> 2:29:30.160
 software just so they can front run orders

2:29:30.160 --> 2:29:31.400
 over other people.

2:29:31.400 --> 2:29:34.520
 I mean, it's crazy the amount of technology that they put in.

2:29:34.520 --> 2:29:37.440
 So the traditional Wall Street version of an exchange

2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:40.360
 is very centralized, very fast, very optimized

2:29:40.360 --> 2:29:44.280
 and kind of behaves by a very close set of rules.

2:29:44.280 --> 2:29:45.400
 When you look at a dex,

2:29:45.400 --> 2:29:47.280
 you have to accept that you're gonna have

2:29:47.280 --> 2:29:48.960
 to have slightly different rules

2:29:48.960 --> 2:29:52.520
 because you're operating in a global systems latency.

2:29:52.520 --> 2:29:53.640
 And you're operating in a system

2:29:53.640 --> 2:29:55.240
 that has different behaviors.

2:29:55.240 --> 2:29:56.080
 However, that said,

2:29:56.080 --> 2:29:58.200
 there's a lot of great protocols that have been built for it.

2:29:58.200 --> 2:30:01.520
 Uniswap has kind of evolved a lot over the years.

2:30:01.520 --> 2:30:03.920
 And we've seen a huge competition

2:30:03.920 --> 2:30:07.400
 and a lot of evolution to basically build out protocols

2:30:07.400 --> 2:30:09.080
 that kind of excuse some of these security problems

2:30:09.080 --> 2:30:10.600
 and enjoy high liquidity.

2:30:10.600 --> 2:30:15.120
 And then also have this beautiful concept of openness.

2:30:15.120 --> 2:30:16.560
 One of the gatekeepers to crypto

2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:19.280
 when you're a cryptocurrency developer are the exchanges.

2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:21.080
 I remember when we first created Cardano,

2:30:21.080 --> 2:30:23.600
 you know, the Bitfinex guys reached out

2:30:23.600 --> 2:30:24.640
 at the Cardano Foundation.

2:30:24.640 --> 2:30:26.920
 They said, oh, we'd be happy to list data.

2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:27.960
 And I said, oh, okay.

2:30:27.960 --> 2:30:31.000
 And they said, yeah, we want $5 million to do it.

2:30:31.000 --> 2:30:33.760
 You know, so there was kind of a sub Italian

2:30:33.760 --> 2:30:36.680
 for go fuck yourself in those email conversations.

2:30:36.680 --> 2:30:39.080
 Fuck, who knows what I said.

2:30:39.080 --> 2:30:42.920
 But anyway, that kind of back and forth happens all the time.

2:30:42.920 --> 2:30:44.640
 And because these guys are gatekeepers,

2:30:44.640 --> 2:30:46.440
 they have this nepotistic control,

2:30:46.440 --> 2:30:48.480
 information asymmetries and so forth.

2:30:48.480 --> 2:30:50.720
 So having a DEX, you don't have that problem.

2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:52.160
 You have open listing.

2:30:52.160 --> 2:30:54.400
 And you basically just put the asset into it.

2:30:54.400 --> 2:30:56.920
 And if anybody wants to trade it, they will.

2:30:56.920 --> 2:30:58.600
 And if it seems like it's a good idea,

2:30:58.600 --> 2:30:59.680
 a natural market will form,

2:30:59.680 --> 2:31:02.000
 market making will occur and you get liquidity with it.

2:31:02.000 --> 2:31:05.160
 So there's no barrier to entry for that type of system.

2:31:05.160 --> 2:31:08.720
 The biggest existential problem for DEX is right now

2:31:08.720 --> 2:31:10.880
 is the concept of regulation.

2:31:10.880 --> 2:31:13.840
 So basically right now, when you use Binance

2:31:13.840 --> 2:31:15.400
 or Coinbase or these other guys,

2:31:15.400 --> 2:31:17.000
 you have to go through KYC and AML,

2:31:17.000 --> 2:31:18.960
 know your customer and anti money laundering.

2:31:18.960 --> 2:31:22.200
 So basically who are you and is your money real or not?

2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:24.240
 Or are you a drug dealer or something?

2:31:24.240 --> 2:31:26.200
 So normally you do that by saying,

2:31:26.200 --> 2:31:29.120
 okay, I'm gonna give them my copy of my passport

2:31:29.120 --> 2:31:31.200
 and maybe they're gonna request some tax records

2:31:31.200 --> 2:31:32.680
 or whatever the best practices are

2:31:32.680 --> 2:31:34.560
 for the particular jurisdiction.

2:31:34.560 --> 2:31:37.880
 And then that exchange is liable if that's fucked up.

2:31:37.880 --> 2:31:39.960
 So if the government comes in and says,

2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:43.320
 hey guys, pull your compliance records

2:31:43.320 --> 2:31:44.640
 and they find discrepancies,

2:31:44.640 --> 2:31:46.400
 they'll actually put the exchange out of business

2:31:46.400 --> 2:31:48.360
 or find them very heavily.

2:31:48.360 --> 2:31:51.640
 JP Morgan Chase got $19 billion in finance

2:31:51.640 --> 2:31:53.160
 and fines over the last 20 years

2:31:53.160 --> 2:31:56.280
 for various compliance issues amongst other things.

2:31:56.280 --> 2:31:59.240
 So it's expensive, very difficult thing.

2:31:59.240 --> 2:32:01.440
 And at DEX it's open system.

2:32:01.440 --> 2:32:03.680
 You just have value coming in, not identity.

2:32:03.680 --> 2:32:05.000
 And so all these things are trading

2:32:05.000 --> 2:32:06.480
 amongst sedonymous accounts.

2:32:06.480 --> 2:32:08.320
 And so there's no notion of compliance

2:32:08.320 --> 2:32:09.280
 right now for that.

2:32:09.280 --> 2:32:11.400
 So a lot of regulators are coming in and saying,

2:32:11.400 --> 2:32:14.000
 oh, well, this is just a cesspool for terrorism

2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:15.320
 and drug dealing and bad stuff.

2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:18.240
 And they're word salad of bullshit.

2:32:18.240 --> 2:32:19.160
 But it is what it is.

2:32:19.160 --> 2:32:20.320
 You have to deal with these guys.

2:32:20.320 --> 2:32:22.440
 And so there's been a lot of discussions

2:32:22.440 --> 2:32:25.560
 of can we take DEXes and keep the openness

2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:28.280
 and keep the liquidity and no counterpart

2:32:28.280 --> 2:32:30.920
 or custodial risk and can we add

2:32:30.920 --> 2:32:32.800
 some notion of compliance to that?

2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:33.960
 And it just centralized way.

2:32:33.960 --> 2:32:37.240
 It doesn't require a single actor to be a gatekeeper.

2:32:37.240 --> 2:32:38.760
 So I think actually by combining

2:32:38.760 --> 2:32:41.160
 DIDS decentralized identifiers, that's the way to do it.

2:32:41.160 --> 2:32:43.440
 But it's actually the next generation of the technology

2:32:43.440 --> 2:32:44.680
 is the regulated DEX.

2:32:44.680 --> 2:32:46.280
 And who regulates that?

2:32:46.280 --> 2:32:47.640
 How does that work and so forth?

2:32:47.640 --> 2:32:49.000
 But I think ultimately those are gonna be

2:32:49.000 --> 2:32:53.000
 the only marketplaces that end up surviving

2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:54.840
 in this current environment if your desire

2:32:54.840 --> 2:32:56.520
 is to exit to a dollar.

2:32:56.520 --> 2:32:59.120
 If you don't really care about the fiat side,

2:32:59.120 --> 2:33:01.000
 like traditional legacy currency,

2:33:01.000 --> 2:33:05.280
 you can always do things in a shadowy, unregulated way.

2:33:05.280 --> 2:33:07.680
 But I mean, it's a personal preference

2:33:07.680 --> 2:33:08.920
 and a business preference.

2:33:08.920 --> 2:33:13.560
 Can we kind of return to proof of work and proof of stake?

2:33:13.560 --> 2:33:15.760
 There's just so many topics I wanna talk to you about.

2:33:15.760 --> 2:33:17.720
 So I'll jump around a little bit.

2:33:17.720 --> 2:33:21.440
 But at the Bitcoin conference, Jack Dorsey spoke.

2:33:21.440 --> 2:33:25.040
 I think I believe he said Bitcoin changes everything.

2:33:25.040 --> 2:33:27.320
 I think you made a video for Jack

2:33:27.320 --> 2:33:30.160
 trying to explain different ideas to him.

2:33:30.160 --> 2:33:32.720
 I guess describing the difference between proof of work

2:33:32.720 --> 2:33:35.120
 and proof of stake as we've talked about.

2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:37.160
 What do you hope Jack Dorsey comes to understand

2:33:37.160 --> 2:33:39.120
 about the difference between proof of work

2:33:39.120 --> 2:33:40.680
 and proof of stake?

2:33:40.680 --> 2:33:42.880
 Well, I hope he understands it's just a resource.

2:33:42.880 --> 2:33:45.040
 That's the entire point of the video I was trying to make.

2:33:45.040 --> 2:33:47.400
 It's like, dude, you're like in this cult

2:33:47.400 --> 2:33:49.840
 where you think the only way to be secure is proof of work

2:33:49.840 --> 2:33:51.840
 or in somehow proof of stake is less secure

2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:52.920
 than proof of work.

2:33:52.920 --> 2:33:55.440
 I don't even know how you put those inequalities there

2:33:55.440 --> 2:33:57.680
 because you're talking about apples and oranges.

2:33:57.680 --> 2:33:59.480
 You're making different trade offs

2:33:59.480 --> 2:34:00.480
 and there's different assumptions

2:34:00.480 --> 2:34:02.680
 about the nature of the people involved,

2:34:02.680 --> 2:34:04.600
 but the mechanics are the same.

2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:06.640
 And so it's really more of a question of

2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:08.480
 what type of system do you prefer?

2:34:08.480 --> 2:34:10.400
 Do you want mercenaries guarding Rome

2:34:10.400 --> 2:34:13.040
 or do you want Roman citizens guarding Rome?

2:34:13.040 --> 2:34:14.240
 Okay, and as the Romans learned,

2:34:14.240 --> 2:34:16.800
 it's better to have citizens usually doing that.

2:34:16.800 --> 2:34:19.280
 Okay, and that's the only point I was trying to make

2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:22.440
 to Dorsey and I don't think he watched it

2:34:22.440 --> 2:34:25.680
 or particularly cared, but it was more of a video

2:34:25.680 --> 2:34:28.600
 for everyone and to start that dialogue

2:34:28.600 --> 2:34:32.000
 realizing that the real game is proof of stake

2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:33.320
 better than proof of work.

2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:36.360
 It's how do we go from one to N and what should N be?

2:34:36.360 --> 2:34:38.640
 You just mentioned that semantical addressable web

2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:41.720
 going back to IPFS and these other concepts.

2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:44.600
 Well, how do you pay for the enormous burden

2:34:44.600 --> 2:34:46.160
 of storing that much data?

2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:48.120
 You can create a consensus protocol for it.

2:34:48.120 --> 2:34:50.040
 There actually is one, it's called Permacoin.

2:34:50.040 --> 2:34:53.320
 Came out in 2014, 15, Andrew Miller wrote it

2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:54.440
 and a few other authors.

2:34:54.440 --> 2:34:57.880
 I think our John Katz may have been an author as well,

2:34:57.880 --> 2:35:00.080
 but basically it was just a throwaway

2:35:00.080 --> 2:35:02.000
 proof of work style algorithm

2:35:02.000 --> 2:35:06.000
 that only works if you have large amounts of data.

2:35:06.000 --> 2:35:09.680
 So it's like your miners are like a hard drive effectively.

2:35:09.680 --> 2:35:11.160
 Proof of storage, I think you call this.

2:35:11.160 --> 2:35:12.760
 Yeah, this type of stuff.

2:35:12.760 --> 2:35:14.680
 And there's been since then many iterations,

2:35:14.680 --> 2:35:17.000
 evolutions of that type of protocol.

2:35:17.000 --> 2:35:20.160
 Okay, so what if you throw that into your resource bag?

2:35:20.160 --> 2:35:22.520
 Now you have a capacity in your system

2:35:22.520 --> 2:35:24.840
 for storing huge amounts of information

2:35:24.840 --> 2:35:27.000
 that's incentivized by the way the system works.

2:35:27.000 --> 2:35:29.280
 And you can balance that with a proof of stake system.

2:35:29.280 --> 2:35:31.200
 And you can balance that with,

2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:33.880
 let's say you have proof of useful computation.

2:35:33.880 --> 2:35:37.320
 We may have a paper on that, who knows, coming soon.

2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:39.280
 And what if you have a proof of useful computation

2:35:39.280 --> 2:35:41.680
 where maybe you can do walk stat or something, who knows?

2:35:41.680 --> 2:35:43.920
 With something like that, okay, well now you have

2:35:43.920 --> 2:35:45.760
 three resources inside your system.

2:35:45.760 --> 2:35:47.680
 And those three things keep your system secure,

2:35:47.680 --> 2:35:48.680
 they keep each other balanced.

2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:50.240
 And they just so happen to create

2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:53.040
 the world's largest supercomputer that's programmable.

2:35:53.040 --> 2:35:54.200
 And it just so happens to create

2:35:54.200 --> 2:35:56.640
 the world's largest database that's programmable.

2:35:56.640 --> 2:35:59.600
 In addition to having a shareholder style model

2:35:59.600 --> 2:36:00.720
 for ownership inside of it,

2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:02.080
 to kind of balance these things out.

2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:04.280
 So people care about the appreciation of value

2:36:04.280 --> 2:36:05.480
 inside the system.

2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:08.320
 So that was my point to Jack, is your business guy,

2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:09.760
 why are you betting all your eggs?

2:36:09.760 --> 2:36:12.360
 And one crazy model that's a cult,

2:36:12.360 --> 2:36:14.920
 step away and realize that that does something.

2:36:14.920 --> 2:36:18.440
 It's a tool, but saws aren't the only tool in the toolbox.

2:36:18.440 --> 2:36:20.760
 There's hammers and screwdrivers and other things.

2:36:20.760 --> 2:36:22.160
 Go to end resources.

2:36:22.160 --> 2:36:24.080
 And let's have a real conversation about

2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:27.000
 what would a world computer or a world infrastructure

2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:28.920
 that's useful for your business to name,

2:36:28.920 --> 2:36:31.560
 in his case, Twitter, require.

2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:33.240
 And what type of resources would you need

2:36:33.240 --> 2:36:34.080
 for that such a thing?

2:36:34.080 --> 2:36:36.400
 Well, in his case, Square more importantly.

2:36:36.400 --> 2:36:38.280
 Currently, if you look at Square and Cash App,

2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:41.120
 they support Bitcoin.

2:36:41.120 --> 2:36:44.280
 He is kind of all in on the proof of work idea.

2:36:44.280 --> 2:36:46.400
 Not all in, but currently kind of,

2:36:46.400 --> 2:36:48.600
 that's the one supported idea.

2:36:48.600 --> 2:36:51.000
 I guess there's just a tip in proof of work.

2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:54.240
 I love you so much, Charles.

2:36:54.240 --> 2:36:57.480
 Thank you, appreciate this.

2:36:57.480 --> 2:37:00.080
 But I'm not gonna run with that,

2:37:00.080 --> 2:37:02.200
 even though I'm tempted to,

2:37:02.200 --> 2:37:05.960
 but looking forward to you hope Cardano

2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:07.840
 becomes part of Cash App.

2:37:07.840 --> 2:37:09.360
 I mean, he's the business guy,

2:37:09.360 --> 2:37:10.560
 or at least I'd hope he is.

2:37:10.560 --> 2:37:13.040
 And it's not about what I want or what he wants.

2:37:13.040 --> 2:37:14.640
 It's about what markets want.

2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:16.640
 When you run a publicly traded company,

2:37:16.640 --> 2:37:18.680
 you have a fiduciary obligation to your shareholders

2:37:18.680 --> 2:37:21.840
 to maximize the utility and sustainability

2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:23.480
 and value of your company.

2:37:23.480 --> 2:37:27.360
 And so if he's running a company that makes money

2:37:27.360 --> 2:37:28.400
 off of these things,

2:37:28.400 --> 2:37:31.040
 it makes absolutely no sense to be a maximalist.

2:37:31.040 --> 2:37:32.280
 You want transaction volume.

2:37:32.280 --> 2:37:33.400
 That's how you make your damn money.

2:37:33.400 --> 2:37:34.720
 It was Coinbase was the same way.

2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:36.960
 They were very maximalists in the beginning.

2:37:36.960 --> 2:37:38.440
 Very quickly they started realizing,

2:37:38.440 --> 2:37:40.000
 hey, we're losing a lot of money.

2:37:40.000 --> 2:37:40.960
 If we want an IPO,

2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:43.360
 we kind of need to be a bit more diverse.

2:37:43.360 --> 2:37:46.160
 Eric Voorhees was also a maximalist way back today.

2:37:46.160 --> 2:37:47.840
 Now look at Eric, he's got a shape shift.

2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:49.920
 And all these other pieces of infrastructure,

2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:52.400
 he's a lot more friendly with us Alties.

2:37:52.400 --> 2:37:55.160
 So, you know, Jack will make that decision.

2:37:55.160 --> 2:37:56.920
 His people will make that decision, I think,

2:37:56.920 --> 2:37:59.320
 based on market dynamics, transaction volume,

2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:01.560
 and value to the user.

2:38:01.560 --> 2:38:04.680
 And if the concern is actually legitimately security,

2:38:04.680 --> 2:38:06.680
 then the only question I'd ask their team is,

2:38:06.680 --> 2:38:09.440
 can you please provide me a definition of one?

2:38:09.440 --> 2:38:14.440
 Doing POW is more secure than proof of stake as a tweet

2:38:14.600 --> 2:38:16.080
 is not really a proof.

2:38:16.080 --> 2:38:18.120
 Okay, you need to actually come out and sit down and say,

2:38:18.120 --> 2:38:19.480
 what is your security model?

2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:20.560
 What do you care about?

2:38:20.560 --> 2:38:21.400
 What do you value?

2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:23.920
 What's the problems you're concerned about a proof of stake?

2:38:23.920 --> 2:38:25.400
 And they never really get there.

2:38:25.400 --> 2:38:28.400
 And that's why I call this maximum like a religion,

2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:30.160
 because it's just like saying,

2:38:30.160 --> 2:38:32.320
 you know, well, the angels descended from the heavens.

2:38:32.320 --> 2:38:33.480
 And it's like, well, how do you know?

2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:36.160
 Because the Bible said so, or the doctrine said so.

2:38:36.160 --> 2:38:37.560
 It's like, well, that's your evidence?

2:38:37.560 --> 2:38:39.520
 Somebody wrote something down.

2:38:39.520 --> 2:38:41.120
 Can you please give me a little bit more?

2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:43.560
 They say, no, you're challenging the word of God.

2:38:43.560 --> 2:38:46.000
 In this case, you're challenging the word of Satoshi.

2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:48.360
 And all I ask for is just, what is the burden of proof?

2:38:48.360 --> 2:38:50.680
 We wrote the papers, we have security models,

2:38:50.680 --> 2:38:52.080
 we went through the peer review process.

2:38:52.080 --> 2:38:53.760
 God, that was not easy.

2:38:53.760 --> 2:38:55.400
 We wrote formal specifications.

2:38:55.400 --> 2:38:57.560
 In some cases, we formalize those specifications

2:38:57.560 --> 2:39:00.560
 with Isabelle for God's sakes, which is not easy to do.

2:39:00.560 --> 2:39:01.960
 And then we implemented it.

2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:04.280
 And it's running in production with a million users

2:39:04.280 --> 2:39:06.160
 at a $50 billion market cap.

2:39:06.160 --> 2:39:08.920
 I mean, as a whip point, do you start saying,

2:39:08.920 --> 2:39:10.640
 well, maybe there's something there?

2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:12.640
 You know, and they say, no, there's nothing there.

2:39:12.640 --> 2:39:14.240
 And it's not secure, it can't be secure.

2:39:14.240 --> 2:39:17.200
 And he said, okay, then why do you believe what you believe?

2:39:17.200 --> 2:39:19.880
 And they never come back to me with an answer, ever.

2:39:19.880 --> 2:39:22.360
 Well, I believe God didn't go through a peer review process

2:39:22.360 --> 2:39:23.560
 when you wrote the 10 Commandments.

2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:28.000
 So sometimes it works out, sometimes not.

2:39:28.000 --> 2:39:33.120
 Let me ask, on that same thread, Tesla, SpaceX, Elon Musk

2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:34.880
 currently invested in Bitcoin,

2:39:34.880 --> 2:39:37.000
 but are openly looking to explore

2:39:37.000 --> 2:39:39.560
 other cryptocurrency investments.

2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:41.880
 What case would you make for Cardano?

2:39:41.880 --> 2:39:43.840
 Well, if they truly care about alternative energy

2:39:43.840 --> 2:39:46.680
 and sustainability, you know, carbon reduction

2:39:46.680 --> 2:39:49.800
 or carbon neutrality, you can't be in a system

2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:53.000
 where there is no built in mechanism

2:39:53.000 --> 2:39:55.160
 to constrain the energy consumption.

2:39:55.160 --> 2:39:56.160
 You know, with proof of stake,

2:39:56.160 --> 2:39:58.160
 energy consumption is a negative.

2:39:58.160 --> 2:39:59.920
 You want to minimize it.

2:39:59.920 --> 2:40:01.680
 If you can get the same amount of stuff done

2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:03.720
 on a Raspberry Pi as you can a big server,

2:40:03.720 --> 2:40:05.200
 you're going to do it on the Pi,

2:40:05.200 --> 2:40:07.080
 because ultimately that server cost

2:40:07.080 --> 2:40:09.280
 and the energy cost is coming out of your budget.

2:40:09.280 --> 2:40:11.960
 With proof of work, any innovation you come up with

2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:16.240
 to optimize power, you just build more Asics,

2:40:16.240 --> 2:40:18.720
 because, you know, it's always 30% more power efficient.

2:40:18.720 --> 2:40:20.920
 Great, buy 30% more.

2:40:20.920 --> 2:40:23.840
 You keep adding to the work set

2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:25.320
 because you want more hash power,

2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:27.800
 more hash power, more share of the Pi.

2:40:27.800 --> 2:40:30.120
 So you have no energy savings component.

2:40:30.120 --> 2:40:30.960
 I know these people are saying,

2:40:30.960 --> 2:40:33.480
 well, there's a lot of wasted energy in the grid,

2:40:33.480 --> 2:40:37.240
 and this is kind of incentivizing using that wasted energy,

2:40:37.240 --> 2:40:39.400
 and it's a better way of storing it than batteries

2:40:39.400 --> 2:40:41.080
 because you're now storing it as a Bitcoin

2:40:41.080 --> 2:40:42.560
 instead of storing it as energy.

2:40:42.560 --> 2:40:44.600
 Okay, maybe there's some truth to that,

2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:47.640
 but anyway, it's just...

2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:50.800
 The energy is a critical point for you, like the...

2:40:50.800 --> 2:40:52.520
 Yeah, that's exactly right.

2:40:52.520 --> 2:40:55.680
 The energy is a critical point for me with Tesla

2:40:55.680 --> 2:40:58.880
 because they assert to be an alternative energy company.

2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:00.600
 And unless they can make the case

2:41:00.600 --> 2:41:02.240
 that somehow the proliferation of Bitcoin

2:41:02.240 --> 2:41:04.360
 is legitimately going to proliferate batteries,

2:41:04.360 --> 2:41:06.840
 solar, and wind, or other things,

2:41:06.840 --> 2:41:09.200
 then it's probably good for them to just focus

2:41:09.200 --> 2:41:13.040
 on the most efficient energy efficient cryptocurrency possible.

2:41:13.040 --> 2:41:15.160
 Otherwise, you're exacerbating global warming,

2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:18.080
 you're exacerbating the ecological consequences of it.

2:41:18.080 --> 2:41:20.280
 The other thing is Bitcoin is the least programmable

2:41:20.280 --> 2:41:21.600
 of all the cryptocurrencies.

2:41:21.600 --> 2:41:24.200
 And if you want to do interesting, sexy, unique things,

2:41:24.200 --> 2:41:26.440
 let's say Tesla, for example,

2:41:26.440 --> 2:41:30.800
 they want to start doing VDI and V2V for autonomous vehicles

2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:32.400
 and have the vehicles start talking to each other

2:41:32.400 --> 2:41:33.800
 and connected to 5G,

2:41:33.800 --> 2:41:35.720
 well, imagine if you wanted to build a telco coin

2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:37.560
 or some sort of 5G coin,

2:41:37.560 --> 2:41:40.280
 and you want to build an IoT layer and network,

2:41:40.280 --> 2:41:42.760
 there's just no real way to do that on Bitcoin

2:41:42.760 --> 2:41:44.080
 with the way it's designed.

2:41:44.080 --> 2:41:46.400
 So you'd need fundamentally different infrastructure

2:41:46.400 --> 2:41:49.400
 to create such a token and regulate such a system

2:41:49.400 --> 2:41:51.960
 and have these things autonomously negotiating

2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:52.880
 and do business with each other.

2:41:52.880 --> 2:41:54.800
 You need DEXs and stable coins

2:41:54.800 --> 2:41:56.280
 and all kinds of mechanics

2:41:56.280 --> 2:41:58.280
 to make something like that possible.

2:41:58.280 --> 2:42:00.120
 Well, that's really beneficial to Tesla

2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:01.520
 if they could figure that out

2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:03.440
 because they could create like an information sharing

2:42:03.440 --> 2:42:05.560
 incentive scheme where if the cars talk to each other,

2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:08.800
 including other branded cars like GM cars and Fords,

2:42:08.800 --> 2:42:10.840
 they can now actually get data from those cars

2:42:10.840 --> 2:42:12.440
 through a marketplace in exchange

2:42:12.440 --> 2:42:14.320
 for the benefit of autonomous driving

2:42:14.320 --> 2:42:16.280
 or for the benefit of understanding road conditions

2:42:16.280 --> 2:42:18.120
 or safety enhancement and so forth.

2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:19.160
 So it's just depending.

2:42:19.160 --> 2:42:20.520
 Are you just here to speculate?

2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:23.560
 Are you here to actually use another medium of exchange

2:42:23.560 --> 2:42:25.440
 or do you actually want to build infrastructure

2:42:25.440 --> 2:42:26.320
 on this thing?

2:42:26.320 --> 2:42:28.960
 The more closely you get to utility,

2:42:28.960 --> 2:42:31.240
 the further down the road you get there,

2:42:31.240 --> 2:42:33.680
 then the more programmability you need.

2:42:33.680 --> 2:42:35.120
 And so it makes a lot more sense

2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:37.240
 to be an Ethereum fan or a Cardano fan

2:42:37.240 --> 2:42:38.880
 than to be a Bitcoin fan.

2:42:38.880 --> 2:42:40.760
 So to be both proof of stake

2:42:40.760 --> 2:42:42.680
 and have the smart contracts capabilities.

2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:43.960
 Yes.

2:42:43.960 --> 2:42:45.280
 And that's why we went over Ethereum

2:42:45.280 --> 2:42:46.720
 because they're proof of work.

2:42:47.800 --> 2:42:49.000
 You mentioned God.

2:42:49.000 --> 2:42:51.000
 God spelled backwards as dog.

2:42:52.240 --> 2:42:53.920
 How's that for a transition?

2:42:55.680 --> 2:43:00.680
 And Elon Musk and Tesla are at least a little bit curious

2:43:01.080 --> 2:43:04.440
 about a coin called Dogecoin.

2:43:04.440 --> 2:43:06.360
 You made a video directed to Elon

2:43:06.360 --> 2:43:08.400
 on how to improve Dogecoin.

2:43:08.400 --> 2:43:11.960
 What are your ideas for making Dogecoin

2:43:11.960 --> 2:43:14.040
 even better than it already is?

2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:17.120
 Well, Dogecoin is just based,

2:43:17.120 --> 2:43:18.520
 it's like that nine inch nail song,

2:43:18.520 --> 2:43:20.120
 a copy of a copy of a copy.

2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:21.520
 Yeah, it's just a copy of a copy.

2:43:21.520 --> 2:43:25.080
 It's a Bitcoin gave Litecoin, Litecoin gave Dogecoin.

2:43:25.080 --> 2:43:26.840
 And it was kind of a parody cryptocurrency.

2:43:26.840 --> 2:43:28.560
 And I think Jackson was trying to do it

2:43:28.560 --> 2:43:30.400
 to like prove a point about altcoins.

2:43:30.400 --> 2:43:33.520
 And then true to form, it's like nobody got the doctrine

2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:35.480
 and completely perverted the entire religion.

2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:37.880
 It's almost like the emperor of man in Warhammer 40K,

2:43:37.880 --> 2:43:39.640
 who's like this atheist, don't worship me.

2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:41.200
 And now there's like this whole religion

2:43:41.200 --> 2:43:42.720
 built around the emperor.

2:43:42.720 --> 2:43:44.920
 So Dogecoin has become a thing

2:43:44.920 --> 2:43:46.640
 and it's become such a large thing

2:43:46.640 --> 2:43:49.120
 that it is a reasonable target for somebody

2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:50.400
 to fix it up and repair it,

2:43:50.400 --> 2:43:52.520
 make it an interesting cryptocurrency.

2:43:52.520 --> 2:43:54.400
 The point of the video was to show

2:43:54.400 --> 2:43:56.480
 what a modern third generation cryptocurrency

2:43:56.480 --> 2:43:57.760
 really would require.

2:43:57.760 --> 2:43:58.960
 It's a major overhaul.

2:43:58.960 --> 2:44:01.080
 And there are already people doing this.

2:44:01.080 --> 2:44:03.320
 There's the Solanas and the Harmony Ones

2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:05.560
 and the Cardanos, Neosis and all these other guys.

2:44:05.560 --> 2:44:06.760
 And they have billions of dollars

2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:10.000
 and huge dev teams and all these innovative protocols.

2:44:10.000 --> 2:44:12.760
 If you're really serious about this thing sticking around,

2:44:12.760 --> 2:44:15.240
 being useful in doing stuff,

2:44:15.240 --> 2:44:16.800
 then the point of the video was to show

2:44:16.800 --> 2:44:18.800
 the types of things you'd have to think about

2:44:18.800 --> 2:44:21.360
 and the types of papers that are all open source,

2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:23.680
 patent free and don't have any notion

2:44:23.680 --> 2:44:25.080
 of intellectual property behind them,

2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:28.080
 that his engineers could grab and go and do.

2:44:28.080 --> 2:44:30.520
 And he did mention on Twitter that he was looking

2:44:30.520 --> 2:44:32.600
 for feedback on how to improve Doge.

2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:33.760
 And so I said, all right, well,

2:44:33.760 --> 2:44:35.480
 I'll just put all these things together.

2:44:35.480 --> 2:44:36.640
 It was a little tongue in cheek

2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:38.640
 because I figured he'd ignore it.

2:44:38.640 --> 2:44:41.200
 But it was also showing how hard it is

2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:43.120
 to innovate in this tire space.

2:44:43.120 --> 2:44:44.320
 You don't just go and say,

2:44:44.320 --> 2:44:47.200
 I'm gonna go build a battery powered car or rocket

2:44:47.200 --> 2:44:48.440
 or enter a new industry.

2:44:48.440 --> 2:44:49.960
 It's really hard to do that.

2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:52.160
 You spend years and lots of effort.

2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:54.480
 You have to do series of small learning steps.

2:44:54.480 --> 2:44:56.360
 You have to pick up destroyed rockets

2:44:56.360 --> 2:44:58.160
 on the side of the beach and things like that

2:44:58.160 --> 2:45:00.840
 before you get to the rocket landing itself.

2:45:00.840 --> 2:45:02.600
 Well, analogously, it's really hard

2:45:02.600 --> 2:45:04.280
 to build a cryptocurrency.

2:45:04.280 --> 2:45:08.400
 The Satoshi probably spent years thinking carefully

2:45:08.400 --> 2:45:11.400
 and that work was a derivative of 30 years of work

2:45:11.400 --> 2:45:13.880
 in the digital assets space starting the 1980s,

2:45:13.880 --> 2:45:15.360
 working its way through.

2:45:15.360 --> 2:45:18.480
 So, and then Bitcoin only did very limited things

2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:20.040
 relative to what Ethereum can do

2:45:20.040 --> 2:45:22.080
 or Cardano can do and so forth.

2:45:22.080 --> 2:45:24.400
 So the minute that you extend that complexity,

2:45:24.400 --> 2:45:26.120
 you're talking about years of R&D,

2:45:26.120 --> 2:45:28.640
 years of engineering effort that needs to be done.

2:45:28.640 --> 2:45:30.120
 So what's the point of Doge?

2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:32.160
 Is it just a meme?

2:45:32.160 --> 2:45:34.440
 Is it actually contending to be useful?

2:45:34.440 --> 2:45:37.800
 Or is it competing as a store value against Bitcoin?

2:45:37.800 --> 2:45:39.760
 Now, if it's competing as a store value against Bitcoin,

2:45:39.760 --> 2:45:42.720
 why the hell does it have the monetary policy it does?

2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:44.480
 Also, there's predatory distribution

2:45:44.480 --> 2:45:47.200
 of the underlying asset and over 90 some percent

2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:49.480
 is consolidated less than 1% of the holders.

2:45:49.480 --> 2:45:50.320
 For Dogecoin.

2:45:50.320 --> 2:45:52.800
 For Dogecoin at a very, very low price point.

2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:55.000
 So they can sell at almost any price point

2:45:55.000 --> 2:45:56.320
 and make a profit.

2:45:56.320 --> 2:45:59.120
 So, it hits 50 cents there, they're billionaires

2:45:59.120 --> 2:46:02.600
 and it's not like 20,000 people,

2:46:02.600 --> 2:46:04.360
 it's probably less than 100 wallets

2:46:04.360 --> 2:46:05.760
 that have that distribution.

2:46:05.760 --> 2:46:07.840
 So there's this existential ticking time bomb

2:46:07.840 --> 2:46:10.480
 that's in Doge that once the guys who are vested

2:46:10.480 --> 2:46:12.560
 start selling, they can just keep selling

2:46:12.560 --> 2:46:14.320
 and keep selling and ride it all the way down

2:46:14.320 --> 2:46:15.880
 and make windfall profits regardless

2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:16.800
 of what price they sell down.

2:46:16.800 --> 2:46:18.080
 And who are they selling against?

2:46:18.080 --> 2:46:19.240
 The retail investors.

2:46:20.680 --> 2:46:23.920
 People make $500, spare money a month

2:46:23.920 --> 2:46:25.080
 or something like that.

2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:27.560
 And it bothers me because I see it in my community.

2:46:27.560 --> 2:46:29.840
 So I live in Longmont, now in Colorado.

2:46:29.840 --> 2:46:32.680
 And I was at a restaurant and I was talking to the waitress

2:46:32.680 --> 2:46:34.200
 and she asked me what business those are.

2:46:34.200 --> 2:46:35.760
 And I said, I'm in the cryptocurrency space.

2:46:35.760 --> 2:46:36.760
 And she's like, what is that?

2:46:36.760 --> 2:46:37.840
 And I started explaining all of it.

2:46:37.840 --> 2:46:41.280
 And she goes, oh, yeah, I own some Dogecoin.

2:46:41.280 --> 2:46:42.560
 I said, do you want anything else?

2:46:42.560 --> 2:46:43.800
 No, no, I just bought some Dogecoin.

2:46:43.800 --> 2:46:44.720
 Why did you buy Dogecoin?

2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:46.920
 Oh, I saw Elon tweeting about it

2:46:46.920 --> 2:46:48.960
 and I thought it was a good deal.

2:46:48.960 --> 2:46:50.520
 So when you see stuff like that

2:46:50.520 --> 2:46:52.480
 where people have no clue what they're doing,

2:46:52.480 --> 2:46:55.000
 they don't really understand the supply dynamics,

2:46:55.000 --> 2:46:57.360
 the ownership dynamics and these types of things.

2:46:57.360 --> 2:47:00.240
 And then when the clock stops,

2:47:00.240 --> 2:47:02.000
 they're the ones who get hurt.

2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:03.240
 And then the regulator comes in,

2:47:03.240 --> 2:47:04.680
 the Elizabeth Warrens of the world.

2:47:04.680 --> 2:47:06.600
 And they say, see, this is an evidence.

2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:08.360
 These guys can't regulate themselves,

2:47:08.360 --> 2:47:09.200
 control themselves.

2:47:09.200 --> 2:47:10.880
 We need to control everything.

2:47:10.880 --> 2:47:13.040
 Either let's ban it or let's just announce

2:47:13.040 --> 2:47:14.560
 that the only three are legitimate

2:47:14.560 --> 2:47:17.440
 and every one of them has to be connected to identity

2:47:17.440 --> 2:47:18.760
 and rah, rah, rah.

2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:22.200
 And I'm just very concerned that that's a bad thing to do.

2:47:22.200 --> 2:47:24.880
 And that's why I've been so vocal about this topic.

2:47:24.880 --> 2:47:27.720
 And my hope is that a compromise can be made

2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:29.280
 where real developers come in

2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:30.560
 and they start working on Doge

2:47:30.560 --> 2:47:31.520
 and they find a way to create

2:47:31.520 --> 2:47:33.440
 some sort of use and utility for it.

2:47:33.440 --> 2:47:37.280
 So at least it has a value floor and won't collapse.

2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:39.160
 Is it possible for Cardano and Doge

2:47:39.160 --> 2:47:40.720
 going to work together somehow?

2:47:40.720 --> 2:47:42.720
 Yeah, it'd be a lot of fun.

2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:45.680
 I'm not adverse to the idea of cleaning up the code base

2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:47.960
 but legitimately whoever comes in

2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:50.520
 be two years or three years of work.

2:47:50.520 --> 2:47:51.880
 Cause you have to do real stuff.

2:47:51.880 --> 2:47:56.800
 And that code is like Litecoin circa 2012, 2013.

2:47:56.800 --> 2:47:58.600
 Well, the interesting thing about Elon

2:47:58.600 --> 2:48:00.440
 and I've got to interact with him quite a bit.

2:48:00.440 --> 2:48:04.640
 That combination of humor and extreme ambition

2:48:04.640 --> 2:48:06.600
 like in the face of impossible odds

2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:08.440
 is something he does really well.

2:48:08.440 --> 2:48:12.280
 And so I think that's the spirit of Dogecoin

2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:17.280
 is fun and almost like bold, ambitious innovation.

2:48:17.280 --> 2:48:21.000
 And so I think you can't discount the power of that.

2:48:21.000 --> 2:48:22.160
 But where's the innovation?

2:48:22.160 --> 2:48:23.000
 What's the agenda?

2:48:23.000 --> 2:48:24.120
 Well, this is step one.

2:48:24.120 --> 2:48:26.400
 What's going to Mars for Dogecoin?

2:48:26.400 --> 2:48:30.200
 Well, I mean, he came in the same way to, to raucous.

2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:33.400
 He came in the same way to, to electric cars.

2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:36.080
 It was seemed impossible at first,

2:48:36.080 --> 2:48:38.400
 but you step in and you solve the problems

2:48:38.400 --> 2:48:40.360
 first principles one at a time.

2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:42.640
 But I'll challenge you a little bit on this

2:48:42.640 --> 2:48:44.400
 because I think he had some trends though

2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:46.080
 that he was very smart to recognize

2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:47.400
 in the case of battery powered cars.

2:48:47.400 --> 2:48:49.800
 He said, hang on, everybody has tablets and cell phones

2:48:49.800 --> 2:48:50.640
 and these other things.

2:48:50.640 --> 2:48:52.960
 And there's an incentive to make batteries

2:48:52.960 --> 2:48:55.480
 better, faster, cheaper and charge faster.

2:48:55.480 --> 2:48:57.080
 And that's connected to mobile computing.

2:48:57.080 --> 2:49:00.320
 So regardless if you want battery powered cars or not,

2:49:00.320 --> 2:49:03.040
 every year you have billions of dollars of R&D

2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:06.480
 being pushed to force this capacity to evolve.

2:49:06.480 --> 2:49:07.920
 And he's just getting on the train

2:49:07.920 --> 2:49:09.480
 and piggybacking on that.

2:49:09.480 --> 2:49:12.120
 So that was a brilliant business acumen to recognize that.

2:49:12.120 --> 2:49:14.720
 In the case of SpaceX, it was just an obvious question.

2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:16.600
 If every time you get on a plane,

2:49:16.600 --> 2:49:19.400
 you have to throw the plane away and no one would fly.

2:49:19.400 --> 2:49:22.440
 So reusability is like a fundamental thing

2:49:22.440 --> 2:49:25.280
 that if you solve that, you've now opened space up

2:49:25.280 --> 2:49:27.960
 to a complete new class of commercialization.

2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:29.960
 I don't see the problem in Dogecoin

2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:31.200
 because if he was looking for it,

2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:33.120
 then why not look at a real platform

2:49:33.120 --> 2:49:35.320
 actually trying to solve a real problem?

2:49:35.320 --> 2:49:36.360
 There's so many of them.

2:49:36.360 --> 2:49:39.720
 He has, he throw a rock, he can hit 15 of these guys

2:49:39.720 --> 2:49:42.160
 and they'd all die to work with Elon Musk.

2:49:42.160 --> 2:49:43.200
 Yeah, that's very interesting.

2:49:43.200 --> 2:49:45.960
 I mean, so first I could continue pushing back

2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:49.160
 on your intuition about electric cars and batteries

2:49:49.160 --> 2:49:50.000
 and so on.

2:49:50.000 --> 2:49:52.000
 I don't think it's more obvious in retrospect

2:49:52.000 --> 2:49:55.160
 than it is at the time, I would say.

2:49:55.160 --> 2:49:57.520
 Because I would agree with you on the batteries front.

2:49:57.520 --> 2:50:00.040
 I wouldn't necessarily agree with you with the electric car

2:50:00.040 --> 2:50:03.120
 because first of all, nobody started a successful car company

2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:04.240
 for decades.

2:50:04.240 --> 2:50:05.600
 Well, but it was the loyalty.

2:50:05.600 --> 2:50:08.480
 The EV4 guys or whatever it was with GM,

2:50:08.480 --> 2:50:09.840
 they didn't want to give them back

2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:11.600
 when they had the lease program.

2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:13.480
 So there's some basic intuition

2:50:13.480 --> 2:50:14.880
 that there is some hunger here,

2:50:14.880 --> 2:50:17.160
 but it's not obvious that you can do it successfully.

2:50:17.160 --> 2:50:19.720
 And with relaunching rockets for cheap,

2:50:19.720 --> 2:50:22.760
 that sounds good on paper, but to do it well,

2:50:22.760 --> 2:50:25.320
 NASA is spending way more money for this.

2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:28.360
 And the Russians were assholes,

2:50:28.360 --> 2:50:29.480
 not selling any rockets.

2:50:29.480 --> 2:50:31.480
 Like, so you have to do it all yourself from scratch.

2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:33.080
 How do you build the team?

2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:36.560
 How do you launch rockets when,

2:50:36.560 --> 2:50:39.440
 if you fail a few times, you're gonna go bankrupt?

2:50:39.440 --> 2:50:41.000
 I mean, it's just business wise,

2:50:41.000 --> 2:50:43.120
 I would rather build an app, like Angry Birds.

2:50:43.120 --> 2:50:44.440
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2:50:44.440 --> 2:50:45.280
 There's launch rockets.

2:50:45.280 --> 2:50:46.120
 You gotta give him credit.

2:50:46.120 --> 2:50:47.520
 He's got boulders for balls.

2:50:49.520 --> 2:50:50.840
 That's a good picture.

2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:52.160
 Yeah, thank you for that.

2:50:52.160 --> 2:50:54.600
 But I don't, maybe that's what, I mean,

2:50:56.920 --> 2:50:59.480
 I think there's not enough first principle thinking

2:50:59.480 --> 2:51:00.720
 on the cryptocurrency side.

2:51:00.720 --> 2:51:02.480
 I think I agree with you on that.

2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:06.320
 But there's some aspect to which the seriousness

2:51:06.320 --> 2:51:09.640
 of the cryptocurrency world is paralyzing.

2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:14.360
 So in some way, the innovation that you spoke to

2:51:14.360 --> 2:51:16.600
 requires taking risks,

2:51:16.600 --> 2:51:19.000
 requires not taking everything so seriously,

2:51:19.000 --> 2:51:21.200
 like being afraid to take those bold risks

2:51:21.200 --> 2:51:24.080
 in the space of ideas, not in the space of financials.

2:51:24.080 --> 2:51:29.080
 So in that way, I think that's one pro for Bitcoin,

2:51:29.880 --> 2:51:33.720
 is there's room, it's hungry for innovation.

2:51:33.720 --> 2:51:35.600
 But I think Cardano in that same way is hungry

2:51:35.600 --> 2:51:37.680
 for innovation, just like you said,

2:51:37.680 --> 2:51:41.640
 with some more rigor and formalism behind it.

2:51:41.640 --> 2:51:44.960
 And even Ethereum has a hunger for innovation.

2:51:44.960 --> 2:51:47.800
 That's where Bitcoin is a little bit more,

2:51:47.800 --> 2:51:50.040
 I would say conservative in terms of how much innovating

2:51:50.040 --> 2:51:51.640
 they're willing to do,

2:51:51.640 --> 2:51:54.240
 in terms of the incentives they built into the systems

2:51:54.240 --> 2:51:57.160
 for the evolution of the cryptocurrency.

2:51:57.160 --> 2:52:00.720
 But yeah, I mean, it's difficult to psychoanalyze

2:52:00.720 --> 2:52:04.760
 why Dogecoin is the thing that excites Elon so much.

2:52:04.760 --> 2:52:09.200
 But at the same time, there's some power to the fun.

2:52:09.200 --> 2:52:11.360
 It sounds ridiculous to say,

2:52:11.360 --> 2:52:16.360
 but the fun, this idea that the most entertaining outcome

2:52:18.560 --> 2:52:22.920
 was the most likely, there could be something built

2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:25.760
 into the physics of the universe that makes that true.

2:52:25.760 --> 2:52:30.760
 Because the viral nature of fun has power.

2:52:30.760 --> 2:52:34.400
 A fun has power.

2:52:34.400 --> 2:52:36.000
 Well, it's a neural science thing.

2:52:36.000 --> 2:52:40.720
 We like dopamine, we like these chemicals in our brain.

2:52:40.720 --> 2:52:43.360
 And when we have fun, we want more of it.

2:52:43.360 --> 2:52:46.080
 So you tend to gravitate towards work activities

2:52:46.080 --> 2:52:48.720
 and play activities that are enjoyable to you.

2:52:48.720 --> 2:52:52.400
 And it is nice sometimes to kind of come in

2:52:52.400 --> 2:52:54.120
 and troll an entire industry.

2:52:54.120 --> 2:52:54.960
 Yeah.

2:52:54.960 --> 2:52:57.000
 And I can imagine he's probably at the time of his life.

2:52:57.000 --> 2:53:00.840
 It's the same as like taking Tesla private at 420,

2:53:00.840 --> 2:53:01.840
 that kind of stuff.

2:53:01.840 --> 2:53:04.680
 And it's one thing when you do it with friends,

2:53:04.680 --> 2:53:06.360
 it's another thing when you do with the whole industry

2:53:06.360 --> 2:53:09.080
 and it hurts people financially.

2:53:09.080 --> 2:53:11.520
 And also I understand he hates short sellers

2:53:11.520 --> 2:53:12.960
 and there's some things there.

2:53:12.960 --> 2:53:14.320
 And I can't speak for him

2:53:14.320 --> 2:53:16.360
 because I only know the guy from a distance.

2:53:16.360 --> 2:53:18.240
 It's just I live in this space

2:53:18.240 --> 2:53:19.800
 and I have to deal with the consequences

2:53:19.800 --> 2:53:20.640
 and clean up the mess of the company.

2:53:20.640 --> 2:53:21.840
 You feel the pain.

2:53:21.840 --> 2:53:24.360
 Yeah, and this results in a regulatory event.

2:53:24.360 --> 2:53:26.200
 It's like, I'm the guy who has to put on a suit

2:53:26.200 --> 2:53:28.840
 and go to Washington and go and sit in a Senate in Korea

2:53:28.840 --> 2:53:29.680
 and all this stuff.

2:53:29.680 --> 2:53:30.800
 And he's the guy that, you know,

2:53:30.800 --> 2:53:32.440
 just like laugh with his friends

2:53:32.440 --> 2:53:33.960
 about how he crashed the crypto market

2:53:33.960 --> 2:53:36.160
 and how easy it was to do it.

2:53:36.160 --> 2:53:39.360
 And that's my only umbridge about this.

2:53:39.360 --> 2:53:40.200
 On the other hand, you know,

2:53:40.200 --> 2:53:42.440
 if it brings a lot of cool new interesting things

2:53:42.440 --> 2:53:44.760
 and people into the space, that's a net positive.

2:53:44.760 --> 2:53:46.560
 And so, you know, it's not university bad

2:53:46.560 --> 2:53:47.600
 or universally good.

2:53:47.600 --> 2:53:50.440
 And I'd like to give people the benefit of the doubt.

2:53:50.440 --> 2:53:52.680
 And so I'm really hopeful to see

2:53:52.680 --> 2:53:55.320
 what comes about this recent surge of interest.

2:53:55.320 --> 2:53:57.680
 And if Elon actually puts his money where his mouth is

2:53:57.680 --> 2:54:00.800
 and takes some of his enormous engineering talent

2:54:00.800 --> 2:54:03.400
 and, you know, capital and starts contributing

2:54:03.400 --> 2:54:05.960
 and building something in the cryptocurrency space.

2:54:05.960 --> 2:54:07.720
 Be really cool to see that happen.

2:54:08.880 --> 2:54:11.240
 There's a bunch of different technical aspects

2:54:11.240 --> 2:54:13.400
 I want to ask you about on the Cardano side.

2:54:13.400 --> 2:54:17.040
 So first maybe on the scaling side, what is Hydra?

2:54:17.040 --> 2:54:20.440
 How does Hydra compare to other different ideas

2:54:20.440 --> 2:54:22.680
 for scalability like rollups?

2:54:22.680 --> 2:54:26.120
 Main trade offs with respect to security, UX

2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:31.240
 and anything else you want to talk about.

2:54:31.240 --> 2:54:33.400
 You have to have a little bit more energy Lex, come on.

2:54:33.400 --> 2:54:34.760
 You know what I need?

2:54:34.760 --> 2:54:36.600
 I need that Coke machine that you mentioned,

2:54:36.600 --> 2:54:38.560
 the thing that converts water to cocaine.

2:54:38.560 --> 2:54:40.280
 Water to be cocaine from director Bullock.

2:54:41.440 --> 2:54:43.200
 We'll leave this said, right?

2:54:43.200 --> 2:54:44.240
 Yeah.

2:54:44.240 --> 2:54:47.680
 Isomorphic state channels, that's a great topic, right?

2:54:47.680 --> 2:54:51.080
 There's words salad of cryptographic terms.

2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:53.560
 Whether lightning, Hydra, rollups, any of these things.

2:54:53.560 --> 2:54:56.120
 Really what you're trying to do is say, okay,

2:54:56.120 --> 2:54:58.920
 if I do it on layer one, it's slow and expensive.

2:54:58.920 --> 2:55:02.160
 What I'm going to do is batch something somehow, some way

2:55:02.160 --> 2:55:04.280
 and then do it in a different system

2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:07.240
 where it's fast and cheap.

2:55:07.240 --> 2:55:09.760
 And what I'm doing with that is I'm losing some

2:55:09.760 --> 2:55:12.640
 of the security guarantees of the base layer

2:55:12.640 --> 2:55:15.240
 and admitting a slight higher degree of this,

2:55:15.240 --> 2:55:20.240
 of centralization, but then I get super fast settlement.

2:55:20.240 --> 2:55:22.520
 I get super low cost transactions.

2:55:22.520 --> 2:55:24.600
 And potentially I may even be able

2:55:24.600 --> 2:55:26.560
 to get distributed computing.

2:55:26.560 --> 2:55:29.360
 Meaning that instead of having the smart contracts run

2:55:29.360 --> 2:55:31.760
 in a replicated system, they can run on a single node

2:55:31.760 --> 2:55:34.600
 like a stake pool and their stuff is different

2:55:34.600 --> 2:55:35.880
 from the other guy's stuff.

2:55:35.880 --> 2:55:40.520
 So you go from a system of capacity of whatever it is

2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:44.080
 to a system of N for the totality of all the stake pools.

2:55:44.080 --> 2:55:48.160
 So basically Hydra is just the next generation of that.

2:55:48.160 --> 2:55:51.200
 When you have the ability to tinker with the accounting model

2:55:51.200 --> 2:55:54.360
 and the layer two solution is co designed

2:55:54.360 --> 2:55:55.600
 with the layer one solution.

2:55:55.600 --> 2:55:57.760
 So it's like what lightning would have been

2:55:57.760 --> 2:56:00.800
 had lightning been co developed when Bitcoin came out.

2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:02.560
 There would have been special provisions made

2:56:02.560 --> 2:56:05.480
 in Bitcoin specifically to accommodate lightning.

2:56:05.480 --> 2:56:07.200
 And it would have made it very easy for you then

2:56:07.200 --> 2:56:09.440
 to move inside the system, outside of the system

2:56:09.440 --> 2:56:12.080
 and have security properties preserved

2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:13.880
 like availability, for example,

2:56:13.880 --> 2:56:16.960
 or fraud resistance say, oh, you can't steal the money

2:56:16.960 --> 2:56:18.280
 or these types of things.

2:56:18.280 --> 2:56:19.760
 Where things get really complex

2:56:19.760 --> 2:56:22.440
 and this is why Hydra's novel over lightning

2:56:22.440 --> 2:56:25.640
 is when you wanna move beyond payments to state management.

2:56:25.640 --> 2:56:26.880
 Okay, so payments are just,

2:56:26.880 --> 2:56:28.440
 I wanna move between Alice to Bob

2:56:28.440 --> 2:56:31.080
 as quickly as possible as low cost as possible.

2:56:31.080 --> 2:56:34.240
 So for example, I have a micro tipping application

2:56:34.240 --> 2:56:37.160
 like change tip on Twitter or like a video

2:56:37.160 --> 2:56:38.160
 I'm watching YouTube video

2:56:38.160 --> 2:56:39.720
 like maybe this video in the future

2:56:39.720 --> 2:56:41.320
 and people really like it and they click tip

2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:43.480
 and you get five cents or something like that.

2:56:43.480 --> 2:56:46.600
 Okay, so that's an example of a perfect payment application.

2:56:46.600 --> 2:56:47.960
 And that's great.

2:56:47.960 --> 2:56:49.320
 But what happens when you actually have

2:56:49.320 --> 2:56:51.440
 a rich smart contract like a DEX

2:56:51.440 --> 2:56:54.120
 or you wanna do a video game or something like that.

2:56:54.120 --> 2:56:55.640
 You wanna run that off chain

2:56:55.640 --> 2:56:59.080
 but then there's some reconciliation on chain that happens.

2:56:59.080 --> 2:57:01.840
 So a state channel basically lets you do that

2:57:01.840 --> 2:57:04.000
 but it's a lot more complicated

2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:05.680
 and there's a lot more to think about.

2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:09.040
 So Hydra basically just has in its design

2:57:09.040 --> 2:57:11.520
 a collection of ideas of how to do that.

2:57:11.520 --> 2:57:15.160
 And the current paper is for a single head.

2:57:15.160 --> 2:57:17.320
 The next thing you do is composition.

2:57:17.320 --> 2:57:18.880
 And so you go multiple heads

2:57:18.880 --> 2:57:20.880
 and there's a routing protocol between them.

2:57:20.880 --> 2:57:22.600
 And then eventually create these tail protocols

2:57:22.600 --> 2:57:24.240
 for when things get asynchronous.

2:57:24.240 --> 2:57:25.800
 So instead of always being aligned

2:57:25.800 --> 2:57:26.800
 and always being available,

2:57:26.800 --> 2:57:28.720
 what happens if they die for a bit

2:57:28.720 --> 2:57:30.000
 and then they come back?

2:57:30.000 --> 2:57:31.880
 And you can create all kinds of guarantees

2:57:31.880 --> 2:57:34.480
 that your funds won't be lost or locked forever

2:57:34.480 --> 2:57:35.320
 or things like that.

2:57:35.320 --> 2:57:37.720
 There's a failure recovery mode for this type of stuff.

2:57:37.720 --> 2:57:39.960
 And basically the idea is leverage

2:57:39.960 --> 2:57:42.200
 what lightning is already achieved with Bitcoin

2:57:42.200 --> 2:57:44.680
 but then take advantage of the fact

2:57:44.680 --> 2:57:46.920
 that you have a more expressive accounting model

2:57:46.920 --> 2:57:48.720
 and a more expressive programming model.

2:57:48.720 --> 2:57:50.160
 So you can just physically do more

2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:52.240
 and you can put more crypto and type that thing.

2:57:52.240 --> 2:57:55.240
 Now contrast it with rollups, really that is the thing.

2:57:55.240 --> 2:57:56.640
 You're gonna take some thing,

2:57:56.640 --> 2:57:58.400
 batch a bunch of transactions together

2:57:58.400 --> 2:58:00.040
 and you're gonna generate a proof.

2:58:00.040 --> 2:58:02.680
 And then what you can do is whenever you see some part

2:58:02.680 --> 2:58:04.840
 of that history, you can check it against that proof

2:58:04.840 --> 2:58:05.840
 that's rolled up.

2:58:05.840 --> 2:58:08.680
 And they're closely related concept of recursive snarks

2:58:08.680 --> 2:58:09.520
 that you'll see a lot.

2:58:09.520 --> 2:58:11.680
 There's things like the MENA protocol or other things.

2:58:11.680 --> 2:58:14.600
 And basically the idea is that whenever you see something,

2:58:14.600 --> 2:58:16.840
 you can always generate two proofs,

2:58:16.840 --> 2:58:19.440
 an existential proofs that the coins exist

2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:21.840
 and a non existence of a double spend.

2:58:21.840 --> 2:58:23.560
 So you can always check those two properties

2:58:23.560 --> 2:58:27.040
 and the proof is verifiable and logarithmic time ideally.

2:58:27.040 --> 2:58:29.320
 So you can have giant amounts of data

2:58:29.320 --> 2:58:33.160
 but it's very small, the actual proof is concise, okay?

2:58:33.160 --> 2:58:35.720
 So they're just different boats for different floats.

2:58:35.720 --> 2:58:38.600
 The advantage of a layer two network

2:58:38.600 --> 2:58:41.000
 where there's actual channels and there's interaction

2:58:41.000 --> 2:58:43.280
 and there's service providers is the channels

2:58:43.280 --> 2:58:45.720
 can eventually scale in the collection of things

2:58:45.720 --> 2:58:47.920
 that they can do and eventually they can become

2:58:47.920 --> 2:58:51.360
 interoperability networks between cryptocurrencies.

2:58:51.360 --> 2:58:53.920
 So at some point we could modify the bolt spec

2:58:53.920 --> 2:58:56.360
 and make it somewhat interoperable with Hydra.

2:58:56.360 --> 2:58:57.840
 And then what you could happen is you could use it

2:58:57.840 --> 2:59:00.080
 as a bridge to actually do cross chain traffic

2:59:00.080 --> 2:59:02.480
 and send transactions between the systems.

2:59:02.480 --> 2:59:03.880
 You don't really think about that too much

2:59:03.880 --> 2:59:04.920
 when you're talking about rollups.

2:59:04.920 --> 2:59:07.480
 That's more of optimizing what you have within the system.

2:59:07.480 --> 2:59:08.320
 Within the chain.

2:59:08.320 --> 2:59:10.640
 So can you elaborate how it's possible

2:59:10.640 --> 2:59:12.880
 to cross chain traffic?

2:59:12.880 --> 2:59:14.120
 Well, you already have the intermediary,

2:59:14.120 --> 2:59:15.560
 you have the channel operator

2:59:15.560 --> 2:59:18.760
 and you already have lightning protocol, right?

2:59:18.760 --> 2:59:21.720
 And you just build a dex that runs within that system

2:59:21.720 --> 2:59:24.320
 and they can swap assets or you can do wrapped assets.

2:59:24.320 --> 2:59:25.160
 So you lock it.

2:59:25.160 --> 2:59:26.280
 It would be like low cost.

2:59:26.280 --> 2:59:28.080
 I guess you could just switch low.

2:59:28.080 --> 2:59:30.080
 Yeah, the same thing lets you batch things on one,

2:59:30.080 --> 2:59:31.040
 will let you batch the other.

2:59:31.040 --> 2:59:32.480
 So if lightning works on Bitcoin

2:59:32.480 --> 2:59:34.120
 and Hydra works on Cardano,

2:59:34.120 --> 2:59:35.880
 you can eventually bridge these two together

2:59:35.880 --> 2:59:37.800
 and create a way of moving back and forth.

2:59:37.800 --> 2:59:39.400
 And the same things that make transactions

2:59:39.400 --> 2:59:40.640
 in and out of that network cheap,

2:59:40.640 --> 2:59:43.240
 will make creating wrapped assets cheap,

2:59:43.240 --> 2:59:45.560
 at least on the Bitcoin to Cardano side.

2:59:45.560 --> 2:59:47.400
 You can't create assets on Bitcoin.

2:59:47.400 --> 2:59:49.880
 Another flaw of Bitcoin that they've never fixed.

2:59:49.880 --> 2:59:52.080
 What's your thought about layer two technologies

2:59:52.080 --> 2:59:52.920
 in general?

2:59:52.920 --> 2:59:53.880
 Is there stuff you're excited about?

2:59:53.880 --> 2:59:57.120
 We talked quite a bit about lightning network, Hydra.

2:59:57.120 --> 2:59:59.040
 These ideas, do you think there'll be somebody

2:59:59.040 --> 3:00:01.760
 that wins out or is this gonna be this kind of dynamic thing

3:00:01.760 --> 3:00:03.800
 that we just keep building different ideas

3:00:03.800 --> 3:00:05.560
 and they all interact with each other?

3:00:05.560 --> 3:00:08.440
 It goes back to biology, that cell differentiation concept.

3:00:08.440 --> 3:00:11.440
 You have to build specialized tissue to do things.

3:00:11.440 --> 3:00:13.520
 The point of layer two is to extend the network.

3:00:13.520 --> 3:00:15.320
 It's adding a foot, it's adding an arm,

3:00:15.320 --> 3:00:18.200
 it's adding a brain, it's adding a heart, it's adding eyes.

3:00:18.200 --> 3:00:20.360
 Giving you additional senses, you have years now.

3:00:20.360 --> 3:00:21.920
 So when you add these layer two products,

3:00:21.920 --> 3:00:23.960
 like a Tala Prism is a perfect example of that.

3:00:23.960 --> 3:00:27.240
 We don't have identity at the base layer of Cardano.

3:00:27.240 --> 3:00:29.440
 It's a real bad deal to do that.

3:00:29.440 --> 3:00:31.720
 Because China will come in or US will come in

3:00:31.720 --> 3:00:32.800
 and tell you how to do that.

3:00:32.800 --> 3:00:34.360
 What we do is you build a layer two protocol

3:00:34.360 --> 3:00:37.400
 that's blockchain agnostic and then the user can decide

3:00:37.400 --> 3:00:38.840
 when and where they need an identity

3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:41.200
 and then bring that identity into the system.

3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:43.320
 And if you designed it right, when they bring it in,

3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:45.360
 it's very easy, very fluid,

3:00:45.360 --> 3:00:47.800
 and suddenly the experience enhances.

3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:49.280
 Everything just gets better.

3:00:49.280 --> 3:00:51.760
 Oh wow, okay, now I can use all these regulated things.

3:00:51.760 --> 3:00:53.840
 They go from gray to green in the App Store.

3:00:53.840 --> 3:00:55.000
 That's so cool.

3:00:55.000 --> 3:00:58.400
 Or oh wow, now I can send to human readable addresses.

3:00:58.400 --> 3:01:00.200
 Because if I have an identity and you have an identity,

3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:02.360
 we can alias them with some namespace.

3:01:02.360 --> 3:01:06.040
 And now I send to Lex instead of some horrible

3:01:06.040 --> 3:01:08.080
 back 32 address structure.

3:01:08.080 --> 3:01:10.920
 Okay, so that's really what you need to do with layer two

3:01:10.920 --> 3:01:13.120
 is say, okay, each layer two protocol

3:01:13.120 --> 3:01:14.160
 is meant to do something.

3:01:14.160 --> 3:01:17.280
 Either it gives me payments or lower customer contracts

3:01:17.280 --> 3:01:19.760
 or interoperability or identity.

3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:21.520
 And then it's a marketplace.

3:01:21.520 --> 3:01:23.600
 So you should have blockchain agnosticism

3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:24.960
 with your layer two solutions.

3:01:24.960 --> 3:01:27.440
 And so you can mix and match and choose

3:01:27.440 --> 3:01:29.240
 whichever collection of services you need.

3:01:29.240 --> 3:01:31.520
 And that's actually how IT works these days

3:01:31.520 --> 3:01:33.640
 with microservices and these other things.

3:01:33.640 --> 3:01:36.200
 And cloud software, you know, every firm

3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:38.560
 is an aggregation of dozens of providers.

3:01:38.560 --> 3:01:41.880
 And basically that composition of them is your software stack.

3:01:43.040 --> 3:01:45.840
 Jumping around back to proof of work.

3:01:45.840 --> 3:01:49.200
 What are non interactive proofs of proof of work?

3:01:49.200 --> 3:01:51.680
 NIPO, POW, WS.

3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:52.760
 Nipo POWs.

3:01:52.760 --> 3:01:53.600
 Nipo POWs.

3:01:53.600 --> 3:01:54.440
 Nipo POWs.

3:01:54.440 --> 3:01:55.280
 It's fun to say, right?

3:01:55.280 --> 3:01:56.120
 Nipo POWs.

3:01:56.120 --> 3:01:57.200
 It's just one of those things that you notice

3:01:57.200 --> 3:02:00.160
 that certain proofs of work when you solve them

3:02:00.160 --> 3:02:02.080
 come up less frequently than other ones.

3:02:02.080 --> 3:02:05.440
 And just by that nature, you can sample them

3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:07.040
 and then construct proofs from them.

3:02:07.040 --> 3:02:09.920
 So you can, with that just set,

3:02:09.920 --> 3:02:12.000
 have a more concise representation

3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:14.080
 of an amount of work for a range of the chain.

3:02:14.080 --> 3:02:14.920
 So that word.

3:02:14.920 --> 3:02:15.760
 I can say that again.

3:02:15.760 --> 3:02:17.600
 Yeah, I was gonna say that word salad,

3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:20.960
 basically the idea is, okay, so let's say that this block,

3:02:20.960 --> 3:02:22.720
 and I'm just simplifying the concept a lot,

3:02:22.720 --> 3:02:26.080
 this block, you know, you get a regular green

3:02:26.080 --> 3:02:27.160
 type of proof of work.

3:02:27.160 --> 3:02:28.680
 And then this block, you get a green

3:02:28.680 --> 3:02:31.520
 and you keep going and then suddenly you get a red one, okay?

3:02:31.520 --> 3:02:33.000
 So it's still a valid proof of work,

3:02:33.000 --> 3:02:35.840
 but it's more rare than the other ones, okay?

3:02:35.840 --> 3:02:37.600
 So if you notice that particular pattern,

3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:40.000
 what you can do is you can just start not caring

3:02:40.000 --> 3:02:41.400
 so much about the green ones,

3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:44.920
 and you can just bookend your chain with red, okay?

3:02:44.920 --> 3:02:46.480
 And then you can just repeat that

3:02:46.480 --> 3:02:48.320
 and repeat that, repeat that, and you can collect,

3:02:48.320 --> 3:02:50.800
 and you can create this really compressed representation

3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:51.760
 of these things.

3:02:51.760 --> 3:02:52.600
 So what does it mean?

3:02:52.600 --> 3:02:55.000
 It means that suddenly when you have that,

3:02:55.000 --> 3:02:58.360
 now you have a way of representing a long range of history

3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:00.360
 with a very small proof.

3:03:00.360 --> 3:03:01.920
 So you can use it for light wallets,

3:03:01.920 --> 3:03:05.320
 and you also could use it for side chains,

3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:07.760
 if both side chains use proof of work.

3:03:07.760 --> 3:03:09.360
 So when you see a transaction come in,

3:03:09.360 --> 3:03:11.160
 you don't have a copy of the side chain,

3:03:11.160 --> 3:03:12.720
 but you have a copy of the proof of work,

3:03:12.720 --> 3:03:14.960
 and it has the same algorithmic weight

3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:17.480
 as the normal longest chain,

3:03:17.480 --> 3:03:18.960
 because you don't have all the greens,

3:03:18.960 --> 3:03:20.000
 but the reds only occur

3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:21.920
 with a certain sampling frequency.

3:03:21.920 --> 3:03:25.280
 So this is the brainchild of Dionysus Zindros and Agalos,

3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:27.000
 and it's just an amazing paper,

3:03:27.000 --> 3:03:29.640
 and what's so cool about it is it doesn't require

3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:31.440
 any structural changes to proof of work.

3:03:31.440 --> 3:03:33.400
 It's just something you notice as an off gas

3:03:33.400 --> 3:03:34.360
 of proof of work.

3:03:34.360 --> 3:03:36.360
 It's like you're watching an engine operate,

3:03:36.360 --> 3:03:39.080
 and you notice like every 500 times a piston

3:03:39.080 --> 3:03:40.960
 will do a certain weird thing,

3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:42.360
 and so you take advantage of that,

3:03:42.360 --> 3:03:44.160
 you say, well, if I count 10 of them,

3:03:44.160 --> 3:03:47.160
 now I have 5,000 pistons, strikes,

3:03:47.160 --> 3:03:48.600
 because I observed that pattern,

3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:50.360
 and so it's the same concept there,

3:03:50.360 --> 3:03:52.520
 and it's just a property of the engine.

3:03:52.520 --> 3:03:54.000
 So you don't really need to hard fork it in,

3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:54.840
 it's just there,

3:03:54.840 --> 3:03:57.000
 and because you can build proofs that way,

3:03:57.000 --> 3:03:59.680
 now you can use those proofs to do like clients,

3:03:59.680 --> 3:04:01.080
 and you can use those proofs to do other things,

3:04:01.080 --> 3:04:02.560
 because you can just use that as something

3:04:02.560 --> 3:04:03.400
 that comes with the history,

3:04:03.400 --> 3:04:04.880
 you don't have to have the whole blockchain.

3:04:04.880 --> 3:04:06.080
 Now, is this a weird property

3:04:06.080 --> 3:04:08.480
 of multiple proof of work chains?

3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:09.560
 Okay, can this...

3:04:09.560 --> 3:04:12.040
 It has to be key to the particular consensus algorithm,

3:04:12.040 --> 3:04:14.680
 but usually there's some portability

3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:15.520
 in this type of thing.

3:04:15.520 --> 3:04:16.440
 Like we're right now exploring,

3:04:16.440 --> 3:04:17.960
 can you do NEPA piles with Prism

3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:20.160
 or any of these sharded proof of work protocols,

3:04:20.160 --> 3:04:21.360
 but it looks like you can.

3:04:21.360 --> 3:04:23.520
 The closely related is log space mining.

3:04:23.520 --> 3:04:25.320
 So you can use this concept,

3:04:25.320 --> 3:04:26.880
 and instead of having the entire blockchain

3:04:26.880 --> 3:04:27.880
 to be able to mine,

3:04:27.880 --> 3:04:30.000
 you can use a compressed representation of it.

3:04:30.000 --> 3:04:31.720
 We wrote a paper called Log Space Mining

3:04:31.720 --> 3:04:33.720
 that basically explains how to do that.

3:04:33.720 --> 3:04:38.200
 So your miner only has this very small micro ledger

3:04:38.200 --> 3:04:40.480
 as opposed to the entire ledger.

3:04:40.480 --> 3:04:43.080
 How does it connect back to the entire ledger?

3:04:43.080 --> 3:04:44.200
 How does the compressed?

3:04:44.200 --> 3:04:45.640
 Because you have those red blocks,

3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:46.720
 you have those special things.

3:04:46.720 --> 3:04:48.760
 And so you know that the state you're working on

3:04:48.760 --> 3:04:51.040
 is actually legitimate, right?

3:04:51.040 --> 3:04:52.920
 So the map goes both ways?

3:04:52.920 --> 3:04:55.520
 Yeah, pretty cool.

3:04:55.520 --> 3:04:56.440
 Wow, that's really interesting.

3:04:56.440 --> 3:04:58.600
 Yeah, and DNS is a genius.

3:04:58.600 --> 3:05:00.040
 He's a really, really smart kid.

3:05:00.040 --> 3:05:01.760
 And he got his PhD under us.

3:05:01.760 --> 3:05:03.280
 He went to University of Athens,

3:05:03.280 --> 3:05:05.400
 and he was a Agilos's graduate student.

3:05:05.400 --> 3:05:08.360
 And now he's doing a postdoc at Stanford under David Shee.

3:05:08.360 --> 3:05:10.320
 And this is literally the only thing he does.

3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:13.080
 He does interoperability, sidechain stuff,

3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:14.600
 NEPA piles and so forth.

3:05:14.600 --> 3:05:16.680
 And he's written a lot of great papers on it.

3:05:16.680 --> 3:05:18.720
 And that was a testimony to hard work

3:05:18.720 --> 3:05:20.080
 for getting the paper published

3:05:20.080 --> 3:05:21.840
 because the paper came out in 2016.

3:05:21.840 --> 3:05:23.600
 But I think it took three or four years

3:05:23.600 --> 3:05:25.480
 for it to go through a peer review.

3:05:25.480 --> 3:05:27.200
 He kept trying to push it one conference

3:05:27.200 --> 3:05:29.440
 after a rejection, after another rejection,

3:05:29.440 --> 3:05:30.880
 but he got it through.

3:05:30.880 --> 3:05:32.200
 Real proud of that kid.

3:05:32.200 --> 3:05:34.200
 And then he's just doing all this beautiful derivative work

3:05:34.200 --> 3:05:37.040
 now, like log space mining and so forth.

3:05:37.040 --> 3:05:42.040
 So Reddit, and he suddenly says starts with Reddit,

3:05:42.240 --> 3:05:43.640
 you know, it's gonna be fun.

3:05:43.640 --> 3:05:47.600
 The top question on the Cardano subreddit,

3:05:47.600 --> 3:05:50.520
 which is quite a wonderful place by the way,

3:05:50.520 --> 3:05:55.240
 was can you get Charles to play devil's advocate

3:05:55.240 --> 3:05:57.000
 against Cardano?

3:05:57.000 --> 3:06:00.080
 If it's going to fail, what would failure look like

3:06:00.080 --> 3:06:02.600
 and what are the most likely reasons it would fail?

3:06:03.600 --> 3:06:06.600
 Okay, well, there's the failure.

3:06:06.600 --> 3:06:09.080
 For example, I said one of the project goals

3:06:09.080 --> 3:06:11.200
 was to achieve self evolution.

3:06:11.200 --> 3:06:12.920
 So if it doesn't achieve that work

3:06:12.920 --> 3:06:16.080
 and involve itself iteration by iteration,

3:06:16.080 --> 3:06:19.360
 then obviously the product didn't do what was intended.

3:06:19.360 --> 3:06:23.040
 If it continuously required the supervision of custodians

3:06:23.040 --> 3:06:26.760
 in order for it to succeed, the system just won't work.

3:06:26.760 --> 3:06:29.360
 The good news is we have a lot of data showing the opposite.

3:06:29.360 --> 3:06:31.720
 You know, we used to run an federated model

3:06:31.720 --> 3:06:33.200
 and now we're completely decentralized

3:06:33.200 --> 3:06:36.400
 for block production, but that didn't just happen overnight.

3:06:36.400 --> 3:06:38.440
 I mean, there was a whole process

3:06:38.440 --> 3:06:40.000
 with the incentivized test net

3:06:40.000 --> 3:06:41.840
 and the stateful pioneers program

3:06:41.840 --> 3:06:43.760
 and the launch of Shelly and the decrementing

3:06:43.760 --> 3:06:45.720
 of the decentralization parameter.

3:06:45.720 --> 3:06:47.200
 And every step of the way people showed up

3:06:47.200 --> 3:06:48.360
 and had to do things.

3:06:48.360 --> 3:06:51.600
 And we went from several to thousands of people

3:06:51.600 --> 3:06:54.080
 who are regularly maintaining the infrastructure.

3:06:54.080 --> 3:06:57.080
 But there's no guarantee that that would be sustainable.

3:06:57.080 --> 3:06:59.880
 And there's no guarantee that the next step,

3:06:59.880 --> 3:07:02.120
 the smart contract step will achieve what we want.

3:07:02.120 --> 3:07:03.480
 And the next step, the governance step

3:07:03.480 --> 3:07:04.760
 will achieve what we want.

3:07:04.760 --> 3:07:06.880
 I mean, it's an experiment on all these types of things.

3:07:06.880 --> 3:07:10.200
 All cryptocurrencies, all companies are in a sense

3:07:10.200 --> 3:07:12.960
 experiments when they are evolving the business model.

3:07:12.960 --> 3:07:17.600
 And as our case, our business's systems and society,

3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:19.640
 we're offering to the world a vision

3:07:19.640 --> 3:07:22.240
 of how to run humanity in a different way.

3:07:22.240 --> 3:07:24.240
 And the only way the system can do that

3:07:24.240 --> 3:07:26.600
 is by millions of people joining the system,

3:07:26.600 --> 3:07:28.520
 self evolving the system and growing it

3:07:28.520 --> 3:07:30.600
 in that particular direction.

3:07:30.600 --> 3:07:32.440
 Another failure scenario would be

3:07:32.440 --> 3:07:34.920
 the system evolves in the wrong direction.

3:07:34.920 --> 3:07:36.200
 So it's self evolving,

3:07:36.200 --> 3:07:39.640
 but it goes into a more centralized dystopian way.

3:07:39.640 --> 3:07:41.400
 And that's problematic as well.

3:07:41.400 --> 3:07:42.240
 What would that look like?

3:07:42.240 --> 3:07:44.840
 What would dystopia, self evolution

3:07:44.840 --> 3:07:46.360
 toward dystopia look like?

3:07:46.360 --> 3:07:48.600
 A small group of actors have total control

3:07:48.600 --> 3:07:50.160
 over who gets to use the system

3:07:50.160 --> 3:07:51.560
 and how they get to use the system.

3:07:51.560 --> 3:07:53.720
 And your use of the system is monitored

3:07:53.720 --> 3:07:56.200
 and shared with that small group of actors.

3:07:56.200 --> 3:07:59.160
 So social credit in China is a great example of that.

3:07:59.160 --> 3:08:00.880
 Small group of people have access to that.

3:08:00.880 --> 3:08:03.600
 And then your experience in Chinese society

3:08:03.600 --> 3:08:04.680
 is determined by it.

3:08:05.760 --> 3:08:07.760
 So that's an example of a failure mode.

3:08:07.760 --> 3:08:10.240
 And then another could be just network effect.

3:08:10.240 --> 3:08:13.280
 We start experiencing a churn rate

3:08:13.280 --> 3:08:16.880
 and inputs don't match the outputs

3:08:16.880 --> 3:08:19.600
 in that you lose more than you gain

3:08:19.600 --> 3:08:21.840
 and then over time the system dies off.

3:08:21.840 --> 3:08:23.560
 However, that's really hard in practice.

3:08:23.560 --> 3:08:25.480
 Once you've reached a certain network effect,

3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:28.040
 even if you become stagnant and stale,

3:08:28.040 --> 3:08:29.560
 you tend not to lose your users.

3:08:29.560 --> 3:08:32.360
 And our evangelism is unbelievable

3:08:32.360 --> 3:08:33.400
 in the Cardinal community.

3:08:33.400 --> 3:08:35.720
 I think we're number one for tattoos.

3:08:35.720 --> 3:08:37.280
 And that's, if you think about that,

3:08:37.280 --> 3:08:38.920
 it's a strange metric to have,

3:08:38.920 --> 3:08:41.120
 but there are brands that associate that way.

3:08:41.120 --> 3:08:43.160
 Apple and Harley Davidson and so forth,

3:08:43.160 --> 3:08:45.360
 people tend to actually tattoo the logo.

3:08:45.360 --> 3:08:47.080
 Those people don't leave.

3:08:47.080 --> 3:08:49.480
 They don't actually walk away from the ecosystem.

3:08:49.480 --> 3:08:51.360
 They're fanboys to the core.

3:08:51.360 --> 3:08:55.280
 So there's a lot of people that are here for life.

3:08:55.280 --> 3:08:58.080
 They don't care if it's dollar, eight, two cent data.

3:08:58.080 --> 3:08:59.920
 They believe in the mission, vision and value

3:08:59.920 --> 3:09:01.200
 of what we wish to achieve.

3:09:01.200 --> 3:09:03.360
 And they've become evangelists in that respect.

3:09:03.360 --> 3:09:06.840
 So the question is, does that community sustain itself?

3:09:06.840 --> 3:09:09.120
 And also does that community not make the same sins

3:09:09.120 --> 3:09:10.600
 and mistake of Bitcoin,

3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:13.000
 where they become toxic and maximalistic

3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:14.720
 and they start becoming highly religious

3:09:14.720 --> 3:09:16.240
 about whatever beliefs they have?

3:09:16.240 --> 3:09:20.200
 My hope is our community will be open and socratic

3:09:20.200 --> 3:09:21.920
 and love the scientific method

3:09:21.920 --> 3:09:25.240
 and be willing to entertain ideas without adopting them

3:09:25.240 --> 3:09:28.040
 and discard ideas that are proven to be wrong.

3:09:28.040 --> 3:09:31.360
 If we become dogmatic and embrace an orthodoxy

3:09:31.360 --> 3:09:33.680
 that is counterproductive innovation,

3:09:33.680 --> 3:09:36.120
 then it'll stall out the ecosystem.

3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:38.560
 And you'll notice I never said price in any of this.

3:09:38.560 --> 3:09:42.600
 I never said, hey, failure is if the price goes way down

3:09:42.600 --> 3:09:44.880
 and successes if the price goes way up.

3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:46.960
 That's unfortunately the metric that most people use,

3:09:46.960 --> 3:09:48.640
 but I couldn't care less about it.

3:09:48.640 --> 3:09:51.320
 Because the reality is if you construct a system

3:09:51.320 --> 3:09:53.520
 that encompasses the entire globe

3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:55.120
 and has billions of users,

3:09:55.120 --> 3:09:57.080
 probably gonna be a pretty valuable system.

3:09:57.080 --> 3:09:59.400
 That's a secondary thing.

3:09:59.400 --> 3:10:02.040
 It's an after effect of having success

3:10:02.040 --> 3:10:03.680
 and adoption, use and utility.

3:10:04.520 --> 3:10:06.960
 Unfortunately, most people on Reddit

3:10:06.960 --> 3:10:08.800
 and Twitter and other channels,

3:10:08.800 --> 3:10:11.520
 they tend to just judge your entire success based on that.

3:10:11.520 --> 3:10:13.840
 I had very few people when Shelly launched,

3:10:13.840 --> 3:10:15.560
 even though it took us four years to get there,

3:10:15.560 --> 3:10:18.440
 a lot of work, say congratulations on Shelly.

3:10:18.440 --> 3:10:20.600
 But I had a lot of people when Ada reached the dollar,

3:10:20.600 --> 3:10:22.840
 say we're so proud of you, amazing work,

3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:24.360
 congratulations and so forth.

3:10:24.360 --> 3:10:26.240
 And that's probably the most disheartening thing

3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:30.360
 about the whole being around and doing this stuff

3:10:30.360 --> 3:10:32.640
 where all the things you do only matter

3:10:32.640 --> 3:10:34.560
 as long as it's making someone else rich.

3:10:34.560 --> 3:10:37.920
 And in a way, I feel almost like a failure.

3:10:37.920 --> 3:10:42.480
 Because that mindset means that we haven't yet

3:10:42.480 --> 3:10:45.840
 inculcated the community in a proper way saying,

3:10:45.840 --> 3:10:48.280
 hey guys, this is about more than money.

3:10:48.280 --> 3:10:49.840
 It's about more than the value of Ada.

3:10:49.840 --> 3:10:51.160
 What we're attempting to do here

3:10:51.160 --> 3:10:52.960
 is reengineer the way society works.

3:10:52.960 --> 3:10:54.600
 I'd like your voting to be different.

3:10:54.600 --> 3:10:55.880
 I'd like your property to be different.

3:10:55.880 --> 3:10:57.160
 I'd like you out of your cell phone

3:10:57.160 --> 3:10:58.840
 to have a universal wallet.

3:10:58.840 --> 3:11:00.520
 And when you go to Starbucks or wherever,

3:11:00.520 --> 3:11:03.480
 you can buy your coffee with silver or gold

3:11:03.480 --> 3:11:05.440
 or airline miles or something like that.

3:11:05.440 --> 3:11:07.240
 And they get paid whenever the hell they wanna get paid.

3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:09.040
 And I want those rails to be done with a system

3:11:09.040 --> 3:11:11.240
 that puts you in charge, not someone else.

3:11:11.240 --> 3:11:12.720
 And they say, yeah, that's all fine and great.

3:11:12.720 --> 3:11:15.760
 As long as eight is $5, we're all happy.

3:11:15.760 --> 3:11:18.040
 You see, so that's a problem.

3:11:18.040 --> 3:11:19.680
 There are of course other things that could fail,

3:11:19.680 --> 3:11:22.080
 like we could lose project cohesion.

3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:23.800
 Lots of people could quit and die.

3:11:23.800 --> 3:11:25.400
 But again, there's so much momentum.

3:11:25.400 --> 3:11:26.440
 There's so many things here.

3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:27.960
 The ideas are already out there.

3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:30.000
 And there's no intellectual property.

3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:31.240
 When you publish 100 papers,

3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:32.600
 you write a million lines of code.

3:11:32.600 --> 3:11:34.440
 That's something and it's permanent.

3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:35.960
 And it's in the commons now.

3:11:35.960 --> 3:11:38.400
 So it's just as much yours as it is mine.

3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:41.240
 So there's no notion that somehow,

3:11:41.240 --> 3:11:43.320
 if the core development company disappeared,

3:11:43.320 --> 3:11:46.880
 then that concept is lost forever,

3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:50.240
 like the library of Alexandria burning to the ground.

3:11:50.240 --> 3:11:53.080
 It's there and someone else will take it,

3:11:53.080 --> 3:11:55.440
 fork it and get it done.

3:11:55.440 --> 3:11:56.800
 I mean, first of all, that's fascinating.

3:11:56.800 --> 3:11:57.960
 The self evolution,

3:11:57.960 --> 3:11:59.880
 you don't know which trajectories that's gonna take.

3:11:59.880 --> 3:12:03.640
 But also there's could be singular events,

3:12:03.640 --> 3:12:07.840
 like bugs in the system create an opportunity

3:12:07.840 --> 3:12:09.400
 to hack the system.

3:12:09.400 --> 3:12:10.760
 Is that something that you see

3:12:10.760 --> 3:12:12.880
 as a potential failure case?

3:12:12.880 --> 3:12:14.520
 Yeah, it's always a possibility.

3:12:14.520 --> 3:12:15.520
 Bugs can exist.

3:12:15.520 --> 3:12:17.920
 There can be flaws in the protocol design.

3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:19.520
 Zcash was a great example of that

3:12:19.520 --> 3:12:21.040
 where there was a subtle flaw

3:12:21.040 --> 3:12:23.320
 and it damaged the fidelity of the cryptocurrency

3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:26.080
 in ways no other cryptocurrencies ever experienced.

3:12:26.080 --> 3:12:27.960
 Normally when you have a bug,

3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:30.280
 the bug, you can see it like the Bitcoin overflow,

3:12:30.280 --> 3:12:31.360
 the value overflow incident.

3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:32.600
 Yes, Bitcoin can be created,

3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:34.520
 but we can verify they weren't.

3:12:34.520 --> 3:12:36.440
 So the monetary policy is preserved.

3:12:36.440 --> 3:12:39.320
 When you have a bug with a private system like Zcash

3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:41.520
 and it exists on the shielded side,

3:12:41.520 --> 3:12:44.560
 there's no guarantee unless you can audit the total supply

3:12:44.560 --> 3:12:45.840
 inside that shielded side.

3:12:45.840 --> 3:12:47.360
 My understanding is you can't

3:12:47.360 --> 3:12:49.200
 that somebody didn't exploit the bug

3:12:49.200 --> 3:12:51.200
 and create trillions of these coins out of thin air

3:12:51.200 --> 3:12:53.840
 and just hiding them on that system and dripping them out.

3:12:53.840 --> 3:12:56.000
 And so the monetary policy is for every damage

3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:57.560
 as a consequence of bug like that.

3:12:57.560 --> 3:12:59.440
 It's probably the worst type of bug you can have

3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:01.120
 for these types of products.

3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:04.040
 So, no matter how good of a job you do,

3:13:04.040 --> 3:13:05.240
 they have great scientists,

3:13:05.240 --> 3:13:07.480
 they're great people there, great engineers there.

3:13:07.480 --> 3:13:08.960
 You can always have something like that,

3:13:08.960 --> 3:13:11.080
 seep its way in, leak its way in,

3:13:11.080 --> 3:13:12.800
 and that lurks in the distance.

3:13:12.800 --> 3:13:15.520
 But if that's a problem shared

3:13:15.520 --> 3:13:17.120
 with every one of your neighbors,

3:13:18.240 --> 3:13:20.480
 it's like everybody working on a nuclear power plant.

3:13:20.480 --> 3:13:22.480
 Well, yeah, you can all die of radiation poisoning.

3:13:22.480 --> 3:13:24.520
 Well, we all kind of knew that, didn't we?

3:13:25.840 --> 3:13:28.760
 So it's like, I don't really think too much about it.

3:13:28.760 --> 3:13:30.640
 I think the context of the question was more,

3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:33.480
 what is Cardano specific over Ethereum or Bitcoin

3:13:33.480 --> 3:13:34.600
 or any of these other things?

3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:37.600
 And yeah, okay, existential lurking bug could happen.

3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:40.200
 It's lower probability for us than the other systems

3:13:40.200 --> 3:13:42.040
 because we use formal methods.

3:13:42.040 --> 3:13:45.920
 And we use peer review inside the protocol design.

3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:47.680
 So there's been more eyeballs and tools

3:13:47.680 --> 3:13:49.240
 and techniques used to check things.

3:13:49.240 --> 3:13:51.200
 And we actually have discovered a lot

3:13:51.200 --> 3:13:53.400
 of weird wonky bugs before production

3:13:53.400 --> 3:13:54.960
 and resolve those bugs.

3:13:54.960 --> 3:13:57.800
 So it shows you the system works, it's a lot of fun.

3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:00.600
 What about close kind of competitors?

3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:01.840
 I don't know if you would put it that way,

3:14:01.840 --> 3:14:04.000
 but if you look in the space of ideas,

3:14:05.160 --> 3:14:08.440
 competitor cryptocurrencies like Polkadot,

3:14:08.440 --> 3:14:09.840
 what is some interesting difference

3:14:09.840 --> 3:14:12.120
 between Cardano and Polkadot?

3:14:12.120 --> 3:14:14.360
 Technically, philosophically, historically,

3:14:14.360 --> 3:14:15.600
 is that something you think about

3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:17.560
 when you think about the future of Cardano?

3:14:17.560 --> 3:14:19.160
 Yeah, I mean, we do.

3:14:19.160 --> 3:14:20.720
 We actually have a whole group of people

3:14:20.720 --> 3:14:23.360
 that do business intelligence and comparative analysis.

3:14:23.360 --> 3:14:24.680
 And we're getting to a point

3:14:24.680 --> 3:14:27.240
 where we wanna start eventually forking their code

3:14:27.240 --> 3:14:28.600
 and running private versions of it

3:14:28.600 --> 3:14:29.720
 and just playing around with things.

3:14:29.720 --> 3:14:30.560
 Well, that's fascinating.

3:14:30.560 --> 3:14:33.320
 Better, you see, Consensus actually does this.

3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:34.320
 They actually did it with Eos

3:14:34.320 --> 3:14:36.840
 and they wrote this lovely report like Trashing Eos saying,

3:14:36.840 --> 3:14:38.720
 hey, by the way, all those claims these guys made

3:14:38.720 --> 3:14:39.920
 are just not true.

3:14:40.880 --> 3:14:42.960
 But it's nice to do that.

3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:45.040
 It's nice to use your competitor's technology

3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:47.040
 or competing protocol technology

3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:48.560
 because you learn a lot along the process.

3:14:48.560 --> 3:14:50.280
 It's not all bad.

3:14:50.280 --> 3:14:51.720
 There's always something there

3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:53.840
 because they have different tradeoffs and customers

3:14:53.840 --> 3:14:55.440
 that potentially are more interesting.

3:14:55.440 --> 3:14:57.560
 Like right now we're grocking, how do we wanna do

3:14:57.560 --> 3:14:59.480
 the side chain model of Cardano?

3:14:59.480 --> 3:15:02.040
 Polkadot's actually a tremendously useful piece

3:15:02.040 --> 3:15:03.840
 of infrastructure for that conversation

3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:06.640
 because they copied part of our infrastructure.

3:15:06.640 --> 3:15:08.760
 You know, Gavin's a trained computer scientist.

3:15:08.760 --> 3:15:12.880
 He got his PhD from York and he read our papers obviously

3:15:12.880 --> 3:15:15.440
 and he realized that Ouroboros was a really good

3:15:15.440 --> 3:15:18.480
 starting place for building a proof of stake system.

3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:21.280
 So Polkadot's consensus is very similar to ours.

3:15:21.280 --> 3:15:22.360
 And so if you're saying, hey,

3:15:22.360 --> 3:15:24.400
 how do you do a good side chain model

3:15:24.400 --> 3:15:26.960
 with an Ouroboros style proof of stake?

3:15:26.960 --> 3:15:29.080
 Well, we already have this parachain thing, right?

3:15:29.080 --> 3:15:31.320
 And so now by just looking at that,

3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:34.560
 I can kind of get an idea of how, one way of doing it.

3:15:34.560 --> 3:15:37.000
 And so that's just beautiful that we live in a space

3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:38.440
 where that's there, it's open source,

3:15:38.440 --> 3:15:39.280
 and it's really good.

3:15:39.280 --> 3:15:41.200
 You just say, okay, well, we'll just take that

3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:42.040
 and adopt that.

3:15:42.040 --> 3:15:43.800
 There's no shame, you know?

3:15:43.800 --> 3:15:46.880
 The other side of it is that Polkadot

3:15:46.880 --> 3:15:49.880
 really has focused a lot on commercial adoption,

3:15:49.880 --> 3:15:53.480
 Silicon Valley adoption, getting real use in utility.

3:15:53.480 --> 3:15:55.720
 I say in a much more sustainable way

3:15:55.720 --> 3:15:57.440
 than Ethereum has focused on.

3:15:57.440 --> 3:15:59.640
 Ethereum was kind of a spray and pray thing.

3:15:59.640 --> 3:16:01.960
 Polkadot was more of like, hey, let's go ahead

3:16:01.960 --> 3:16:04.640
 and actually curate our ecosystem more carefully.

3:16:04.640 --> 3:16:08.120
 And we're gonna build it in a way where there's predictable

3:16:08.120 --> 3:16:10.560
 or as predictable a cost as possible

3:16:10.560 --> 3:16:12.960
 with the rollout of the infrastructure.

3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:16.600
 And that's so important for a business.

3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:18.680
 It's not necessarily important for an experiment

3:16:18.680 --> 3:16:21.080
 or a startup where they're just trying to get

3:16:21.080 --> 3:16:22.920
 populations quickly as possible,

3:16:22.920 --> 3:16:24.440
 we'll figure out later.

3:16:24.440 --> 3:16:25.760
 But if you're actually sitting here saying,

3:16:25.760 --> 3:16:28.440
 I need to know what my expenses are three years,

3:16:28.440 --> 3:16:30.240
 five years, 10 years into the future,

3:16:30.240 --> 3:16:31.960
 you need predictability there.

3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:33.360
 I think they have a better shot of it

3:16:33.360 --> 3:16:37.640
 than anything in F2 or with currently Ethereum.

3:16:37.640 --> 3:16:41.200
 Now, the big contrast between the two systems, those,

3:16:41.200 --> 3:16:43.360
 we actually have native multi asset,

3:16:43.360 --> 3:16:44.680
 we have a different accounting model.

3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:47.320
 I think our base ledger is far more expressive.

3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:48.960
 Our rate of evolution with proof of stake

3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:50.200
 is much faster than ours

3:16:50.200 --> 3:16:51.600
 because they're based on derivative work

3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:54.600
 and we already have Oris Omega and other things there.

3:16:54.600 --> 3:16:56.680
 I think we have a better, ultimately,

3:16:56.680 --> 3:16:58.560
 a better side chain model will come

3:16:58.560 --> 3:17:00.680
 because we have something called Mithril for that,

3:17:00.680 --> 3:17:02.920
 but we learned a lot from their work.

3:17:02.920 --> 3:17:04.840
 The other thing is that we thought about governance

3:17:04.840 --> 3:17:06.640
 a lot more carefully in my view.

3:17:06.640 --> 3:17:08.320
 And we have Catalyst and Voltaire

3:17:08.320 --> 3:17:10.360
 and really the key there is saying,

3:17:10.360 --> 3:17:12.120
 how do we make sure that every single person

3:17:12.120 --> 3:17:14.800
 who holds data can participate in the network?

3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:17.440
 That wasn't a high design priority of Polkadot.

3:17:17.440 --> 3:17:19.760
 It was more a fast commercial adoption.

3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:21.400
 The acquisition of customers will come

3:17:21.400 --> 3:17:22.800
 to governance later.

3:17:22.800 --> 3:17:25.920
 And those were just different business philosophies,

3:17:25.920 --> 3:17:28.400
 but it's nice to have a competitor like that.

3:17:28.400 --> 3:17:31.600
 And oftentimes I've said that Polkadot's like Ethereum 1.5.

3:17:31.600 --> 3:17:33.720
 It's what F2 probably should have been.

3:17:33.720 --> 3:17:35.200
 There was what Vitalik wanted to do,

3:17:35.200 --> 3:17:38.680
 which was incredibly aggressive and brilliant,

3:17:38.680 --> 3:17:39.920
 but it's a lot.

3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:42.640
 And there's so much execution risk in that plan.

3:17:42.640 --> 3:17:44.280
 And I think they've had like six years

3:17:44.280 --> 3:17:45.680
 of playing around with it.

3:17:45.680 --> 3:17:47.960
 Had they gone down the Polkadot road,

3:17:47.960 --> 3:17:50.520
 they probably would have been a market within 2018.

3:17:50.520 --> 3:17:53.000
 And because they already had the network effect,

3:17:53.000 --> 3:17:55.160
 they would have had years of building on that,

3:17:55.160 --> 3:17:56.000
 iterating that.

3:17:56.000 --> 3:17:57.440
 And they already had a path to it too.

3:17:57.440 --> 3:17:59.320
 All they had to do was just give Elaine Shee

3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:02.920
 and her cohorts at Cornell a $5, $10 million grants.

3:18:02.920 --> 3:18:05.400
 No white would have been the dominant protocol,

3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:08.280
 not at Orboros in the proof of stake space.

3:18:08.280 --> 3:18:09.680
 So it's really fascinating historically

3:18:09.680 --> 3:18:11.280
 when you look at these things and the rivalries

3:18:11.280 --> 3:18:12.760
 and what they did and what they didn't do.

3:18:12.760 --> 3:18:17.760
 And Gavin had a chance to have C++ Ethereum be used

3:18:17.760 --> 3:18:21.880
 as IBM's enterprise blockchain.

3:18:21.880 --> 3:18:24.760
 The only reason they didn't do it is it was licensed GPL.

3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:27.200
 And I think they wanted to re license Apache.

3:18:27.200 --> 3:18:28.600
 If you ever talked to Bob Summerwall,

3:18:28.600 --> 3:18:31.040
 he was there at the time and he had this amazing story

3:18:31.040 --> 3:18:34.840
 about like these terrible fights where it's like guys,

3:18:34.840 --> 3:18:36.400
 just re license the goddamn code.

3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:37.960
 Let's figure out a way to make this happen

3:18:37.960 --> 3:18:40.440
 so that we can get this huge network effect

3:18:40.440 --> 3:18:43.240
 of being basically IBM's play.

3:18:43.240 --> 3:18:44.920
 They didn't do it, they created fabric,

3:18:44.920 --> 3:18:46.440
 these types of things.

3:18:46.440 --> 3:18:49.920
 So there's a lot of lore and stories, not respect,

3:18:49.920 --> 3:18:52.640
 but the space is better because of Polkadot.

3:18:52.640 --> 3:18:54.000
 And there's a lot of good people there.

3:18:54.000 --> 3:18:55.800
 Web three is a good concept.

3:18:55.800 --> 3:18:58.720
 And we've run into their people in Germany and Zurich a lot

3:18:58.720 --> 3:19:00.760
 and they've always been cordial and friendly

3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:02.920
 and really affable.

3:19:02.920 --> 3:19:04.400
 Before I talked to you about governance,

3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:07.840
 which is one of the most fascinating things about Cardano.

3:19:07.840 --> 3:19:10.320
 There's a lot of stuff to untangle there.

3:19:10.320 --> 3:19:15.040
 Since you mentioned some humans

3:19:15.040 --> 3:19:17.480
 in this wonderful story,

3:19:17.480 --> 3:19:22.160
 you did make a video before we talked directed to me.

3:19:22.160 --> 3:19:23.440
 Thank you so much for that.

3:19:24.640 --> 3:19:26.440
 It came from a place of love.

3:19:29.440 --> 3:19:32.600
 But it was basically saying as we have been,

3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:34.400
 you would love to talk about the technology,

3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:37.400
 about the future that you're creating with Cardano

3:19:37.400 --> 3:19:40.200
 and just the future of the cryptocurrency space.

3:19:40.200 --> 3:19:42.880
 I think you're kind of worried

3:19:42.880 --> 3:19:44.640
 that you'll be talking to a journalist

3:19:44.640 --> 3:19:47.680
 that's looking for clickbait content, that kind of thing.

3:19:47.680 --> 3:19:49.400
 But I'm fascinated by human beings.

3:19:49.400 --> 3:19:51.560
 I think you're all from an outside perspective,

3:19:51.560 --> 3:19:52.760
 incredible human beings.

3:19:52.760 --> 3:19:54.320
 I don't know about personal tensions,

3:19:54.320 --> 3:19:55.240
 all those kinds of stuff,

3:19:55.240 --> 3:19:57.800
 but I think you're changing the world together

3:19:57.800 --> 3:19:59.040
 in different ways.

3:19:59.040 --> 3:20:02.480
 And I just wanted to sort of give you an opportunity

3:20:02.480 --> 3:20:06.400
 if there's in the name of love and friendship,

3:20:06.400 --> 3:20:09.680
 is there something from your history

3:20:09.680 --> 3:20:11.360
 over the past decade or so,

3:20:11.360 --> 3:20:13.960
 outside of technology and the human side of things

3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:16.920
 that you draw inspiration from, you draw insight from.

3:20:16.920 --> 3:20:18.800
 You're just proud that happened.

3:20:18.800 --> 3:20:21.920
 I mean, it's like asking Paul McCartney about John Lennon.

3:20:21.920 --> 3:20:23.160
 Tell us about John Lennon.

3:20:23.160 --> 3:20:24.160
 It's like, you know.

3:20:24.160 --> 3:20:25.480
 How much do you hate Yoko?

3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:28.600
 For almost eight years now,

3:20:28.600 --> 3:20:32.000
 it's just been this reoccurring pattern every interview.

3:20:32.000 --> 3:20:33.760
 Tell us about your time at Ethereum.

3:20:33.760 --> 3:20:36.720
 Those six months you spent there that were so pleasant

3:20:36.720 --> 3:20:38.440
 and enjoyable, tell us all about it.

3:20:38.440 --> 3:20:40.760
 And tell us about your relationship with Vitalik.

3:20:40.760 --> 3:20:42.240
 It's like, barely talk to the guy,

3:20:42.240 --> 3:20:44.320
 I see him every now and then, like every two years,

3:20:44.320 --> 3:20:46.640
 we say, hey, he says, hey, it's like, okay,

3:20:46.640 --> 3:20:49.160
 maybe 10, 20 years in the future, you know,

3:20:49.160 --> 3:20:52.520
 Walt Mossberg or Robo, Walt will bring us together

3:20:52.520 --> 3:20:55.840
 like he did Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.

3:20:55.840 --> 3:20:57.560
 And we can kind of talk about, you know.

3:20:57.560 --> 3:20:59.480
 That was a tense conversation, by the way.

3:20:59.480 --> 3:21:00.800
 The 2007 interview.

3:21:00.800 --> 3:21:01.640
 Yeah, the 2007.

3:21:01.640 --> 3:21:03.160
 Oh, great though, wasn't it?

3:21:03.160 --> 3:21:06.440
 Yeah, that was the body language, that was art.

3:21:06.440 --> 3:21:07.280
 Yeah.

3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:08.880
 It was, that was fascinating.

3:21:08.880 --> 3:21:11.400
 That was a fascinating study of human nature.

3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:14.080
 Yeah, so maybe that'll be us in like 10 or 20 years.

3:21:14.080 --> 3:21:14.920
 Who the hell knows?

3:21:14.920 --> 3:21:16.360
 The robot versions of all three of you.

3:21:16.360 --> 3:21:18.480
 Yeah, my only point though, was that, you know,

3:21:18.480 --> 3:21:20.640
 it's a closed chapter and it's funny,

3:21:20.640 --> 3:21:21.760
 I was there for six months,

3:21:21.760 --> 3:21:23.800
 I've been building Cardano for years,

3:21:23.800 --> 3:21:27.160
 we've done all this stuff, I've been to 52 countries.

3:21:27.160 --> 3:21:29.560
 I love talking about those experiences.

3:21:29.560 --> 3:21:32.080
 And there's so many of them, I've met heads of state.

3:21:32.080 --> 3:21:34.960
 You know, I went to Mongolia like eagle hunting

3:21:34.960 --> 3:21:37.240
 and, you know, being bucked off horses

3:21:37.240 --> 3:21:39.160
 and riding the sand dunes.

3:21:39.160 --> 3:21:43.880
 We've invented all this new cool technology

3:21:43.880 --> 3:21:45.800
 that the space itself is using

3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:48.640
 and we've had a chance to sit on government panels,

3:21:48.640 --> 3:21:51.400
 pass laws, 24 laws in Wyoming.

3:21:51.400 --> 3:21:54.120
 I mean, there's like all this amazing stuff that's there

3:21:54.120 --> 3:21:55.640
 and it's such a fun conversation.

3:21:55.640 --> 3:21:57.520
 There's so many superheroes in that conversation,

3:21:57.520 --> 3:21:59.360
 like Kailin Long and Taylor Limholm

3:21:59.360 --> 3:22:03.000
 and there's Alex Schirpinoy, who we already mentioned

3:22:03.000 --> 3:22:04.600
 that I met along the travels.

3:22:04.600 --> 3:22:05.840
 I met Ralph Merkel, cool.

3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:07.800
 I met all these amazing people along the way.

3:22:07.800 --> 3:22:10.240
 I have fond memories of, by the way,

3:22:10.240 --> 3:22:11.400
 you should interview him, by the way,

3:22:11.400 --> 3:22:13.720
 the amazing guy does nanotech now.

3:22:13.720 --> 3:22:15.440
 You know, I met, you know, I was hanging out

3:22:15.440 --> 3:22:17.880
 with Sylvia McCauley and I remember before I launched

3:22:17.880 --> 3:22:19.800
 Yalgrant, I said, you should really just do

3:22:19.800 --> 3:22:22.280
 a Bitcoin cash style play and airdrop Bitcoin.

3:22:22.280 --> 3:22:24.280
 What the hell are you doing distributing this?

3:22:24.280 --> 3:22:26.360
 He's like, trust me, I know what I'm doing.

3:22:26.360 --> 3:22:29.120
 You know, so it's like so many great conversations

3:22:29.120 --> 3:22:30.080
 and so many great people.

3:22:30.080 --> 3:22:31.960
 And what I've really noticed in this industry,

3:22:31.960 --> 3:22:34.720
 when you separate the tribalism, the maximum side,

3:22:34.720 --> 3:22:38.840
 there really is a love of creativity and building.

3:22:38.840 --> 3:22:41.120
 And there's like no other industry like it.

3:22:41.120 --> 3:22:42.920
 I've been in many different places in life

3:22:42.920 --> 3:22:45.600
 and here people just love art, they love beauty,

3:22:45.600 --> 3:22:48.560
 they love the unknown, they love pushing things,

3:22:48.560 --> 3:22:52.080
 you know, really, you know, in some cases,

3:22:53.120 --> 3:22:55.400
 not necessarily the most socially beneficial way,

3:22:55.400 --> 3:22:57.560
 but they really love the challenge, right?

3:22:58.560 --> 3:23:00.680
 And that has been fun.

3:23:00.680 --> 3:23:02.560
 I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

3:23:02.560 --> 3:23:07.440
 The dark side of the industry is that people love labels.

3:23:07.440 --> 3:23:10.400
 They love saying this person's good, this person's evil,

3:23:10.400 --> 3:23:12.960
 this person's a sociopath, this person's not.

3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:15.040
 And by the way, they've never met that person.

3:23:15.040 --> 3:23:16.800
 They've never interacted with that person.

3:23:16.800 --> 3:23:19.600
 And they just say, well, I heard from this person,

3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:21.960
 I read this book or I did that.

3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:23.960
 I was like, oh, so some books written by a journalist

3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:27.520
 makes $50,000 a year who's looking for a movie deal,

3:23:27.520 --> 3:23:29.840
 say that somebody said this or did this

3:23:29.840 --> 3:23:32.000
 in an unconfirmed way.

3:23:32.000 --> 3:23:33.720
 So what can you assume for slander?

3:23:33.720 --> 3:23:36.400
 I mean, so you just let it ride and you let it roll.

3:23:36.400 --> 3:23:38.480
 And if it was just ending there, that'd be great.

3:23:38.480 --> 3:23:41.680
 But the problem is it cascades and people just repost it

3:23:41.680 --> 3:23:44.240
 and they relive it again and again and again.

3:23:44.240 --> 3:23:45.240
 And then what do you do about it?

3:23:45.240 --> 3:23:47.440
 You eventually just say, I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

3:23:47.440 --> 3:23:48.400
 I'm done with it.

3:23:48.400 --> 3:23:50.120
 And you move on and you say, you know what?

3:23:50.120 --> 3:23:51.400
 If it's your problem, it's your problem,

3:23:51.400 --> 3:23:53.240
 it's your reality that you wanna live in,

3:23:53.240 --> 3:23:55.800
 I'll be defined by the things that I achieve and do

3:23:55.800 --> 3:23:58.640
 and the people that we help and the things that we build.

3:23:58.640 --> 3:24:00.960
 And, you know, since I started this industry,

3:24:00.960 --> 3:24:03.560
 I've gotten to a point where not only do we have

3:24:03.560 --> 3:24:06.400
 this amazing company with these incredible people

3:24:06.400 --> 3:24:08.960
 who work at this company, but we also have the ability

3:24:08.960 --> 3:24:10.920
 to pursue amazing different interests.

3:24:10.920 --> 3:24:14.280
 Like I met Ben Gortzel and Ben and I are gonna do

3:24:14.280 --> 3:24:17.440
 an AGI project together and of all places for Wanda.

3:24:17.440 --> 3:24:20.200
 And he gave me this 85 fucking page paper.

3:24:20.200 --> 3:24:22.840
 He was wearing that damn hat that he always wears.

3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:25.760
 I think he showers with the hat on.

3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:27.200
 He never takes that thing off.

3:24:27.200 --> 3:24:30.200
 I think he refused, I interviewed him and he refused

3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:31.800
 to tell me the story of the hat.

3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:33.080
 He wouldn't tell me either.

3:24:33.080 --> 3:24:34.960
 I interviewed him as well in Wyoming.

3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:37.800
 And every time I call him, he'll have his shirt off,

3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:39.160
 he'll have the fucking hat on.

3:24:39.160 --> 3:24:41.080
 And now all I can think about is the hat.

3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:42.640
 I wonder what the story there is.

3:24:42.640 --> 3:24:44.880
 I know, it's like, it's gotta be.

3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:46.040
 That might be the AGI.

3:24:46.040 --> 3:24:46.880
 Yeah, exactly.

3:24:46.880 --> 3:24:48.840
 But anyway, he gives me this 80 page paper

3:24:48.840 --> 3:24:50.960
 and he says, Charles, it's like the culmination

3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:53.240
 of everything I wanna, this is how we're gonna do AGI.

3:24:53.240 --> 3:24:54.440
 And I said, that's crazy, Ben.

3:24:54.440 --> 3:24:56.440
 I said, I'll throw some money at it.

3:24:56.440 --> 3:24:58.000
 So we're gonna hire some developers

3:24:58.000 --> 3:24:59.520
 and I have no idea where it's gonna go.

3:24:59.520 --> 3:25:02.040
 But I mean, I get to hang out with Ben Courtson.

3:25:02.040 --> 3:25:03.560
 You know, that's fun.

3:25:03.560 --> 3:25:04.400
 That's the kind of stuff.

3:25:04.400 --> 3:25:06.440
 And that's the really cool side of the space.

3:25:06.440 --> 3:25:10.520
 And it's what I enjoy in the Vitalik rival thing,

3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:12.440
 the Ethereum thing.

3:25:12.440 --> 3:25:14.560
 I try my best not to mention it.

3:25:14.560 --> 3:25:16.760
 I hate the fact that still when Bloomberg

3:25:16.760 --> 3:25:18.280
 or anybody else writes a story about me,

3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:20.280
 they'll say, Ethereum co founder.

3:25:20.280 --> 3:25:22.440
 Like, can you say something else?

3:25:22.440 --> 3:25:24.600
 Well, I think if I've learned anything from the internet,

3:25:24.600 --> 3:25:25.920
 you can't resist that kind of stuff.

3:25:25.920 --> 3:25:28.640
 You just have to say Elon, it's the joke.

3:25:28.640 --> 3:25:30.080
 You joke it away.

3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:30.960
 I've noticed this.

3:25:30.960 --> 3:25:32.560
 This is already starting to happen with me.

3:25:32.560 --> 3:25:34.240
 It's like, people just make up stuff.

3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:36.440
 They haven't made up anything interesting yet,

3:25:36.440 --> 3:25:38.040
 but they could.

3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:39.920
 And I've seen that with Bill Gates, for example,

3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:41.440
 just stuff being made up.

3:25:41.440 --> 3:25:43.120
 I mean, probably half of it is true.

3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:44.760
 Sorry, internet, I'm sorry.

3:25:44.760 --> 3:25:48.280
 But like, you know, I guess what I realized,

3:25:48.280 --> 3:25:49.720
 this is the dark side of memes,

3:25:49.720 --> 3:25:52.880
 is you can just make something up and it'll spread.

3:25:52.880 --> 3:25:53.720
 And then that's it.

3:25:53.720 --> 3:25:55.680
 And that's what happens.

3:25:55.680 --> 3:25:56.520
 But then...

3:25:56.520 --> 3:25:58.360
 And the problem is half the world will believe it.

3:25:58.360 --> 3:25:59.200
 Yeah.

3:25:59.200 --> 3:26:00.960
 It could be good stuff and it could be bad stuff.

3:26:00.960 --> 3:26:04.240
 So I guess the hope is it bounces on the end.

3:26:04.240 --> 3:26:06.760
 I tend to believe you almost want to play with that

3:26:06.760 --> 3:26:07.960
 and not take it seriously.

3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:10.000
 Just kind of laugh it off and enjoy life

3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:12.360
 and keep creating, keep doing awesome stuff.

3:26:12.360 --> 3:26:13.200
 Right.

3:26:13.200 --> 3:26:16.080
 Operating both in the physical space with other humans

3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:18.560
 and in the digital space with humans and AI systems

3:26:18.560 --> 3:26:19.560
 and just have fun.

3:26:19.560 --> 3:26:20.400
 Yeah.

3:26:20.400 --> 3:26:22.880
 Because most of us in the long arc of history

3:26:22.880 --> 3:26:24.000
 will be completely forgotten.

3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:26.040
 None of it will matter.

3:26:26.040 --> 3:26:29.800
 It'll all be some kind of just like H H Hacker's guide

3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:31.560
 into the galaxy will just be one sentence

3:26:31.560 --> 3:26:34.320
 that summarizes all of our existence.

3:26:34.320 --> 3:26:36.680
 And the sad thing is most of us

3:26:36.680 --> 3:26:38.880
 will not be part of that sentence or all of us.

3:26:38.880 --> 3:26:40.960
 Well, thanks for all the fish, Lex.

3:26:40.960 --> 3:26:42.000
 Thanks for all the fish.

3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:43.640
 The dolphins are running this thing.

3:26:43.640 --> 3:26:46.240
 And they're talking to the UFOs recently,

3:26:46.240 --> 3:26:48.040
 which is very interesting.

3:26:48.040 --> 3:26:50.560
 Because the UFOs keep going to the water.

3:26:50.560 --> 3:26:53.720
 So we humans assume that the UFOs are here to visit,

3:26:53.720 --> 3:26:55.160
 the aliens are here to visit us,

3:26:55.160 --> 3:26:56.320
 but it's probably the fish.

3:26:56.320 --> 3:26:58.560
 No, I just think it's next generation aircraft

3:26:58.560 --> 3:27:00.080
 that we're using.

3:27:00.080 --> 3:27:01.480
 Oh, that we're just not aware of.

3:27:01.480 --> 3:27:03.040
 But why are they talking to the fish?

3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:05.720
 Well, that's the place you test hypersonic aircraft

3:27:05.720 --> 3:27:06.640
 is over oceans.

3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:10.320
 So that's the Russians with their hypersonic nuclear weapons.

3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:11.160
 That's what we're watching.

3:27:11.160 --> 3:27:12.120
 Rod's from God, man.

3:27:12.120 --> 3:27:13.680
 Rod's from God.

3:27:13.680 --> 3:27:19.360
 So let me try to transition from UFOs to Abraham Lincoln.

3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:22.880
 Lincoln said that nearly all men can stand adversity.

3:27:22.880 --> 3:27:27.000
 But if you want to test a man's character, give him power.

3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:31.160
 Do you think power and money can corrupt most people?

3:27:31.160 --> 3:27:33.960
 And if so, do you worry of this corrupting force

3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:35.480
 on your own mind?

3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:40.360
 You're one of the leading minds in the cryptocurrency space.

3:27:40.360 --> 3:27:44.120
 You're the leader of the Cardano project.

3:27:44.120 --> 3:27:47.160
 You're the king of the rats.

3:27:47.160 --> 3:27:49.360
 Of the rats.

3:27:49.360 --> 3:27:51.000
 Does this corrupt your mind?

3:27:51.000 --> 3:27:53.240
 Both the power and the money of it?

3:27:53.240 --> 3:27:55.400
 Yeah, I mean, you see this most pervasively

3:27:55.400 --> 3:27:59.360
 with people who inherit a large amount of money or title

3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:02.480
 like dynasties like the melons or the Rockefellers

3:28:02.480 --> 3:28:03.240
 or other people.

3:28:03.240 --> 3:28:04.680
 The worst thing you can do to somebody

3:28:04.680 --> 3:28:06.600
 is just hand them an enormous amount of power

3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:08.800
 that they're not prepared for.

3:28:08.800 --> 3:28:11.880
 And the challenge with this space is like everybody's young.

3:28:11.880 --> 3:28:13.400
 And we're all billionaires now.

3:28:13.400 --> 3:28:14.920
 And we have these cult followings

3:28:14.920 --> 3:28:16.320
 and do all these things, right?

3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:18.000
 Nobody really says no to you.

3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:21.880
 Like for example, I have this ranch up in Wyoming

3:28:21.880 --> 3:28:23.760
 and it has 400 bison on it.

3:28:23.760 --> 3:28:25.880
 So now I'm a bison rancher.

3:28:25.880 --> 3:28:31.200
 If somebody was monitoring, auditing, that'd be like,

3:28:31.200 --> 3:28:32.360
 Charles, do you have any experience

3:28:32.360 --> 3:28:33.840
 racing taking care of bison?

3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:35.200
 I'd be like, no.

3:28:35.200 --> 3:28:36.640
 So you think it's really a good idea

3:28:36.640 --> 3:28:39.000
 to have this ranch with 400 bison running around.

3:28:39.000 --> 3:28:40.520
 What the hell are you going to do with bison?

3:28:40.520 --> 3:28:42.960
 Just have to figure out what I'm going to do with these bison.

3:28:42.960 --> 3:28:45.200
 So we'll make a video game.

3:28:45.200 --> 3:28:47.320
 We'll do crypto bison.

3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:49.480
 But you're going to get one.

3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:50.520
 I'm not pulling it.

3:28:50.520 --> 3:28:51.040
 Thank you.

3:28:51.040 --> 3:28:52.160
 I'd love to.

3:28:52.160 --> 3:28:53.680
 I'm not pulling it that string just yet.

3:28:53.680 --> 3:28:57.600
 So I'm wondering how you're going to connect this back to power.

3:28:57.600 --> 3:28:58.480
 Right.

3:28:58.480 --> 3:29:01.480
 And so my point is that when you are unrestrained,

3:29:01.480 --> 3:29:03.600
 like literally no one can say no,

3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:06.880
 or you have the ability to distort reality around yourself

3:29:06.880 --> 3:29:10.320
 and you're not constrained by social customs,

3:29:10.320 --> 3:29:16.200
 it creates a situation where you start losing perspective.

3:29:16.200 --> 3:29:17.920
 You're not grounded anymore, I think.

3:29:17.920 --> 3:29:20.720
 So it's less of a question of, will you become evil or not?

3:29:20.720 --> 3:29:22.880
 It's more of a question of, will you lose so much touch

3:29:22.880 --> 3:29:26.480
 with humanity that you just can't relate or understand people?

3:29:26.480 --> 3:29:28.400
 And then inadvertently, by your actions,

3:29:28.400 --> 3:29:31.240
 start harming people, either through the policies

3:29:31.240 --> 3:29:34.480
 that you pursue or the things that you start building

3:29:34.480 --> 3:29:35.960
 and so forth.

3:29:35.960 --> 3:29:38.800
 So I think the best inoculation against that

3:29:38.800 --> 3:29:40.880
 is to surround yourself with activities

3:29:40.880 --> 3:29:44.080
 that are utterly divorced from your reputation and status.

3:29:44.080 --> 3:29:46.800
 The best thing are animals and gardening.

3:29:46.800 --> 3:29:49.400
 Because a donkey doesn't care if you're a billionaire or broke,

3:29:49.400 --> 3:29:52.600
 he'll shit on you exactly the same way.

3:29:52.600 --> 3:29:55.840
 And so there's a humility behind these types of activities

3:29:55.840 --> 3:29:56.680
 and these things.

3:29:56.680 --> 3:30:00.560
 And there's an honest work component,

3:30:00.560 --> 3:30:03.360
 like when you grow hay or whatever, you have to plant.

3:30:03.360 --> 3:30:05.200
 You have to actually water, you have to irrigate,

3:30:05.200 --> 3:30:06.480
 you have to actually be there.

3:30:06.480 --> 3:30:08.280
 And you can't use some excuse while I was meeting

3:30:08.280 --> 3:30:09.680
 the president of El Salvador.

3:30:09.680 --> 3:30:10.600
 I was doing this.

3:30:10.600 --> 3:30:12.560
 I was like, hey, it doesn't give a shit.

3:30:12.560 --> 3:30:13.720
 It's heady, right?

3:30:13.720 --> 3:30:14.840
 So it grounds it connects you.

3:30:14.840 --> 3:30:17.240
 The other thing is you have to get used to giving away.

3:30:17.240 --> 3:30:19.000
 All the best things in my life

3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:21.400
 have come as a consequence of first giving.

3:30:21.400 --> 3:30:23.080
 Like I got started in the cryptocurrency space

3:30:23.080 --> 3:30:24.360
 by giving away a free class,

3:30:24.360 --> 3:30:26.560
 Bitcoin or how we learn to stop wearing your love crypto.

3:30:26.560 --> 3:30:28.200
 You did a free podcast, right?

3:30:28.200 --> 3:30:31.400
 In life, if you give and you develop that mindset

3:30:31.400 --> 3:30:33.960
 of I'm not attached to the things I have

3:30:33.960 --> 3:30:36.360
 and if push comes to shove, it goes away.

3:30:36.360 --> 3:30:37.800
 Usually you get more back.

3:30:37.800 --> 3:30:38.960
 Like I gave away all my ether,

3:30:38.960 --> 3:30:41.520
 I never received any of it, 293,000 ether.

3:30:41.520 --> 3:30:44.400
 At the all time high over $1.2 billion.

3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:46.120
 I give it to my secretary.

3:30:46.120 --> 3:30:48.040
 I had no idea if it was gonna be worth anything or not,

3:30:48.040 --> 3:30:49.200
 but he kind of got shafted.

3:30:49.200 --> 3:30:51.200
 And I was like, well, they don't like me.

3:30:51.200 --> 3:30:53.200
 So they don't like you by the transitive property

3:30:53.200 --> 3:30:54.240
 of relationships.

3:30:54.240 --> 3:30:55.680
 So you're screwed.

3:30:55.680 --> 3:30:56.840
 And he's like, well, I'm gonna go back

3:30:56.840 --> 3:30:58.520
 and my wife is probably gonna divorce me

3:30:58.520 --> 3:30:59.360
 and all this stuff.

3:30:59.360 --> 3:31:00.200
 And then what do I do?

3:31:00.200 --> 3:31:01.200
 And I said, well, I'll give you my ether.

3:31:01.200 --> 3:31:02.920
 I don't know if it's gonna be worth anything.

3:31:02.920 --> 3:31:05.320
 So, you know, he's still pretty good.

3:31:05.320 --> 3:31:07.560
 So, you know, but then again,

3:31:07.560 --> 3:31:10.280
 regardless of doing that, I now have Cardano.

3:31:10.280 --> 3:31:11.400
 I have this great career.

3:31:11.400 --> 3:31:12.800
 I've done all these amazing things.

3:31:12.800 --> 3:31:13.640
 So I think that's the,

3:31:13.640 --> 3:31:16.080
 there's a single best way of handling power

3:31:16.080 --> 3:31:19.560
 is you have to do things to keep yourself grounded.

3:31:19.560 --> 3:31:20.640
 In case of Washington,

3:31:20.640 --> 3:31:22.720
 he was deeply connected to Mount Vernon.

3:31:22.720 --> 3:31:23.800
 During the Revolutionary War,

3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:25.240
 he was like sending letters,

3:31:25.240 --> 3:31:26.880
 talking about the irrigation ditches

3:31:26.880 --> 3:31:28.480
 and the barn and things like that.

3:31:28.480 --> 3:31:29.960
 He was always connected to that.

3:31:29.960 --> 3:31:31.520
 And then also develop a mindset

3:31:31.520 --> 3:31:34.280
 that you're only here temporarily.

3:31:34.280 --> 3:31:35.720
 Everything you have is finite.

3:31:35.720 --> 3:31:37.720
 It's going to go away at some point.

3:31:37.720 --> 3:31:39.320
 No matter how much you want to keep it,

3:31:39.320 --> 3:31:42.480
 you will die and somebody else will have it.

3:31:42.480 --> 3:31:44.800
 So you live for the next generation.

3:31:44.800 --> 3:31:45.800
 You don't live for yourself.

3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:47.120
 You look to the future and you say,

3:31:47.120 --> 3:31:48.400
 what am I going to leave behind?

3:31:48.400 --> 3:31:50.000
 What am I going to transmit?

3:31:50.000 --> 3:31:51.920
 And then in that kind of mindset,

3:31:51.920 --> 3:31:54.960
 always forces you to be more gracious,

3:31:54.960 --> 3:31:57.160
 cooperative and collaborative with people.

3:31:57.160 --> 3:32:00.680
 All these dictators, they are egomaniacs

3:32:00.680 --> 3:32:02.880
 and they get connected to these fantasies

3:32:02.880 --> 3:32:04.080
 and they live for themselves.

3:32:04.080 --> 3:32:05.240
 Look at Xi and China.

3:32:05.240 --> 3:32:07.560
 He's unraveling a power structure

3:32:07.560 --> 3:32:10.560
 that was what made China, China today.

3:32:10.560 --> 3:32:11.600
 After Mao, they said,

3:32:11.600 --> 3:32:13.880
 we probably shouldn't have another one of those guys.

3:32:13.880 --> 3:32:16.160
 And so he said, let's build something

3:32:16.160 --> 3:32:17.880
 where there's checks and balances

3:32:17.880 --> 3:32:21.120
 and no one person is going to run the whole show

3:32:21.120 --> 3:32:24.360
 or else it'll descend and regress and we'll have problems.

3:32:24.360 --> 3:32:25.320
 And then what he's done,

3:32:25.320 --> 3:32:27.240
 he's thinking only about himself,

3:32:27.240 --> 3:32:29.160
 not the best interest of China.

3:32:29.160 --> 3:32:31.520
 So he's systematically unraveling a system

3:32:31.520 --> 3:32:34.440
 they've been embracing for over 40 years.

3:32:34.440 --> 3:32:35.800
 And to what end?

3:32:35.800 --> 3:32:37.720
 After he dies, the next guy who comes in,

3:32:37.720 --> 3:32:39.360
 even as Xi is super competent,

3:32:39.360 --> 3:32:41.440
 the next guy is going to horrifically abuse

3:32:41.440 --> 3:32:42.560
 that power structure.

3:32:42.560 --> 3:32:45.080
 And the same thing happened with the Romans.

3:32:45.080 --> 3:32:47.440
 After Augustus, the great emperor,

3:32:47.440 --> 3:32:50.360
 then suddenly down the line, you have Caligula and Nero

3:32:50.360 --> 3:32:51.800
 and all these other terrible emperors

3:32:51.800 --> 3:32:53.560
 that just destroyed everything

3:32:53.560 --> 3:32:56.480
 that the republic and the empire sought to achieve.

3:32:56.480 --> 3:32:58.800
 So you have to think for the future.

3:32:58.800 --> 3:33:01.040
 You have to think in institutions and systems.

3:33:01.040 --> 3:33:03.240
 You have to have things that ground yourself

3:33:03.240 --> 3:33:05.800
 and you have to be fully prepared to lose everything

3:33:05.800 --> 3:33:07.080
 and give up everything.

3:33:07.080 --> 3:33:10.040
 After I left Ethereum, I had nothing, okay?

3:33:10.040 --> 3:33:12.920
 Reputation was damaged, not a lot of money.

3:33:12.920 --> 3:33:14.120
 Nobody really want to work with me.

3:33:14.120 --> 3:33:16.560
 No one pick up a phone for two whole years.

3:33:16.560 --> 3:33:18.000
 It was horrible.

3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:21.040
 And so I was at bedrock in that experience.

3:33:21.040 --> 3:33:22.600
 And now look where I'm at.

3:33:22.600 --> 3:33:24.200
 I built all the way up to that.

3:33:24.200 --> 3:33:25.960
 And so that wasn't by accident.

3:33:25.960 --> 3:33:29.200
 It was, I had to surround myself with amazing people.

3:33:29.200 --> 3:33:31.320
 Why would amazing people want to surround themselves with me?

3:33:31.320 --> 3:33:34.440
 If I was this narcissistic asshole

3:33:34.440 --> 3:33:36.920
 who just looks like it's me, me, me,

3:33:36.920 --> 3:33:41.320
 everything would be a transactional relationship.

3:33:41.320 --> 3:33:43.200
 It would be, okay, we'll get as much as we can

3:33:43.200 --> 3:33:45.280
 and then run away as quickly as possible.

3:33:45.280 --> 3:33:47.640
 Instead, it was, I'm going to invest in you.

3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:49.480
 And maybe I'll win, maybe I won't win,

3:33:49.480 --> 3:33:51.600
 but I'll be the last guy to leave the boat.

3:33:51.600 --> 3:33:54.200
 If we're freezing to death, you get my coat

3:33:54.200 --> 3:33:57.560
 and I'll just deal with the cold, that kind of mindset.

3:33:57.560 --> 3:33:58.640
 You have to have that.

3:33:58.640 --> 3:33:59.880
 I got that from my dad.

3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:01.840
 He got it from his father.

3:34:01.840 --> 3:34:04.160
 You know, my grandfather and great grandfather,

3:34:04.160 --> 3:34:05.600
 my dad's, I grew up in Montana

3:34:05.600 --> 3:34:07.960
 and they were like products of the Homestead Act.

3:34:07.960 --> 3:34:09.520
 Very rough Montana.

3:34:09.520 --> 3:34:11.680
 You know, a lot of people died and froze to death

3:34:11.680 --> 3:34:13.280
 up there eating by animals or something.

3:34:13.280 --> 3:34:14.840
 They were shot by their neighbors

3:34:14.840 --> 3:34:18.040
 and nobody investigates anything because it's Montana.

3:34:18.040 --> 3:34:21.720
 So the only way you survive is by taking care of each other

3:34:21.720 --> 3:34:23.520
 and being a good member of that community.

3:34:23.520 --> 3:34:24.640
 And if somebody gets big,

3:34:24.640 --> 3:34:27.920
 you feel have this implicit desire to go and give back

3:34:27.920 --> 3:34:30.160
 and take care of the community that you came from

3:34:30.160 --> 3:34:31.560
 and invest in that community.

3:34:31.560 --> 3:34:32.960
 Like I came from the mathematical community.

3:34:32.960 --> 3:34:34.360
 I never completed a PhD,

3:34:34.360 --> 3:34:36.040
 but one of the things that I'm doing

3:34:36.040 --> 3:34:38.960
 is I'm going to put $20 million and set up a center

3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:40.360
 to do automated theorem proving

3:34:40.360 --> 3:34:42.440
 and we're going to heavily invest and lean

3:34:42.440 --> 3:34:44.640
 because I'm super excited about mechanizing math

3:34:44.640 --> 3:34:46.400
 and making machine understandable.

3:34:46.400 --> 3:34:48.320
 I know all these guys who do this work.

3:34:48.320 --> 3:34:51.360
 There's like all these mathematicians and computer scientists

3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:52.640
 and no one pays attention to them.

3:34:52.640 --> 3:34:54.680
 And they're kind of like the redheaded stepchildren

3:34:54.680 --> 3:34:57.280
 of mathematics and they live on the boundaries and periphery.

3:34:57.280 --> 3:34:58.880
 Meanwhile, they're super passionate

3:34:58.880 --> 3:35:01.240
 and they absolutely love what they do.

3:35:01.240 --> 3:35:05.200
 And if only they had the right resources,

3:35:05.200 --> 3:35:07.480
 within 50 or 100 years, what they're doing

3:35:07.480 --> 3:35:09.160
 can probably come the dominant model

3:35:09.160 --> 3:35:10.800
 of how to do mathematics.

3:35:10.800 --> 3:35:14.160
 So I'm now in a position where I have the financial means

3:35:14.160 --> 3:35:15.800
 to take care of these guys.

3:35:15.800 --> 3:35:18.040
 So all I have to do is just call them up and say,

3:35:18.040 --> 3:35:19.680
 hey, would you like to work with?

3:35:19.680 --> 3:35:20.840
 Oh, absolutely.

3:35:20.840 --> 3:35:22.840
 And cut a check and it's done.

3:35:22.840 --> 3:35:25.200
 So the interesting tension here,

3:35:25.200 --> 3:35:27.960
 so we talked about ways to prevent power

3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:30.240
 from corrupting a human being

3:35:30.240 --> 3:35:32.000
 that's in a leadership position.

3:35:32.000 --> 3:35:35.960
 There's an interesting case in the cryptocurrency space

3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:38.560
 of Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto

3:35:38.560 --> 3:35:40.840
 that basically doesn't have a leader.

3:35:40.840 --> 3:35:44.480
 So the benefit of a leader is somebody

3:35:44.480 --> 3:35:48.480
 that perhaps even when they don't carry power

3:35:48.480 --> 3:35:51.640
 maintains a little bit of a flame of vision.

3:35:51.640 --> 3:35:54.760
 I suppose Bitcoin has that

3:35:54.760 --> 3:35:57.800
 with the original work by Satoshi Nakamoto

3:35:57.800 --> 3:36:02.600
 and the sort of that, even though it's anonymous,

3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:05.120
 the idea still lives on through the community.

3:36:05.120 --> 3:36:08.400
 But nevertheless, the leader is anonymous.

3:36:08.400 --> 3:36:11.960
 Do you think this is an interesting case study

3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:16.880
 about leadership is for the leader to maintain anonymity?

3:36:16.880 --> 3:36:19.320
 It was a saying from Sun Tzu paraphrasing it,

3:36:19.320 --> 3:36:22.280
 the best leaders are felt but never seen.

3:36:22.280 --> 3:36:24.160
 Yeah, so I think that's exactly right.

3:36:24.160 --> 3:36:26.640
 The less the leader can be in the room

3:36:26.640 --> 3:36:28.800
 and the more the principles of the leader are in the room,

3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:29.880
 the better for the firm.

3:36:29.880 --> 3:36:32.440
 Because what you're doing is creating more leaders that way.

3:36:32.440 --> 3:36:35.000
 You're inspiring the next generation, the next wave,

3:36:35.000 --> 3:36:38.480
 the next circle out to act with those principles

3:36:38.480 --> 3:36:41.120
 but contribute in their own way and their own flair.

3:36:41.120 --> 3:36:43.000
 And so you gain collective intelligence

3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:44.120
 inside the organization

3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:45.760
 instead of just constraining yourself

3:36:45.760 --> 3:36:48.200
 to however the great the leader can be.

3:36:48.200 --> 3:36:50.560
 The other side of it is if the leader's principles

3:36:50.560 --> 3:36:52.720
 are too strong, so this is the dark side of it,

3:36:52.720 --> 3:36:54.320
 you end up with what's happened in Disney

3:36:54.320 --> 3:36:57.040
 with Walt Disney after he died for like 20 years.

3:36:57.040 --> 3:36:58.160
 People say, well, we don't do that

3:36:58.160 --> 3:37:00.560
 because Walt Disney wouldn't do it that way.

3:37:00.560 --> 3:37:02.160
 Or to a lesser extent, Apple.

3:37:02.160 --> 3:37:03.280
 They say, oh, we don't do that

3:37:03.280 --> 3:37:05.360
 because Steve Jobs wouldn't do it that way.

3:37:05.360 --> 3:37:07.440
 Well, he's dead, he's gone, move on.

3:37:07.440 --> 3:37:10.560
 So somebody I think asked you whether you're a clone

3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:13.960
 or a deep fake and you said that you admitted,

3:37:13.960 --> 3:37:17.280
 you slipped up on video saying that you're a deep fake.

3:37:17.280 --> 3:37:18.400
 So on that top.

3:37:18.400 --> 3:37:20.840
 I'm actually a poker playing robot that escaped a lab.

3:37:20.840 --> 3:37:22.240
 The truth finally comes out.

3:37:22.240 --> 3:37:23.640
 But I said on that topic,

3:37:23.640 --> 3:37:25.600
 who do you think is Satoshi Nakamoto?

3:37:25.600 --> 3:37:29.160
 Is it possible that you are in fact, Satoshi Nakamoto?

3:37:29.160 --> 3:37:30.000
 No.

3:37:32.320 --> 3:37:35.720
 If you have a preponderance of the evidence,

3:37:35.720 --> 3:37:39.040
 I think the most likely candidate would be Adam Back.

3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:41.120
 It's the Occam's razor candidate.

3:37:41.120 --> 3:37:43.760
 And mostly because he's the right place, right time,

3:37:43.760 --> 3:37:46.040
 right age, right skill set.

3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:48.440
 If you look at the design of Bitcoin,

3:37:48.440 --> 3:37:50.520
 the types of decisions like the use of fourth,

3:37:50.520 --> 3:37:52.000
 the scripting language,

3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:53.440
 that was pretty common in English

3:37:53.440 --> 3:37:56.080
 and European pedagogy in the 1980s and 1990s.

3:37:56.080 --> 3:37:58.880
 It's like an example language for a stack based assembly.

3:37:58.880 --> 3:38:01.760
 And like little stuff like that, little quirks like that.

3:38:01.760 --> 3:38:03.040
 Also he created HashCash,

3:38:03.040 --> 3:38:05.200
 which was the predecessor of Proof of Work.

3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:06.560
 He just kind of got a chip on his shoulder

3:38:06.560 --> 3:38:08.800
 that Microsoft never did anything with it.

3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:10.200
 So he's probably looking for something.

3:38:10.200 --> 3:38:11.760
 He grew up with all the cipherpunks.

3:38:11.760 --> 3:38:13.600
 He knew of Hal Fennie.

3:38:13.600 --> 3:38:15.240
 He knew of all these people.

3:38:15.240 --> 3:38:16.080
 He knew Phil Zimmerman.

3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:17.160
 You don't think it's Hal Fennie?

3:38:17.160 --> 3:38:20.960
 Well, no, because the code was not good enough.

3:38:20.960 --> 3:38:23.160
 Hal was a Unix, Linux guy.

3:38:23.160 --> 3:38:24.880
 He was a talented programmer.

3:38:24.880 --> 3:38:26.480
 He was a talented developer.

3:38:26.480 --> 3:38:27.960
 The initial code for Bitcoin

3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:30.400
 was developed to look like on a Windows machine.

3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:33.560
 You know, Adam worked at Microsoft, go figure.

3:38:33.560 --> 3:38:35.200
 And also it was very academic.

3:38:35.200 --> 3:38:36.320
 And it had to be cleaned up

3:38:36.320 --> 3:38:38.920
 and a lot of things had to be patched up and fixed.

3:38:38.920 --> 3:38:40.840
 If it got like Hal developed it,

3:38:40.840 --> 3:38:43.760
 it probably had less of the, you know,

3:38:43.760 --> 3:38:47.400
 let's use secp246k1 and these types of things

3:38:47.400 --> 3:38:48.520
 and more of like,

3:38:48.520 --> 3:38:50.760
 hey, let's build this cool engineering thing

3:38:50.760 --> 3:38:53.280
 and we'll figure out the protocol design later on.

3:38:53.280 --> 3:38:56.520
 It just stinks of an older academic,

3:38:56.520 --> 3:38:58.000
 the initial design of Bitcoin

3:38:58.000 --> 3:38:59.480
 and the initial rollout of Bitcoin.

3:38:59.480 --> 3:39:02.000
 And then brilliant people like Greg Maxwell and others,

3:39:02.000 --> 3:39:03.840
 they came and cleaned it all up.

3:39:03.840 --> 3:39:05.520
 And lo and behold, where is Adam?

3:39:05.520 --> 3:39:08.360
 It's like the CEO of the largest Bitcoin development company

3:39:08.360 --> 3:39:10.520
 in the space who's trying to keep working on

3:39:10.520 --> 3:39:11.720
 and building out Bitcoin.

3:39:11.720 --> 3:39:14.840
 And where the hell was Adam when Satoshi was around?

3:39:14.840 --> 3:39:17.080
 I don't think there was any overlap

3:39:17.080 --> 3:39:19.640
 where they were both together at the same period of time.

3:39:19.640 --> 3:39:21.000
 But I mean, if you really care,

3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:22.760
 you can even do this.

3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:25.320
 There's a lovely paper written by the US Army.

3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:28.520
 If you just Google like code, stalometry, US Army,

3:39:28.520 --> 3:39:31.720
 it's a technique where you can use ML

3:39:31.720 --> 3:39:33.720
 and a few other things to actually kind of develop

3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:36.320
 a fingerprint for the way that people write code.

3:39:36.320 --> 3:39:39.320
 So all you gotta do is take the original Bitcoin source code

3:39:39.320 --> 3:39:41.640
 and then take all the open source repos

3:39:41.640 --> 3:39:43.680
 from around that time period and before

3:39:43.680 --> 3:39:46.640
 and see if there's a match between those two.

3:39:46.640 --> 3:39:49.600
 Now, if he's really good at creating an alias,

3:39:49.600 --> 3:39:53.120
 probably not so good at obfuscating the code that was written.

3:39:53.120 --> 3:39:55.360
 So the odds are that you'd probably find a match

3:39:55.360 --> 3:39:58.160
 to a repo that's connected to a real life human identity

3:39:58.160 --> 3:40:00.360
 or at least a weaker Opssec

3:40:00.360 --> 3:40:03.040
 because you're younger, you have weaker Opssec.

3:40:03.040 --> 3:40:04.200
 Do you know if people have tried that?

3:40:04.200 --> 3:40:05.800
 I don't think anybody's actually done it,

3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:07.320
 but there's actually a beautiful paper.

3:40:07.320 --> 3:40:09.720
 It's like 94% accurate, the code stalometry.

3:40:09.720 --> 3:40:14.320
 The code stalometry, so for various reasons,

3:40:14.320 --> 3:40:16.320
 I've worked with people that work on stalometry

3:40:16.320 --> 3:40:17.760
 of natural language.

3:40:17.760 --> 3:40:22.280
 Okay, and I think it matches closest to Nick Sabo

3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:26.480
 if you actually do the written stalometry analysis

3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:28.440
 of Satoshi's writings to Salvatore.

3:40:28.440 --> 3:40:30.080
 So I meant stalometry as a field.

3:40:30.080 --> 3:40:31.840
 I didn't actually look for application

3:40:31.840 --> 3:40:33.600
 for this particular problem,

3:40:33.600 --> 3:40:36.520
 but so you're saying Nick Sabo is the closest match.

3:40:36.520 --> 3:40:37.840
 Yeah, somebody did it years ago.

3:40:37.840 --> 3:40:39.840
 I didn't look at if the model was a sound or not,

3:40:39.840 --> 3:40:41.520
 but I just remember reading on a Bitcoin talk

3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:44.240
 and Sabo is another one of the common candidates.

3:40:44.240 --> 3:40:48.000
 How many Sabo and Adam are probably the top three things

3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:48.840
 that people could list.

3:40:48.840 --> 3:40:51.080
 What do you think about this idea of anonymity,

3:40:51.080 --> 3:40:53.040
 of publishing something anonymously?

3:40:53.040 --> 3:40:55.080
 Would you ever consider publishing a paper?

3:40:55.080 --> 3:40:59.680
 You've been part of, I mean, the Cardano ecosystem

3:40:59.680 --> 3:41:01.840
 has published a lot of incredible papers.

3:41:01.840 --> 3:41:04.080
 Is there ever a value to publish anonymously?

3:41:04.080 --> 3:41:06.960
 Well, every paper that goes through the referee process,

3:41:06.960 --> 3:41:08.400
 the authors are ripped off.

3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:10.320
 So you don't actually see the authorship

3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:12.360
 when you submit to the conference.

3:41:12.360 --> 3:41:14.360
 So that's just best practice.

3:41:14.360 --> 3:41:15.200
 But the question is,

3:41:15.200 --> 3:41:17.000
 do you preserve the anonymity post conference

3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:20.160
 and actually not reveal the author of the paper?

3:41:20.160 --> 3:41:22.920
 It's a detriment for the deals we make

3:41:22.920 --> 3:41:25.640
 because the whole premise of working with our company

3:41:25.640 --> 3:41:28.920
 as an academic is that you're gonna have amazing coauthors

3:41:28.920 --> 3:41:31.080
 and your work is gonna appear in great conferences,

3:41:31.080 --> 3:41:33.840
 great journals, and as a consequence, you get tenure.

3:41:33.840 --> 3:41:35.920
 If you publish anonymously,

3:41:35.920 --> 3:41:38.360
 it's like being like doing clearance work

3:41:38.360 --> 3:41:40.280
 in high energy physics or something like that.

3:41:40.280 --> 3:41:42.800
 It's like, after 30 years of this amazing career

3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:45.640
 working on nuclear weapons and classified reactors,

3:41:45.640 --> 3:41:48.080
 you finish and then you go to apply for a job

3:41:48.080 --> 3:41:48.920
 and they're like, so what have you done

3:41:48.920 --> 3:41:50.000
 for the last 30 years?

3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:53.520
 Stuff, where is it on your CV?

3:41:53.520 --> 3:41:55.200
 Well, I can't really talk about it.

3:41:55.200 --> 3:41:57.600
 Okay, welcome to community college.

3:41:57.600 --> 3:41:59.760
 So you get really screwed if you do that.

3:41:59.760 --> 3:42:01.600
 So there's a misalignment of incentives

3:42:01.600 --> 3:42:04.560
 in the academic world towards anonymity.

3:42:04.560 --> 3:42:06.200
 And generally it's only done

3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:08.640
 when you're doing something very controversial

3:42:08.640 --> 3:42:10.960
 or there's a whistleblowing type of a component.

3:42:10.960 --> 3:42:13.680
 It's not typically done for foundational work.

3:42:13.680 --> 3:42:15.440
 And Satoshi was really one of the first things

3:42:15.440 --> 3:42:17.720
 because like if there was a Satoshi dox themselves,

3:42:17.720 --> 3:42:19.600
 and I don't think it's possible anymore,

3:42:19.600 --> 3:42:21.600
 but if he or she did that,

3:42:21.600 --> 3:42:24.440
 that's like a Nobel Prize in economics, likely.

3:42:24.440 --> 3:42:26.560
 You're on the shortlist for that.

3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:28.440
 And there's enormous accolades

3:42:28.440 --> 3:42:30.480
 that would come beyond the monetary incentives

3:42:30.480 --> 3:42:32.680
 of being able to dox yourself.

3:42:32.680 --> 3:42:37.240
 But that'd be cool if they give a Nobel Prize in economics

3:42:37.240 --> 3:42:39.400
 to an anonymous, to Satoshi Nakamoto.

3:42:39.400 --> 3:42:41.640
 It's been proposed and it was turned down.

3:42:41.640 --> 3:42:43.760
 Yeah, so yeah, I mean,

3:42:43.760 --> 3:42:45.160
 there are a few people in our company

3:42:45.160 --> 3:42:47.480
 that have done Sadonymous publications

3:42:47.480 --> 3:42:49.800
 like the, if you look at the Chimerical Edgers paper,

3:42:49.800 --> 3:42:52.560
 that's a, it's not a real name, it's a crazy name.

3:42:52.560 --> 3:42:55.240
 It's a Sadonymous publication.

3:42:55.240 --> 3:42:58.360
 And you know, but that's usually for throwaway work.

3:42:58.360 --> 3:42:59.920
 There is one project we inherited

3:42:59.920 --> 3:43:02.160
 from an anonymous person, which is fascinating.

3:43:02.160 --> 3:43:03.720
 It's called Qedidas.

3:43:03.720 --> 3:43:05.520
 And it's basically an extension

3:43:05.520 --> 3:43:08.040
 of the QED manifesto from the 90s.

3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:10.120
 And the pseudonym is Bill White.

3:43:10.120 --> 3:43:12.160
 And I think it's some anonymous mathematician,

3:43:12.160 --> 3:43:14.120
 but I can't figure out which one it is.

3:43:14.120 --> 3:43:16.320
 But basically it's a marketplace for deduction.

3:43:16.320 --> 3:43:19.080
 So it's like a, so it's like this magic machine

3:43:19.080 --> 3:43:20.880
 where you can create incentives for people

3:43:20.880 --> 3:43:23.080
 to write mathematical proofs and a theorem prover

3:43:23.080 --> 3:43:24.400
 and make some money from it.

3:43:24.400 --> 3:43:26.760
 So there's some cool work that's there.

3:43:26.760 --> 3:43:29.080
 And it's sad that Bill stayed anonymous

3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:31.000
 because I think that could have been easily published.

3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:32.240
 And there was a lot of really cool things

3:43:32.240 --> 3:43:34.400
 that could have been done with Qedidas.

3:43:34.400 --> 3:43:36.360
 So you did say the success of Cardano,

3:43:36.360 --> 3:43:38.880
 sort of the vision you have is for you

3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:41.320
 to have less and less power over time.

3:43:41.320 --> 3:43:43.720
 So this idea of governance,

3:43:43.720 --> 3:43:45.960
 what's your vision for a decentralized,

3:43:45.960 --> 3:43:47.440
 secure governance system?

3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:49.400
 So the first thing you have to do

3:43:49.400 --> 3:43:51.600
 is you got to look at meaningful metrics,

3:43:51.600 --> 3:43:53.000
 not vanity metrics.

3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:55.840
 So what does it mean to have legitimacy

3:43:55.840 --> 3:43:56.680
 in a governance system?

3:43:56.680 --> 3:43:58.520
 You can build any governance system you want.

3:43:58.520 --> 3:43:59.840
 You have a dictator, right?

3:43:59.840 --> 3:44:01.240
 Like Bob is in charge.

3:44:01.240 --> 3:44:03.200
 It's like, whether you like Bob or not,

3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:04.320
 he's in charge.

3:44:04.320 --> 3:44:05.560
 It's not very legitimate.

3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:06.920
 And you can have pure democracy

3:44:06.920 --> 3:44:08.440
 where every single person votes

3:44:08.440 --> 3:44:10.280
 and then nothing ever gets done.

3:44:10.280 --> 3:44:12.880
 County dog catcher is like a six year election

3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:14.120
 or something like that.

3:44:14.120 --> 3:44:15.280
 So there's a spectrum there

3:44:15.280 --> 3:44:17.320
 between absolute power to one

3:44:17.320 --> 3:44:20.200
 and perfectly egalitarian power

3:44:20.200 --> 3:44:23.480
 to every single potential participant inside the system.

3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:24.960
 And then the question is, okay,

3:44:24.960 --> 3:44:28.200
 well, how do you handle choice architecture in that?

3:44:28.200 --> 3:44:31.960
 So like, are you asking your people about every question?

3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:33.240
 Or are you asking your people

3:44:33.240 --> 3:44:34.560
 about a subset of questions

3:44:34.560 --> 3:44:36.360
 related to a particular set of topics,

3:44:36.360 --> 3:44:38.720
 but then they're not allowed to talk about other topics?

3:44:38.720 --> 3:44:40.720
 Like for example, are they allowed to change the tax rate

3:44:40.720 --> 3:44:42.520
 but they can't change freedom of speech?

3:44:42.520 --> 3:44:43.760
 That kind of a thing.

3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:45.800
 So the first thing you have to do

3:44:45.800 --> 3:44:47.240
 when you build these types of systems

3:44:47.240 --> 3:44:48.960
 and they get to a certain scale

3:44:48.960 --> 3:44:50.840
 is you have to build some mechanism

3:44:50.840 --> 3:44:52.760
 for people who are interested in governance

3:44:52.760 --> 3:44:54.960
 to self select and participate.

3:44:54.960 --> 3:44:56.800
 Just create a collection bucket.

3:44:56.800 --> 3:44:58.440
 In Bitcoin, we had Bitcoin talk

3:44:58.440 --> 3:44:59.920
 and Bitcoin Reddit and these things

3:44:59.920 --> 3:45:02.160
 and eventually the GitHub repos and these things,

3:45:02.160 --> 3:45:04.720
 there was a place to go if you were interested.

3:45:04.720 --> 3:45:06.720
 And you need some sort of change management system

3:45:06.720 --> 3:45:08.760
 where people who want to evolve the system

3:45:08.760 --> 3:45:10.480
 can write it down in a very careful way.

3:45:10.480 --> 3:45:11.400
 So in Bitcoin's case,

3:45:11.400 --> 3:45:12.880
 it was Bitcoin improvement proposal

3:45:12.880 --> 3:45:15.520
 and Ethereum, it's the Ethereum improvement proposal.

3:45:15.520 --> 3:45:16.600
 And for us, it's the SIP,

3:45:16.600 --> 3:45:18.320
 the Cardano improvement proposal.

3:45:18.320 --> 3:45:19.400
 But it's just a structured way

3:45:19.400 --> 3:45:21.320
 of discussing how you wish to change.

3:45:21.320 --> 3:45:22.800
 Then there's a question of,

3:45:22.800 --> 3:45:25.800
 do you want to do this implicitly or explicitly?

3:45:25.800 --> 3:45:27.600
 In the case of Bitcoin and Ethereum,

3:45:27.600 --> 3:45:28.840
 it's an implicit system.

3:45:28.840 --> 3:45:30.760
 So there's no on chain voting,

3:45:30.760 --> 3:45:32.760
 there's no like five people said this

3:45:32.760 --> 3:45:34.880
 and four people said this, so we do this.

3:45:34.880 --> 3:45:35.720
 In the case of Cardano,

3:45:35.720 --> 3:45:37.520
 we're actually explicitly inviting this.

3:45:37.520 --> 3:45:39.280
 This is one of the biggest differentiators

3:45:39.280 --> 3:45:41.560
 between Cardano, Polkadotios and these other things

3:45:41.560 --> 3:45:43.800
 is that we're really serious about governance

3:45:43.800 --> 3:45:46.160
 to the extent that we're actually doing

3:45:46.160 --> 3:45:47.920
 foundational research in eVoting.

3:45:47.920 --> 3:45:49.480
 We're building new voting systems,

3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:52.040
 we're exploring preference voting and quadratic voting.

3:45:52.040 --> 3:45:53.240
 And the long and the short is

3:45:53.240 --> 3:45:54.920
 that we want more and more people

3:45:54.920 --> 3:45:57.720
 to participate in voting for things.

3:45:57.720 --> 3:45:59.600
 And you have to start somewhere.

3:45:59.600 --> 3:46:02.640
 So our hypothesis is we can bootstrap the system

3:46:02.640 --> 3:46:05.800
 with the treasury system.

3:46:05.800 --> 3:46:09.040
 So in Cardano, some of the inflation goes

3:46:09.040 --> 3:46:10.040
 to the block producers,

3:46:10.040 --> 3:46:11.760
 just like any other cryptocurrency,

3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:14.480
 but some goes into a decentralized treasury,

3:46:14.480 --> 3:46:17.240
 which has over a billion dollars of ADA in it.

3:46:17.240 --> 3:46:18.680
 So it's a lot of money.

3:46:18.680 --> 3:46:20.680
 And that treasury is not on our mind control

3:46:20.680 --> 3:46:22.080
 or the foundation's control,

3:46:22.080 --> 3:46:24.840
 it's actually controlled by the community as a whole.

3:46:24.840 --> 3:46:26.400
 Through a program called Catalyst.

3:46:26.400 --> 3:46:28.000
 And so all these people can come together,

3:46:28.000 --> 3:46:29.440
 they can submit spending ballots

3:46:29.440 --> 3:46:32.440
 and other people who hold ADA can vote to approve that.

3:46:32.440 --> 3:46:34.560
 What's nice about it is you have a growth engine

3:46:34.560 --> 3:46:36.760
 to improve two accesses.

3:46:36.760 --> 3:46:38.680
 One is absolute participation.

3:46:38.680 --> 3:46:40.640
 So increase the amount of people

3:46:40.640 --> 3:46:42.240
 who hold ADA participating.

3:46:42.240 --> 3:46:44.400
 So the absolute number of people participating.

3:46:44.400 --> 3:46:46.680
 And the other is meaningful participation.

3:46:46.680 --> 3:46:48.200
 So the depth of participation.

3:46:48.200 --> 3:46:49.880
 Did you just show up and vote?

3:46:49.880 --> 3:46:53.320
 Or did you spend hours debating things on idea scale,

3:46:53.320 --> 3:46:54.960
 the innovation management platform,

3:46:54.960 --> 3:46:56.640
 interacting with the funding proposal,

3:46:56.640 --> 3:46:57.880
 going back and forth.

3:46:57.880 --> 3:47:00.360
 And there's dozens of little things like that.

3:47:00.360 --> 3:47:02.920
 Now my hypothesis is if you run this with enough iterations,

3:47:02.920 --> 3:47:05.320
 eventually you get to a certain critical mass,

3:47:05.320 --> 3:47:07.600
 like over 50% absolute participation

3:47:07.600 --> 3:47:09.920
 and a high level of meaningful participation,

3:47:09.920 --> 3:47:12.120
 where you can move beyond funding

3:47:12.120 --> 3:47:14.720
 and you can start actually having meaningful questions

3:47:14.720 --> 3:47:17.520
 about protocol design and improvement proposals

3:47:17.520 --> 3:47:18.360
 and so forth.

3:47:18.360 --> 3:47:20.240
 And then what you can do is you can roll out

3:47:20.240 --> 3:47:22.760
 new voting systems and new social structures.

3:47:22.760 --> 3:47:25.080
 And you can let them start voting on training wheels

3:47:25.080 --> 3:47:26.120
 like system parameters.

3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:28.200
 Like for example, the minimum transaction fee

3:47:28.200 --> 3:47:30.280
 or that K parameter for the amount of stake pools

3:47:30.280 --> 3:47:32.080
 or these types of things.

3:47:32.080 --> 3:47:34.040
 Then they build enough competency there

3:47:34.040 --> 3:47:35.640
 and they move up a next level

3:47:35.640 --> 3:47:37.440
 and they actually start talking about hard forks

3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:40.320
 using the update system, the hard fork combinator system.

3:47:40.320 --> 3:47:41.160
 See, so that's how you.

3:47:41.160 --> 3:47:42.760
 Voting on a hard fork.

3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:43.960
 Voting on a hard fork.

3:47:43.960 --> 3:47:46.280
 You can't do it unless your social dynamics are right

3:47:46.280 --> 3:47:47.400
 and your voting system is right.

3:47:47.400 --> 3:47:49.480
 And by the way, you also need to write a constitution

3:47:49.480 --> 3:47:50.800
 around the same time.

3:47:50.800 --> 3:47:53.400
 Because not all hard forks are created equally.

3:47:53.400 --> 3:47:55.160
 The kinds of things that would add support

3:47:55.160 --> 3:47:57.440
 for a new cryptographic primitive

3:47:57.440 --> 3:47:59.200
 are distinctly different from the kinds of things

3:47:59.200 --> 3:48:02.000
 that would change your monetary policy of the system.

3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:04.600
 So the constitution would be written

3:48:04.600 --> 3:48:05.760
 and maybe you can comment on

3:48:05.760 --> 3:48:09.000
 what is the innovation management proposal system?

3:48:09.000 --> 3:48:11.120
 So we partnered with a company called IdeaScale

3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:13.280
 and they run a kind of a side platform.

3:48:13.280 --> 3:48:14.960
 So people are interested.

3:48:14.960 --> 3:48:16.840
 They kind of, that's kind of our version of a forum.

3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:18.520
 They sign up and there's special tools

3:48:18.520 --> 3:48:21.240
 on that platform for discussions that are productive.

3:48:21.240 --> 3:48:22.080
 So they don't descend it

3:48:22.080 --> 3:48:24.480
 to kind of like trolley Reddit style conversations,

3:48:24.480 --> 3:48:25.640
 but they're much more focused

3:48:25.640 --> 3:48:28.280
 around how's your product building out.

3:48:28.280 --> 3:48:29.920
 And by the way, we're gonna add more infrastructure

3:48:29.920 --> 3:48:30.760
 over time.

3:48:30.760 --> 3:48:32.440
 In fact, our chief of staff, Tamara Hasson,

3:48:32.440 --> 3:48:35.400
 she's working on setting up an incubator and accelerator.

3:48:35.400 --> 3:48:36.960
 And we have lots of cool partners

3:48:36.960 --> 3:48:38.200
 we've talked with in that space.

3:48:38.200 --> 3:48:39.520
 And it's the same concept.

3:48:39.520 --> 3:48:41.040
 Your idea comes in,

3:48:41.040 --> 3:48:43.200
 what enters the system should not be

3:48:43.200 --> 3:48:44.760
 what gets approved on the other side.

3:48:44.760 --> 3:48:46.280
 It should go through some sort of gauntlet,

3:48:46.280 --> 3:48:47.640
 some sort of crucible

3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:49.160
 where you iterate your way through

3:48:49.160 --> 3:48:51.840
 and there's all kinds of optimizations and upgrades

3:48:51.840 --> 3:48:54.520
 and evolutions and combinations and destructions

3:48:54.520 --> 3:48:55.360
 that occur.

3:48:55.360 --> 3:48:56.480
 And then by the time you get to the other side

3:48:56.480 --> 3:48:58.560
 either the idea just dies on the vine

3:48:58.560 --> 3:48:59.760
 because it was a bad idea

3:48:59.760 --> 3:49:01.760
 or it's a significantly stronger,

3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:03.080
 far more fundable thing

3:49:03.080 --> 3:49:05.320
 and potentially even gets attached with accountability.

3:49:05.320 --> 3:49:06.960
 So you don't just fund the idea.

3:49:06.960 --> 3:49:09.560
 You'd actually fund the auditor at the same time

3:49:09.560 --> 3:49:10.920
 who actually holds the person accountable

3:49:10.920 --> 3:49:12.880
 because the blockchain is not a real company.

3:49:12.880 --> 3:49:14.720
 It's a ethereal thing.

3:49:14.720 --> 3:49:16.960
 You need a counterparty to hold someone accountable

3:49:16.960 --> 3:49:18.880
 who's real for that type of stuff

3:49:18.880 --> 3:49:20.000
 and that type of funding.

3:49:20.000 --> 3:49:21.440
 So that's what we're doing this year.

3:49:21.440 --> 3:49:23.120
 It's like we have a whole team of people,

3:49:23.120 --> 3:49:25.720
 partners like Governance Live and IdeaScale

3:49:25.720 --> 3:49:27.000
 and papers we've written

3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:30.600
 and about 30, 40,000 people regularly participating in this.

3:49:30.600 --> 3:49:32.480
 So it's a huge social experiment

3:49:32.480 --> 3:49:34.280
 and we're learning an enormous amount

3:49:34.280 --> 3:49:35.840
 and then our goal is by the end of the year

3:49:35.840 --> 3:49:37.560
 to have a meaningful percentage

3:49:37.560 --> 3:49:39.760
 of the entire cardinal population inside of it,

3:49:39.760 --> 3:49:41.400
 like 40, 50%.

3:49:41.400 --> 3:49:42.680
 Then once you're at that threshold,

3:49:42.680 --> 3:49:46.320
 now you have democratic majority of the entire system

3:49:46.320 --> 3:49:48.040
 and you can have a real conversation about,

3:49:48.040 --> 3:49:50.280
 okay, how do we write a constitution

3:49:50.280 --> 3:49:51.520
 for this type of a system?

3:49:51.520 --> 3:49:53.160
 And sorry to interrupt,

3:49:53.160 --> 3:49:54.640
 but so the constitution,

3:49:54.640 --> 3:49:57.440
 people still argue about it because natural language,

3:49:57.440 --> 3:49:58.800
 much like poetry,

3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:00.680
 lends itself to multiple interpretations.

3:50:00.680 --> 3:50:03.880
 Is it possible to formalize some of these ideas

3:50:03.880 --> 3:50:07.560
 that reduce the ambiguity?

3:50:07.560 --> 3:50:09.000
 Everything is old is new again.

3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:12.120
 We were talking about loge bond back in the day, right?

3:50:12.120 --> 3:50:14.600
 So there's definitely formal languages

3:50:14.600 --> 3:50:15.960
 you can use to express these things.

3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:17.840
 That's why I'm so interested in things like address

3:50:17.840 --> 3:50:21.000
 and Coq and Acta and theorem proving

3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:23.000
 because that's exactly what you're attempting to do

3:50:23.000 --> 3:50:27.440
 is to express some concept or desire or construction

3:50:27.440 --> 3:50:29.080
 in a language that's machine understandable

3:50:29.080 --> 3:50:30.160
 and manipulatable.

3:50:30.160 --> 3:50:33.320
 In particular, how does the system know its own design?

3:50:33.320 --> 3:50:35.480
 So what is the reference of a cryptocurrency?

3:50:35.480 --> 3:50:37.160
 Usually it's a canonical code base,

3:50:37.160 --> 3:50:40.040
 like here's Bitcoin Core and the C++ code

3:50:40.040 --> 3:50:42.640
 is that is the canonical code base.

3:50:42.640 --> 3:50:43.720
 But actually that's not right.

3:50:43.720 --> 3:50:46.360
 You should have specifications, blueprints

3:50:46.360 --> 3:50:47.840
 that are implementation agnostic

3:50:47.840 --> 3:50:49.160
 as your canonical code base.

3:50:49.160 --> 3:50:51.360
 And can your system know those specifications,

3:50:51.360 --> 3:50:52.840
 understand those specifications

3:50:52.840 --> 3:50:55.560
 and can your change management system be for that?

3:50:55.560 --> 3:50:57.120
 And then can you provide a proof

3:50:57.120 --> 3:51:00.360
 that your client is by similar to that specification?

3:51:00.360 --> 3:51:02.160
 So that's 10 years in the future,

3:51:02.160 --> 3:51:05.240
 but that's where you would go with that kind of a concept.

3:51:05.240 --> 3:51:08.800
 But you're tending towards the formalism?

3:51:08.800 --> 3:51:10.800
 Eventually, but that's not necessary

3:51:10.800 --> 3:51:12.280
 for the system in the short term.

3:51:12.280 --> 3:51:14.920
 It's good enough just to have,

3:51:14.920 --> 3:51:17.720
 I know in a winner and say the Haskell client is that.

3:51:17.720 --> 3:51:21.240
 And then what you basically do is you vote on a SIP

3:51:21.240 --> 3:51:23.280
 and then once it's approved,

3:51:23.280 --> 3:51:24.480
 then you go and implement that.

3:51:24.480 --> 3:51:26.560
 And there's some mechanism to trigger the update system

3:51:26.560 --> 3:51:27.680
 to update the reference client.

3:51:27.680 --> 3:51:29.200
 Do you have an example of a SIP,

3:51:29.200 --> 3:51:31.120
 a Cardano Improvement Proposal?

3:51:31.120 --> 3:51:34.320
 Yeah, like the Kurt Benefit Pledge, SIP 007.

3:51:34.320 --> 3:51:37.240
 So the...

3:51:37.240 --> 3:51:38.360
 007.

3:51:38.360 --> 3:51:40.880
 Yeah, everybody loves that.

3:51:40.880 --> 3:51:41.720
 Yeah.

3:51:41.720 --> 3:51:44.400
 I'm gonna change my luggage code now, Lex.

3:51:44.400 --> 3:51:45.240
 What is that?

3:51:45.240 --> 3:51:50.120
 Yeah, so basically it just has to do with the Pledge.

3:51:50.120 --> 3:51:52.360
 So Pledge is a certain amount of ADA

3:51:52.360 --> 3:51:54.680
 that a stake pool operator will set aside

3:51:54.680 --> 3:51:58.000
 and connect to his pool in order to be listed

3:51:58.000 --> 3:51:59.800
 in the registry.

3:51:59.800 --> 3:52:02.800
 And actually it's connected to how much income you make

3:52:02.800 --> 3:52:04.000
 as a pool operator.

3:52:04.000 --> 3:52:07.480
 So if you set it too high, you have a consolidation

3:52:07.480 --> 3:52:08.720
 and you have lots of pools.

3:52:08.720 --> 3:52:09.800
 If you set it too low,

3:52:09.800 --> 3:52:11.080
 what will happen is larger pools

3:52:11.080 --> 3:52:12.600
 will tend to fragment

3:52:12.600 --> 3:52:15.520
 and actually run multiple instances of themselves.

3:52:15.520 --> 3:52:17.040
 And so there's this delicate parameter

3:52:17.040 --> 3:52:18.080
 that you have to tweak.

3:52:18.080 --> 3:52:20.040
 And so we have a formula for it,

3:52:20.040 --> 3:52:22.080
 our formal specification that's quite involved.

3:52:22.080 --> 3:52:23.800
 And so one of the community members came and said,

3:52:23.800 --> 3:52:27.200
 well, I think we can massively simplify this design

3:52:27.200 --> 3:52:28.640
 and actually get a better result

3:52:28.640 --> 3:52:30.960
 for smaller stake pool operators.

3:52:30.960 --> 3:52:33.160
 And so it's SIP 007.

3:52:33.160 --> 3:52:34.680
 And there's actually a lot of conversation

3:52:34.680 --> 3:52:35.720
 and people are thinking about it.

3:52:35.720 --> 3:52:37.560
 And it was just stunning for me

3:52:37.560 --> 3:52:39.640
 because to understand how to write a SIP like this,

3:52:39.640 --> 3:52:41.440
 you actually have to read like a hundred pages

3:52:41.440 --> 3:52:44.760
 of mathematical pros in the formal specification.

3:52:44.760 --> 3:52:48.720
 So the guys who wrote, I was like, fuck yeah, this is great.

3:52:48.720 --> 3:52:50.440
 I'll just say an example of a SIP.

3:52:50.440 --> 3:52:52.560
 That's one thing, but it can be as big as,

3:52:52.560 --> 3:52:55.640
 hey, I want to add like quantum resistance to the system.

3:52:55.640 --> 3:52:57.960
 And here's how you do that, you know, like quantum VRF

3:52:57.960 --> 3:53:00.720
 and I want to put XMSS and all this other stuff.

3:53:00.720 --> 3:53:02.160
 So there's a lot you can do.

3:53:02.160 --> 3:53:07.160
 And you can do it indirectly or implicitly

3:53:07.160 --> 3:53:10.120
 where there's some social process outside of the system

3:53:10.120 --> 3:53:12.440
 where you eventually approve a SIP

3:53:12.440 --> 3:53:14.640
 or you can do it explicitly where you directly vote

3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:16.880
 or some representative democracy,

3:53:16.880 --> 3:53:19.240
 some group of representatives directly votes.

3:53:19.240 --> 3:53:21.200
 And then once you've decided it's there,

3:53:21.200 --> 3:53:22.440
 the constitution is necessary

3:53:22.440 --> 3:53:24.720
 because you need to know the decision threshold.

3:53:24.720 --> 3:53:27.000
 Is it super majority or majority?

3:53:27.000 --> 3:53:29.040
 And also the voting process.

3:53:29.040 --> 3:53:30.760
 Like a lot of policy experts believe

3:53:30.760 --> 3:53:32.880
 that if Brexit was a multi stage vote,

3:53:32.880 --> 3:53:34.440
 it would have never passed

3:53:34.440 --> 3:53:36.480
 because what people would have done the initial stage

3:53:36.480 --> 3:53:37.760
 in all the horrors of Brexit

3:53:37.760 --> 3:53:39.680
 would have been broadcasted to society.

3:53:39.680 --> 3:53:41.160
 And then there would have been some reluctance

3:53:41.160 --> 3:53:42.920
 and buyer's remorse on it.

3:53:42.920 --> 3:53:44.600
 And then the second round would have failed

3:53:44.600 --> 3:53:45.960
 or something like that.

3:53:45.960 --> 3:53:48.160
 But because it was just a singular event, you know,

3:53:48.160 --> 3:53:50.200
 it's like they passed it now.

3:53:50.200 --> 3:53:52.960
 British are all passive aggressive about it with no sign.

3:53:52.960 --> 3:53:55.680
 Very well, we shall remove from Europe.

3:53:55.680 --> 3:53:58.640
 And so your voting system has a lot to do

3:53:58.640 --> 3:53:59.840
 with, you know, the outcome you get.

3:53:59.840 --> 3:54:01.520
 The other thing is, you know, what type of voting?

3:54:01.520 --> 3:54:03.920
 Is it just an absolute or is it preference voting?

3:54:03.920 --> 3:54:06.520
 Like, so, you know, you pick your favorite sip,

3:54:06.520 --> 3:54:08.640
 your second favorite sip or something like that.

3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:11.120
 You know, so Condorcet or Borda are two examples of systems.

3:54:11.120 --> 3:54:13.080
 Are you a fan of those like the rank choice vote?

3:54:13.080 --> 3:54:16.360
 I love them so much, especially for political diversity.

3:54:16.360 --> 3:54:18.800
 Because this whole concept of throwing your vote away,

3:54:18.800 --> 3:54:20.160
 if it's Alice or Bob,

3:54:20.160 --> 3:54:21.160
 you're always going to get a,

3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:23.560
 it's self parked it at best, right?

3:54:23.560 --> 3:54:26.600
 The giant, the, yeah, yeah, you know, you know the one.

3:54:26.600 --> 3:54:29.640
 Turd versus I forget what else, douche versus turd.

3:54:29.640 --> 3:54:31.760
 Douche versus turd, self park.

3:54:31.760 --> 3:54:34.480
 So if it's ranked order, you know, or preference voting,

3:54:34.480 --> 3:54:35.640
 you never have that situation

3:54:35.640 --> 3:54:36.800
 because you always pick your favorite

3:54:36.800 --> 3:54:38.560
 and you get a lot more diversity on the ballot.

3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:39.840
 But then you have arrows, paradox,

3:54:39.840 --> 3:54:41.800
 and you know, all these other things that come up.

3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:44.000
 So it's, there's no perfect system.

3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:46.800
 And really you have to be comfortable

3:54:46.800 --> 3:54:48.840
 with governance in a game of inches.

3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:51.240
 And you start by some guiding principles.

3:54:51.240 --> 3:54:53.480
 The guiding principles is more is better

3:54:53.480 --> 3:54:55.920
 and productive interactions are better

3:54:55.920 --> 3:54:57.240
 than destructive interactions.

3:54:57.240 --> 3:54:58.840
 And you have to be able to quantify those things.

3:54:58.840 --> 3:55:00.080
 As long as you have an engine

3:55:00.080 --> 3:55:02.160
 that allows you to grow in those directions,

3:55:02.160 --> 3:55:04.120
 then you have a lot more people on for the ride

3:55:04.120 --> 3:55:05.280
 when you actually start talking

3:55:05.280 --> 3:55:07.240
 about these bigger and bigger things.

3:55:07.240 --> 3:55:08.080
 The other challenge was

3:55:08.080 --> 3:55:10.600
 that we had to decentralize development of the protocol

3:55:10.600 --> 3:55:12.880
 and the brain of the protocol.

3:55:12.880 --> 3:55:15.360
 We have fully decentralized the brain of the protocol.

3:55:15.360 --> 3:55:17.080
 The peer review academic process means

3:55:17.080 --> 3:55:19.400
 that there's now an academic incentive

3:55:19.400 --> 3:55:22.240
 for graduate students, postdocs, and professors

3:55:22.240 --> 3:55:24.640
 to spend enormous amounts of time writing papers

3:55:24.640 --> 3:55:27.440
 in our ecosystem because they want tenure, you know,

3:55:27.440 --> 3:55:29.680
 they want to, and we show that you can get it.

3:55:29.680 --> 3:55:31.480
 We should, there's been a lot of people

3:55:31.480 --> 3:55:33.120
 who've gotten great academic careers

3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:34.320
 from working with us.

3:55:34.320 --> 3:55:37.720
 So yeah, keep adding to that pile of 105 papers.

3:55:37.720 --> 3:55:38.880
 This is great.

3:55:38.880 --> 3:55:40.360
 And that doesn't need Charles Hoskins

3:55:40.360 --> 3:55:42.760
 and it doesn't need IOHK funding or anything like that.

3:55:42.760 --> 3:55:45.080
 They're on, we're already seeing unfunded derivative work

3:55:45.080 --> 3:55:46.640
 from people who are completely disconnected

3:55:46.640 --> 3:55:49.560
 from us writing papers about stuff in our ecosystem.

3:55:49.560 --> 3:55:53.040
 So just continue to develop that, but that's looking good.

3:55:53.040 --> 3:55:55.160
 To centralize development, we're working on that as well.

3:55:55.160 --> 3:55:57.160
 Our goal is sometime in the next few years

3:55:57.160 --> 3:56:00.080
 to make sure there's at least three independent clients,

3:56:00.080 --> 3:56:03.120
 so three completely independent teams and code bases,

3:56:03.120 --> 3:56:06.880
 and also to get a separation of the commercial clients

3:56:06.880 --> 3:56:09.360
 from the reference code and turn the reference code

3:56:09.360 --> 3:56:12.200
 into like a formal specification, a formal blueprint,

3:56:12.200 --> 3:56:13.960
 and then have that change managed

3:56:13.960 --> 3:56:15.680
 may be completely decentralized.

3:56:15.680 --> 3:56:17.920
 The core developers are actually voted on

3:56:17.920 --> 3:56:21.160
 and the SIP process is used to change that,

3:56:21.160 --> 3:56:23.120
 and then some way of proving

3:56:23.120 --> 3:56:25.480
 that your client follows the specification

3:56:25.480 --> 3:56:28.200
 as a use of the protocol.

3:56:28.200 --> 3:56:30.800
 Is there beyond the Cardano ecosystem

3:56:32.120 --> 3:56:35.360
 these ideas of distributed governance?

3:56:35.360 --> 3:56:40.360
 Do you see ways it could revolutionize politics,

3:56:40.360 --> 3:56:42.400
 you know, our governments?

3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:45.360
 Oh yeah, like Ethiopia deal for example,

3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:46.480
 we have five million people

3:56:46.480 --> 3:56:49.280
 that we brought in with the DIT system there.

3:56:49.280 --> 3:56:51.160
 That's gonna follow them throughout their whole life.

3:56:51.160 --> 3:56:52.920
 Right now they're high school students,

3:56:52.920 --> 3:56:54.400
 but when they're in their 20s, 30s,

3:56:54.400 --> 3:56:55.920
 they're gonna want to use that for eVoting

3:56:55.920 --> 3:56:57.640
 and for payments and so forth.

3:56:57.640 --> 3:56:59.160
 Can you describe the Ethiopia project

3:56:59.160 --> 3:57:00.520
 because that's fascinating.

3:57:00.520 --> 3:57:02.520
 Yeah, so we spent four years in Ethiopia.

3:57:02.520 --> 3:57:05.440
 I went there in 2017 and shook a lot of hands,

3:57:05.440 --> 3:57:06.640
 kissed a lot of babies, and they said,

3:57:06.640 --> 3:57:08.840
 oh yeah, we'll have it all done in six months.

3:57:10.080 --> 3:57:11.640
 Everything is a lot of fun there,

3:57:11.640 --> 3:57:12.840
 but it takes a little bit longer

3:57:12.840 --> 3:57:15.800
 than you'd think to get anything done, and that's okay.

3:57:15.800 --> 3:57:19.080
 I really love Ethiopia, it's a beautiful country.

3:57:19.080 --> 3:57:20.720
 So we spent four years,

3:57:20.720 --> 3:57:22.600
 we trained a whole cohort of developers,

3:57:22.600 --> 3:57:23.800
 and then we started a relationship

3:57:23.800 --> 3:57:25.120
 with the Ministry of Education,

3:57:25.120 --> 3:57:28.320
 and they care a lot about proper credentials.

3:57:28.320 --> 3:57:29.640
 One of the biggest problems they have

3:57:29.640 --> 3:57:31.320
 is when someone graduates,

3:57:31.320 --> 3:57:33.240
 it's really hard for them to prove the quality

3:57:33.240 --> 3:57:34.600
 of the credentials that they have,

3:57:34.600 --> 3:57:36.360
 and it's really hard for them to prove the knowledge

3:57:36.360 --> 3:57:37.200
 that they have.

3:57:37.200 --> 3:57:39.240
 So if you want to be an ICT outsourcer,

3:57:39.240 --> 3:57:41.960
 how does somebody know that this is a real programmer,

3:57:41.960 --> 3:57:44.200
 or how does somebody really know that this is a real doctor,

3:57:44.200 --> 3:57:46.240
 or whatever the hell you're outsourcing?

3:57:46.240 --> 3:57:47.680
 So they said, can you come and build

3:57:47.680 --> 3:57:50.640
 a digital identity system for credentials?

3:57:50.640 --> 3:57:52.920
 So every student in the country at some point

3:57:52.920 --> 3:57:55.240
 will get a did, a decentralized identifier,

3:57:55.240 --> 3:57:58.160
 and then you can prove all sorts of things about them,

3:57:58.160 --> 3:58:00.960
 like GPA, or what particular diploma they hold,

3:58:00.960 --> 3:58:02.280
 or blah, blah, blah.

3:58:02.280 --> 3:58:04.560
 And then the beautiful thing is the way we designed it

3:58:04.560 --> 3:58:07.480
 is it's extensible to include payments,

3:58:07.480 --> 3:58:10.280
 extensible to include proofs about themselves,

3:58:10.280 --> 3:58:12.640
 like are you over the age of 21, that kind of stuff,

3:58:12.640 --> 3:58:14.120
 and then eventually it can be used

3:58:14.120 --> 3:58:16.120
 to link into a cryptocurrency system.

3:58:16.120 --> 3:58:18.160
 In this case, we built it for Cardano.

3:58:18.160 --> 3:58:20.840
 So Italo Prism is the framework we're using for it,

3:58:20.840 --> 3:58:22.320
 every student will get one,

3:58:22.320 --> 3:58:24.000
 and then those students will be able

3:58:24.000 --> 3:58:26.960
 to use those credentials in the Cardano ecosystem,

3:58:26.960 --> 3:58:29.200
 eventually for DeFi, like lending, and so forth.

3:58:29.200 --> 3:58:31.280
 So it's the largest blockchain deal of its kind,

3:58:31.280 --> 3:58:33.960
 and it probably will grow to 20 million people

3:58:33.960 --> 3:58:35.520
 over the next 24 months.

3:58:35.520 --> 3:58:37.080
 The other beautiful thing about Ethiopia

3:58:37.080 --> 3:58:38.880
 that people don't know is the prime minister

3:58:38.880 --> 3:58:43.000
 is a cryptographer, and he's like 40s, 50s, a young guy,

3:58:43.000 --> 3:58:45.320
 and he can actually read the papers, if you're right.

3:58:45.320 --> 3:58:46.880
 And so he's a really bright guy,

3:58:46.880 --> 3:58:48.920
 and he's written this beautiful agenda

3:58:48.920 --> 3:58:51.280
 called Digital Ethiopia 2025,

3:58:51.280 --> 3:58:55.720
 and one of his things in the agenda is digital identity.

3:58:55.720 --> 3:58:57.240
 He wants every person in the country

3:58:57.240 --> 3:59:00.000
 to have a digital identity by 2025,

3:59:00.000 --> 3:59:01.920
 and he wants to implement an eVoting system

3:59:01.920 --> 3:59:03.400
 at some point for that.

3:59:03.400 --> 3:59:04.880
 So when you ask about governance,

3:59:04.880 --> 3:59:07.200
 all these governance tools that we're constructing

3:59:07.200 --> 3:59:11.440
 for Cardano are completely reusable for a nation state,

3:59:11.440 --> 3:59:12.720
 a company, and by the way,

3:59:12.720 --> 3:59:14.240
 if you create a Cardano application,

3:59:14.240 --> 3:59:16.280
 will eventually be reusable for you.

3:59:16.280 --> 3:59:17.760
 Because if you have a DeFi protocol,

3:59:17.760 --> 3:59:18.720
 you need a voting system,

3:59:18.720 --> 3:59:20.280
 why the fuck do you have to reimplement that?

3:59:20.280 --> 3:59:23.000
 Native multi asset, anything that works on ADA

3:59:23.000 --> 3:59:24.280
 works with a native multi asset.

3:59:24.280 --> 3:59:27.080
 I can, you can use our voting system for your asset.

3:59:27.080 --> 3:59:28.680
 So you get a government in a box

3:59:28.680 --> 3:59:31.200
 that you can parameterize any way you want.

3:59:31.200 --> 3:59:33.120
 And similarly, when a government does something

3:59:33.120 --> 3:59:35.240
 with Cardano, not only did they get all this

3:59:35.240 --> 3:59:38.240
 amazing infrastructure, but wait, there's more.

3:59:38.240 --> 3:59:40.240
 They actually get this amazing voting system

3:59:40.240 --> 3:59:43.120
 that they can use for small or large scale decisions

3:59:43.120 --> 3:59:44.200
 that they wanna do.

3:59:44.200 --> 3:59:46.640
 On the US side, we're thinking about trying to roll

3:59:46.640 --> 3:59:48.920
 something like this out in the state of Wyoming.

3:59:48.920 --> 3:59:50.920
 You know, there's been tons of laws that are passed.

3:59:50.920 --> 3:59:52.960
 It's a very friendly crypto place.

3:59:52.960 --> 3:59:55.440
 The very least, it'd be fun to see if we can do

3:59:55.440 --> 3:59:58.200
 the Republican Democrat primaries with preference voting

3:59:58.200 --> 4:00:01.320
 and voter registration this way and do it,

4:00:01.320 --> 4:00:03.880
 and do it completely online with an E voting system.

4:00:03.880 --> 4:00:06.560
 So, you know, that's something we'll be pursuing in 2022.

4:00:06.560 --> 4:00:08.080
 You think there's some openness to that?

4:00:08.080 --> 4:00:09.440
 Yeah, yeah.

4:00:09.440 --> 4:00:11.440
 That's the one good thing about the craziness of Trump.

4:00:11.440 --> 4:00:12.600
 He's made like half of America,

4:00:12.600 --> 4:00:14.200
 I think the election system is completely

4:00:14.200 --> 4:00:15.680
 air pairably broken.

4:00:15.680 --> 4:00:16.880
 So, you know, you walk in and it's like,

4:00:16.880 --> 4:00:18.320
 we're gonna go kill Dominion.

4:00:18.320 --> 4:00:19.920
 And they're like, yay, that's great.

4:00:19.920 --> 4:00:20.920
 Let's go do that.

4:00:20.920 --> 4:00:22.760
 Whether you believe that or not,

4:00:22.760 --> 4:00:24.480
 you know, it's created a market opportunity,

4:00:24.480 --> 4:00:26.960
 created a lack of faith and credibility in the system.

4:00:26.960 --> 4:00:28.640
 To improve the system.

4:00:28.640 --> 4:00:30.200
 Exactly, exactly.

4:00:30.200 --> 4:00:32.640
 What do you think about El Salvador becoming

4:00:32.640 --> 4:00:35.840
 the first country to approve a cryptocurrency,

4:00:35.840 --> 4:00:39.080
 Bitcoin in this case, as legal currency?

4:00:39.080 --> 4:00:40.640
 And where's this trend going?

4:00:40.640 --> 4:00:42.480
 First of all, this event,

4:00:42.480 --> 4:00:44.160
 if we mentioned the Bitcoin conference,

4:00:44.160 --> 4:00:47.520
 the Bitcoin folks believe that this is a monumental event.

4:00:47.520 --> 4:00:49.880
 Do you think this is a start of something new?

4:00:49.880 --> 4:00:50.840
 Well, they're both right.

4:00:50.840 --> 4:00:53.440
 The critics and the pro people.

4:00:53.440 --> 4:00:55.560
 So the critics are saying this is a nothing burger

4:00:55.560 --> 4:00:58.240
 and it's just a publicity event for El Salvador.

4:00:58.240 --> 4:01:00.760
 And then the people say this is the most monumental event.

4:01:00.760 --> 4:01:02.040
 They may actually be right

4:01:02.040 --> 4:01:04.280
 because there's reciprocal agreements.

4:01:04.280 --> 4:01:06.080
 When a country issues a currency,

4:01:06.080 --> 4:01:08.240
 other countries honor that usually.

4:01:08.240 --> 4:01:09.840
 And it trades on Forex exchanges.

4:01:09.840 --> 4:01:12.880
 So if like Bitcoin becomes a recognized currency

4:01:12.880 --> 4:01:15.480
 of a country, then it may be the case

4:01:15.480 --> 4:01:17.240
 that United States and European Union,

4:01:17.240 --> 4:01:18.760
 others can't actually stop them

4:01:18.760 --> 4:01:20.520
 from trading on Forex exchanges

4:01:20.520 --> 4:01:22.240
 and being treated as a currency

4:01:22.240 --> 4:01:23.600
 from a regulatory perspective.

4:01:23.600 --> 4:01:26.200
 So it was like a really clever backdoor

4:01:26.200 --> 4:01:28.600
 into the League of Nations.

4:01:28.600 --> 4:01:31.360
 And actually we had this crazy hair brained idea

4:01:31.360 --> 4:01:33.080
 years ago, we were down in Mexico

4:01:33.080 --> 4:01:34.800
 at the Satoshi Roundtable and we're like,

4:01:34.800 --> 4:01:36.640
 hey, let's go buy a country.

4:01:36.640 --> 4:01:39.160
 Let's go to Tuvalu and get them to do something

4:01:39.160 --> 4:01:40.520
 with a cryptocurrency.

4:01:40.520 --> 4:01:42.080
 Cause they sell everything in Tuvalu,

4:01:42.080 --> 4:01:44.760
 like the dot TV extension and their fishing rights

4:01:44.760 --> 4:01:47.080
 and Taiwan pays them money to recognize them

4:01:47.080 --> 4:01:48.120
 and so forth.

4:01:48.120 --> 4:01:50.120
 So I'm like, man, maybe we can convince Tuvalu

4:01:50.120 --> 4:01:51.920
 to do something with crypto.

4:01:51.920 --> 4:01:53.480
 That didn't work out so well.

4:01:53.480 --> 4:01:56.480
 But now El Salvador is actually playing the game

4:01:56.480 --> 4:01:57.520
 and that's a real country.

4:01:57.520 --> 4:02:00.080
 It's got like five million people and so forth.

4:02:00.080 --> 4:02:01.960
 So we know the president's brother

4:02:01.960 --> 4:02:03.760
 and we've had some conversations there.

4:02:03.760 --> 4:02:05.600
 So maybe we'll go, you know, the next few months

4:02:05.600 --> 4:02:06.840
 and see what's going on there

4:02:06.840 --> 4:02:09.160
 and do a state visit and talk to the president.

4:02:09.160 --> 4:02:11.520
 But it's an interesting development.

4:02:11.520 --> 4:02:14.240
 And it's one of those things that it can't quite be ignored

4:02:14.240 --> 4:02:15.920
 because the nation states doing it.

4:02:15.920 --> 4:02:18.440
 On the other hand, you have to manage expectations.

4:02:18.440 --> 4:02:21.440
 Is the central bank taking a position in Bitcoin?

4:02:21.440 --> 4:02:23.680
 You know, are they actually switching over

4:02:23.680 --> 4:02:26.600
 to a cryptocurrency as their unit of account?

4:02:26.600 --> 4:02:28.280
 Are they now getting off of BIS

4:02:28.280 --> 4:02:30.720
 and they're all using the settlement rails

4:02:30.720 --> 4:02:31.640
 of central banks?

4:02:31.640 --> 4:02:34.120
 Are they actually block chaining the entire country

4:02:34.120 --> 4:02:36.760
 and they have some broad, ambitious agenda

4:02:36.760 --> 4:02:38.840
 to go and do all that that remains to be seen.

4:02:38.840 --> 4:02:40.600
 And so it really is a commitment there.

4:02:40.600 --> 4:02:43.480
 The other thing is that if you're autocratic,

4:02:43.480 --> 4:02:45.240
 these systems are not so good for you.

4:02:45.240 --> 4:02:47.200
 Because the minute you adopt these types of systems,

4:02:47.200 --> 4:02:49.560
 you're pushing a lot of power to the edges.

4:02:49.560 --> 4:02:50.760
 So there's a world of difference

4:02:50.760 --> 4:02:53.400
 between optics and actual commitment.

4:02:53.400 --> 4:02:55.720
 And actual commitment is I'm prepared

4:02:55.720 --> 4:02:58.040
 to accept the consequences that the state

4:02:58.040 --> 4:03:01.000
 is going to lose a lot of power along the way.

4:03:01.000 --> 4:03:03.240
 And the problem is it's not clear to me

4:03:03.240 --> 4:03:05.600
 some of these politicians who are pro blockchain

4:03:05.600 --> 4:03:08.160
 and I'm not making a statement on El Salvador in particular,

4:03:08.160 --> 4:03:09.680
 I'm just saying in general,

4:03:09.680 --> 4:03:11.720
 are fully aware of that reality.

4:03:11.720 --> 4:03:13.440
 A lot of them seem to think that somehow

4:03:13.440 --> 4:03:16.120
 they can contain the blockchain genie in the bottle

4:03:16.120 --> 4:03:17.680
 and blockchain their whole country,

4:03:17.680 --> 4:03:19.840
 but stay president for life.

4:03:19.840 --> 4:03:23.680
 That doesn't work once they have that power, they're gone.

4:03:23.680 --> 4:03:24.920
 So do you think once they realize

4:03:24.920 --> 4:03:27.840
 that this is one of the failure cases,

4:03:27.840 --> 4:03:29.400
 one of the things that people are concerned about

4:03:29.400 --> 4:03:31.320
 is governments banning cryptocurrency?

4:03:31.320 --> 4:03:32.560
 Well, that's China case, right?

4:03:32.560 --> 4:03:35.440
 They started realizing this was a legitimate threat

4:03:35.440 --> 4:03:37.920
 to capital controls into the autocratic system

4:03:37.920 --> 4:03:39.000
 that they've constructed there.

4:03:39.000 --> 4:03:41.240
 And then suddenly China started to build its own

4:03:41.240 --> 4:03:43.240
 People's Bank of China blockchain

4:03:43.240 --> 4:03:46.080
 and Bitcoin is now the redheaded stepchild.

4:03:46.080 --> 4:03:47.080
 They didn't really care too much

4:03:47.080 --> 4:03:48.160
 because it was great for corruption.

4:03:48.160 --> 4:03:49.520
 You could have a capital control

4:03:49.520 --> 4:03:51.640
 since all the like well connected people,

4:03:51.640 --> 4:03:53.080
 they're, oh yeah, Bitcoin's bad,

4:03:53.080 --> 4:03:54.680
 but then they'd have Bitcoin of their own

4:03:54.680 --> 4:03:56.840
 and they could use it to send money around.

4:03:56.840 --> 4:03:59.320
 But now the government has gotten very serious about it.

4:03:59.320 --> 4:04:01.480
 They're saying like, okay, we want to control

4:04:01.480 --> 4:04:02.880
 and dominate this whole thing.

4:04:02.880 --> 4:04:05.120
 And it's a threat to our plan for the digital you want

4:04:05.120 --> 4:04:07.280
 to become the world standard to displace the dollars.

4:04:07.280 --> 4:04:09.200
 But so the moment you have El Salvador

4:04:09.200 --> 4:04:10.680
 in just more and more countries,

4:04:10.680 --> 4:04:12.880
 say there'll be a country in Europe, for example.

4:04:12.880 --> 4:04:17.880
 That accepts Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, Cardano.

4:04:18.840 --> 4:04:21.080
 The idea is it would put a lot of pressure on you.

4:04:21.080 --> 4:04:24.160
 So there'll be like this kind of ripple effect that you,

4:04:24.160 --> 4:04:26.200
 and then the individual governments

4:04:26.200 --> 4:04:27.040
 won't be able to help.

4:04:27.040 --> 4:04:29.560
 And eventually there'll be a superpower like,

4:04:29.560 --> 4:04:32.040
 I don't know, Russia or the United States

4:04:32.040 --> 4:04:34.520
 and or I don't know, Canada.

4:04:34.520 --> 4:04:38.480
 So do you see that sort of an inevitable trend

4:04:38.480 --> 4:04:40.360
 where cryptocurrency takes over the world

4:04:40.360 --> 4:04:45.360
 as a store of value and as a method of payments?

4:04:46.040 --> 4:04:46.880
 Yeah, probably.

4:04:46.880 --> 4:04:48.840
 I mean, you can do just so much more

4:04:48.840 --> 4:04:50.000
 with programmable finance.

4:04:50.000 --> 4:04:51.880
 You know, transactions in general have five properties.

4:04:51.880 --> 4:04:54.280
 You know, you have the asset that runs on the rail.

4:04:54.280 --> 4:04:55.720
 That's what we always think about.

4:04:55.720 --> 4:04:57.960
 And you can transact that, you know,

4:04:57.960 --> 4:04:59.520
 and then you have the identity

4:04:59.520 --> 4:05:02.000
 and you transact that either like one to one,

4:05:02.000 --> 4:05:04.480
 one to many, many to one or many to many.

4:05:04.480 --> 4:05:05.360
 Then you have metadata.

4:05:05.360 --> 4:05:07.160
 So that's the story of the transactions.

4:05:07.160 --> 4:05:09.600
 Like where did it take place, these types of things.

4:05:09.600 --> 4:05:12.240
 And then you have the contractual relationship.

4:05:12.240 --> 4:05:13.640
 So that's the smart contract opponent.

4:05:13.640 --> 4:05:15.280
 And then you embed that within regulation.

4:05:15.280 --> 4:05:18.240
 So transactions always live within jurisdictions.

4:05:18.240 --> 4:05:19.720
 This is relevant to the conversation

4:05:19.720 --> 4:05:21.400
 will digital currencies take over

4:05:22.400 --> 4:05:25.760
 because those things are right now done separately

4:05:25.760 --> 4:05:27.920
 in a very fragmented and fractured way.

4:05:27.920 --> 4:05:30.000
 And they're not completely globalized.

4:05:30.000 --> 4:05:33.040
 And so super expensive to hoist up this entire system

4:05:33.040 --> 4:05:35.240
 and automate things like compliance.

4:05:35.240 --> 4:05:39.360
 It's usually a huge part of every bank's balance sheet.

4:05:39.360 --> 4:05:42.280
 So when you look at the concept of a digital currency,

4:05:42.280 --> 4:05:44.960
 you're saying all five of those things are programmable.

4:05:44.960 --> 4:05:47.280
 And so they could be like library driven.

4:05:47.280 --> 4:05:50.160
 You say, oh, I want to be in compliance with the air tray.

4:05:50.160 --> 4:05:51.880
 Okay, pull up the air tray and library.

4:05:51.880 --> 4:05:54.480
 Now you are, it's built into the transaction.

4:05:54.480 --> 4:05:56.760
 Previously, it's like, go hire some lawyers

4:05:56.760 --> 4:05:58.720
 and go figure out the entire code

4:05:58.720 --> 4:06:01.240
 and translate some things and rah, rah, rah.

4:06:01.240 --> 4:06:02.760
 It's crazy.

4:06:02.760 --> 4:06:07.480
 So just the orders of magnitude efficiency gains

4:06:07.480 --> 4:06:10.160
 that you get and the increased liquidity you get

4:06:10.160 --> 4:06:12.960
 and the fact that you can now represent all assets

4:06:12.960 --> 4:06:15.640
 with a universal way, that financial stem cell.

4:06:15.640 --> 4:06:18.600
 There's an inevitability to the victory of our industry.

4:06:18.600 --> 4:06:21.200
 The challenge is, how do we deal with this

4:06:21.200 --> 4:06:24.000
 with the squabbling of superpowers?

4:06:24.000 --> 4:06:25.760
 China wants to be the new world standard.

4:06:25.760 --> 4:06:27.200
 America wants to preserve that.

4:06:27.200 --> 4:06:29.120
 And the rest of the world is trying to figure out

4:06:29.120 --> 4:06:32.200
 how do we create something that's a bit more fair and balanced.

4:06:32.200 --> 4:06:35.360
 And so crypto comes in and it potentially is

4:06:35.360 --> 4:06:38.040
 both an ally and a competitor to those desires.

4:06:38.040 --> 4:06:40.080
 Because if you do too much crypto,

4:06:40.080 --> 4:06:42.160
 you don't need to nation state anymore.

4:06:42.160 --> 4:06:45.800
 If you do too little crypto, well, it's China or America.

4:06:45.800 --> 4:06:47.800
 So what's that sweet spot?

4:06:47.800 --> 4:06:52.280
 Do you hope that in the process of cryptocurrency

4:06:52.280 --> 4:06:55.360
 pushing power to the edges to the people

4:06:55.360 --> 4:06:58.200
 that we would be able to alleviate some of the suffering

4:06:58.200 --> 4:07:00.440
 in the world caused by centralized power

4:07:00.440 --> 4:07:02.280
 and the abuses of power and corruption

4:07:02.280 --> 4:07:03.280
 and all those kinds of things?

4:07:03.280 --> 4:07:06.800
 A hundred percent, I made a very angry video months ago.

4:07:06.800 --> 4:07:08.560
 I make angry videos.

4:07:08.560 --> 4:07:11.160
 I should drink, Lex.

4:07:11.160 --> 4:07:12.200
 I mean, you should drink more.

4:07:12.200 --> 4:07:13.160
 Yeah, I know, right?

4:07:13.160 --> 4:07:14.480
 It depends on who you ask.

4:07:14.480 --> 4:07:15.680
 I made a video a little while.

4:07:15.680 --> 4:07:17.960
 I said, you know, our industry is an industry of frustration.

4:07:17.960 --> 4:07:21.080
 It exists because we weren't the industry

4:07:21.080 --> 4:07:23.680
 that charged 85% interest to the poorest people

4:07:23.680 --> 4:07:24.720
 in the world for loans.

4:07:24.720 --> 4:07:27.760
 We weren't the industry that charged 15% to move money

4:07:27.760 --> 4:07:31.720
 for a maid sending money home to mom and Manila.

4:07:31.720 --> 4:07:33.720
 You know, we weren't the industry that laundered

4:07:33.720 --> 4:07:36.000
 hundreds of billions of dollars of drug money

4:07:36.000 --> 4:07:38.840
 and funded arms dealers in Africa and all these things

4:07:38.840 --> 4:07:42.840
 or permitted oil for food to exist and so forth.

4:07:42.840 --> 4:07:44.800
 And the people who did these things aren't in jail.

4:07:44.800 --> 4:07:45.640
 They're rich.

4:07:45.640 --> 4:07:46.480
 They're billionaires.

4:07:46.480 --> 4:07:48.160
 They fly private jets.

4:07:48.160 --> 4:07:51.520
 So our industry is the antidote to these types of things.

4:07:51.520 --> 4:07:54.760
 We say, guys, we want a system that's fair.

4:07:54.760 --> 4:07:56.240
 That's it.

4:07:56.240 --> 4:07:58.920
 And we want everybody to be treated equally.

4:07:58.920 --> 4:08:00.920
 That doesn't mean it's everybody's going to win.

4:08:00.920 --> 4:08:03.080
 It doesn't mean that when you lose, you know,

4:08:03.080 --> 4:08:05.800
 somebody's going to come on a white horse and bail you out,

4:08:05.800 --> 4:08:08.000
 you're going to have winners and losers, but it's fair.

4:08:08.000 --> 4:08:08.960
 That's all we want.

4:08:08.960 --> 4:08:10.560
 That's all we've ever wanted.

4:08:10.560 --> 4:08:12.520
 There's no coincidence that Bitcoin was created

4:08:12.520 --> 4:08:16.000
 right around the same time as the 2008 financial crisis.

4:08:16.000 --> 4:08:17.840
 It's not like these were just unrelated events.

4:08:17.840 --> 4:08:20.120
 They're highly correlated to each other, OK?

4:08:20.120 --> 4:08:21.600
 I'd say perhaps even causal.

4:08:21.600 --> 4:08:23.040
 Go figure.

4:08:23.040 --> 4:08:26.960
 And everything we've done as an industry from that moment

4:08:26.960 --> 4:08:32.000
 to today and beyond has been about that endless, relentless

4:08:32.000 --> 4:08:35.320
 desire to make things a little bit less corrupt,

4:08:35.320 --> 4:08:38.800
 a little bit less nepotistic, and a bit more open.

4:08:38.800 --> 4:08:42.680
 And it's gotten so insane that you have these things

4:08:42.680 --> 4:08:45.600
 in Wyoming called speedy banks where you're full reserve banks.

4:08:45.600 --> 4:08:49.680
 They have 100% of their balance sheet is accounted for.

4:08:49.680 --> 4:08:50.960
 They don't lend.

4:08:50.960 --> 4:08:53.480
 And then you have the people in the banking community saying,

4:08:53.480 --> 4:08:55.240
 well, those are a risk to banking.

4:08:55.240 --> 4:08:59.600
 We were scared that these speedy banks are going to default.

4:08:59.600 --> 4:09:02.120
 It's like, what world are you living in?

4:09:02.120 --> 4:09:05.000
 You have fractional reserve, sometimes like 2% assets

4:09:05.000 --> 4:09:06.160
 on the balance sheet.

4:09:06.160 --> 4:09:08.160
 And then you're worried that the guys who actually

4:09:08.160 --> 4:09:10.360
 have a dollar for every dollar they say they have

4:09:10.360 --> 4:09:12.440
 are the ones that are going to collapse.

4:09:12.440 --> 4:09:15.000
 It's like the 1984 level doublespeak

4:09:15.000 --> 4:09:17.000
 when you see the system and negative interest rates

4:09:17.000 --> 4:09:18.000
 and all these other things.

4:09:18.000 --> 4:09:20.760
 And so I absolutely believe the direction course

4:09:20.760 --> 4:09:24.120
 of this industry is to make things more honest and fair.

4:09:24.120 --> 4:09:26.600
 And also, by its very existence, it

4:09:26.600 --> 4:09:30.400
 exposes double standards, hypocrisy, and corruption.

4:09:30.400 --> 4:09:32.080
 Just the fact that it's there.

4:09:32.080 --> 4:09:34.360
 Because it's one thing to say that, well, it just

4:09:34.360 --> 4:09:36.720
 can't be because of the nature of global finance.

4:09:36.720 --> 4:09:38.360
 There's no way to do it otherwise.

4:09:38.360 --> 4:09:42.040
 It's another thing to see it there as an example and say,

4:09:42.040 --> 4:09:43.320
 well, that thing is doing it.

4:09:43.320 --> 4:09:45.240
 Why can't you guys be this way?

4:09:45.240 --> 4:09:46.800
 That's why I'm so passionate about Africa

4:09:46.800 --> 4:09:48.720
 because they don't like the systems they have.

4:09:48.720 --> 4:09:50.280
 And everybody's really young.

4:09:50.280 --> 4:09:52.480
 And they are going to throw all the systems out

4:09:52.480 --> 4:09:53.480
 in the next 20 years.

4:09:53.480 --> 4:09:55.480
 And they're going to replace them with something else.

4:09:55.480 --> 4:09:58.720
 If we get this stuff into Africa, 1.2 billion people

4:09:58.720 --> 4:10:00.840
 will be living in a considerably better system

4:10:00.840 --> 4:10:02.080
 than the rest of the world.

4:10:02.080 --> 4:10:03.880
 And then everybody else will look at that and say,

4:10:03.880 --> 4:10:05.640
 why the hell are those guys so rich?

4:10:05.640 --> 4:10:07.080
 Why are those guys making the money?

4:10:07.080 --> 4:10:08.760
 Why are those guys doing so well?

4:10:08.760 --> 4:10:10.000
 And it's not satisfying here.

4:10:10.000 --> 4:10:13.320
 Well, Africa is just better.

4:10:13.320 --> 4:10:14.400
 No one's going to say that.

4:10:14.400 --> 4:10:17.600
 They're going to say, OK, yeah, it's nepotism and corruption

4:10:17.600 --> 4:10:19.960
 and lack of transparency and these types of things.

4:10:19.960 --> 4:10:22.080
 So I think absolutely it has the potential

4:10:22.080 --> 4:10:23.640
 to improve the human condition.

4:10:23.640 --> 4:10:26.160
 But humans have to get out of the way.

4:10:26.160 --> 4:10:28.960
 Humans have ingrained in themselves selfishness

4:10:28.960 --> 4:10:31.920
 and it is a desire to maximize them for themselves

4:10:31.920 --> 4:10:34.480
 and their family and not thinking systems.

4:10:34.480 --> 4:10:38.120
 And so we have to evolve capitalism at the same time.

4:10:38.120 --> 4:10:40.000
 And what I mean by that is right now you're

4:10:40.000 --> 4:10:42.520
 trying to maximize the amount of resources you get today.

4:10:42.520 --> 4:10:43.920
 What we need to do is start thinking

4:10:43.920 --> 4:10:47.880
 about how do we create future versions of ourselves in 2100

4:10:47.880 --> 4:10:50.160
 and create a resource for that time period.

4:10:50.160 --> 4:10:54.120
 And then the name of the game is to maximize that or balance

4:10:54.120 --> 4:10:55.880
 that with what you get in the short term.

4:10:55.880 --> 4:10:57.800
 And then suddenly you're saying to yourself, well,

4:10:57.800 --> 4:11:00.120
 if I'm doing things that are good for me today,

4:11:00.120 --> 4:11:02.680
 but compromising then, I make less money.

4:11:02.680 --> 4:11:05.520
 So capitalism as an engine is OK.

4:11:05.520 --> 4:11:07.560
 The problem is it's misparameterized.

4:11:07.560 --> 4:11:10.040
 Right, almost like inject long term incentives

4:11:10.040 --> 4:11:10.960
 into the capitalist system.

4:11:10.960 --> 4:11:11.400
 Exactly.

4:11:11.400 --> 4:11:13.840
 And cryptocurrency space is the only economic system

4:11:13.840 --> 4:11:15.560
 where that's actually possible.

4:11:15.560 --> 4:11:17.200
 You can create a tokenomics scheme

4:11:17.200 --> 4:11:19.160
 where doing things that are beneficial for people

4:11:19.160 --> 4:11:22.000
 you'll never meet because you're long dead actually

4:11:22.000 --> 4:11:23.360
 makes you money today.

4:11:23.360 --> 4:11:26.560
 You can't do that in a legacy financial system and so forth.

4:11:26.560 --> 4:11:28.760
 So I think that that's the real impact capital

4:11:28.760 --> 4:11:32.040
 conversation that has to be had as you explore these things

4:11:32.040 --> 4:11:34.200
 is you have to talk to people and say, look,

4:11:34.200 --> 4:11:37.520
 it's not about communism or socialism versus capitalism.

4:11:37.520 --> 4:11:40.480
 It's not about, hey, let's donate and save the world

4:11:40.480 --> 4:11:43.080
 or try to be charity and make things better.

4:11:43.080 --> 4:11:44.720
 It's all about how do you use the fact

4:11:44.720 --> 4:11:48.120
 that we have a better toolkit to create a different system,

4:11:48.120 --> 4:11:51.160
 a different incentive model where the default configuration

4:11:51.160 --> 4:11:52.960
 of the system is long term thinking.

4:11:52.960 --> 4:11:54.680
 And the default consideration of the system

4:11:54.680 --> 4:11:56.600
 is to get rid of all these negative externalities

4:11:56.600 --> 4:11:59.880
 that marketplaces have and judge the success of society

4:11:59.880 --> 4:12:02.400
 not by how the greatest of society are doing,

4:12:02.400 --> 4:12:04.840
 but by how the least of society are doing.

4:12:04.840 --> 4:12:07.160
 HDI, not GDP, this kind of thinking.

4:12:07.160 --> 4:12:09.840
 And I think crypto can actually be the vanguard

4:12:09.840 --> 4:12:10.920
 that pushes us there.

4:12:10.920 --> 4:12:12.880
 And the first countries to adopt that

4:12:12.880 --> 4:12:16.040
 are going to be just significantly better places to live.

4:12:16.040 --> 4:12:18.480
 And the people who envy them will force the other countries

4:12:18.480 --> 4:12:19.320
 to change.

4:12:19.320 --> 4:12:20.160
 That's right, that'd be a ripple effect.

4:12:20.160 --> 4:12:21.600
 So when you wake up in the morning

4:12:21.600 --> 4:12:23.120
 or as you sleep like a baby,

4:12:23.120 --> 4:12:25.280
 wake up multiple times in the middle of the night,

4:12:25.280 --> 4:12:30.280
 are you, do you feel the burden of this kind of future

4:12:31.640 --> 4:12:34.440
 that's in your hands and not to mess it up?

4:12:34.440 --> 4:12:36.440
 Like what is it, Big Lebowski?

4:12:36.440 --> 4:12:38.680
 Her life is in your hands, dude.

4:12:38.680 --> 4:12:42.840
 Don't worry about them, they're nihilists, honey.

4:12:42.840 --> 4:12:46.760
 Do you feel the burden of like,

4:12:46.760 --> 4:12:49.480
 because we're talking about all these 100 plus papers

4:12:49.480 --> 4:12:52.200
 and the academic beauty of the algorithms

4:12:52.200 --> 4:12:53.040
 we're talking about,

4:12:53.040 --> 4:12:56.320
 but then there's millions of human lives that stay here.

4:12:56.320 --> 4:12:57.920
 I mean, you always feel the burden,

4:12:57.920 --> 4:12:59.080
 especially my own company.

4:12:59.080 --> 4:13:00.680
 I mean, I have all these people work for me

4:13:00.680 --> 4:13:03.240
 and they eat because I pay them, right?

4:13:03.240 --> 4:13:06.320
 So if I can't pay them, then that's my fault.

4:13:06.320 --> 4:13:09.320
 So you have to, as a leader,

4:13:09.320 --> 4:13:10.600
 you always have to be cognizant

4:13:10.600 --> 4:13:12.080
 that there's all these people who've signed up

4:13:12.080 --> 4:13:13.560
 for your crazy vision

4:13:13.560 --> 4:13:16.040
 and you have to be larger than life.

4:13:16.040 --> 4:13:17.400
 You always have to be good.

4:13:17.400 --> 4:13:20.440
 You're not allowed to have a bad day.

4:13:20.440 --> 4:13:21.760
 You're not allowed to feel like shit.

4:13:21.760 --> 4:13:23.080
 You always have to show up.

4:13:23.080 --> 4:13:24.920
 You always have to be pushing forward.

4:13:26.160 --> 4:13:28.080
 And so that's a huge burden on many respects

4:13:28.080 --> 4:13:29.560
 because there's Charles the person

4:13:29.560 --> 4:13:31.880
 and then Charles the CEO

4:13:31.880 --> 4:13:34.280
 and these are very different things

4:13:34.280 --> 4:13:37.200
 in terms of expectations, at the very least.

4:13:37.200 --> 4:13:39.880
 And so it's heavy in that respect.

4:13:39.880 --> 4:13:41.480
 That said, what gives you solace

4:13:41.480 --> 4:13:43.560
 is that you're not in it alone.

4:13:43.560 --> 4:13:45.240
 It's lonely, but you're not all alone.

4:13:45.240 --> 4:13:47.680
 You have so many amazing people around you

4:13:47.680 --> 4:13:48.720
 that are willing to help

4:13:48.720 --> 4:13:50.040
 and actually take some of that burden.

4:13:50.040 --> 4:13:53.200
 And my life has gotten considerably better

4:13:53.200 --> 4:13:55.680
 when I learned how to delegate and trust.

4:13:55.680 --> 4:13:57.960
 And even if people screw up and fail,

4:13:57.960 --> 4:13:59.920
 it's worth the risk

4:13:59.920 --> 4:14:02.360
 because ultimately you're amplifying yourself.

4:14:02.360 --> 4:14:06.120
 The other thing is that it's okay not to get all the way.

4:14:06.120 --> 4:14:07.800
 You want to, you want to push there,

4:14:07.800 --> 4:14:10.160
 but make sure whatever the hell you do,

4:14:10.160 --> 4:14:12.560
 you leave something for somebody else to pick up

4:14:12.560 --> 4:14:13.840
 and carry on.

4:14:13.840 --> 4:14:16.880
 That's why we care so much about the publication process

4:14:16.880 --> 4:14:17.720
 and open source code.

4:14:17.720 --> 4:14:20.480
 We'll never file a patent in our entire history

4:14:20.480 --> 4:14:23.800
 because whatever we do, it's yours as much as it is mine.

4:14:23.800 --> 4:14:26.280
 And maybe I can only get you 70% of the way

4:14:26.280 --> 4:14:28.200
 and I'll plop over dead from a heart attack

4:14:28.200 --> 4:14:30.600
 or get killed by an eagle or something like that.

4:14:30.600 --> 4:14:32.440
 Maybe somebody brings the has,

4:14:32.440 --> 4:14:35.200
 maybe somebody brings the has eagle back and it kills me.

4:14:35.200 --> 4:14:36.280
 So it could happen.

4:14:36.280 --> 4:14:37.600
 They're bringing the Willie Mammoth back.

4:14:37.600 --> 4:14:39.880
 Talk to the George church about that.

4:14:39.880 --> 4:14:40.720
 That's a good way to go.

4:14:40.720 --> 4:14:42.680
 Either the eagle or the mammoth.

4:14:42.680 --> 4:14:44.080
 I'd rather be crushed by a mammoth

4:14:44.080 --> 4:14:47.160
 because eagles actually fly you up and drop you.

4:14:47.160 --> 4:14:48.720
 Oh, so you won't die, it'll be a slow death

4:14:48.720 --> 4:14:49.960
 and they probably peck at you.

4:14:49.960 --> 4:14:50.800
 Yeah, exactly.

4:14:50.800 --> 4:14:52.720
 You'd just be grievously wounded on the ground

4:14:52.720 --> 4:14:55.080
 and the eagle's like slowly devouring you.

4:14:55.080 --> 4:14:56.800
 Yeah, don't go down that way.

4:14:56.800 --> 4:14:58.160
 I've lost my train of thought.

4:14:58.160 --> 4:15:03.320
 The point is that you feel deeply grateful

4:15:03.320 --> 4:15:06.280
 that a bunch of people around you and then you give...

4:15:06.280 --> 4:15:09.600
 Yeah, you delegate and somebody fights the eagle

4:15:09.600 --> 4:15:11.160
 and then other people takes care of that

4:15:11.160 --> 4:15:12.000
 and this, that and the other.

4:15:12.000 --> 4:15:13.240
 You just do the best you can.

4:15:13.240 --> 4:15:14.080
 You're in the arena.

4:15:14.080 --> 4:15:15.240
 You fight as hard as you can.

4:15:15.240 --> 4:15:19.120
 You leave nothing for home.

4:15:19.120 --> 4:15:20.720
 You could put it all on the field.

4:15:20.720 --> 4:15:21.680
 And then when you go home,

4:15:21.680 --> 4:15:23.160
 you have pride in what you've done.

4:15:23.160 --> 4:15:26.000
 And you know that you've at least made a slight difference.

4:15:26.000 --> 4:15:28.280
 You know, one person can make a huge difference.

4:15:28.280 --> 4:15:30.240
 Look at Norman Borlong.

4:15:30.240 --> 4:15:31.960
 I mean, just one or a whole world teaching people

4:15:31.960 --> 4:15:34.520
 how to grow crops that he saved a billion lives

4:15:34.520 --> 4:15:35.560
 over the course of his life.

4:15:35.560 --> 4:15:38.720
 Billion people didn't start to death because of one guy.

4:15:38.720 --> 4:15:40.920
 It's amazing the asymmetry and the returns

4:15:40.920 --> 4:15:41.760
 on that type of a thing.

4:15:41.760 --> 4:15:44.080
 Just for the knowledge transfer of all things

4:15:44.080 --> 4:15:46.080
 and yet not a household name.

4:15:46.080 --> 4:15:48.880
 So that's the other side of it, of the burdens.

4:15:48.880 --> 4:15:51.560
 You know, people always want something or something.

4:15:51.560 --> 4:15:53.240
 So they say, oh, if I endured all these burdens,

4:15:53.240 --> 4:15:54.720
 I should be given something.

4:15:54.720 --> 4:15:57.120
 I entered into this space fully expecting

4:15:57.120 --> 4:16:00.320
 that probably the most likely outcome was jail.

4:16:00.320 --> 4:16:02.440
 That's what my dad told me and other people told me.

4:16:02.440 --> 4:16:04.880
 And it was because it's like, look at where we came from.

4:16:04.880 --> 4:16:07.040
 The Liberty Dollar, Eagle, all these things.

4:16:07.040 --> 4:16:09.600
 Anybody tries to innovate the monetary system,

4:16:09.600 --> 4:16:12.080
 either end up like Gaddafi or they end up in prison

4:16:12.080 --> 4:16:15.120
 or they end up like nepotistic corrupt banker

4:16:15.120 --> 4:16:16.520
 or something like that.

4:16:16.520 --> 4:16:19.800
 And so, you know, the financial regulations

4:16:19.800 --> 4:16:22.320
 are not built for rapid innovation.

4:16:22.320 --> 4:16:24.080
 They're not built for Bitcoin.

4:16:24.080 --> 4:16:26.080
 There's a reason Satoshi was anonymous.

4:16:26.080 --> 4:16:28.080
 It wasn't because, you know, he enjoyed the anonymity

4:16:28.080 --> 4:16:30.880
 because there was legitimate criminal risk

4:16:30.880 --> 4:16:32.400
 for this type of activity.

4:16:32.400 --> 4:16:34.360
 So the fact that I've gotten this far

4:16:34.360 --> 4:16:37.040
 and I'm doing pretty good, that's a win.

4:16:37.040 --> 4:16:39.000
 You know, you take that, life is good.

4:16:40.000 --> 4:16:41.680
 What is a productive day in the life

4:16:41.680 --> 4:16:43.760
 of Charles Hoskinson look like?

4:16:43.760 --> 4:16:46.080
 Now, we're getting to the details here.

4:16:46.080 --> 4:16:49.360
 Diet, like fasting or not, maybe.

4:16:49.360 --> 4:16:54.160
 Coffee, non coffee, exercise, sleep,

4:16:54.160 --> 4:16:57.640
 scheduling like periods of deep work, programming,

4:16:57.640 --> 4:16:59.880
 then the social media stuff that you do.

4:16:59.880 --> 4:17:01.640
 You clearly enjoy being on social media

4:17:01.640 --> 4:17:04.320
 and also live streaming, educating, inspiring the world.

4:17:04.320 --> 4:17:07.920
 Or getting drunk and ranting at the computer.

4:17:07.920 --> 4:17:10.280
 Well, first off, you do a wet year and a dry year.

4:17:10.280 --> 4:17:12.360
 That's what prevents you from becoming an alcoholic.

4:17:12.360 --> 4:17:15.000
 So unfortunately, the way that schedule worked,

4:17:15.000 --> 4:17:17.040
 2020 was my dry year.

4:17:17.040 --> 4:17:18.800
 Like I didn't drink the entire year.

4:17:18.800 --> 4:17:20.920
 Now, single sip of alcohol, it was the worst.

4:17:20.920 --> 4:17:21.760
 On purpose.

4:17:21.760 --> 4:17:23.600
 Yeah, you do a dry year and then you do a wet year.

4:17:23.600 --> 4:17:26.280
 Oh, so this is one of your ideas about life

4:17:26.280 --> 4:17:27.320
 is you alternate.

4:17:27.320 --> 4:17:28.280
 Yeah, you have to alternate.

4:17:28.280 --> 4:17:30.480
 You know, never do too much of any one thing.

4:17:30.480 --> 4:17:31.680
 Well, Churchill never alternate.

4:17:31.680 --> 4:17:33.000
 He just kept drinking throughout his life.

4:17:33.000 --> 4:17:37.800
 He did pretty good, just to push back against you.

4:17:37.800 --> 4:17:39.400
 Yeah, him and Alfred North Whitehead.

4:17:39.400 --> 4:17:41.000
 Although, didn't Churchill get kicked out

4:17:41.000 --> 4:17:42.240
 as Prime Minister at some point?

4:17:42.240 --> 4:17:44.080
 So maybe he took one dry year.

4:17:44.080 --> 4:17:47.120
 Yeah, he was sober, happy in shape, Churchill.

4:17:47.120 --> 4:17:49.680
 He had to let it Britain for 30 fucking years, but.

4:17:51.680 --> 4:17:55.080
 See Lex, that's why we can't have nice things.

4:17:55.080 --> 4:17:57.000
 Hunter S. Thompson, maybe you're onto something.

4:17:57.000 --> 4:17:58.960
 Oh, you know, it's really crazy if you go to Aspen

4:17:58.960 --> 4:18:00.840
 and see the bar he used to go to.

4:18:00.840 --> 4:18:02.680
 I actually met a waitress who knew him really well

4:18:02.680 --> 4:18:05.320
 and he'd go in there like two, three times a day.

4:18:05.320 --> 4:18:07.560
 And she's like, yeah, he'd do cocaine right here

4:18:07.560 --> 4:18:10.240
 on the table and he'd come in with lots of pills

4:18:10.240 --> 4:18:12.280
 and just put them all out on the table

4:18:12.280 --> 4:18:13.840
 and be taking them at different hours.

4:18:13.840 --> 4:18:15.720
 And they were all clearly illegal substances,

4:18:15.720 --> 4:18:18.280
 but we just give him coffee for whatever he wanted.

4:18:18.280 --> 4:18:19.280
 He's a great guy.

4:18:19.280 --> 4:18:20.760
 But then we asked the day in the life of Charles.

4:18:20.760 --> 4:18:23.880
 I fast, I tried to intermittent fasting 16, 8.

4:18:23.880 --> 4:18:26.160
 The longest fast I ever did for a long term fast

4:18:26.160 --> 4:18:28.120
 was two weeks, which was just crazy.

4:18:28.120 --> 4:18:28.960
 Wow.

4:18:28.960 --> 4:18:30.160
 Oh my God, I was.

4:18:30.160 --> 4:18:33.160
 Can you take me to the journey of like philosophically

4:18:33.160 --> 4:18:34.720
 what was going on in your mind?

4:18:34.720 --> 4:18:37.160
 Well, so normally when I do an extended fast

4:18:37.160 --> 4:18:38.680
 it's about three, four days,

4:18:38.680 --> 4:18:39.880
 because that's the sweet spot

4:18:39.880 --> 4:18:41.560
 before you start losing muscle mass

4:18:41.560 --> 4:18:42.840
 and other things start happening.

4:18:42.840 --> 4:18:45.760
 And there's people know so much more about this than I do,

4:18:45.760 --> 4:18:47.040
 but I just feel pretty good.

4:18:47.040 --> 4:18:49.280
 And you kind of get addicted to the fast high.

4:18:49.280 --> 4:18:52.240
 You know, you don't have to eat, you have no downtime.

4:18:52.240 --> 4:18:54.640
 You're just going, your energy never dips.

4:18:54.640 --> 4:18:58.160
 And so I used to do like three, five days,

4:18:58.160 --> 4:19:00.760
 maybe three, four was the sweet spot.

4:19:00.760 --> 4:19:02.560
 But then after about a week, I was like,

4:19:02.560 --> 4:19:04.480
 how long do I, can I make this go?

4:19:04.480 --> 4:19:05.680
 And so I started talking to some people,

4:19:05.680 --> 4:19:09.800
 I said, well, Angus Barberry did 384 days.

4:19:09.800 --> 4:19:11.200
 Of course I'm not as fat as Angus.

4:19:11.200 --> 4:19:13.040
 So I said, oh, I can do two weeks.

4:19:13.040 --> 4:19:14.720
 So I just kept going and kept going

4:19:14.720 --> 4:19:16.040
 and kept going and kept going.

4:19:16.040 --> 4:19:18.880
 And right around the two week mark,

4:19:18.880 --> 4:19:21.600
 you know, I fainted for a little bit in a chair.

4:19:21.600 --> 4:19:24.880
 And I was like, okay, maybe I should start eating again.

4:19:24.880 --> 4:19:26.120
 But then I was legitimately worried

4:19:26.120 --> 4:19:28.560
 about like refeeding syndrome and this stuff like, okay,

4:19:28.560 --> 4:19:30.000
 how do I, how do I take care of that?

4:19:30.000 --> 4:19:32.120
 So my brother's a doctor and I called him and I said,

4:19:32.120 --> 4:19:34.280
 hey, Willie, you know, I haven't eaten in two weeks.

4:19:34.280 --> 4:19:36.400
 How do I, how do I start eating again?

4:19:36.400 --> 4:19:37.760
 And he's like, what?

4:19:39.760 --> 4:19:40.600
 Slowly.

4:19:40.600 --> 4:19:41.440
 Slowly.

4:19:41.440 --> 4:19:42.280
 Yeah.

4:19:42.280 --> 4:19:43.760
 So the usual routine intermittent fasting,

4:19:43.760 --> 4:19:46.000
 although I haven't been as good about it as I should be.

4:19:46.000 --> 4:19:48.720
 And I used to work out, I don't do as much as that.

4:19:48.720 --> 4:19:51.560
 The stress and the work life balance

4:19:51.560 --> 4:19:53.880
 has been horrible the last 24 months.

4:19:53.880 --> 4:19:55.920
 And I've gained a lot of weight and all that stuff.

4:19:55.920 --> 4:19:57.000
 But I'll fix that.

4:19:57.000 --> 4:19:58.160
 But I do try a lot of things.

4:19:58.160 --> 4:20:00.280
 Like I use the call map and I do meditation.

4:20:00.280 --> 4:20:02.680
 Recently I started doing photobiomodulation.

4:20:02.680 --> 4:20:03.720
 You ever heard of that?

4:20:03.720 --> 4:20:04.560
 No.

4:20:04.560 --> 4:20:06.120
 It's crazy headset called a V light.

4:20:06.120 --> 4:20:08.080
 You saw that picture of me with like the weird thing

4:20:08.080 --> 4:20:09.400
 with the red lights on.

4:20:09.400 --> 4:20:10.880
 Actually it shoots lights into your brain.

4:20:10.880 --> 4:20:12.200
 It's really cool stuff.

4:20:12.200 --> 4:20:13.200
 But it proves blood flow.

4:20:13.200 --> 4:20:15.320
 And actually there's some peer reviewed studies

4:20:15.320 --> 4:20:17.200
 that show that it does neurogenesis.

4:20:17.200 --> 4:20:19.840
 So you actually generate new neurons and things like that.

4:20:19.840 --> 4:20:21.160
 It's really cool stuff.

4:20:21.160 --> 4:20:23.960
 So I do that and it actually helps a lot.

4:20:23.960 --> 4:20:26.880
 And you know, it's every day is a little different.

4:20:26.880 --> 4:20:31.280
 Do you get a few hours of like a long time to work to think?

4:20:31.280 --> 4:20:33.680
 Yeah, deep work is so important.

4:20:33.680 --> 4:20:36.720
 You know, there's even a book on that, like deep work.

4:20:36.720 --> 4:20:38.040
 Yeah, by Cal Newport.

4:20:38.040 --> 4:20:39.200
 I think you interviewed him, didn't you?

4:20:39.200 --> 4:20:41.520
 Yeah, everyone should listen to his podcast.

4:20:41.520 --> 4:20:43.320
 Deep questions, he's awesome.

4:20:43.320 --> 4:20:46.720
 He's a mathematician, a theoretical computer scientist.

4:20:46.720 --> 4:20:48.320
 So those guys really need their time

4:20:48.320 --> 4:20:49.520
 to really think.

4:20:49.520 --> 4:20:51.320
 That's the one thing I deeply miss.

4:20:51.320 --> 4:20:54.840
 When you're a CEO, you're the master of the five minute deal.

4:20:54.840 --> 4:20:56.400
 You come in, you talk to people for a minute,

4:20:56.400 --> 4:20:58.080
 you make a decision, you move on the next thing,

4:20:58.080 --> 4:20:59.040
 you move on the next thing.

4:20:59.040 --> 4:21:01.280
 And I used to be used to like really deep focus.

4:21:01.280 --> 4:21:02.720
 You'd sit down and think about something

4:21:02.720 --> 4:21:05.080
 for 10 hours, 15 hours, 20 hours.

4:21:05.080 --> 4:21:05.920
 And that's that.

4:21:05.920 --> 4:21:06.760
 And I enjoyed it.

4:21:06.760 --> 4:21:09.800
 It was just so beautiful to get lost into something

4:21:09.800 --> 4:21:11.840
 and just go and go and go.

4:21:11.840 --> 4:21:13.360
 And then you become a CEO and it's like,

4:21:13.360 --> 4:21:14.360
 you never can go and go.

4:21:14.360 --> 4:21:16.400
 You're lucky if you read a four page thing,

4:21:16.400 --> 4:21:18.120
 because there's something else that comes up, you know?

4:21:18.120 --> 4:21:19.760
 You have to travel, you have to do that.

4:21:19.760 --> 4:21:21.640
 So I've been trying lately to have,

4:21:21.640 --> 4:21:23.840
 and actually our chief of staff recommended,

4:21:23.840 --> 4:21:26.240
 like Fridays is do not disturb day.

4:21:26.240 --> 4:21:27.880
 So it's for deep work, you know,

4:21:27.880 --> 4:21:29.720
 you don't have meetings and any of these things.

4:21:29.720 --> 4:21:32.040
 And so far I have not committed to that,

4:21:32.040 --> 4:21:33.320
 but everybody else in the organization

4:21:33.320 --> 4:21:34.200
 has started to move there.

4:21:34.200 --> 4:21:35.640
 But my hope is next month

4:21:35.640 --> 4:21:37.560
 that I can actually get serious about that.

4:21:37.560 --> 4:21:39.240
 The other time I'm lost in thought is

4:21:39.240 --> 4:21:40.760
 I do a lot of float tanks.

4:21:40.760 --> 4:21:42.360
 Have you ever done isolation tanks?

4:21:42.360 --> 4:21:43.800
 But I really want to.

4:21:43.800 --> 4:21:45.840
 It's one of the most amazing things you can do.

4:21:45.840 --> 4:21:48.000
 You know, you come out on the other side

4:21:48.000 --> 4:21:51.200
 and all your stress worries, they're just gone.

4:21:51.200 --> 4:21:53.880
 And you have so much productivity and clarity.

4:21:53.880 --> 4:21:57.160
 If you combine that with daily naps, that's the way to go.

4:21:57.160 --> 4:21:58.560
 Yeah, I'm a huge fan of naps.

4:21:58.560 --> 4:22:01.520
 So what about the social media stuff

4:22:01.520 --> 4:22:04.520
 and like you doing the live streams?

4:22:04.520 --> 4:22:06.200
 Do you ever dread those?

4:22:06.200 --> 4:22:08.480
 Do you, are you energized by those?

4:22:08.480 --> 4:22:10.920
 So because you're exceptionally good at communicating

4:22:10.920 --> 4:22:12.240
 all the different kinds of ideas

4:22:12.240 --> 4:22:14.000
 and being very transparent with the community,

4:22:14.000 --> 4:22:14.840
 all those kinds of things.

4:22:14.840 --> 4:22:16.200
 I really enjoy the live streams.

4:22:16.200 --> 4:22:18.920
 You know, it's fun, it's never been a chore

4:22:18.920 --> 4:22:20.200
 because it's for them.

4:22:20.200 --> 4:22:22.240
 You know, it's a chance for people in the community

4:22:22.240 --> 4:22:23.600
 who've been loyal and they really love it

4:22:23.600 --> 4:22:25.600
 to actually just be there, ask some questions

4:22:25.600 --> 4:22:28.320
 and I try to make it as entertaining as possible.

4:22:28.320 --> 4:22:32.160
 And you know, you have your trolls and you have your love

4:22:32.160 --> 4:22:34.680
 and it's actually nice to have a mixture of the two

4:22:34.680 --> 4:22:37.040
 because sometimes you can beat down trolls just for fun.

4:22:37.040 --> 4:22:37.920
 You know, that kind of stuff.

4:22:37.920 --> 4:22:40.440
 And I, it's grown to a cult following.

4:22:40.440 --> 4:22:42.480
 I think there's like 40, 50,000 people

4:22:42.480 --> 4:22:45.400
 and it's almost like Fight Club in a certain respect.

4:22:45.400 --> 4:22:47.440
 So I was in Vancouver years ago

4:22:47.440 --> 4:22:49.360
 and I was at Air Canada checking in

4:22:49.360 --> 4:22:50.960
 just about to fly back to Colorado

4:22:50.960 --> 4:22:52.560
 and it's getting this weird vibe

4:22:52.560 --> 4:22:53.960
 from the guy that was checking me in.

4:22:53.960 --> 4:22:56.000
 And then right after he takes my bag,

4:22:56.000 --> 4:22:59.080
 he kind of leans over to me, he's like, I love Ada.

4:22:59.080 --> 4:23:00.280
 You know, and I was like, really?

4:23:00.280 --> 4:23:02.520
 He's like, yeah, I watch your live streams.

4:23:02.520 --> 4:23:04.040
 And then I was flying into London.

4:23:04.040 --> 4:23:05.480
 I was in London, he threw airport

4:23:05.480 --> 4:23:07.320
 and the passport control guy was there

4:23:07.320 --> 4:23:09.120
 and I was just about to take my passport out

4:23:09.120 --> 4:23:11.400
 and he says, welcome to London, Mr. Hoskinson.

4:23:11.400 --> 4:23:15.200
 I was like, oh God, am I going to jail in London?

4:23:15.200 --> 4:23:17.520
 Why does the border patrol guy know who I am?

4:23:17.520 --> 4:23:19.400
 This is a bad deal for me.

4:23:19.400 --> 4:23:22.040
 And it turned out he watched my live streams.

4:23:22.040 --> 4:23:25.760
 And so there's a lot of that and that's so much fun.

4:23:25.760 --> 4:23:27.120
 In fact, here in Austin,

4:23:27.120 --> 4:23:31.360
 as a Mexican restaurant just down close to this place,

4:23:31.360 --> 4:23:32.320
 and while eating there,

4:23:32.320 --> 4:23:33.920
 two different people recognized me

4:23:33.920 --> 4:23:35.400
 and I took a picture with one of them.

4:23:35.400 --> 4:23:37.240
 And again, they watched the live streams.

4:23:37.240 --> 4:23:38.080
 So that's...

4:23:38.080 --> 4:23:39.240
 Well, if it's anything like Fight Club,

4:23:39.240 --> 4:23:40.920
 you have to wonder if some of those people

4:23:40.920 --> 4:23:43.480
 or all of them are just figments of your imagination.

4:23:43.480 --> 4:23:47.480
 Right, I don't have an answer for that.

4:23:49.480 --> 4:23:51.200
 I could be a figment of your imagination,

4:23:51.200 --> 4:23:52.040
 it just proves that yes.

4:23:52.040 --> 4:23:52.880
 Yeah, but honestly,

4:23:52.880 --> 4:23:54.640
 if I was capable of that level of delusion,

4:23:54.640 --> 4:23:56.400
 why the hell don't I look like Brad Pitt?

4:23:56.400 --> 4:23:57.240
 Good point.

4:23:57.240 --> 4:24:01.080
 Okay, so on this topic, let me ask you about mushrooms.

4:24:02.400 --> 4:24:05.600
 You're interested in mushrooms, growing mushrooms.

4:24:05.600 --> 4:24:08.240
 I believe you are also interested

4:24:08.240 --> 4:24:11.320
 in the mind expanding capabilities of psychedelics.

4:24:11.320 --> 4:24:14.280
 At least you mentioned kind of the interesting place

4:24:14.280 --> 4:24:15.120
 where you're interested

4:24:15.120 --> 4:24:17.560
 in non psychedelic mushrooms might go.

4:24:17.560 --> 4:24:21.160
 Can you explain the nature of your interest in mushrooms?

4:24:21.160 --> 4:24:22.000
 Is it personal?

4:24:22.000 --> 4:24:22.920
 Is it business?

4:24:22.920 --> 4:24:24.160
 Is it both?

4:24:24.160 --> 4:24:25.520
 Well, it's a little bit of everything.

4:24:25.520 --> 4:24:28.040
 You know, it's just an underexplored area

4:24:28.040 --> 4:24:31.240
 of science and botany that ought to be explored

4:24:31.240 --> 4:24:34.640
 because there's so much cool, interesting stuff there.

4:24:34.640 --> 4:24:37.360
 Mushrooms do so much.

4:24:37.360 --> 4:24:39.400
 Like they have these things called courtesepes

4:24:39.400 --> 4:24:42.280
 and they are like a zombie fungus

4:24:42.280 --> 4:24:45.040
 that infects insects, takes them over

4:24:45.040 --> 4:24:47.760
 and then it will have them kind of get to other insects

4:24:47.760 --> 4:24:50.200
 and then burst out of their head like an alien

4:24:50.200 --> 4:24:52.240
 and spray spores on them and repeat the process.

4:24:52.240 --> 4:24:53.920
 I mean, they even made a damn game about this,

4:24:53.920 --> 4:24:55.840
 the last of us or something like that.

4:24:55.840 --> 4:24:56.880
 And this is a real thing.

4:24:56.880 --> 4:24:59.040
 Like you can Google it and see like these dead hands

4:24:59.040 --> 4:25:01.440
 with these fungal stabs coming out of them.

4:25:01.440 --> 4:25:03.840
 It's like, holy God, this is crazy.

4:25:03.840 --> 4:25:08.240
 And in the same topic,

4:25:08.240 --> 4:25:09.720
 you go all the way to Lion's Mane

4:25:09.720 --> 4:25:11.760
 and it could actually help treat Alzheimer's

4:25:11.760 --> 4:25:14.480
 and treat depression and Parkinson's

4:25:14.480 --> 4:25:16.720
 and regrow nerves and so forth.

4:25:16.720 --> 4:25:20.560
 Other things, they've shown some effectiveness against COVID.

4:25:20.560 --> 4:25:23.040
 You know, it's just so crazy the diversity

4:25:23.040 --> 4:25:27.200
 in the mushroom kingdom of the medicinal applications,

4:25:27.200 --> 4:25:29.600
 the pesticide applications.

4:25:29.600 --> 4:25:32.320
 You can use it a lot to kind of save hay and trees.

4:25:32.320 --> 4:25:33.600
 There's a lot of things you can do

4:25:33.600 --> 4:25:37.120
 to combat all kinds of invasive species.

4:25:37.120 --> 4:25:39.600
 And it's true, there's a lot of cool stuff

4:25:39.600 --> 4:25:42.080
 with psychedelic mushrooms and there's a great book

4:25:42.080 --> 4:25:44.880
 from Michael Pollan, How to Change Your Mind,

4:25:44.880 --> 4:25:46.360
 where he was really the first journalist

4:25:46.360 --> 4:25:49.280
 a long time to go and Roland Kriss has worked his way

4:25:49.280 --> 4:25:50.960
 through the Johns Hopkins studies.

4:25:50.960 --> 4:25:53.000
 But the longest short for me when I read that book,

4:25:53.000 --> 4:25:54.880
 like, okay, mine expansion is great,

4:25:54.880 --> 4:25:59.280
 but look at the effectiveness of psychedelics,

4:25:59.280 --> 4:26:02.200
 psalocybe mushrooms with SSRIs,

4:26:02.200 --> 4:26:04.000
 selective serotonin readup take inhibitors

4:26:04.000 --> 4:26:05.520
 for the treatment of depression.

4:26:05.520 --> 4:26:07.840
 They showed in the Johns Hopkins studies

4:26:07.840 --> 4:26:09.920
 that they're equal or better in effectiveness

4:26:09.920 --> 4:26:10.760
 in many cases.

4:26:10.760 --> 4:26:12.080
 Yes, fascinating.

4:26:12.080 --> 4:26:13.720
 For the treatment of depression,

4:26:13.720 --> 4:26:16.640
 then a drug that you have to take forever.

4:26:16.640 --> 4:26:18.560
 And this is just one or two treatments

4:26:18.560 --> 4:26:20.520
 and then you desist from it.

4:26:20.520 --> 4:26:21.720
 That's a miracle,

4:26:21.720 --> 4:26:22.960
 because there's so many people suffer

4:26:22.960 --> 4:26:26.720
 from severe depression and it's a lifetime ailment.

4:26:26.720 --> 4:26:29.000
 And the fact that we have something in the toolbox

4:26:29.000 --> 4:26:32.360
 that we've under explored is a very powerful thing.

4:26:32.360 --> 4:26:34.120
 The other thing was end of life issues.

4:26:34.120 --> 4:26:35.760
 A lot of people get cancer.

4:26:35.760 --> 4:26:38.160
 I've lost people in the family from cancer.

4:26:38.160 --> 4:26:41.040
 And it's so hard those last two, three months,

4:26:41.040 --> 4:26:43.200
 because they kind of have this,

4:26:43.200 --> 4:26:44.600
 they're in a horrific pain,

4:26:44.600 --> 4:26:45.600
 they're trying to find meaning

4:26:45.600 --> 4:26:47.440
 and why is this happening to me?

4:26:47.440 --> 4:26:49.080
 And if you can just give them a substance

4:26:49.080 --> 4:26:50.200
 that on the other side of it,

4:26:50.200 --> 4:26:51.960
 there's a good chance they can come to peace

4:26:51.960 --> 4:26:54.360
 with everything and die with a lot more dignity

4:26:54.360 --> 4:26:57.760
 and happiness, that alone justifies

4:26:57.760 --> 4:26:59.360
 an enormous amount of study.

4:26:59.360 --> 4:27:01.440
 And the fact that these things are super cheap

4:27:01.440 --> 4:27:03.840
 and they grow pretty much anywhere, pretty cool.

4:27:03.840 --> 4:27:04.840
 Now, on the commercial side,

4:27:04.840 --> 4:27:06.920
 you can make a lot of money from mushrooms.

4:27:06.920 --> 4:27:09.160
 And I'm working with a company called Farmbox Foods.

4:27:09.160 --> 4:27:11.160
 And it's one of the,

4:27:11.160 --> 4:27:13.520
 they do both vertical hydropartic farming.

4:27:13.520 --> 4:27:15.520
 They also do mushroom.

4:27:15.520 --> 4:27:20.000
 And they put these amazing labs and shipping containers

4:27:20.000 --> 4:27:22.000
 that are kind of like controlled environments.

4:27:22.000 --> 4:27:24.200
 And you grow 400 pounds of gourmet mushrooms

4:27:24.200 --> 4:27:26.080
 a single week off of that.

4:27:26.080 --> 4:27:28.400
 And your margins can be up to 30% per year.

4:27:28.400 --> 4:27:31.280
 If you're just selling them for food consumption,

4:27:31.280 --> 4:27:32.200
 if you're doing supplements,

4:27:32.200 --> 4:27:34.320
 they can be even higher than that.

4:27:34.320 --> 4:27:35.400
 So it just kind of made sense

4:27:35.400 --> 4:27:37.200
 from a diversification of assets to say,

4:27:37.200 --> 4:27:38.880
 hey, let's do some stuff in hydroponics

4:27:38.880 --> 4:27:40.840
 and aquaponics and in mushrooms.

4:27:40.840 --> 4:27:41.680
 But the more I do,

4:27:41.680 --> 4:27:43.200
 the more I learn that community,

4:27:43.200 --> 4:27:45.320
 just the cooler that community is.

4:27:45.320 --> 4:27:47.160
 Like I went to this beautiful mushroom festival

4:27:47.160 --> 4:27:49.800
 in Cape Springs down in Georgia.

4:27:49.800 --> 4:27:52.840
 And I met this guy named Bill Yule.

4:27:52.840 --> 4:27:54.960
 And he just looks like a druid.

4:27:54.960 --> 4:27:56.560
 You know, just like he lives in a tree

4:27:56.560 --> 4:27:58.600
 and he opens up the tree and goes out and everything.

4:27:58.600 --> 4:27:59.760
 And I was like, Bill, what do you do?

4:27:59.760 --> 4:28:03.400
 He said, I go and I try to study beetles and bull eats

4:28:03.400 --> 4:28:05.040
 in a very particular type of beetle.

4:28:05.040 --> 4:28:07.560
 And they mate in the most crazy way.

4:28:07.560 --> 4:28:10.440
 It's like this beetle will fuse on top of another beetle

4:28:10.440 --> 4:28:11.600
 and they'll vibrate.

4:28:11.600 --> 4:28:12.800
 And if they make the right harmony,

4:28:12.800 --> 4:28:13.640
 she'll mate with them.

4:28:13.640 --> 4:28:14.880
 Otherwise, they'll kick her off.

4:28:14.880 --> 4:28:16.240
 And you can only make the harmony

4:28:16.240 --> 4:28:18.760
 while you're on a specific type of bully mushroom.

4:28:18.760 --> 4:28:20.440
 If it's anywhere else, the harmony doesn't.

4:28:20.440 --> 4:28:22.960
 It's like, who the fuck does this stuff?

4:28:22.960 --> 4:28:24.800
 It's like 20 years, 30 years,

4:28:24.800 --> 4:28:27.800
 just thinking about goddamn beetles and bully mushrooms.

4:28:27.800 --> 4:28:28.960
 But that's that community.

4:28:28.960 --> 4:28:31.520
 And they're the happiest people you'll ever meet.

4:28:31.520 --> 4:28:33.200
 And they're just so much fun to talk to

4:28:33.200 --> 4:28:36.440
 and there's just so much lore there that's not discovered.

4:28:36.440 --> 4:28:39.720
 The other thing is there's a ton of undiscovered mushrooms.

4:28:39.720 --> 4:28:42.040
 So, you know, you go to my ranch up in Wyoming,

4:28:42.040 --> 4:28:43.680
 go out that national forest next to it.

4:28:43.680 --> 4:28:46.000
 You'll probably discover six or seven new species,

4:28:46.000 --> 4:28:48.920
 just doing some gene sequencing and things like that.

4:28:48.920 --> 4:28:52.560
 So there's like a gold rush for new things to discover

4:28:52.560 --> 4:28:53.840
 to treat all kinds of things.

4:28:53.840 --> 4:28:55.560
 So love mushrooms, love that community.

4:28:55.560 --> 4:28:57.760
 I think there's a lot of wonderful medicinal properties

4:28:57.760 --> 4:29:00.760
 and everybody there is just a lot of fun to hang out with.

4:29:00.760 --> 4:29:03.000
 The other passion is aquaponics and hydroponics.

4:29:03.000 --> 4:29:06.000
 And I got a lot more serious after COVID.

4:29:06.000 --> 4:29:08.560
 I go to the supermarket, all the store shelves are barren.

4:29:08.560 --> 4:29:10.480
 And I say, guys, can you imagine

4:29:10.480 --> 4:29:13.400
 if we had a real big thing, what this would be like?

4:29:13.400 --> 4:29:15.480
 We need to have domestic food production.

4:29:15.480 --> 4:29:17.960
 We need to have resilience at the community level.

4:29:17.960 --> 4:29:21.200
 So let's go build a $40, $50 million aquaponics facility

4:29:21.200 --> 4:29:23.360
 next to every major city.

4:29:23.360 --> 4:29:26.280
 So at least you have some local production of food

4:29:26.280 --> 4:29:27.840
 and people won't starve to death.

4:29:27.840 --> 4:29:29.680
 Otherwise, it's very bad.

4:29:29.680 --> 4:29:32.880
 And again, the margins are phenomenal there, 20%, 30%.

4:29:32.880 --> 4:29:34.120
 If you actually do it right

4:29:34.120 --> 4:29:36.320
 and alternate your crops properly and so forth.

4:29:36.320 --> 4:29:38.880
 And you create a lot of high paying jobs with it as well.

4:29:38.880 --> 4:29:41.680
 And so you kind of draw a lot of value

4:29:41.680 --> 4:29:44.200
 from staying close to nature and all of these kinds of ways

4:29:44.200 --> 4:29:45.480
 to keeping you humble.

4:29:45.480 --> 4:29:46.640
 Like you said, what is it?

4:29:46.640 --> 4:29:49.080
 The goat is still gonna crap on you.

4:29:49.080 --> 4:29:50.680
 Oh yeah, the doggies will shit on you

4:29:50.680 --> 4:29:53.120
 whether you're broke or a billionaire.

4:29:53.120 --> 4:29:53.960
 That's a good line.

4:29:53.960 --> 4:29:58.960
 I just don't like, the line you'll be remembered for

4:29:59.760 --> 4:30:01.440
 if the universe has a sense of humor.

4:30:01.440 --> 4:30:03.560
 Yes, it's a Neo Yogi para.

4:30:04.520 --> 4:30:07.320
 So I think mushrooms is a good place

4:30:07.320 --> 4:30:11.200
 to ask about my friend, Joe Rogan.

4:30:11.200 --> 4:30:13.320
 So I keep folks from the Cardano community

4:30:13.320 --> 4:30:15.920
 keep saying things like,

4:30:15.920 --> 4:30:18.920
 legs podcast first, then Joe Rogan experience.

4:30:18.920 --> 4:30:23.000
 I guess I'm the moon and Joe's Mars in this metaphor.

4:30:24.040 --> 4:30:25.200
 Since I'm a CS person,

4:30:25.200 --> 4:30:29.160
 I can talk a little bit more fluently about cryptocurrency

4:30:29.160 --> 4:30:31.640
 because fundamentally cryptocurrency

4:30:31.640 --> 4:30:33.120
 is a computational idea.

4:30:33.120 --> 4:30:34.840
 But then there's somebody like Joe

4:30:34.840 --> 4:30:36.280
 who's more like an every man

4:30:36.280 --> 4:30:38.120
 and he does not necessarily know

4:30:38.120 --> 4:30:40.760
 the technical intricacies of cryptocurrencies.

4:30:41.720 --> 4:30:42.920
 What kind of, and I don't think

4:30:42.920 --> 4:30:45.160
 he's had a cryptocurrency person on.

4:30:45.160 --> 4:30:47.520
 Did I do any interview and dress on Tidopolis?

4:30:47.520 --> 4:30:48.360
 Oh, he did.

4:30:48.360 --> 4:30:49.400
 I had long, long time ago.

4:30:49.400 --> 4:30:50.640
 But that was almost like,

4:30:52.360 --> 4:30:54.840
 the cryptocurrency space goes through phases.

4:30:54.840 --> 4:30:57.600
 And I think we're in a new era of some kind.

4:30:57.600 --> 4:31:01.840
 And what, how do you talk to Joe about Cardano?

4:31:01.840 --> 4:31:04.880
 How do you talk to Joe about what the heck,

4:31:04.880 --> 4:31:06.200
 I remember somebody tried to explain to him

4:31:06.200 --> 4:31:07.960
 what Dogecoin is.

4:31:07.960 --> 4:31:09.360
 How do you explain this whole space?

4:31:09.360 --> 4:31:12.120
 So what Bitcoin is, of where Ethereum is,

4:31:12.120 --> 4:31:13.840
 where Cardano smart contracts

4:31:13.840 --> 4:31:15.240
 and some of this Puthas work

4:31:15.240 --> 4:31:18.520
 with this Puthas stake ideas that we'll be talking about.

4:31:18.520 --> 4:31:20.920
 You don't, what you do is you start with applications

4:31:20.920 --> 4:31:21.840
 that they're interested in.

4:31:21.840 --> 4:31:22.960
 So he's an Elk Hunter.

4:31:22.960 --> 4:31:25.880
 And so he's probably interested in Elk tags, right?

4:31:25.880 --> 4:31:28.160
 So you start there and you say that whole system

4:31:28.160 --> 4:31:29.240
 can be put on a blockchain

4:31:29.240 --> 4:31:31.760
 and here's how it's going to be better for you.

4:31:31.760 --> 4:31:32.600
 You say that's what you do.

4:31:32.600 --> 4:31:35.160
 You always connect it to something they know and love.

4:31:35.160 --> 4:31:37.880
 And then once they get that, they say, oh, that's really cool.

4:31:37.880 --> 4:31:39.760
 And then they ask, what else can you do with it?

4:31:39.760 --> 4:31:41.240
 What else can you sell me on it?

4:31:41.240 --> 4:31:43.160
 And you kind of work your way outwards there.

4:31:43.160 --> 4:31:44.400
 Problem technologists make

4:31:44.400 --> 4:31:46.480
 is they're so damn in love with the technology.

4:31:46.480 --> 4:31:48.200
 They have that tail wagging the dog

4:31:48.200 --> 4:31:50.480
 where they just want to talk about the technology

4:31:50.480 --> 4:31:52.040
 and how incredibly cool it is.

4:31:52.040 --> 4:31:52.880
 And that's fun.

4:31:52.880 --> 4:31:53.760
 It's like talking about math.

4:31:53.760 --> 4:31:55.840
 Oh God, let's talk about cobertisms.

4:31:55.840 --> 4:31:56.680
 That's fun.

4:31:58.120 --> 4:31:59.600
 Everybody's eyes glows over.

4:31:59.600 --> 4:32:01.440
 No, you always have to connect it

4:32:01.440 --> 4:32:03.560
 to the interest of the particular person

4:32:03.560 --> 4:32:04.840
 and what they care about, what they love,

4:32:04.840 --> 4:32:07.160
 what they need, royalty payments.

4:32:07.160 --> 4:32:09.520
 He's a big guy, he's got the Spotify things,

4:32:09.520 --> 4:32:11.000
 got all these things going on.

4:32:11.000 --> 4:32:13.160
 Intellectual property is probably pretty important, Joe,

4:32:13.160 --> 4:32:14.440
 but some juncture.

4:32:14.440 --> 4:32:16.880
 So NFTs, we can talk about this concept

4:32:16.880 --> 4:32:18.600
 of perpetual royalties.

4:32:18.600 --> 4:32:21.520
 So for example, let's say that you create a piece of art.

4:32:21.520 --> 4:32:24.320
 You can build into the token itself.

4:32:24.320 --> 4:32:26.760
 A perpetual royalty is something you care about.

4:32:26.760 --> 4:32:29.720
 Maybe every time it sells, it pays it back to you.

4:32:29.720 --> 4:32:31.480
 Or maybe every time it sells,

4:32:31.480 --> 4:32:33.400
 it donate to some clean water charity

4:32:33.400 --> 4:32:34.680
 or something like that.

4:32:34.680 --> 4:32:37.720
 The point is that the actual acquisition of the NFT

4:32:37.720 --> 4:32:40.280
 requires adherence to that smart contract.

4:32:40.280 --> 4:32:42.280
 So people can't deviate from your desire

4:32:42.280 --> 4:32:43.840
 even after you die.

4:32:43.840 --> 4:32:46.960
 So stuff from Andy Warhol or from Picasso,

4:32:46.960 --> 4:32:49.520
 that can still be generating some donation

4:32:49.520 --> 4:32:52.160
 every time a Picasso sells to something else.

4:32:52.160 --> 4:32:54.200
 You can do that with NFTs.

4:32:54.200 --> 4:32:56.040
 And so he starts thinking, God, what else can I do?

4:32:56.040 --> 4:32:57.000
 I do shows.

4:32:57.000 --> 4:32:59.120
 Maybe I can do my tickets with these types of things.

4:32:59.120 --> 4:33:01.360
 Maybe I can do loyalty points for my fans.

4:33:01.360 --> 4:33:02.720
 So now you've got to engage

4:33:02.720 --> 4:33:04.880
 and he's thinking of all the opportunities for him.

4:33:04.880 --> 4:33:07.240
 And it gives him an incentive to anchor

4:33:07.240 --> 4:33:08.920
 and connect to those concepts.

4:33:08.920 --> 4:33:11.240
 And then over time, he starts asking question,

4:33:11.240 --> 4:33:12.960
 how do we know it's secure?

4:33:12.960 --> 4:33:15.400
 Then we can talk about proof of work or proof of stake

4:33:15.400 --> 4:33:16.320
 or these types of things.

4:33:16.320 --> 4:33:18.200
 Well, so this is how it stays secure

4:33:18.200 --> 4:33:19.480
 if you're really interested.

4:33:19.480 --> 4:33:22.840
 And there's an incentive to have the attention span

4:33:22.840 --> 4:33:25.000
 necessary to do the homework, eat the broccoli

4:33:25.000 --> 4:33:25.920
 and get over that hill.

4:33:25.920 --> 4:33:27.880
 But it's also an opportunity, at least it was for me,

4:33:27.880 --> 4:33:30.440
 especially with Bitcoin a while ago,

4:33:30.440 --> 4:33:34.000
 is to take another look at the monetary system.

4:33:34.000 --> 4:33:36.400
 Even look at the, I've been looking quite a bit

4:33:36.400 --> 4:33:38.080
 at the history of the 20th century

4:33:38.080 --> 4:33:39.960
 and sort of look at that history

4:33:39.960 --> 4:33:42.240
 through the perspective of the monetary system

4:33:42.240 --> 4:33:44.080
 or the gold standard and all those kinds of things.

4:33:44.080 --> 4:33:47.400
 And just add that little layer of consideration

4:33:47.400 --> 4:33:51.440
 of how much money, of how money can be used

4:33:51.440 --> 4:33:55.400
 to buy people in power to control the populace.

4:33:55.400 --> 4:33:59.960
 And it's fascinating to look at the history

4:33:59.960 --> 4:34:00.960
 from that perspective.

4:34:00.960 --> 4:34:03.360
 And then that allows you to look at the future

4:34:03.360 --> 4:34:06.720
 of how we can change that in order to empower people.

4:34:06.720 --> 4:34:09.800
 And then of course, the governance thing

4:34:09.800 --> 4:34:11.240
 that you're working on is fascinating

4:34:11.240 --> 4:34:13.600
 because, I mean, I don't know,

4:34:13.600 --> 4:34:16.160
 but it seems like a deeply broken aspect

4:34:16.160 --> 4:34:18.800
 of our government is just the voting system.

4:34:18.800 --> 4:34:21.760
 And discussing how that could be revolutionized

4:34:21.760 --> 4:34:24.000
 is fascinating because a lot of conversations

4:34:24.000 --> 4:34:29.000
 end up being on the internet about like number go up,

4:34:29.600 --> 4:34:31.000
 which is like financial side.

4:34:31.000 --> 4:34:32.960
 And to me personally, at least,

4:34:32.960 --> 4:34:36.760
 I think that's the same for Joe, that's just boring.

4:34:36.760 --> 4:34:40.160
 Like it's the investing, the financial side of it.

4:34:40.160 --> 4:34:43.360
 I know it has a lot of impact, but it's kind of boring

4:34:43.360 --> 4:34:45.080
 because longterm is not going to have any impact.

4:34:45.080 --> 4:34:48.040
 If the idea is a strong longterm, it's going to win.

4:34:48.040 --> 4:34:50.400
 The ideas are weak, longterm is going to lose.

4:34:50.400 --> 4:34:52.800
 The ups and downs of the short term don't matter.

4:34:52.800 --> 4:34:57.200
 That's just like casino games that you play.

4:34:58.160 --> 4:35:00.240
 Speaking of games, video games,

4:35:00.240 --> 4:35:01.320
 gotta ask you about those.

4:35:01.320 --> 4:35:02.160
 Okay.

4:35:02.160 --> 4:35:03.040
 Will you mention Diablo?

4:35:03.040 --> 4:35:04.240
 Maybe you're a fan of Diablo.

4:35:04.240 --> 4:35:06.200
 Well, yeah, Diablo is great.

4:35:06.200 --> 4:35:07.280
 Do you like Skyrim?

4:35:07.280 --> 4:35:08.560
 Skyrim is great too.

4:35:08.560 --> 4:35:09.400
 Like The Elder Scrolls.

4:35:09.400 --> 4:35:10.440
 I actually bought the game

4:35:10.440 --> 4:35:13.000
 that The Elder Scrolls was based on, do you know that?

4:35:13.000 --> 4:35:16.320
 So way back in the day, The Elder Scrolls series

4:35:16.320 --> 4:35:18.600
 was inspired by a game called Legends of Valor

4:35:18.600 --> 4:35:20.120
 that I played when I was a little kid.

4:35:20.120 --> 4:35:22.000
 And it doesn't actually have an ending.

4:35:22.000 --> 4:35:23.640
 They ran out of money before they finished it.

4:35:23.640 --> 4:35:25.680
 So they just kind of like put this little thing on

4:35:25.680 --> 4:35:27.440
 and said, okay, but you never finish it.

4:35:27.440 --> 4:35:29.640
 So I actually bought all the intellectual property

4:35:29.640 --> 4:35:30.480
 for the game.

4:35:30.480 --> 4:35:31.320
 I saw that.

4:35:31.320 --> 4:35:32.160
 I didn't know there was a connection

4:35:32.160 --> 4:35:33.000
 to Legends of Valor.

4:35:33.000 --> 4:35:34.720
 Yeah, I forget the name.

4:35:34.720 --> 4:35:37.640
 The guy was at Todd's Something at Bethesda.

4:35:37.640 --> 4:35:40.280
 He played it and he was inspired by it.

4:35:40.280 --> 4:35:42.880
 And then he created Arena right after playing it.

4:35:42.880 --> 4:35:43.840
 That was such a good game.

4:35:43.840 --> 4:35:45.280
 Arena, Daggerfall.

4:35:45.280 --> 4:35:46.120
 Yeah.

4:35:46.120 --> 4:35:47.120
 Yeah.

4:35:47.120 --> 4:35:48.960
 I had a copy of Daggerfall when I was a kid,

4:35:48.960 --> 4:35:49.880
 but it had a bug in.

4:35:49.880 --> 4:35:51.960
 So when you left the dungeon, it would crash.

4:35:51.960 --> 4:35:54.880
 And this was before, like he can get an easy patch for it.

4:35:54.880 --> 4:35:56.920
 So I never actually played Daggerfall.

4:35:56.920 --> 4:35:58.640
 I entered in through Morrowind.

4:36:00.080 --> 4:36:00.920
 Yeah.

4:36:00.920 --> 4:36:02.880
 No, the Daggerfall was the fascinating thing

4:36:02.880 --> 4:36:04.000
 which jumping all over,

4:36:04.000 --> 4:36:05.440
 but we'll return to Legends of Valor

4:36:05.440 --> 4:36:06.440
 because I want to ask you about that.

4:36:06.440 --> 4:36:07.720
 But Daggerfall was fascinating

4:36:07.720 --> 4:36:11.120
 because I think of all of the Elder Scroll games,

4:36:11.120 --> 4:36:12.280
 it was like the largest

4:36:12.280 --> 4:36:15.560
 because it was like randomly generated.

4:36:15.560 --> 4:36:17.200
 It would like randomly generate the worlds,

4:36:17.200 --> 4:36:18.720
 the dungeons and so on,

4:36:18.720 --> 4:36:20.520
 which is fascinating to think about like,

4:36:20.520 --> 4:36:22.240
 how big can you make the world?

4:36:23.440 --> 4:36:26.840
 Both in actuality and feel.

4:36:26.840 --> 4:36:29.440
 Like it's incredible to have a video game.

4:36:29.440 --> 4:36:32.200
 I don't know how many video games do this well,

4:36:32.200 --> 4:36:35.920
 where the feeling is you can be lost here forever.

4:36:35.920 --> 4:36:38.520
 You can live here.

4:36:38.520 --> 4:36:40.840
 Cause most video games have like a bottom.

4:36:40.840 --> 4:36:42.600
 It feels like you can run out of stuff.

4:36:42.600 --> 4:36:45.800
 Where Daggerfall was like, I can just keep doing this.

4:36:45.800 --> 4:36:47.200
 At least that's what I felt at the time.

4:36:47.200 --> 4:36:50.240
 But yeah, why, what the heck Legends of Valor?

4:36:50.240 --> 4:36:51.800
 What's the idea there?

4:36:51.800 --> 4:36:54.720
 Well, I mean, there's really nothing about it

4:36:54.720 --> 4:36:56.240
 that's super compelling today.

4:36:56.240 --> 4:36:59.360
 I mean, there's a nostalgia of youth that's there,

4:36:59.360 --> 4:37:00.880
 but I mean, it doesn't even have a class system,

4:37:00.880 --> 4:37:03.520
 the level system, the combat system is terrible.

4:37:03.520 --> 4:37:05.640
 There's no journal, the magic system is terrible

4:37:05.640 --> 4:37:06.480
 and so forth.

4:37:06.480 --> 4:37:08.160
 And so I just wanted to start somewhere.

4:37:08.160 --> 4:37:09.240
 And I felt like that would be

4:37:09.240 --> 4:37:11.120
 an incredibly fun overhaul project.

4:37:11.120 --> 4:37:13.160
 I kind of got the idea from Beam Dog Studios

4:37:13.160 --> 4:37:15.200
 when they did another one of my favorite games.

4:37:15.200 --> 4:37:16.960
 Remember Baldur's Gate?

4:37:16.960 --> 4:37:17.800
 Yeah, they did the...

4:37:17.800 --> 4:37:18.760
 I love that Baldur's Gate too.

4:37:18.760 --> 4:37:21.000
 Oh yeah, the enhanced edition was great.

4:37:21.000 --> 4:37:22.880
 They should have never just done thrown a ball.

4:37:22.880 --> 4:37:24.880
 They should have done an actual proper sequel.

4:37:24.880 --> 4:37:27.520
 And I got down that whole road.

4:37:27.520 --> 4:37:29.920
 But anyway, I got the idea there.

4:37:29.920 --> 4:37:32.480
 I said, well, take some old piece of IP

4:37:32.480 --> 4:37:34.920
 and then you can kind of retrofit it and clean it up.

4:37:34.920 --> 4:37:37.400
 And what's nice about Legends of Valor is it's a blank slate.

4:37:37.400 --> 4:37:39.280
 You can do your own elder scrolls.

4:37:39.280 --> 4:37:41.480
 You can create your own class system and level system

4:37:41.480 --> 4:37:42.560
 and so forth.

4:37:42.560 --> 4:37:44.360
 You could write some beautiful, exciting,

4:37:44.360 --> 4:37:46.240
 fun narratives for that.

4:37:46.240 --> 4:37:49.000
 And also it gives me a chance to explore a lot of things

4:37:49.000 --> 4:37:50.880
 that I think should be dragged into game development.

4:37:50.880 --> 4:37:53.720
 Like algorithmically generated music is one example.

4:37:53.720 --> 4:37:55.920
 The problem with sound games, as you mentioned,

4:37:55.920 --> 4:37:57.960
 you play lots and lots of hours,

4:37:57.960 --> 4:38:00.080
 but your sound content is much smaller.

4:38:00.080 --> 4:38:02.640
 So you have tons of repetition in the soundtrack.

4:38:02.640 --> 4:38:05.080
 So what if you could connect the music

4:38:05.080 --> 4:38:06.720
 to the state of the game world

4:38:06.720 --> 4:38:08.720
 and automatically through some process

4:38:08.720 --> 4:38:09.560
 will generate music.

4:38:09.560 --> 4:38:11.800
 And there's actually people who study this.

4:38:11.800 --> 4:38:12.960
 And so that's one dimension.

4:38:12.960 --> 4:38:15.160
 The other thing is you have things like GPT3 and so forth.

4:38:15.160 --> 4:38:18.240
 There was a great game, Event Zero.

4:38:18.240 --> 4:38:20.160
 And it came out in like 2016

4:38:20.160 --> 4:38:23.960
 where you could actually have a dialogue with an AI

4:38:23.960 --> 4:38:25.680
 and you're like a marooned astronaut

4:38:25.680 --> 4:38:28.000
 and a space station that's abandoned.

4:38:28.000 --> 4:38:30.560
 And you have to somehow work with this AI

4:38:30.560 --> 4:38:32.000
 through communicating with it

4:38:32.000 --> 4:38:34.720
 to convince you to take you home.

4:38:34.720 --> 4:38:37.000
 But the AI is a bit duplicitous

4:38:37.000 --> 4:38:38.800
 and I don't want to spoil a plot of the game

4:38:38.800 --> 4:38:40.000
 because it's such a cool game,

4:38:40.000 --> 4:38:41.840
 but it's actually like a paint by never say.

4:38:41.840 --> 4:38:43.000
 It's almost like Zork

4:38:43.000 --> 4:38:46.520
 where you don't have preselected dialogue.

4:38:46.520 --> 4:38:48.280
 You actually type in the terminal

4:38:48.280 --> 4:38:50.400
 and the AI will reply to you back and forth.

4:38:50.400 --> 4:38:52.520
 And this was 2016 and it's like things have gotten

4:38:52.520 --> 4:38:54.120
 in order magnitude better.

4:38:54.120 --> 4:38:55.680
 So with the evolution of that tech,

4:38:55.680 --> 4:38:57.280
 I think within the next five years

4:38:57.280 --> 4:38:58.240
 brought into video games,

4:38:58.240 --> 4:39:00.920
 could you give you incredibly cool dialogue

4:39:00.920 --> 4:39:02.880
 inside the game?

4:39:02.880 --> 4:39:04.520
 So algorithmically generated music,

4:39:04.520 --> 4:39:06.520
 better dialogue, better gameplay mechanics.

4:39:06.520 --> 4:39:10.680
 Also, I'd love to explore alternative physics systems,

4:39:10.680 --> 4:39:11.920
 alternative geometries,

4:39:11.920 --> 4:39:15.600
 like hyperbolic geometry or these types of things.

4:39:15.600 --> 4:39:19.040
 And there's actually Hyperbolic is a game that does that.

4:39:19.040 --> 4:39:21.440
 And you can do down the Euclidean geometry as well

4:39:21.440 --> 4:39:23.600
 and bring those elements into a game design.

4:39:23.600 --> 4:39:25.160
 And that's what we'll do as legends of valor.

4:39:25.160 --> 4:39:26.600
 So it'll be kind of like Skyrim,

4:39:26.600 --> 4:39:28.560
 but with a lot of really cool new shit.

4:39:28.560 --> 4:39:30.920
 It's kind of like, I saw Aerosmith years ago

4:39:30.920 --> 4:39:31.760
 and he was out there, he's like,

4:39:31.760 --> 4:39:32.760
 do you like the old shit?

4:39:32.760 --> 4:39:34.240
 Do you like new shit?

4:39:34.240 --> 4:39:35.240
 Kind of middle shit.

4:39:36.240 --> 4:39:38.040
 So you're going for the middle.

4:39:38.040 --> 4:39:39.880
 Yeah, I'm gonna try to do some of the old

4:39:39.880 --> 4:39:41.680
 and some of the new and bring it in.

4:39:41.680 --> 4:39:43.480
 So that'll be a lot of fun.

4:39:43.480 --> 4:39:48.480
 And what's nice about it is that there is a lot of new

4:39:50.920 --> 4:39:51.800
 play in the market

4:39:51.800 --> 4:39:54.440
 because of the Microsoft acquisition of Bethesda.

4:39:54.440 --> 4:39:56.480
 They've been losing employees like crazy.

4:39:56.480 --> 4:39:58.400
 And there's a lot of belief that Elder Scrolls 6

4:39:58.400 --> 4:40:00.240
 will not live up to expectations

4:40:00.240 --> 4:40:01.280
 because Microsoft will kill it.

4:40:01.280 --> 4:40:02.520
 I will tweet it.

4:40:02.520 --> 4:40:03.760
 Okay, listen to me.

4:40:03.760 --> 4:40:07.880
 I will go into, I'm all about love on the internet,

4:40:07.880 --> 4:40:09.800
 but I will go hard at you Microsoft

4:40:09.800 --> 4:40:11.360
 if you screw up Elder Scrolls.

4:40:11.360 --> 4:40:14.120
 Well, we might have to do a spiritual successor, right?

4:40:14.120 --> 4:40:16.120
 And it might have to happen with legends of valor.

4:40:16.120 --> 4:40:17.440
 You never know.

4:40:17.440 --> 4:40:18.560
 But it's a passion project.

4:40:18.560 --> 4:40:20.320
 So I have no time for it at all.

4:40:20.320 --> 4:40:22.040
 It's like so low on my list of things to do.

4:40:22.040 --> 4:40:24.600
 So I'll probably do it in 2022, 2023,

4:40:24.600 --> 4:40:27.400
 and we'll build a nice crew and we'll do it in Wyoming,

4:40:27.400 --> 4:40:29.480
 probably in Wheatland or some really small town

4:40:29.480 --> 4:40:31.240
 and we'll import everybody.

4:40:31.240 --> 4:40:32.920
 And then we'll have to build the whole city up

4:40:32.920 --> 4:40:34.760
 like Elon is doing here in Texas.

4:40:34.760 --> 4:40:36.680
 It'll be a fun project.

4:40:36.680 --> 4:40:38.520
 Well, I like programmatically generated music.

4:40:38.520 --> 4:40:40.400
 You mentioned Baldur's Gate.

4:40:40.400 --> 4:40:41.880
 By the way, Haskell frameworks for that.

4:40:41.880 --> 4:40:42.960
 Uturpe is one.

4:40:42.960 --> 4:40:43.960
 For generating music?

4:40:43.960 --> 4:40:45.440
 Yeah, for doing it.

4:40:45.440 --> 4:40:46.680
 I wonder how successful that could be

4:40:46.680 --> 4:40:49.080
 because I remember Baldur's Gate was the first game

4:40:49.080 --> 4:40:52.160
 where I realized music is so important to the game.

4:40:52.160 --> 4:40:54.120
 It was the thing I remembered about the game.

4:40:54.120 --> 4:40:57.440
 It was the reason that it was the thing I thought about

4:40:57.440 --> 4:40:59.440
 when I was away from the game

4:40:59.440 --> 4:41:02.720
 is like that, the feeling it created that music.

4:41:02.720 --> 4:41:04.560
 I don't even remember the music anymore,

4:41:04.560 --> 4:41:05.880
 but I remember the music.

4:41:08.120 --> 4:41:10.720
 Jeremy Soul, I think was the composer.

4:41:10.720 --> 4:41:12.000
 And it was great.

4:41:12.000 --> 4:41:13.920
 And actually getting like Rahman Juati

4:41:13.920 --> 4:41:16.520
 or Bear McCready to do that would be so cool.

4:41:16.520 --> 4:41:19.600
 Okay, this is awesome.

4:41:19.600 --> 4:41:20.480
 Ridiculous question.

4:41:20.480 --> 4:41:23.200
 What's the maybe let's say top three

4:41:23.200 --> 4:41:25.080
 great video games of all time?

4:41:26.680 --> 4:41:28.360
 Yeah, Baldur's Gate is definitely in the top three.

4:41:28.360 --> 4:41:30.280
 Arkane M is my favorite game.

4:41:30.280 --> 4:41:34.440
 And Arkane M was, Troika Games was just this amazing studio

4:41:34.440 --> 4:41:37.920
 where they took the time to build

4:41:37.920 --> 4:41:40.480
 probably the most compelling game worlds.

4:41:40.480 --> 4:41:42.160
 In the case of Arkane M, it takes place

4:41:42.160 --> 4:41:44.960
 in kind of like a 19th century Victorian England play.

4:41:44.960 --> 4:41:46.320
 So Steampunk.

4:41:46.320 --> 4:41:48.640
 But then there's also magic inside this game world.

4:41:48.640 --> 4:41:50.680
 And there's this crazy juxtaposition

4:41:50.680 --> 4:41:52.040
 between magic and technology.

4:41:52.040 --> 4:41:54.720
 And the more technology you have, magic stops working.

4:41:54.720 --> 4:41:57.160
 The more magic you have, it disrupts technology.

4:41:57.160 --> 4:41:58.600
 So all the people on the magic side

4:41:58.600 --> 4:42:00.840
 hate the technology people and vice versa.

4:42:00.840 --> 4:42:03.320
 And so you're just this character in this game world

4:42:03.320 --> 4:42:06.120
 and you're just trying to figure out like where do you fit?

4:42:06.120 --> 4:42:08.760
 And it has this incredible plot

4:42:08.760 --> 4:42:11.680
 where you're kind of just a stowaway on a zeppelin

4:42:11.680 --> 4:42:15.600
 that gets shot down and you get dragged into this conspiracy

4:42:15.600 --> 4:42:17.640
 and you have to kind of figure out the conspiracy

4:42:17.640 --> 4:42:18.920
 as you go through the whole game world

4:42:18.920 --> 4:42:20.200
 and you meet all these different races

4:42:20.200 --> 4:42:22.000
 like the elves and the dwarves and so forth.

4:42:22.000 --> 4:42:23.560
 And they've all been impacted

4:42:23.560 --> 4:42:25.640
 by the proliferation of technology in different ways.

4:42:25.640 --> 4:42:28.520
 Like the humans, you steam engines to clear cut

4:42:28.520 --> 4:42:30.760
 all the forest and it caused a lot of problems.

4:42:30.760 --> 4:42:33.480
 The dwarves leaked that technology to the humans.

4:42:33.480 --> 4:42:36.080
 And so they kind of got exiled for it and so forth.

4:42:36.080 --> 4:42:38.120
 And you have to decide like where do you fit all this?

4:42:38.120 --> 4:42:40.000
 And you have a lot of choices as a player.

4:42:40.000 --> 4:42:41.320
 You can be on the magic side,

4:42:41.320 --> 4:42:43.680
 the technology side kind of be neutral.

4:42:43.680 --> 4:42:46.160
 And there's like 40 different endings for the game.

4:42:46.160 --> 4:42:47.400
 It's just incredible.

4:42:47.400 --> 4:42:48.840
 And this is all like 2000.

4:42:48.840 --> 4:42:51.200
 And you talk about a procedurally generated world,

4:42:51.200 --> 4:42:53.080
 you have a quick travel, but if you want,

4:42:53.080 --> 4:42:55.040
 you just walk and the world randomly generates.

4:42:55.040 --> 4:42:56.120
 But it's not like Daggerfall

4:42:56.120 --> 4:42:58.040
 where there was interesting things along the way.

4:42:58.040 --> 4:42:59.840
 So it was really ahead of its time

4:42:59.840 --> 4:43:03.360
 and it was kind of the last of a generation of games.

4:43:03.360 --> 4:43:05.400
 It was based on the same framework

4:43:05.400 --> 4:43:07.320
 that Interplay used for Fallout,

4:43:07.320 --> 4:43:09.440
 the original Fallout and Fallout 2.

4:43:09.440 --> 4:43:11.120
 So that was really a cool setup.

4:43:11.120 --> 4:43:12.280
 So how were the graphics?

4:43:12.280 --> 4:43:13.120
 They were not essential to the game?

4:43:13.120 --> 4:43:15.680
 Oh, it's isometric top down.

4:43:15.680 --> 4:43:17.960
 So yeah, kind of like the Fallout look.

4:43:17.960 --> 4:43:21.560
 And so it doesn't hold up super well today,

4:43:21.560 --> 4:43:22.920
 but that was never the point.

4:43:22.920 --> 4:43:24.960
 It was a more of a story driven game.

4:43:24.960 --> 4:43:26.760
 But it was in one of the very few games

4:43:26.760 --> 4:43:27.840
 where at the very end of the game,

4:43:27.840 --> 4:43:29.880
 you could actually talk the villain

4:43:29.880 --> 4:43:33.520
 into killing himself instead of fighting you.

4:43:33.520 --> 4:43:35.560
 If you, and you had to really work at it,

4:43:35.560 --> 4:43:37.400
 you had to become a master of persuasion

4:43:37.400 --> 4:43:39.360
 and get your charisma score maxed out

4:43:39.360 --> 4:43:40.960
 and learn all this stuff along the way.

4:43:40.960 --> 4:43:42.520
 And you have this philosophical debate

4:43:42.520 --> 4:43:44.120
 over the nature of life and death with him.

4:43:44.120 --> 4:43:44.960
 That's amazing.

4:43:44.960 --> 4:43:45.920
 Yeah, and then you're just like,

4:43:45.920 --> 4:43:47.520
 by the way, you're wrong and here's why.

4:43:47.520 --> 4:43:48.760
 And he's like, oh yeah, you got a point.

4:43:48.760 --> 4:43:50.000
 I'm just gonna kill myself.

4:43:50.000 --> 4:43:52.960
 And I was like, wow, this is great.

4:43:52.960 --> 4:43:54.920
 Planescape Torment is the other one,

4:43:54.920 --> 4:43:56.200
 I think is probably the greatest.

4:43:56.200 --> 4:43:57.240
 Was it called Planescape?

4:43:57.240 --> 4:43:59.440
 Yeah, it's another one on the Infinity engine,

4:43:59.440 --> 4:44:01.320
 which was what was used for Baldur's Gate.

4:44:01.320 --> 4:44:02.680
 So it looks like Baldur's Gate.

4:44:02.680 --> 4:44:05.960
 And God, that was such an incredibly well written game.

4:44:05.960 --> 4:44:07.720
 You play this character called the Nameless One.

4:44:07.720 --> 4:44:10.080
 It's this little blue guy and you wake up in a morgue.

4:44:10.080 --> 4:44:11.920
 And it turns out that you're immortal.

4:44:11.920 --> 4:44:14.240
 And every time you die, you lose all your memories.

4:44:14.240 --> 4:44:17.440
 And so you've just been apparently living this life

4:44:17.440 --> 4:44:18.680
 for a very long time.

4:44:18.680 --> 4:44:20.040
 And you meet all these people

4:44:20.040 --> 4:44:22.400
 in this crazy city called Sigil who know you,

4:44:22.400 --> 4:44:23.720
 but you don't know yourself.

4:44:23.720 --> 4:44:25.160
 And you're trying to figure out your name,

4:44:25.160 --> 4:44:27.520
 your identity and why do you have this curse

4:44:27.520 --> 4:44:28.800
 where you live forever,

4:44:28.800 --> 4:44:31.200
 but you keep forgetting every time you get killed.

4:44:31.200 --> 4:44:33.680
 And it turns out you weren't such a nice person

4:44:33.680 --> 4:44:35.160
 throughout this entire game world.

4:44:35.160 --> 4:44:36.640
 But then again, it's this question of,

4:44:36.640 --> 4:44:40.400
 well, if you can start over and you lose all your memories,

4:44:40.400 --> 4:44:42.720
 do you have a chance for redemption or not?

4:44:42.720 --> 4:44:45.120
 So it's incredible game, Plainscape Torment.

4:44:45.120 --> 4:44:46.560
 And it's actually another one of those games

4:44:46.560 --> 4:44:49.000
 where you can never actually have a fight.

4:44:49.000 --> 4:44:50.880
 You can just kind of talk your way out of everything.

4:44:50.880 --> 4:44:53.680
 And there's probably like 1,000 pages of dialogue

4:44:53.680 --> 4:44:54.520
 inside the game.

4:44:54.520 --> 4:44:56.440
 Those guys had a lot of fun and a lot of drugs

4:44:56.440 --> 4:44:57.840
 making that game.

4:44:57.840 --> 4:45:00.480
 Do you think these three games are the kinds

4:45:00.480 --> 4:45:02.400
 that would still be okay to play today

4:45:02.400 --> 4:45:03.920
 or are they forever lost in time?

4:45:03.920 --> 4:45:08.400
 Because we sort of got desensitized

4:45:08.400 --> 4:45:10.520
 to the richness of computer graphics

4:45:10.520 --> 4:45:12.360
 and all those kinds of things in modern games.

4:45:12.360 --> 4:45:14.000
 I think you can enhance these games

4:45:14.000 --> 4:45:17.440
 because your storytelling medium is so much more engaging.

4:45:17.440 --> 4:45:19.440
 You know, I was at the movie theater before COVID

4:45:19.440 --> 4:45:21.160
 and the person to the left of me

4:45:21.160 --> 4:45:23.040
 was looking at their cell phone during the movie

4:45:23.040 --> 4:45:24.000
 and the person to the right of me

4:45:24.000 --> 4:45:25.080
 was looking at their cell phone.

4:45:25.080 --> 4:45:26.320
 They're just not engaged anymore.

4:45:26.320 --> 4:45:28.560
 Everybody is attention starved.

4:45:28.560 --> 4:45:30.600
 And the video game is one of the last mediums

4:45:30.600 --> 4:45:33.160
 where you have undivided attention of people.

4:45:33.160 --> 4:45:34.640
 They're really into it.

4:45:34.640 --> 4:45:35.960
 They're all into that thing.

4:45:35.960 --> 4:45:39.080
 And so I think the fact that you have VR and AR

4:45:39.080 --> 4:45:42.480
 and enhanced graphics and all these new gameplay mechanics,

4:45:42.480 --> 4:45:44.920
 it's a value add instead of a value negative

4:45:44.920 --> 4:45:46.040
 because ultimately what are you doing?

4:45:46.040 --> 4:45:47.720
 You're telling stories

4:45:47.720 --> 4:45:49.760
 and you're trying to connect people to something.

4:45:49.760 --> 4:45:52.000
 Maybe it's the nature of life and death

4:45:52.000 --> 4:45:53.480
 or are we truly real?

4:45:53.480 --> 4:45:55.680
 Are we in a simulation or not or something like that?

4:45:55.680 --> 4:45:57.520
 It'd be great to do 13th floor as a game

4:45:57.520 --> 4:45:59.320
 or something like that.

4:45:59.320 --> 4:46:02.120
 And the question is, well, how good of a story can you tell?

4:46:02.120 --> 4:46:04.080
 Well, you're constrained by your storytelling tools

4:46:04.080 --> 4:46:06.360
 and technology. The fact that games

4:46:06.360 --> 4:46:09.040
 are so much more advanced now means that you now have

4:46:09.040 --> 4:46:12.200
 many more dimensions of storytelling available to you.

4:46:12.200 --> 4:46:14.240
 And actually with AI now coming in

4:46:14.240 --> 4:46:17.520
 and really good AI coming in the next five or 10 years,

4:46:17.520 --> 4:46:20.080
 your storytelling is not static anymore.

4:46:20.080 --> 4:46:22.920
 The person can actually majorly participate

4:46:22.920 --> 4:46:24.400
 and change the outcome in ways

4:46:24.400 --> 4:46:26.320
 that were previously unpredictable.

4:46:26.320 --> 4:46:27.760
 The other thing is they're still educational.

4:46:27.760 --> 4:46:30.600
 You can teach people concepts that they never knew before.

4:46:30.600 --> 4:46:32.240
 And it's like, if you want to teach people

4:46:32.240 --> 4:46:36.800
 about bizarre geometries or like Minecraft is a great example.

4:46:36.800 --> 4:46:40.200
 A lot of people learned how computers work from Redstone.

4:46:40.200 --> 4:46:42.680
 Think about that. It's true.

4:46:42.680 --> 4:46:43.960
 Yeah. Yeah.

4:46:43.960 --> 4:46:45.920
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, as we said,

4:46:45.920 --> 4:46:47.520
 we're more and more going to be living

4:46:47.520 --> 4:46:50.320
 in the video game worlds might as well,

4:46:50.320 --> 4:46:52.960
 sort of as opposed to just make it fun,

4:46:52.960 --> 4:46:57.320
 also expand our knowledge, expand our ability to think,

4:46:57.320 --> 4:47:00.440
 like explore different ideas

4:47:00.440 --> 4:47:02.320
 and do education broadly defined

4:47:02.320 --> 4:47:03.720
 within those video game worlds.

4:47:03.720 --> 4:47:05.080
 So we can do the entirety,

4:47:05.080 --> 4:47:08.200
 the entirety of life in the video game worlds.

4:47:08.200 --> 4:47:11.240
 Hopefully it doesn't look like Minecraft, but we'll see.

4:47:11.240 --> 4:47:13.640
 Do you have advice for young people today,

4:47:13.640 --> 4:47:16.400
 aside from playing lots of video games?

4:47:16.400 --> 4:47:19.080
 You know, high schoolers, college students,

4:47:19.080 --> 4:47:22.080
 thinking about their career, thinking about life.

4:47:23.320 --> 4:47:24.720
 Well, we no longer live in a world

4:47:24.720 --> 4:47:25.840
 where you get one skill set.

4:47:25.840 --> 4:47:28.320
 You do it for 40 years and retire.

4:47:28.320 --> 4:47:30.440
 I mean, that ship has sailed a long time ago.

4:47:30.440 --> 4:47:33.360
 So learn how to learn and learn an appreciation

4:47:33.360 --> 4:47:34.680
 and love for learning.

4:47:34.680 --> 4:47:36.160
 So that's the first thing, you know,

4:47:36.160 --> 4:47:37.840
 Josh Waitzkin's wrote this beautiful book,

4:47:37.840 --> 4:47:39.960
 The Art of Learning, if you ever read it,

4:47:39.960 --> 4:47:41.520
 stuff like that.

4:47:41.520 --> 4:47:43.240
 So good study skills, you know,

4:47:43.240 --> 4:47:44.800
 slip box notes, these things,

4:47:44.800 --> 4:47:48.120
 what was it, Zettel Kasten or whatever it was.

4:47:48.120 --> 4:47:49.520
 Yeah, there's lots of little techniques

4:47:49.520 --> 4:47:50.960
 that you can pick up along the way.

4:47:50.960 --> 4:47:52.640
 And basically the teacher had to process

4:47:52.640 --> 4:47:55.280
 lots of information very quickly, retain it,

4:47:55.280 --> 4:47:58.360
 and then decide what's useful to you for that moment.

4:47:58.360 --> 4:48:00.600
 The second thing is do not undervalue EQ,

4:48:00.600 --> 4:48:01.800
 emotional intelligence.

4:48:01.800 --> 4:48:03.920
 We've lived for a long time in a society

4:48:03.920 --> 4:48:06.040
 where IQ is dominant.

4:48:06.040 --> 4:48:08.960
 It's like how smart you are excuses everything else.

4:48:08.960 --> 4:48:10.680
 You could be a horrible human being,

4:48:10.680 --> 4:48:12.640
 but he's a really bright guy, right?

4:48:12.640 --> 4:48:15.360
 The asshole mathematician or physicist.

4:48:15.360 --> 4:48:17.200
 We now live in a world where the balance

4:48:17.200 --> 4:48:18.600
 is far more important.

4:48:18.600 --> 4:48:21.640
 You have to be smart, but you also have to be a nice guy

4:48:21.640 --> 4:48:23.000
 and don't undervalue that.

4:48:23.000 --> 4:48:25.080
 So learn things like closed circuit communication

4:48:25.080 --> 4:48:26.480
 and active listening.

4:48:26.480 --> 4:48:30.000
 These skill sets will always pay enormous dividends

4:48:30.000 --> 4:48:31.440
 along the way.

4:48:31.440 --> 4:48:32.840
 Third, remember that you're judged

4:48:32.840 --> 4:48:33.800
 for the things that you have

4:48:33.800 --> 4:48:35.280
 and what you do with those things.

4:48:35.280 --> 4:48:36.720
 You know, if you have very little,

4:48:36.720 --> 4:48:37.840
 you still have to do something,

4:48:37.840 --> 4:48:39.680
 but you have a lot, you have to do even more.

4:48:39.680 --> 4:48:43.240
 So learn how to give and do that early on.

4:48:43.240 --> 4:48:46.000
 Learn how to give back, volunteerism, charity,

4:48:46.000 --> 4:48:48.160
 mentoring, these types of things.

4:48:48.160 --> 4:48:51.320
 Those are so incredibly valuable to a person's develop.

4:48:51.320 --> 4:48:53.400
 The people that you mentored in the academic world,

4:48:53.400 --> 4:48:55.360
 you learn this, you have graduate students.

4:48:55.360 --> 4:48:58.200
 They one day will be professors

4:48:58.200 --> 4:49:00.720
 and it might just so happen, they might eclipse you.

4:49:00.720 --> 4:49:03.000
 Remember, Gauss had a doctoral advisor.

4:49:04.200 --> 4:49:08.120
 Never forget that, you know, and so did Feynman.

4:49:08.120 --> 4:49:10.440
 Make sure that you mentor people, you give back

4:49:10.440 --> 4:49:11.400
 and you learn how to learn

4:49:11.400 --> 4:49:12.680
 and you learn how to teach.

4:49:12.680 --> 4:49:15.120
 Super important for your development as a person.

4:49:15.120 --> 4:49:16.960
 Now you'll notice all those things are agnostic

4:49:16.960 --> 4:49:19.080
 to whatever domain you happen to have chosen.

4:49:19.080 --> 4:49:21.200
 You could be in medicine or law or technology,

4:49:21.200 --> 4:49:22.760
 whatever that you're fancy,

4:49:22.760 --> 4:49:24.720
 whatever your passion happens to be.

4:49:24.720 --> 4:49:27.800
 And don't conflate your earning in your career.

4:49:27.800 --> 4:49:30.760
 If people try to keep putting these things together,

4:49:30.760 --> 4:49:32.760
 they're increasingly becoming decoupled.

4:49:32.760 --> 4:49:34.800
 There's a lot of cases where people do their passions

4:49:34.800 --> 4:49:37.760
 and they do it for free or, you know, for sustenance,

4:49:37.760 --> 4:49:39.560
 but then they have something else they do on the side

4:49:39.560 --> 4:49:41.800
 to also augment or supplement their income.

4:49:41.800 --> 4:49:43.520
 Probably best that way.

4:49:43.520 --> 4:49:44.800
 When you conflate the two,

4:49:44.800 --> 4:49:46.600
 you tend to get burned out terribly.

4:49:46.600 --> 4:49:49.080
 You see this a lot with musicians or other people,

4:49:49.080 --> 4:49:50.480
 they just, they wanna make music,

4:49:50.480 --> 4:49:51.800
 but they have to tour or whatever

4:49:51.800 --> 4:49:54.920
 because they gotta pay bills, stuff like that happens.

4:49:54.920 --> 4:49:57.280
 Other than that, I mean, I'm not a guru.

4:49:57.280 --> 4:49:59.200
 I'm not in any particular position.

4:49:59.200 --> 4:50:01.760
 You showed up in a robe, which I thought was kind of weird.

4:50:01.760 --> 4:50:05.000
 And you had a crown and you kept calling yourself king.

4:50:05.000 --> 4:50:06.440
 King of the rats.

4:50:06.440 --> 4:50:08.360
 And that was in a robe that was a Yukata.

4:50:08.360 --> 4:50:10.040
 Okay, thank you for clarifying.

4:50:10.040 --> 4:50:11.600
 The audience, he's joking.

4:50:12.600 --> 4:50:13.440
 Reddit.

4:50:15.000 --> 4:50:17.560
 I heard somebody's gonna write blog posts.

4:50:17.560 --> 4:50:20.960
 Charles Hoskinson walks around with a crown.

4:50:20.960 --> 4:50:23.440
 Let me ask you a ridiculously big

4:50:23.440 --> 4:50:24.880
 and the most important question.

4:50:24.880 --> 4:50:28.160
 What's the meaning of this whole thing of life?

4:50:28.160 --> 4:50:29.360
 Well, I got a story for that.

4:50:29.360 --> 4:50:33.880
 Does this have something to do with the farm?

4:50:33.880 --> 4:50:35.400
 Well, no, no, no, it's from Japan.

4:50:35.400 --> 4:50:36.240
 I used to live in Japan.

4:50:36.240 --> 4:50:39.680
 I live in Osaka, right next to Namba, a beautiful area.

4:50:39.680 --> 4:50:41.320
 It's like, if you're gonna live anywhere in Japan,

4:50:41.320 --> 4:50:43.240
 live in Osaka and you live anywhere in Osaka,

4:50:43.240 --> 4:50:44.880
 live next to the restaurant district.

4:50:44.880 --> 4:50:47.200
 Four o clock in the morning and get good ramen.

4:50:47.200 --> 4:50:50.600
 These are the things in life that make you who you are.

4:50:50.600 --> 4:50:54.360
 So there was a shogun and he was kind of a bad ass.

4:50:54.360 --> 4:50:55.920
 He was really good at killing people,

4:50:55.920 --> 4:50:57.320
 really good at running his empire.

4:50:57.320 --> 4:50:59.960
 And then he got a bit disgruntled in his late 40s.

4:50:59.960 --> 4:51:03.040
 And he said, you know, I'm just gonna give it all to my son

4:51:03.040 --> 4:51:04.840
 and I'm gonna wander around Japan

4:51:04.840 --> 4:51:07.200
 until I find the perfect cherry blossom.

4:51:07.200 --> 4:51:08.480
 That's what I'm gonna do.

4:51:08.480 --> 4:51:09.760
 Everybody thought he went crazy.

4:51:09.760 --> 4:51:11.120
 He said, no, no, no, that's what I'm gonna do.

4:51:11.120 --> 4:51:12.600
 And he took his whole entourage with him

4:51:12.600 --> 4:51:14.720
 and so his son is now the shogun.

4:51:14.720 --> 4:51:16.680
 And then he's just wandering throughout Japan

4:51:16.680 --> 4:51:19.000
 and having all these incredible crazy adventures

4:51:19.000 --> 4:51:20.320
 as he's wandering throughout Japan.

4:51:20.320 --> 4:51:21.720
 He got a fighting bandits

4:51:21.720 --> 4:51:24.240
 and loving beautiful women and so forth.

4:51:24.240 --> 4:51:26.880
 And then 30 years later,

4:51:26.880 --> 4:51:28.880
 he's passing these two geisha gals

4:51:28.880 --> 4:51:31.040
 and one of them turns around

4:51:31.040 --> 4:51:33.920
 and they notice them slumped over next to a cherry tree.

4:51:33.920 --> 4:51:37.760
 And so she goes over to try to rouse them and he's dead.

4:51:37.760 --> 4:51:40.440
 And in his hands is a wilted cherry blossom.

4:51:41.800 --> 4:51:43.880
 So that's a very Japanese story, right?

4:51:43.880 --> 4:51:47.440
 The point is that it's not the actual blossom

4:51:47.440 --> 4:51:49.360
 finding the perfection that matters.

4:51:49.360 --> 4:51:52.000
 It's the things you do on a day to day basis.

4:51:52.000 --> 4:51:53.560
 The places you go, the people you meet,

4:51:53.560 --> 4:51:54.680
 the experiences you have

4:51:54.680 --> 4:51:55.720
 and the joy you take

4:51:55.720 --> 4:51:58.480
 and the things that you do here in the moment now.

4:51:58.480 --> 4:51:59.880
 You have to get there.

4:51:59.880 --> 4:52:02.040
 You know, if you look at Jiro Dreams of Sushi,

4:52:02.040 --> 4:52:03.880
 there's this guy 70 years of his life

4:52:03.880 --> 4:52:06.080
 making the same damn piece of sushi again

4:52:06.080 --> 4:52:06.920
 and again and again.

4:52:06.920 --> 4:52:08.600
 He's the happiest guy around.

4:52:08.600 --> 4:52:11.160
 Albert Camus and his story of Sisyphus.

4:52:11.160 --> 4:52:12.760
 You know, Sisyphus should be miserable.

4:52:12.760 --> 4:52:13.680
 It's the Greek curse.

4:52:13.680 --> 4:52:15.040
 No, he's happy.

4:52:15.040 --> 4:52:17.120
 He has total clarity of purpose.

4:52:17.120 --> 4:52:19.800
 And every day he gets to basically rule that stone

4:52:19.800 --> 4:52:21.680
 just a little bit better than the day before,

4:52:21.680 --> 4:52:23.680
 a different way than the day before.

4:52:23.680 --> 4:52:25.600
 And it's not the destination.

4:52:25.600 --> 4:52:26.920
 It isn't getting the stone up

4:52:26.920 --> 4:52:28.720
 at the top of the hill that matters.

4:52:28.720 --> 4:52:30.360
 It's the fact that the act,

4:52:30.360 --> 4:52:31.760
 you find that joy in that act,

4:52:31.760 --> 4:52:35.160
 that ikigai, that way of life, that purpose of life.

4:52:35.160 --> 4:52:38.080
 That I think is the closest thing a human can get

4:52:38.080 --> 4:52:38.960
 to a meaning.

4:52:39.960 --> 4:52:40.920
 You're a blip.

4:52:40.920 --> 4:52:44.880
 You know, you didn't exist, you're dead.

4:52:44.880 --> 4:52:47.840
 And if you compare it to the size of the universe

4:52:47.840 --> 4:52:49.720
 in that time, it's just a little blip.

4:52:49.720 --> 4:52:51.880
 So all you can do with what you have

4:52:51.880 --> 4:52:53.280
 is just find meaning in the things

4:52:53.280 --> 4:52:54.640
 that you do on a daily basis.

4:52:54.640 --> 4:52:56.480
 And you can't predict the macro.

4:52:56.480 --> 4:52:58.400
 We have all this wealth and power in America.

4:52:58.400 --> 4:53:00.000
 What if a world war breaks out?

4:53:00.000 --> 4:53:02.760
 We could be destitute like war mark Germany.

4:53:02.760 --> 4:53:04.760
 And so, you know, you could be a big guy.

4:53:04.760 --> 4:53:07.160
 You could be now living on the street side.

4:53:07.160 --> 4:53:08.560
 Would you be miserable?

4:53:08.560 --> 4:53:10.280
 The point of life is getting to a point

4:53:10.280 --> 4:53:11.800
 that no matter what comes your way,

4:53:11.800 --> 4:53:13.760
 what misfortune comes your way,

4:53:13.760 --> 4:53:15.520
 you're in a position where you can find

4:53:15.520 --> 4:53:18.960
 a modicum of happiness and love and empathy

4:53:18.960 --> 4:53:21.520
 for others in that moment.

4:53:21.520 --> 4:53:23.240
 And then the highest pursuit of life

4:53:23.240 --> 4:53:25.960
 is the ability to share that mindset with other people

4:53:25.960 --> 4:53:27.800
 and give it to them somehow.

4:53:27.800 --> 4:53:29.600
 And that's really hard, you know,

4:53:29.600 --> 4:53:31.600
 because everybody comes in, they're always EOR,

4:53:31.600 --> 4:53:33.080
 oh, doom and gloom and cynical.

4:53:33.080 --> 4:53:35.640
 Yeah, and but this and that and reputation, this and that.

4:53:35.640 --> 4:53:37.360
 You have to somehow transcend all of it and say,

4:53:37.360 --> 4:53:38.880
 you know, that doesn't matter.

4:53:38.880 --> 4:53:40.240
 Look at the cherry blossoms.

4:53:40.240 --> 4:53:41.520
 Aren't they beautiful today?

4:53:41.520 --> 4:53:44.560
 All right, let's find a better one tomorrow.

4:53:44.560 --> 4:53:47.720
 See, you're also a fan of fishing, I've read somewhere.

4:53:47.720 --> 4:53:48.560
 Yeah.

4:53:48.560 --> 4:53:51.040
 And one of my favorite books is Old Man in the Sea,

4:53:52.360 --> 4:53:57.360
 where there's an old man sort of battling a big fish

4:53:58.400 --> 4:54:01.040
 and basically closing out the last chapter

4:54:01.040 --> 4:54:02.920
 of his life in this battle.

4:54:02.920 --> 4:54:06.160
 So I think another aspect of life with this boulder,

4:54:06.160 --> 4:54:08.000
 it feels like the boulder gets bigger and bigger

4:54:08.000 --> 4:54:11.000
 as we get closer to death.

4:54:11.000 --> 4:54:13.840
 And, you know, you find yourself married

4:54:13.840 --> 4:54:17.720
 to a particular struggle in life

4:54:17.720 --> 4:54:21.480
 that eventually just kind of overtakes the entirety

4:54:21.480 --> 4:54:23.720
 of meaning of your existence.

4:54:23.720 --> 4:54:26.320
 Do you think, I know what it is for me.

4:54:26.320 --> 4:54:28.600
 Do you have something like that?

4:54:28.600 --> 4:54:32.520
 The broader vision that unites your work with Cardano

4:54:32.520 --> 4:54:34.240
 and everything you've done in life,

4:54:34.240 --> 4:54:37.480
 the big fish that you're going to end up

4:54:37.480 --> 4:54:41.520
 in the dark of night struggling with in the last chapter

4:54:41.520 --> 4:54:44.040
 of your life, like the big problem you're taking on?

4:54:45.760 --> 4:54:48.080
 Well, in mathematics, it was the Goldbach conjecture.

4:54:48.080 --> 4:54:48.920
 I'd like to prove it.

4:54:48.920 --> 4:54:51.320
 That's probably not gonna happen.

4:54:51.320 --> 4:54:53.280
 That's a really big fish.

4:54:53.280 --> 4:54:54.960
 So do you still have a love for mathematics?

4:54:54.960 --> 4:54:57.080
 Oh God, yeah, of course I do.

4:54:57.080 --> 4:54:58.840
 You never lose that, you never lose it.

4:54:58.840 --> 4:55:00.920
 You lose the ability to do deep work

4:55:00.920 --> 4:55:02.400
 and you don't have the creativity

4:55:02.400 --> 4:55:04.120
 and the raw inspiration.

4:55:04.120 --> 4:55:06.080
 This is why I've gotten to automated theorem proving

4:55:06.080 --> 4:55:08.600
 because what I lack and because I'm getting older,

4:55:08.600 --> 4:55:10.920
 I can now have computers understand it and use AI

4:55:10.920 --> 4:55:11.840
 to just solve this stuff.

4:55:11.840 --> 4:55:13.960
 It's like the cheat codes for math.

4:55:13.960 --> 4:55:16.520
 Fuck those guys, we'll still do that.

4:55:16.520 --> 4:55:19.080
 But the mathematics still has those last passions

4:55:19.080 --> 4:55:20.800
 and there's all kinds of cool things

4:55:20.800 --> 4:55:22.280
 that I'd like to see done.

4:55:22.280 --> 4:55:24.880
 Like quota complexes allow you to unify topology

4:55:24.880 --> 4:55:26.600
 and never theory in really novel ways.

4:55:26.600 --> 4:55:28.840
 And they're all kinds of cool things, but who cares?

4:55:32.400 --> 4:55:34.400
 Everybody has those white whales.

4:55:34.400 --> 4:55:37.120
 Another thing I love to do is bring back to Willie Mammoth.

4:55:37.120 --> 4:55:39.240
 That's George Church's hidden pleasure

4:55:39.240 --> 4:55:41.200
 and five to 10 years, it's actually gonna happen.

4:55:41.200 --> 4:55:42.760
 And I had this beautiful ranch in Wyoming

4:55:42.760 --> 4:55:44.440
 and I got to find a way to convince George

4:55:44.440 --> 4:55:47.560
 to let me raise his clone mammoth fence on my ranch.

4:55:47.560 --> 4:55:48.400
 Among the bison.

4:55:48.400 --> 4:55:50.800
 Among the bison, they'd probably get along really well.

4:55:50.800 --> 4:55:52.440
 And then I have to learn all these cool things

4:55:52.440 --> 4:55:53.360
 about Willie Mammoth.

4:55:53.360 --> 4:55:55.440
 Like, do you shave them in the summertime

4:55:55.440 --> 4:55:56.880
 and let them get shaggy during the winter

4:55:56.880 --> 4:55:58.720
 or do you just let that coat go and then fall?

4:55:58.720 --> 4:56:01.360
 Who knows, it's an undiscovered country.

4:56:01.360 --> 4:56:05.000
 I just had the image of Charles Hoskinson alone

4:56:05.000 --> 4:56:09.560
 on a bison farm, trying to raise a Willie Mammoth.

4:56:09.560 --> 4:56:10.800
 Just start wearing a white suit

4:56:10.800 --> 4:56:13.040
 and say welcome to Hoskinson's ranch.

4:56:13.040 --> 4:56:14.640
 I'll have a cane with amber on it.

4:56:14.640 --> 4:56:17.120
 Yeah, with the chalkboard that you keep scrambling on,

4:56:17.120 --> 4:56:20.040
 like the beautiful mind in the movie

4:56:20.040 --> 4:56:20.960
 and you have voices that you can hear.

4:56:20.960 --> 4:56:22.480
 Oh, the schizophrenia has already come.

4:56:22.480 --> 4:56:25.440
 You guys are all figments of my imagination anyway.

4:56:25.440 --> 4:56:27.960
 Now, one of my goals though, I love catfish

4:56:27.960 --> 4:56:28.960
 and they live a long time.

4:56:28.960 --> 4:56:31.040
 They get really damn big if you see this guy.

4:56:31.040 --> 4:56:33.600
 I'd love to catch one now and be in my 60s

4:56:33.600 --> 4:56:36.600
 and catch the same fish twice and recognize it.

4:56:36.600 --> 4:56:38.240
 Maybe I'll lift a scar or something.

4:56:38.240 --> 4:56:39.200
 That'd be really cool.

4:56:39.200 --> 4:56:41.120
 Going back to the fish thing, you know?

4:56:41.120 --> 4:56:42.920
 Cause both the fish has gone through a lot.

4:56:42.920 --> 4:56:45.440
 I've gone through a lot and we can just be like old friends.

4:56:45.440 --> 4:56:47.440
 Exactly, exactly.

4:56:47.440 --> 4:56:50.240
 And then I'll die of a heart attack

4:56:50.240 --> 4:56:51.680
 and my mammoths will eat me.

4:56:51.680 --> 4:56:53.440
 That's something to look forward to.

4:56:53.440 --> 4:56:56.320
 Charles, this was one of the most amazing conversations

4:56:56.320 --> 4:56:57.160
 I've ever had.

4:56:57.160 --> 4:56:59.720
 It's truly an honor that you would spend

4:56:59.720 --> 4:57:02.640
 your valuable time with me and I'm glad you exist

4:57:02.640 --> 4:57:04.680
 in the cryptocurrency and the technology space

4:57:04.680 --> 4:57:06.840
 and I can see your love for mathematics

4:57:06.840 --> 4:57:08.480
 and your love for life just to radiate

4:57:08.480 --> 4:57:09.960
 through everything you do so.

4:57:09.960 --> 4:57:12.880
 Thank you for being you and thank you for talking to me today.

4:57:12.880 --> 4:57:13.720
 That's a lot of fun.

4:57:13.720 --> 4:57:15.640
 Thank you so much, Lex.

4:57:15.640 --> 4:57:17.080
 Thanks for listening to this conversation

4:57:17.080 --> 4:57:20.520
 with Charles Hoskinson and thank you to Gala Games,

4:57:20.520 --> 4:57:25.000
 All Form, Indeed, ExpressVPN and Eight Sleep.

4:57:25.000 --> 4:57:26.480
 Check them out in the description

4:57:26.480 --> 4:57:28.520

4:57:28.520 --> 4:57:30.800
 And now, let me leave you with some words

4:57:30.800 --> 4:57:32.720
 from William Faulkner.

4:57:32.720 --> 4:57:35.320
 You cannot swim for new horizons

4:57:35.320 --> 4:57:38.360
 until you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.

4:57:38.360 --> 4:57:58.360
 Thank you for listening and I hope to see you next time.
