00:00.000 --> 00:05.120
 The following is a conversation with Eric Weinstein, the third time we've spoken on this podcast.

00:05.760 --> 00:12.660
 He is the wise turtle, Master Ugwe, to my Kung Fu Panda, one of my favorite people to talk to in this world.

00:13.160 --> 00:25.400
 A complicated and fascinating mind that I'm grateful to have the chance to accompany in exploring this world through conversation, on this podcast and on his, the latter called the portal.

00:25.400 --> 00:30.400
 Quick mention of each sponsor, followed by some thoughts related to the episode.

00:30.400 --> 00:38.400
 First is Grammarly, a service I use in my writing to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure, and readability.

00:38.400 --> 00:46.400
 Second is Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use to add healthy variety into my culinary life.

00:46.400 --> 00:52.400
 Third is SEM Rush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come across.

00:52.400 --> 00:58.400
 I don't like looking at numbers, but somebody should, it helps you make good decisions.

00:58.400 --> 01:05.400
 And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years to protect my privacy on the internet.

01:05.400 --> 01:11.400
 Please check out these sponsors in the description to get a discount and to support this podcast.

01:11.400 --> 01:20.400
 As a side note, let me say that wherever this life takes me, I'm drawn to the possibility of having many more conversations with Eric through the years.

01:20.400 --> 01:30.400
 I think we have just the right kind of contrasting worldviews and a deep respect and appreciation of each other's life stories.

01:30.400 --> 01:45.400
 That creates for this magical experience in the realm of conversation that feels like we're always looking for something that we never quite find, but are always better for having tried.

01:45.400 --> 01:51.400
 I'm not sure how or why the universe is connected to Eric and me, but it did.

01:51.400 --> 01:57.400
 And I would be a fool not to trust its judgment and enjoy the journey.

02:15.400 --> 02:18.400
 Who's the greatest musician of all time, would you say?

02:18.400 --> 02:23.400
 We were just off camera talking about Eddie Van Halen. He unfortunately passed away.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.400
 Who's the greatest musician of all time?

02:25.400 --> 02:26.400
 Yeah.

02:26.400 --> 02:28.400
 Jonathan Richmond.

02:28.400 --> 02:29.400
 Who's that?

02:29.400 --> 02:33.400
 It's a weird question, so I'm going to give you a weird answer. It's not because of you.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.400
 Thank you.

02:34.400 --> 02:37.400
 Jonathan Richmond, the reason I'm picking on him is that he had a quote.

02:37.400 --> 02:41.400
 He was the frontman of a group called The Modern Lovers.

02:41.400 --> 02:51.400
 And his quote was something like, we have to be prepared to play music when our instruments are broken, the electricity's out, and it's raining, something like that.

02:51.400 --> 03:01.400
 And I thought that that quote was very interesting because what it said was, you have to be able to strip this thing down farther and farther back to get to something that is intrinsically musical.

03:01.400 --> 03:05.400
 We were having a conversation just now about virtuosity.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.400
 And we're talking about Eddie Van Halen and his recent passing.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.400
 And that affected me emotionally. I don't know whether it affected you.

03:10.400 --> 03:18.400
 I was never a Van Halen the group fan, but I revered Eddie Van Halen's capacity for innovation.

03:18.400 --> 03:23.400
 I saw him like Rodney Mull in the skateboard.

03:23.400 --> 03:30.400
 I had dreamed of having the two of them on the same podcast just to talk about what it's like to totally discontinuously innovate.

03:30.400 --> 03:36.400
 And he posted a video of Spanish fly, I think, and saying, like, I didn't know the guitar could make those kinds of sounds.

03:36.400 --> 03:37.400
 Like, what is this voodoo magic?

03:37.400 --> 03:38.400
 What is it?

03:38.400 --> 03:39.400
 Well, this is the thing, right?

03:39.400 --> 03:55.400
 The arpeggios that he did on a single string are so fast, and the attacks from the hammer ons, when they go at light speed as he did, particularly, and the reason I chose that was that I wanted to strip out the electronics.

03:55.400 --> 04:03.400
 Because part of the claim will be that he's a rock musician, and a lot of the innovations had to do with things peculiar to sort of the electrified setup.

04:03.400 --> 04:11.400
 His use of the whammy bar, for example, or the Frankenstrat that he built from different pieces, right?

04:11.400 --> 04:19.400
 All of those aspects, in my opinion, are just dwarfed by his innovation and his musicianship.

04:19.400 --> 04:32.400
 And that's why I chose Spanish fly, because everyone, of course, will go to something like your eruption or running with the devil, which is the first things that they heard that let them know that there was a new force erupting out of Southern California that was Eddie Van Halen, right?

04:32.400 --> 04:35.400
 I mean, I'm in love with the story of it.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.400
 You're often so poetic about music.

04:39.400 --> 04:43.400
 It clearly touches your soul on many levels.

04:43.400 --> 04:44.400
 What is that?

04:44.400 --> 04:51.400
 Is it deeper than just rocking out in your convertible Corvette 69?

04:51.400 --> 04:57.400
 I imagine Eric Weinstein is just driving down the California highways, blasting some kind of music.

04:57.400 --> 05:11.400
 Is it just being able to be carefree for moments of time, or is there something more fundamental that connects to the theory of everything in physics and life and all of that?

05:11.400 --> 05:17.400
 How often do you have the chance, for example, to hear mathematics performed as you do in Bach, right?

05:17.400 --> 05:31.400
 Like something with that kind of precision and elegance that can't really be grasped where, you know, to go back to Leonard Cohen's famous line, the baffled king composing, right?

05:31.400 --> 05:32.400
 Such a good song.

05:32.400 --> 05:38.400
 Such a good song, but it's also like individual verses of that song are insanely important.

05:38.400 --> 05:43.400
 The baffled king is how we often make music.

05:43.400 --> 05:50.400
 We don't really understand what did we just do that broke that person's heart sitting on the couch, right?

05:50.400 --> 05:53.400
 And so it's a very strange thing that you should be able to have.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.400
 Think of it like you're a computer.

05:55.400 --> 06:00.400
 You've got this weird open music port, you know, port 37.8, you know?

06:00.400 --> 06:07.400
 Like it's not even supposed to be there, and suddenly somebody starts playing guitar and they're making you feel things.

06:07.400 --> 06:15.400
 Or, you know, like in particular, particular instruments like the violin, it's so difficult, it's so unforgiving.

06:15.400 --> 06:21.400
 And when it gives up its secrets, it just, you know, it wraps its fingers around your heart and won't let go.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.400
 Sometimes I talk about head, heart, and loins.

06:24.400 --> 06:34.400
 When something can grab your head, heart, and your loins at the same moment and integrate them, there are very few opportunities to live like that.

06:34.400 --> 06:45.400
 And if you think about Eddie Van Halen, you know, as far as your head, the musical innovations and the fact that he was drawing directly from the classical canon,

06:45.400 --> 06:56.400
 you know, really speaks to the idea that maybe rock is what somebody like Jimi Hendrix saw it as being, you know, an infinitely extensible medium.

06:56.400 --> 07:05.400
 In terms of heart, I always notice the smile on his face. It's painful to look at an Eddie Van Halen solo now.

07:05.400 --> 07:10.400
 Like sometimes you'll see the cigarette dripping off the side of his mouth and you're like, that's going to fucking kill you.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.400
 And I'm not even worried about it for you. I'm worried about it for me.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.400
 You're going to rob. I don't even need to hear you play another note.

07:16.400 --> 07:21.400
 I just like knowing that you're in the world, that there is somebody that everyone looks to that know.

07:21.400 --> 07:28.400
 But I've never heard a guitarist say, eh, I don't know. I think he was OK. Like I've never heard it.

07:28.400 --> 07:34.400
 You can hate him, but you still think he was a genius. There are very few people like that in the world.

07:34.400 --> 07:42.400
 And then loins, those leaps, that guy was incredibly good looking, you know, skin tight pants, super athleticism.

07:42.400 --> 07:51.400
 He completely owned the male sexuality of the stage, both being the completely dominant, you know, sort of mythical alpha male.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.400
 I hate that expression, but there you are.

07:53.400 --> 08:01.400
 But also this kind of little boy with this mischievous smirk and, you know, the sense that it all came together.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.400
 How could you not eat that up?

08:03.400 --> 08:15.400
 You could just imagine the millions of young teenage boys playing air guitar in their room. Yeah, basically dreaming of being that kind of God.

08:15.400 --> 08:21.400
 The most perfect example of what a human being can be. It's fascinating to think.

08:21.400 --> 08:30.400
 It is. And then, you know, as in many of the cases with these bands, you get these multiple talents in the same outfit.

08:30.400 --> 08:37.400
 And I think that the original configuration with David Lee Roth, I mean, David Lee Roth is such a hot mess at all times.

08:37.400 --> 08:41.400
 I would love you to talk to David Lee Roth.

08:41.400 --> 08:46.400
 Like, if that dance would be just gorgeous.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.400
 I don't know.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.400
 Can you handle it? Can you ride that?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.400
 Probably not.

08:50.400 --> 08:51.400
 Yeah.

08:51.400 --> 08:59.400
 Probably not because I think he's very, I get the feeling that he's very smart and very dysregulated.

08:59.400 --> 09:04.400
 And I don't know that I could like bring him down to earth for a moment.

09:04.400 --> 09:06.400
 Well, I can also get pretty dysregulated, you know?

09:06.400 --> 09:07.400
 Yeah.

09:07.400 --> 09:10.400
 And so I don't know whether it could be magic.

09:10.400 --> 09:11.400
 It could be a shit show.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.400
 I don't know what you thought of his appearance on Rogan.

09:13.400 --> 09:15.400
 That was an interesting one.

09:15.400 --> 09:16.400
 I loved it.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.400
 But Joe and that and Joe does it sometimes.

09:18.400 --> 09:26.400
 Sometimes he just sits back and listens and he just lets like the music play, which works really well.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.400
 I think you have a chance to kind of jump into the chaos.

09:30.400 --> 09:31.400
 I care too.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.400
 And then you'll just start.

09:32.400 --> 09:37.400
 And the places you will go, you may not even talk about music for like hours.

09:37.400 --> 09:40.400
 It might just go to this because he I think lives in Japan.

09:40.400 --> 09:45.400
 Like there's a weird, he's been an EMT after he was a rock star.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.400
 He chose to be kind of like, I don't know.

09:48.400 --> 09:53.400
 You know, there's depth to that man that hasn't been explored by him either.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.400
 So that'll be an exciting conversation.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.400
 Can we go back to Larry Cohen?

09:57.400 --> 09:58.400
 Yeah.

09:58.400 --> 10:05.400
 Can we just, the things I feel when I listen to Hallelujah by Larry Cohen or anything by him really.

10:05.400 --> 10:06.400
 But that one.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.400
 You really want to get into it?

10:08.400 --> 10:09.400
 Let's go.

10:09.400 --> 10:13.400
 What does that song mean to you?

10:13.400 --> 10:15.400
 Is it love?

10:15.400 --> 10:16.400
 Oh boy.

10:16.400 --> 10:19.400
 Well, first of all, it's mystery.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.400
 Like it starts off about mystery.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.400
 So what are you doing?

10:23.400 --> 10:28.400
 You're doing this alternation between the two chords.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.400
 So three notes at the same time.

10:30.400 --> 10:38.400
 One is called the tonic or you have the major and the relative minor and he's alternating between them.

10:38.400 --> 10:41.400
 There's only one note of difference between those two chords.

10:41.400 --> 10:42.400
 One of them would be feeling sad.

10:42.400 --> 10:46.400
 One of them would be more joyous, typically described.

10:46.400 --> 10:52.400
 And so by altering one note, it's the minimal amount to take you back and forth between joy and happiness.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
 As that's encoded in us.

10:54.400 --> 10:55.400
 So he starts off with it.

10:55.400 --> 10:56.400
 I heard there was a scene.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.400
 David played the please a little bit.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.400
 You don't really care for music, do you?

11:01.400 --> 11:06.400
 That's really interesting because it's, he's using this technique called bathos, right?

11:06.400 --> 11:13.400
 So the alternation between the sublime and kind of the guttural or ridiculous or the mundane, right?

11:13.400 --> 11:14.400
 So he's like.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.400
 There's a bitterness to it too.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.400
 Is it just play?

11:17.400 --> 11:21.400
 Well, the way I hear it, again, you know, a great song allows for different interpretations.

11:21.400 --> 11:22.400
 You happen to be asking me.

11:22.400 --> 11:26.400
 So I'm going to impart some stuff that probably isn't in the song, but why it speaks to me.

11:26.400 --> 11:28.400
 That's what makes it great.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.400
 The way I hear it is he doesn't believe the audience.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.400
 You don't really care for music, do you?

11:32.400 --> 11:33.400
 Then what are you doing listening to this?

11:33.400 --> 11:35.400
 You stupid idiots, you know?

11:35.400 --> 11:37.400
 Of course you, of course you care for music.

11:37.400 --> 11:38.400
 You're too cool to care.

11:38.400 --> 11:41.400
 So I see through you and screw you.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.400
 That's like the kind of, that's the energy I get at.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.400
 Then he does this weird thing.

11:46.400 --> 11:53.400
 It goes like this is where he should put the description of where he is in the chord progression, which is the tonic, right?

11:53.400 --> 11:54.400
 It goes like this.

11:54.400 --> 12:02.400
 And then he hits the fourth and the fifth, which are the two other major elements, the subdominant and the dominant in functional harmony.

12:02.400 --> 12:07.400
 So he's describing the chord progression in real time in the lyrics.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.400
 There's two ways this can come about in other songs.

12:10.400 --> 12:15.400
 Like we had this example of every time we say goodbye, do you know the song?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.400
 Every time we say goodbye.

12:17.400 --> 12:21.400
 No, I think it was a Cole Porter, maybe or Gershwin, maybe Porter.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.400
 I don't know.

12:22.400 --> 12:32.400
 I cry a little, there is no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to minor, right?

12:32.400 --> 12:34.400
 Like it's beautiful use.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.400
 Then there's times when it's duplicitous.

12:37.400 --> 12:44.400
 So for example, you'll have, I guess my favorite examples of this are Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire.

12:44.400 --> 12:48.400
 I fell into a burning ring of fire.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.400
 Then what does he do with the lyrics in the tune?

12:52.400 --> 12:55.400
 I went down, down, down.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.400
 He goes up, right?

12:56.400 --> 13:00.400
 And so the idea is like, oh, okay, that was a head fake, right?

13:00.400 --> 13:05.400
 And another one of these is Nina Simone's Feeling Good.

13:05.400 --> 13:18.400
 Oh, okay, so what do you get?

13:18.400 --> 13:20.400
 That woman's voice.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.400
 She doesn't give a damn.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.400
 And I feel it.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.400
 But then what's the...

13:25.400 --> 13:28.400
 It's like heavy stripping music.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.400
 You're not in a good place.

13:30.400 --> 13:33.400
 You're probably in some strip club.

13:33.400 --> 13:38.400
 Last of your money, you're drinking lousy beer, some bad situation.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.400
 And she's feeling good.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
 No, it's funerial.

13:41.400 --> 13:43.400
 It's oppressive, right?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.400
 I never thought of that song that way.

13:45.400 --> 13:46.400
 Wow.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.400
 Well, you think of it as joyous?

13:48.400 --> 13:49.400
 Yeah.

13:49.400 --> 13:50.400
 No, no, no.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.400
 If you think about it, contrast it with Ray Charles, for example.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.400
 Do you know Lonely Avenue?

13:55.400 --> 14:03.400
 Well, my room has got two windows, but the sunshine never comes through.

14:03.400 --> 14:04.400
 It's really depressed.

14:04.400 --> 14:10.400
 It's the same sort of vibe as Nina, but she's claiming that she's in great shape.

14:10.400 --> 14:13.400
 So she's like a good case of the unreliable narrator.

14:13.400 --> 14:17.400
 Leonard Cohen, to me, is talking about the unreliable audience that's too cool to be with

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
 the performer on stage.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.400
 There are things that go with the music, like the Cole Porter stuff that go against, like

14:22.400 --> 14:23.400
 the Johnny Cash.

14:23.400 --> 14:28.400
 I think these are the games that musicians play that the rest of us only sort of notice

14:28.400 --> 14:29.400
 subliminally.

14:29.400 --> 14:30.400
 Okay.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.400
 Fourth, the fifth.

14:33.400 --> 14:38.400
 He should say something about the relative minor or the, he's giving you the secret, the

14:38.400 --> 14:39.400
 baffled king.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.400
 In other words, he doesn't know why it works.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.400
 Did Pockelbel know why Pockelbel's canon would work?

14:45.400 --> 14:46.400
 Yeah.

14:46.400 --> 14:47.400
 It was a discovery.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.400
 That's the whole thing.

14:48.400 --> 14:53.400
 Some music is discovered and some music is invented.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.400
 And he's talking about a musical discovery.

14:56.400 --> 15:02.160
 He's talking about the Pythagorean power of the wave equation and then superimposed, like

15:02.160 --> 15:08.300
 there's two genius intellectual concepts behind music, one of which is the wave equation.

15:08.300 --> 15:11.200
 Usually we solve it for a one dimensional medium because we're talking about strings

15:11.200 --> 15:12.200
 or air columns.

15:12.200 --> 15:17.480
 Occasionally, you're talking about things like handpans or steel drums or metallophones

15:17.480 --> 15:19.400
 or gamelons, whatever.

15:19.400 --> 15:23.880
 And those have a wave equation too that's much more chaotic.

15:23.880 --> 15:29.360
 The other equation is this crazy thing that two to the 1912 is almost exactly equal to

15:29.360 --> 15:32.080
 three, which is what gave us even temperament.

15:32.080 --> 15:37.800
 And so the tension between those two things is, in fact, one of these most beautiful stories

15:37.800 --> 15:40.440
 inside of that system.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.400
 That formula of the baffled king is a discovery.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.200
 It's not, he's not really composing it.

15:46.200 --> 15:51.200
 The reason he's baffled, it's imagine that you took like a little brush and you started

15:51.200 --> 15:55.760
 brushing off a pyramid under the sands.

15:55.760 --> 15:59.920
 You might think that you created the pyramid by your brushing, but in fact, somebody else

15:59.920 --> 16:00.920
 did it.

16:00.920 --> 16:01.920
 That's why you're baffled.

16:01.920 --> 16:02.920
 Right?

16:02.920 --> 16:03.920
 That's beautifully put.

16:03.920 --> 16:04.920
 You're right.

16:04.920 --> 16:10.560
 And as creating one of the greatest songs of all time and as he's doing it, he's baffled.

16:10.560 --> 16:13.360
 And he's within the song.

16:13.360 --> 16:18.280
 And he Leonard is baffled is my my contention, but he knows enough to know that he's baffled.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.280
 Right?

16:19.280 --> 16:21.040
 And so the idea is that he is composing.

16:21.040 --> 16:27.760
 He has the audacity to compose as David.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.680
 He's echoing David at a minimum.

16:30.680 --> 16:34.520
 And then in a later song, which I really wish we would discuss that's totally dystopic and

16:34.520 --> 16:41.240
 you will not like it at all, is the future, which contains this line that I think I used

16:41.240 --> 16:49.800
 in my episode with Roger Penrose on the portal, not the subtle plug, the portal, the portal.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.080
 I'm the little Jew that wrote the Bible.

16:52.080 --> 16:56.560
 So there is this way in which Leonard Cohen, I think is constantly coming to the idea of

16:56.560 --> 17:00.040
 being a biblical like scribe.

17:00.040 --> 17:03.000
 And I think this is one of the great things that, you know, you see Dylan doing this with

17:03.000 --> 17:04.520
 all along the watch tower.

17:04.520 --> 17:09.440
 You saw Warren Zevon, who we should talk much more about doing this with a song called I

17:09.440 --> 17:12.320
 Was In The House When The House Burned Dad, do you know this thing?

17:12.320 --> 17:13.880
 No, this is embarrassing.

17:13.880 --> 17:14.880
 Sweetheart.

17:14.880 --> 17:15.880
 This is a great day.

17:15.880 --> 17:16.880
 Darling.

17:16.880 --> 17:22.320
 Warren Zevon is one of the most important songwriters of our time, and he's been largely

17:22.320 --> 17:26.640
 forgotten by this generation.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.800
 But you know, Bob Dylan would sing one of his songs in tribute.

17:29.800 --> 17:35.280
 I've heard Bob Dylan, you know, very small number of songwriters really move him.

17:35.280 --> 17:40.640
 Woody Guthrie, Gordon Lightfoot, and Warren Zevon.

17:40.640 --> 17:45.360
 By the way, Bob Dylan, if you're out there, appear on either one of our podcasts.

17:45.360 --> 17:48.280
 We need to get your voice into a new medium for a new group.

17:48.280 --> 17:49.280
 Definitely.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.280
 This is a time for Bob Dylan, my friend.

17:52.280 --> 17:55.760
 Honestly, you've been doing an amazing job in this space.

17:55.760 --> 18:01.280
 One of the reasons I'm super excited to do this podcast again is that I've learned some

18:01.280 --> 18:03.800
 things about what I don't do well.

18:03.800 --> 18:08.960
 And I also have sort of struggled with the question, should I do those things better?

18:08.960 --> 18:12.680
 Because what if it's, you know, I always use the same example of the fitted sheet when

18:12.680 --> 18:16.080
 you're trying to put a queen size fitted sheet on a king size mattress.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.680
 He's like, okay, I got that corner squared away, and then you get another corner that

18:18.680 --> 18:21.280
 pops off and then you go back around.

18:21.280 --> 18:27.520
 I wonder whether I can improve my style in the ways in which, you know, I think it's

18:27.520 --> 18:28.960
 just a recognition of a difference.

18:28.960 --> 18:36.360
 You do a better job of getting to the soul of a really top intellectual guest and making

18:36.360 --> 18:42.400
 them accessible and presenting them as themselves for a huge number of people.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.680
 And I'd give my eye tooth to be able to do that.

18:44.680 --> 18:50.760
 Do you ever think about this, like, because I think about what is the greatest conversation

18:50.760 --> 18:57.880
 I'll ever have, you know, like in a sense of the portal, not to reduce it to anything,

18:57.880 --> 19:00.920
 but there will be the greatest conversation.

19:00.920 --> 19:06.200
 You may have already had it, but it's very possible if enough people like me can keep

19:06.200 --> 19:12.240
 twisting your arm to keep doing the portal, please, that there'll be an amazing conversation.

19:12.240 --> 19:19.160
 One of the questions that I ask myself is like, who is the person that I'm especially

19:19.160 --> 19:23.200
 equipped for some reason I'm convinced on Putin.

19:23.200 --> 19:29.320
 There's something in my head that says, I can do this man better than anyone else in

19:29.320 --> 19:30.320
 this world.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.640
 I got this thought in my head about it.

19:31.640 --> 19:35.440
 I don't know why and I'm convinced, but I think the universe works in that way.

19:35.440 --> 19:38.200
 Like if it tells you, it's going to happen.

19:38.200 --> 19:43.640
 The way I would say it is that almost everybody who becomes a Supreme Court justice believes

19:43.640 --> 19:46.680
 at a very early age, they're going to become a Supreme Court justice.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.920
 Many people believe at an early age that they can do it.

19:48.920 --> 19:49.920
 Don't get there.

19:49.920 --> 19:55.600
 But of those who get there, almost all of them had this sort of, well, I call it pathological

19:55.600 --> 19:58.320
 self confidence.

19:58.320 --> 20:03.200
 I do think you have pathological self confidence and you also have humility.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.560
 Most people would hear those as a contradiction.

20:05.560 --> 20:10.680
 I think that you would not be able to get away with what you do if you didn't have the

20:10.680 --> 20:13.680
 humility.

20:13.680 --> 20:18.720
 The great danger is that your equation becomes unbalanced, that you either lose the humility

20:18.720 --> 20:25.000
 or you lose the humility, overwhelms the ego and the drive because right now you've got

20:25.000 --> 20:28.600
 a Mexican standoff in your mind and the rest of us are just benefiting.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.760
 That's beautifully put.

20:29.760 --> 20:32.480
 My Mexican standoffs aren't as stable as yours.

20:32.480 --> 20:36.240
 It's all reservoir dogs all the time.

20:36.240 --> 20:40.000
 But actually the person who that describes is Peter Thiel.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.560
 Peter Thiel thinks more, people always say like, what does Peter think about X, Y, and

20:43.560 --> 20:44.560
 Z, P, and Q?

20:44.560 --> 20:46.280
 It's like, well, do you want communist Peter?

20:46.280 --> 20:48.560
 Do you want hypercapitalist Peter?

20:48.560 --> 20:50.080
 Oh my God, right?

20:50.080 --> 20:51.080
 On everything.

20:51.080 --> 20:53.960
 That's why he's successful is that he's got all these minds fighting each other.

20:53.960 --> 20:59.400
 When people say, Peter is this or Peter is that, I just laugh because nobody who knows

20:59.400 --> 21:05.040
 him would describe him as having thoughts at the level that people are claiming.

21:05.040 --> 21:15.840
 I do think that in my case, there's also pathological epistemic humility.

21:15.840 --> 21:20.560
 I know how little I can do in one life.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.680
 I know how many things I've screwed up.

21:22.680 --> 21:25.280
 I know how many things I've got wrong.

21:25.280 --> 21:30.400
 And on the other hand, I know that if not, it's like Hillel's questions, if I'm not

21:30.400 --> 21:32.120
 for myself, who will be for me?

21:32.120 --> 21:36.960
 If I'm only for myself, what am I if not now when?

21:36.960 --> 21:43.200
 At some level, there's a question about if I don't decide that someone is capable and

21:43.200 --> 21:49.520
 that somebody is me, and if I apply that to everyone else on the planet, then nobody's

21:49.520 --> 21:50.520
 going to do anything.

21:50.520 --> 21:55.120
 And so I do think that one of the things that people like you and I get is, who are you

21:55.120 --> 22:00.960
 to say that, f that, man?

22:00.960 --> 22:03.000
 Sign me up for some Dunning Kruger.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.120
 Yeah, but it's multiple minds, like you said.

22:07.120 --> 22:12.400
 This morning, I was feeling so good and confident about I couldn't think no wrong.

22:12.400 --> 22:16.560
 And I remember last night clearly thinking that I'm the dumbest human who has ever lived

22:16.560 --> 22:19.880
 and nothing I've ever said is worth anything.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.680
 What the fuck am I doing with my life?

22:22.680 --> 22:23.680
 Why am I scared?

22:23.680 --> 22:26.520
 I was terrified of this conversation.

22:26.520 --> 22:27.520
 Who the hell am I?

22:27.520 --> 22:28.520
 This conversation?

22:28.520 --> 22:29.520
 Because I'm an idiot.

22:29.520 --> 22:38.240
 And because, you know, Lex, but no, no, no, but this morning, I was the baddest motherfucker

22:38.240 --> 22:39.520
 who's ever walked this earth.

22:39.520 --> 22:41.800
 So I was very conscious.

22:41.800 --> 22:42.800
 I think it was the coffee.

22:42.800 --> 22:43.800
 I'm not sure.

22:43.800 --> 22:44.800
 Maybe some sleep.

22:44.800 --> 22:48.400
 This sounds very Russian and it involves multiple beverages, some of them being alcoholic,

22:48.400 --> 22:50.200
 others containing caffeine.

22:50.200 --> 22:54.800
 There's, in fact, I can't share the story behind it, but there is a bottle of vodka

22:54.800 --> 22:55.800
 in the fridge.

22:55.800 --> 22:56.800
 Okay.

22:56.800 --> 23:02.720
 So I mean, I should have hit you for coffee because this is a morning show here.

23:02.720 --> 23:07.000
 So I put out a call that we get a chance to have this conversation and people ask these

23:07.000 --> 23:16.120
 wonderful questions, a few people asked about depression and suicide.

23:16.120 --> 23:19.600
 This is a Russian program, so we have to go there.

23:19.600 --> 23:28.600
 And I think about Leonard Cohen and one of the things that always kind of broke my heart

23:28.600 --> 23:35.960
 and kind of suffocated the hope I have for just, I don't know, for love in a person's

23:35.960 --> 23:41.920
 life is to hear how much depression was a part of Leonard Cohen's life and how much

23:41.920 --> 23:44.400
 he suffered.

23:44.400 --> 23:49.920
 I guess one way, I'm not sure where we can go with this question, but do you think about

23:49.920 --> 23:54.280
 the places that the mind can go, like these dark places?

23:54.280 --> 23:55.480
 Yeah.

23:55.480 --> 24:02.120
 Is there something like where the only escape out is suicide, for example, that's the darkest

24:02.120 --> 24:03.120
 version of it?

24:03.120 --> 24:10.400
 But I really think suicide is a big place in suicidal ideation and self harm.

24:10.400 --> 24:14.600
 And we don't talk a lot about it.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.400
 It's a similar problem to trying to talk about trans.

24:17.400 --> 24:19.560
 These are umbrella categories.

24:19.560 --> 24:25.200
 And if the commonality is that somebody harms themselves, but we don't know whether that's

24:25.200 --> 24:32.200
 coming because of a problem in brain chemistry, because of an event in their life, whether

24:32.200 --> 24:38.040
 the evolutionary programming for suicide is weirdly normal, whether or not it might have

24:38.040 --> 24:43.640
 a religious motivation, there's too many different forms of self harm.

24:43.640 --> 24:49.920
 It's something like the 10th largest killer thereabouts.

24:49.920 --> 24:53.960
 And I think that you can look at it from different angles.

24:53.960 --> 25:02.280
 I'm old enough to have had Pete Seeger come to my college when I was at university and

25:02.280 --> 25:08.040
 to watch his good humor in the face of all adversity.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.040
 I think of Odetta.

25:09.040 --> 25:12.840
 I used to go to Odetta concerts, I don't know who she is.

25:12.840 --> 25:15.760
 Okay, this is going to be one of the better days of your life.

25:15.760 --> 25:19.480
 Check out Odetta when we're done with the interview.

25:19.480 --> 25:27.400
 She was a civil rights figure, but also just had a profound voice and great musicianship.

25:27.400 --> 25:33.320
 These people were in the struggles, and they saw lots of bad things happen, and they kept

25:33.320 --> 25:36.720
 their humor about them.

25:36.720 --> 25:45.800
 The thing is that you can take on the Veldschmerz, the pain of the planet, or you can try to do

25:45.800 --> 25:53.040
 something else, which is to be a happy warrior, even if the odds are terrible and the cost

25:53.040 --> 25:55.280
 of failure is catastrophic.

25:55.280 --> 26:01.120
 So even once surrounded by darkness, but the thing is with Leonard Cohen is he created

26:01.120 --> 26:08.280
 such beautiful music, and yet it's like Anthony Bourdain, the same.

26:08.280 --> 26:11.560
 And yet they go to this dark place.

26:11.560 --> 26:16.920
 And it's easier to say it's just biochemistry.

26:16.920 --> 26:25.640
 There's a linkage between this highly generative, creative side, and in some cases, dark depression.

26:25.640 --> 26:26.960
 In other cases, not.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.480
 So you can't say that it's tied.

26:29.480 --> 26:35.680
 The genius and madness are always co traveling, or the beauty and pain are one and the same.

26:35.680 --> 26:40.360
 What you can say is that there's a cluster of people that tell you that for that cluster,

26:40.360 --> 26:43.800
 there is a relationship between the darkness and the beauty.

26:43.800 --> 26:49.280
 And I do think that in part, it's squaring circles that can't be squared.

26:49.280 --> 26:57.360
 We were just talking before about the inability to serve two perfect systems, the perfect

26:57.360 --> 27:01.360
 system of the wave equation and the perfect system of even temperament.

27:01.360 --> 27:02.520
 They're both perfect.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.680
 They're not compatible.

27:05.680 --> 27:14.280
 And once you realize that there is perfection and an inability to make contact with perfection,

27:14.280 --> 27:22.360
 I think you recognize that there is no solution to this world.

27:22.360 --> 27:24.360
 Yeah.

27:24.360 --> 27:26.960
 That's weird with the poets and musicians.

27:26.960 --> 27:31.000
 You want to say, this is a particular thing that you do, but then there's Spanish fly

27:31.000 --> 27:33.160
 by Van Halen.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.160
 And then you realize, oh.

27:34.160 --> 27:37.920
 Well, what do you get out of Spanish fly by Van Halen?

27:37.920 --> 27:42.400
 I think it's very singular because of the fact that it's purely acoustic.

27:42.400 --> 27:48.960
 For some reason, I couldn't imagine Van Halen separate from the band in front of thousands

27:48.960 --> 27:53.560
 of people just screaming and rocking out with lights everywhere.

27:53.560 --> 27:58.120
 And Spanish fly made me think like, you made me imagine him sitting alone in a college

27:58.120 --> 27:59.120
 in a room.

27:59.120 --> 28:00.120
 I think that's who he was.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.120
 I really do.

28:01.120 --> 28:03.400
 I mean, believe me, I get it.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.400
 He was a rock star.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.400
 He was a rock god.

28:05.400 --> 28:06.400
 Got it.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.400
 Got it.

28:07.400 --> 28:08.400
 Got it.

28:08.400 --> 28:09.400
 Got it.

28:09.400 --> 28:12.680
 I'm almost positive that you can't get to where he got to without being a complete introvert.

28:12.680 --> 28:13.680
 Yeah.

28:13.680 --> 28:21.520
 It made me imagine that there's some half naked supermodel walking around hoping that they

28:21.520 --> 28:24.680
 can do their thing together.

28:24.680 --> 28:26.280
 And Eddie's completely disinterested.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.280
 He'd be with the guitar.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.280
 He'd be with the guitar.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.280
 Right?

28:29.280 --> 28:30.280
 Yeah.

28:30.280 --> 28:35.840
 It's totally, at some level, in one case, maybe you're conquesting, maybe you're pursuing

28:35.840 --> 28:36.840
 love and romance.

28:36.840 --> 28:42.760
 In the other case, you're talking about a relationship to the order, the creator, the

28:42.760 --> 28:47.040
 almighty, whatever it is you want to call that substrate that is reality.

28:47.040 --> 28:54.160
 And do I believe that Eddie Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix and Paganini and Heifetz jacked

28:54.160 --> 28:56.600
 into the true essence of the world?

28:56.600 --> 28:57.600
 Yeah, they did.

28:57.600 --> 29:00.600
 I don't think it's as good as differential geometry.

29:00.600 --> 29:01.600
 I'm sorry.

29:01.600 --> 29:08.000
 I do think it's amazing for other reasons and thank God because it's very difficult to

29:08.000 --> 29:10.400
 communicate differential geometry at scale.

29:10.400 --> 29:15.400
 But the thing about eruption, for example, what level do you want to come into eruption?

29:15.400 --> 29:18.280
 Do you want just the sheer majesty and pageantry?

29:18.280 --> 29:20.200
 Do you want the theatrics?

29:20.200 --> 29:25.080
 You could put them on wires and set his pants on fire or whatever.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.520
 You know, it'd be totally in keeping with it.

29:27.520 --> 29:33.520
 On the other hand, you want to have something completely precise that shows off the virtuosity

29:33.520 --> 29:36.760
 of what's possible with the Stratocaster.

29:36.760 --> 29:37.760
 Everything works.

29:37.760 --> 29:38.760
 Multiaccess.

29:38.760 --> 29:44.200
 But there's a precision to it, which is very different than Hendrix.

29:44.200 --> 29:49.480
 There's a messiness to Hendrix that to me, somebody who has OCD has always been struggling.

29:49.480 --> 29:50.480
 How does Hendrix affect you?

29:50.480 --> 29:52.560
 I mean, let's have the Jimi Hendrix conversation.

29:52.560 --> 29:56.360
 I don't know that we can do anything to it that hasn't already been done to it.

29:56.360 --> 29:57.360
 Maybe that's not true.

29:57.360 --> 30:01.440
 Maybe the idea is that every generation has to have its Hendrix conversation and this

30:01.440 --> 30:02.440
 is a long form.

30:02.440 --> 30:03.440
 It's Jimi Hendrix experience.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.440
 Yeah.

30:04.440 --> 30:05.440
 Yeah.

30:05.440 --> 30:06.440
 So funny.

30:06.440 --> 30:07.440
 Yeah.

30:07.440 --> 30:08.440
 I hear he stole it from Joe Rogan.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.440
 Yeah.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.840
 There's so many details.

30:11.840 --> 30:20.880
 One, it hurt my soul on so many levels that you can put a thumb over the guitar to play

30:20.880 --> 30:23.720
 a note, to hold the note.

30:23.720 --> 30:28.880
 And it doesn't because I want it to be the Russian virtuoso that sits with his classical

30:28.880 --> 30:34.200
 guitar in a perfect form, plays really fast with the fingers, and then you don't want,

30:34.200 --> 30:36.920
 you want the thumb to be perfectly relaxed and supporting the neck.

30:36.920 --> 30:39.200
 So that's the Russian conservatory student.

30:39.200 --> 30:40.800
 Conservatory student, yeah.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.440
 Then there's the Russian wild man.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.440
 Which one is that?

30:44.440 --> 30:45.440
 Well, haven't.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.640
 They're different Russian archetypes, right?

30:47.640 --> 30:55.400
 So the completely idiosyncratic Russian is very different in a weird way from the, you

30:55.400 --> 31:00.240
 know, I can do this backwards in any key in any, in my sleep and in any time signature

31:00.240 --> 31:03.200
 that you, you know, just snap your fingers.

31:03.200 --> 31:08.280
 We've discussed my piano tuner in previous episodes.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.280
 No, no, no.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.280
 That was offline conversation.

31:10.280 --> 31:11.280
 You told me the story.

31:11.280 --> 31:13.160
 But I should tell you the story.

31:13.160 --> 31:14.160
 You should retell the story.

31:14.160 --> 31:19.920
 There it was in darkest Manhattan with the world's shittiest, it wasn't even an upright,

31:19.920 --> 31:21.400
 it was a spin at piano.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.600
 A friend had given it to me.

31:23.600 --> 31:27.640
 The piano fell out of tune and I would have to tune it.

31:27.640 --> 31:31.280
 And the only tuner I knew was this Russian guy and I hated dealing with him.

31:31.280 --> 31:35.240
 There was something about his attitude that just really rubbed me the wrong way.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.400
 So anyway, my wife says tune that thing.

31:37.400 --> 31:41.440
 So we get the piano tuner to come and he's tuning this and he's like, are you sure, are

31:41.440 --> 31:44.880
 you sure you want to tune this, this piece of shit, you know, okay, fine.

31:44.880 --> 31:48.320
 So he's like, okay, it's your money.

31:48.320 --> 31:56.560
 The phone rings and I have the phone ringer set on a landline to Paganini Caprice 24.

31:56.560 --> 32:02.120
 And immediately as the phone rings, he figures out what key the phone ringer is and which

32:02.120 --> 32:09.560
 is not the key that like list composed the variations on Caprice 24.

32:09.560 --> 32:13.080
 And he starts going into theme and variations on Caprice 24.

32:13.080 --> 32:17.200
 At some level, I've never heard before, just jaw dropping it.

32:17.200 --> 32:20.560
 And like the phone stops ringing and we have this awkward silence.

32:20.560 --> 32:23.520
 I said, I didn't know you were such a great piano player.

32:23.520 --> 32:27.400
 And then he says one of these things that in, you know, in Russian accent, in English

32:27.400 --> 32:31.960
 hurts in a way you can't imagine, he said, no, you are the piano player.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.960
 I am merely the piano tuner.

32:33.960 --> 32:38.600
 And it's just like, oh man, through the heart.

32:38.600 --> 32:42.240
 You know, it's kind of reminiscent, I'd love to hear actually your opinion, this is reminiscent

32:42.240 --> 32:44.320
 of the Goodwill hunting story.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.880
 What do you think about that?

32:45.880 --> 32:46.880
 That movie?

32:46.880 --> 32:47.880
 That movie.

32:47.880 --> 32:48.880
 It's MIT.

32:48.880 --> 32:49.880
 It's, yeah.

32:49.880 --> 32:58.720
 I guess when I think of that film, I think about Matt Damon as a young guy risking everything,

32:58.720 --> 33:00.120
 giving up Harvard.

33:00.120 --> 33:03.760
 I think, you know, probably the most accomplished group of people in the world are people who

33:03.760 --> 33:05.800
 choose to give up Harvard voluntarily.

33:05.800 --> 33:06.800
 Right.

33:06.800 --> 33:09.080
 That's true, that's true.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.080
 Bigger than Harvard.

33:10.080 --> 33:11.080
 That's very true.

33:11.080 --> 33:18.240
 You know, Ives was one of these people, Bill Gates, of course.

33:18.240 --> 33:19.680
 And then oddly, you know.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.680
 Zuckerberg.

33:20.680 --> 33:21.680
 What?

33:21.680 --> 33:22.680
 Zuckerberg.

33:22.680 --> 33:27.000
 But then Steve Jobs gave up a read and read is like the weirdest craziest college in the

33:27.000 --> 33:28.000
 world.

33:28.000 --> 33:31.240
 People should pay much more attention to read and I'm sorry it's going through a hard time

33:31.240 --> 33:32.240
 at the moment.

33:32.240 --> 33:36.280
 But what it was before the current craziness is really an interesting story.

33:36.280 --> 33:44.520
 Regardless, as we say in the 617 area code, I think that a lot of my reaction is to the

33:44.520 --> 33:50.400
 real story of Matt Damon having this vision and being the young guy to pull it off.

33:50.400 --> 33:57.200
 And you know, I also think about Robin Williams trying to explore heart through this lens

33:57.200 --> 33:58.200
 of acting.

33:58.200 --> 34:06.160
 And, you know, as you and I, you've hung out with comedians, they know that they're a screwed

34:06.160 --> 34:07.680
 up bunch of people.

34:07.680 --> 34:08.680
 They do.

34:08.680 --> 34:10.240
 They're proud about it.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.840
 They really are.

34:11.840 --> 34:17.200
 The idea that Robin Williams, who I saw many years ago when I was in LA in the comedy clubs

34:17.200 --> 34:25.200
 around here, you know, he was a straight up crazy, dysregulated genius in tremendous pain

34:25.200 --> 34:32.640
 and his desire to do it earnestly through acting rather than constantly by just sniping,

34:32.640 --> 34:41.000
 you know, or being a clown or showing us how fast his mind worked relative to ours.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.320
 I was really moved by that.

34:42.320 --> 34:47.960
 I thought that he brought some authenticity and took a huge risk for a comedian to be that

34:47.960 --> 34:48.960
 real.

34:48.960 --> 34:54.160
 And again, like you said, it doesn't always have to be, but in that case, the madness and

34:54.160 --> 34:56.720
 the genius were neighbors.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.760
 That one couldn't have been any other way.

34:58.760 --> 34:59.760
 Yeah.

34:59.760 --> 35:05.760
 No, because his mind, the thing about seeing him in a comedy club was that he would react

35:05.760 --> 35:08.080
 to random stimulus in the environment.

35:08.080 --> 35:10.000
 You know, it could be a heckler.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.960
 Sometimes you almost got the feeling that he wanted a heckler because it was, it gave

35:12.960 --> 35:15.400
 him something to play against.

35:15.400 --> 35:16.400
 Right?

35:16.400 --> 35:20.880
 He was, he was infinitely, instantly inventive.

35:20.880 --> 35:26.840
 But I actually, to me, the best Robin Williams is, has he got closer and closer to the end

35:26.840 --> 35:34.120
 of his life because there was a sadness and he's almost fighting the sadness with this

35:34.120 --> 35:41.240
 improvisational, like the weapons he has is this wit and humor and his dancing that he

35:41.240 --> 35:42.240
 does with language.

35:42.240 --> 35:43.240
 That's right.

35:43.240 --> 35:48.880
 But, and then sometimes when you just fall silent, you can see the sadness.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.600
 But I don't know, there's something so beautiful about that.

35:51.600 --> 35:55.960
 It's like this bird with a broken wing that's like trying to fly, you know, and it's getting

35:55.960 --> 35:56.960
 older and older.

35:56.960 --> 36:04.760
 I mean, those, he would have made a one hell of a podcast guest, I'll tell you that.

36:04.760 --> 36:05.760
 That's a sad.

36:05.760 --> 36:06.760
 Yeah.

36:06.760 --> 36:11.400
 I have some sadness that I really do think that part of what we call podcasting is actually

36:11.400 --> 36:14.880
 just getting to know a soul over and over again.

36:14.880 --> 36:15.880
 Yeah.

36:15.880 --> 36:25.160
 But maybe the idea is that this is talking about depression and sadness and heavy feelings

36:25.160 --> 36:29.200
 is not an American specialty.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.760
 Seeing that in context with the beauty of life is a Russian specialty.

36:32.760 --> 36:37.920
 Like, it is very much, it sounds like a diner menu.

36:37.920 --> 36:38.920
 What?

36:38.920 --> 36:39.920
 Yeah.

36:39.920 --> 36:40.920
 You want the Russian specialty?

36:40.920 --> 36:46.640
 A big scoop of ice cream with tons of depression.

36:46.640 --> 36:53.640
 I do think that we're in a really terrifying and depressing time and I think that part

36:53.640 --> 36:58.000
 of it is that we don't know if something huge is about to get started and we don't even

36:58.000 --> 36:59.000
 know what this is.

36:59.000 --> 37:04.640
 I mean, we just sit here in this weird world that is falling into some new state and we're

37:04.640 --> 37:06.200
 not even super curious.

37:06.200 --> 37:09.000
 It's like, what the hell just happened?

37:09.000 --> 37:12.800
 He's got an answer and I'm positive that all of those answers are wrong.

37:12.800 --> 37:17.640
 Let's try to at least sneak up on the good answer.

37:17.640 --> 37:22.860
 The central core of the answer is that the US seemed to be the greatest thing in the

37:22.860 --> 37:29.280
 world in large measure because we hadn't noticed that we were getting a benefit from

37:29.280 --> 37:34.360
 having no plan, not having to make a plan for low growth.

37:34.360 --> 37:38.480
 As long as we had growth, we were in great shape.

37:38.480 --> 37:42.880
 Let's imagine that you could run an experiment.

37:42.880 --> 37:49.160
 You have a billion copies of Earth and you start the initial conditions slightly different.

37:49.160 --> 37:57.240
 Some giant number of planets, a lot of the things that were discovered from the 1800s

37:57.240 --> 38:03.040
 through the end of the 20th century are discovered in a period of time because a lot of that

38:03.040 --> 38:07.600
 just has to do with once you crack the puzzle of getting better instruments, you can see

38:07.600 --> 38:08.600
 more.

38:08.600 --> 38:11.680
 The more you can see, the more you can make use of what you can see and it turns out there

38:11.680 --> 38:21.880
 was lots of stuff to do with like germs or electron orbitals or spectrum, electromagnetic

38:21.880 --> 38:22.880
 spectrum.

38:22.880 --> 38:28.200
 We got to do all of those things and the US roughly corresponded for a good chunk of

38:28.200 --> 38:30.840
 its history with this bonanza.

38:30.840 --> 38:34.280
 Of course, we look like an amazing genius country.

38:34.280 --> 38:36.160
 We have no plan.

38:36.160 --> 38:39.040
 Imagine that you could sell a car, you don't have to put in seat belts, you don't have

38:39.040 --> 38:44.160
 to put in airbags, you don't have to put in rear view mirrors or sensors or a rear view

38:44.160 --> 38:45.160
 mirror.

38:45.160 --> 38:49.560
 You could save a lot of money on a car by not putting in all of the stuff to keep things

38:49.560 --> 38:53.240
 from going wrong and I think that's what we had.

38:53.240 --> 38:59.800
 We had a machine that as long as growth was insanely good, we plowed it back, the riches

38:59.800 --> 39:05.240
 and spoils and treasure back into the system and made more genius stuff and we carried

39:05.240 --> 39:09.400
 along a good chunk of humanity, hundreds of millions of people.

39:09.400 --> 39:14.440
 We did not have a plan for what happens when the growth goes below the stall speed of our

39:14.440 --> 39:16.240
 society.

39:16.240 --> 39:22.240
 How confident should it be that the growth has slowed in a way that is permanent rather

39:22.240 --> 39:26.000
 than a slap in the face where we…

39:26.000 --> 39:27.920
 It's not the right concept.

39:27.920 --> 39:33.240
 Right concept is, I try to use the same words over and over again in case people see more

39:33.240 --> 39:35.920
 often because then the perseveration actually gets somewhere.

39:35.920 --> 39:40.920
 I use this analogy of the orchard because everyone talks about low hanging fruit.

39:40.920 --> 39:47.400
 They know the concept of low hanging fruit but they don't think in terms of orchards.

39:47.400 --> 39:51.480
 They say things like, you think we've picked all the low hanging fruit but I believe in

39:51.480 --> 39:54.960
 the infinitiveness of the human mind.

39:54.960 --> 39:58.840
 It's like, okay, that doesn't even work as an analogy.

39:58.840 --> 40:02.320
 What if the idea is we only picked all the low hanging fruit here and then we're having

40:02.320 --> 40:06.360
 this stupid argument about low hanging fruit and we're not going and looking for new orchards.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.120
 We're not planting new orchards.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.840
 We're not looking for forests.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.960
 We're just sitting here arguing about low hanging fruit.

40:11.960 --> 40:15.840
 My claim is there's probably a lot more low hanging fruit and it's not here.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.840
 It's in other orchards.

40:16.840 --> 40:17.840
 It's in other orchards.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.080
 One of those turned out to be the digital orchard.

40:20.080 --> 40:29.920
 The digital orchard has not been as stagnant as lots of these other like the chemical orchard.

40:29.920 --> 40:37.040
 I have faith that there's a small percentage of the population but not zero that's looking

40:37.040 --> 40:38.520
 for those other orchards.

40:38.520 --> 40:43.320
 I'm excited about one of those orchards which is, I believe there will be robots in everybody's

40:43.320 --> 40:49.320
 homes and that will unlock some totally new thing.

40:49.320 --> 40:56.520
 Totally new set of technologies, ideas, the way we live life, the productivity, everything.

40:56.520 --> 40:57.520
 It'll change everything.

40:57.520 --> 41:00.080
 I'm excited about that orchard.

41:00.080 --> 41:06.680
 I'm roaming that orchard and wondering how the hell you bring back the ant that finds

41:06.680 --> 41:08.520
 a new source of food.

41:08.520 --> 41:12.080
 I'm trying to find an apple I can bring back to the rest of the earth.

41:12.080 --> 41:13.080
 Great.

41:13.080 --> 41:16.240
 You're in an explorer idiom.

41:16.240 --> 41:18.240
 Do you have faith that there's enough of those?

41:18.240 --> 41:20.440
 I don't think there are very many of us.

41:20.440 --> 41:22.360
 I'm one of them too.

41:22.360 --> 41:23.360
 How many does it take?

41:23.360 --> 41:24.360
 It takes one ant.

41:24.360 --> 41:26.360
 It takes one ant.

41:26.360 --> 41:28.800
 What are you talking about?

41:28.800 --> 41:33.400
 How many eelons does it take to screw in a light bulb?

41:33.400 --> 41:39.600
 Let's imagine that we went, imagine some ant goes and finds a new source of food.

41:39.600 --> 41:44.840
 Then it comes back to the colony and it says, hey, I think I found a new source of food.

41:44.840 --> 41:51.240
 The initial reaction is, you're not authorized to find new food.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.560
 Why would you try to go find new food?

41:52.560 --> 41:55.080
 We're going to remove you from Twitter.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.960
 By the way, I think the fact that you think you're allowed to go find new food shows how

41:57.960 --> 41:59.520
 privileged you are as an ant.

41:59.520 --> 42:00.520
 Get out of the colony.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.520
 Kill him.

42:01.520 --> 42:02.520
 Kill him.

42:02.520 --> 42:07.880
 Well, that's probably not a great model for finding new orchards.

42:07.880 --> 42:12.440
 What we find is that where there's a system that allows somebody to ascend without a lot

42:12.440 --> 42:15.960
 of gatekeeping, you can have that.

42:15.960 --> 42:17.680
 I saw this happen in hedge funds.

42:17.680 --> 42:24.640
 Hedge funds for a while hoovered up a lot of talent because they were places that had

42:24.640 --> 42:28.400
 funding and had freedom.

42:28.400 --> 42:34.960
 In general, really smart people want to be free and they don't want to think a lot about

42:34.960 --> 42:36.840
 how they're going to feed themselves.

42:36.840 --> 42:40.440
 They want to get lost in their minds.

42:40.440 --> 42:45.800
 You can either give them productive places to play, dangerous places to play.

42:45.800 --> 42:51.360
 They're either going to break into computers or find vaccines for you or build bombs or

42:51.360 --> 42:54.280
 build companies.

42:54.280 --> 42:59.960
 We're not providing for the people who have to disrupt and have to innovate and trying

42:59.960 --> 43:01.560
 to channel that effort.

43:01.560 --> 43:06.600
 We're so focused on this other thing, which is fairness and safety.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.280
 Fairness and safety, by the way, are really important.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.360
 I don't want to denigrate them.

43:10.360 --> 43:17.640
 The singular focus on fairness and safety in the same breath being focused on growth

43:17.640 --> 43:22.920
 and discovery and creation is going to doom us because what we're talking about is we're

43:22.920 --> 43:28.560
 always talking about divvying up the pie that is as opposed to the pie that will be.

43:28.560 --> 43:34.320
 Imagine that you spent all your time trying to divvy up the 13th century pie and you destroyed

43:34.320 --> 43:36.720
 your ability to get to the 20th century.

43:36.720 --> 43:39.360
 You'd be an idiot.

43:39.360 --> 43:45.080
 One place I think I disagree with you is, I don't think you need that many people to

43:45.080 --> 43:50.800
 empower the geniuses, the innovators, the people who refuse to spend most of their days in

43:50.800 --> 43:52.280
 meetings about fairness.

43:52.280 --> 43:53.280
 This is good.

43:53.280 --> 43:54.760
 Let's have a disagreement.

43:54.760 --> 44:01.200
 I think podcasting, whatever you call that medium, is just one little example of a tool

44:01.200 --> 44:09.200
 that you can give power to, like you and your podcast can have the next day on Musk and

44:09.200 --> 44:10.200
 make him a star.

44:10.200 --> 44:11.200
 Now I see where you're going.

44:11.200 --> 44:12.200
 Okay.

44:12.200 --> 44:20.040
 There has been a series of places for people to play and be free and we've lost them successfully.

44:20.040 --> 44:23.160
 What's a good place you remember because I disagree with you there too.

44:23.160 --> 44:24.600
 I think they're still there.

44:24.600 --> 44:25.680
 You can still play.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.800
 You interviewed Noam Chomsky.

44:27.800 --> 44:28.800
 Yes.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.800
 Okay.

44:29.800 --> 44:36.960
 Noam Chomsky comes from an era where you could play at MIT and you can't play.

44:36.960 --> 44:38.360
 This is where I disagree with you.

44:38.360 --> 44:40.080
 We've already had this.

44:40.080 --> 44:43.960
 Go check the Clips channel for the Lex Friedman podcast.

44:43.960 --> 44:48.840
 I think I wasn't brave enough at that time and I'm not really brave enough now.

44:48.840 --> 44:49.840
 Come on.

44:49.840 --> 44:50.840
 Because I don't...

44:50.840 --> 44:54.640
 It's a feeling and the people are going to tear me apart.

44:54.640 --> 44:58.440
 Oh, what are you and you speak from emotion and facts?

44:58.440 --> 44:59.440
 The feeling...

44:59.440 --> 45:01.640
 The podcast is yours.

45:01.640 --> 45:02.640
 Yes.

45:02.640 --> 45:03.640
 Okay.

45:03.640 --> 45:07.280
 Tell the people who are currently editing your brain because I saw that move right now.

45:07.280 --> 45:08.280
 Yeah.

45:08.280 --> 45:11.400
 I think you should go find another podcast, right?

45:11.400 --> 45:15.120
 Let's get rid of some of your audience right now.

45:15.120 --> 45:17.800
 Please go find another podcast if you're editing my brain.

45:17.800 --> 45:21.040
 Nevertheless, all the self doubt, they're sitting in that brain.

45:21.040 --> 45:23.520
 I can't stand to watch this, but all right.

45:23.520 --> 45:25.680
 What is the self doubt loop that you're in?

45:25.680 --> 45:34.400
 The thing is, when I walk the halls of MIT, there's bureaucracy, there's administrators

45:34.400 --> 45:37.640
 that never have done anything interesting in their entire lives.

45:37.640 --> 45:41.320
 There's meetings, there's all the usual crap.

45:41.320 --> 45:48.880
 But there's in the eyes of individuals, there's this glow of excitement that has nothing to

45:48.880 --> 45:49.880
 do with career.

45:49.880 --> 45:51.400
 I understand this.

45:51.400 --> 45:52.920
 And it's still a playground.

45:52.920 --> 45:58.280
 There's little pockets of playgrounds from which genius can emerge still.

45:58.280 --> 46:04.520
 And they're unaffected by diversity meetings or fairness meetings or blah, blah, blah.

46:04.520 --> 46:05.520
 I love to hear that.

46:05.520 --> 46:06.520
 Yeah?

46:06.520 --> 46:07.520
 You don't think so?

46:07.520 --> 46:08.520
 No.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.200
 Because I've watched the change, Lex.

46:10.200 --> 46:13.560
 I've watched people, we're all editing ourselves all the time.

46:13.560 --> 46:17.560
 I remember my old mind, I liked it better.

46:17.560 --> 46:24.280
 All of this relentless focus on critical race theory and critical theory, postmodernism,

46:24.280 --> 46:29.800
 fairness, social justice, it's making many of us into worse people.

46:29.800 --> 46:30.800
 You think that's that?

46:30.800 --> 46:35.800
 Do you think the mad daemons of the character is paying attention to any of that?

46:35.800 --> 46:36.800
 You think that has an effect?

46:36.800 --> 46:39.440
 Have you seen what happened to Matt Damon himself?

46:39.440 --> 46:43.240
 Matt Damon has tried to say various things at various times that seem to be relatively

46:43.240 --> 46:44.240
 innocuous.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.240
 He can't speak.

46:45.240 --> 46:46.240
 Okay.

46:46.240 --> 46:48.560
 Well, let's not mix up.

46:48.560 --> 46:49.560
 Matt Damon is just an actor.

46:49.560 --> 46:51.060
 Well, no, no, no.

46:51.060 --> 46:55.920
 He was just a Harvard student who came up with his own genius screenplay, acted and made

46:55.920 --> 46:56.920
 it happen.

46:56.920 --> 46:57.920
 No.

46:57.920 --> 46:59.360
 But we're somewhere else.

46:59.360 --> 47:02.800
 You don't think you can build the rocket company out of MIT still?

47:02.800 --> 47:03.800
 No, I do think.

47:03.800 --> 47:07.400
 I think there are things that you can still do, but we're losing them.

47:07.400 --> 47:08.840
 We lose them.

47:08.840 --> 47:10.720
 We keep losing them.

47:10.720 --> 47:15.160
 I would say the biggest problem here, let me just say, what I think the solution would

47:15.160 --> 47:25.080
 be is to fire anybody who's not faculty, especially young faculty, should have way more power

47:25.080 --> 47:28.000
 and administration should have much less power.

47:28.000 --> 47:34.880
 Because right now, the administration, some of whom used to be faculty, but they've lost

47:34.880 --> 47:40.120
 the fire, the spark that gave them, they've lost the memories of the playground.

47:40.120 --> 47:44.920
 So the people that admire and love the playground, like you could see it in their behavior, should

47:44.920 --> 47:47.000
 have way more power.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.280
 So we should create a systems that give them power.

47:49.280 --> 47:54.800
 Lex, you're very idealistic and you've got a huge heart.

47:54.800 --> 48:02.400
 It's a weird time because I don't want to dissuade you from believing beautiful things

48:02.400 --> 48:04.840
 because I see how potent you are.

48:04.840 --> 48:13.040
 You do all these things, jiu jitsu, guitar, podcasting, programming, computers, et cetera,

48:13.040 --> 48:14.040
 et cetera.

48:14.040 --> 48:15.040
 I don't think you're right.

48:15.040 --> 48:20.360
 I think we're in a really deeply screwed up place where even the tiny number, let me give

48:20.360 --> 48:23.560
 you an alternate version of the dystopia.

48:23.560 --> 48:27.440
 I do think that there are people who are capable and there's still places to play and cause

48:27.440 --> 48:30.680
 things to happen that progress the story forward.

48:30.680 --> 48:36.080
 But if you look at the fire that some of the people are in who fit that profile, like how

48:36.080 --> 48:39.960
 much crap has Elon Musk taken?

48:39.960 --> 48:43.000
 Quite considerable, right?

48:43.000 --> 48:46.520
 And not much admiration from the...

48:46.520 --> 48:51.680
 Craig Venter, Jim Watson.

48:51.680 --> 48:54.880
 These are very difficult people.

48:54.880 --> 48:57.960
 Steve Jobs is a very difficult guy, you know?

48:57.960 --> 49:01.200
 Yeah, it is a bit heartbreaking to me.

49:01.200 --> 49:03.520
 I mean, everybody is different generations.

49:03.520 --> 49:08.400
 I just, my mind is a little focused on Elon Musk because he's the modern person.

49:08.400 --> 49:09.400
 Well, you know him.

49:09.400 --> 49:12.440
 I mean, he's a person to you.

49:12.440 --> 49:21.360
 It hurts my heart to see how few faculty and people with Nobel Prizes and so on admire

49:21.360 --> 49:25.520
 Elon, like how little problem...

49:25.520 --> 49:31.720
 He gets a lot of fans from people that buy his products and young minds just excited.

49:31.720 --> 49:33.640
 But like, why don't we as an institution...

49:33.640 --> 49:38.800
 Why doesn't MIT say that we want to...

49:38.800 --> 49:43.960
 Somebody amongst us will be the next Elon Musk and we want to encourage them.

49:43.960 --> 49:44.960
 Say that.

49:44.960 --> 49:45.960
 Say that in meetings.

49:45.960 --> 49:46.960
 Say that.

49:46.960 --> 49:47.960
 That's success.

49:47.960 --> 49:48.960
 No kidding.

49:48.960 --> 49:51.320
 For us as MIT.

49:51.320 --> 49:54.200
 And they, instead, there's this jealousy.

49:54.200 --> 49:55.200
 It's like...

49:55.200 --> 49:56.200
 Well, here's the crazy...

49:56.200 --> 49:57.200
 Did you hear what Elon Musk tweeted?

49:57.200 --> 49:58.200
 Did you...

49:58.200 --> 49:59.200
 Did you see...

49:59.200 --> 50:00.560
 Like how responsible is what he's doing?

50:00.560 --> 50:01.560
 How...

50:01.560 --> 50:09.160
 Like he's just saying all these things that are just dripping with jealousy and basically...

50:09.160 --> 50:10.160
 I want what he's got.

50:10.160 --> 50:11.160
 Yeah.

50:11.160 --> 50:12.160
 That's the thing, right?

50:12.160 --> 50:13.160
 And if...

50:13.160 --> 50:14.160
 Yeah.

50:14.160 --> 50:15.160
 Here's the weird thing.

50:15.160 --> 50:18.960
 Rivalry has a different signature.

50:18.960 --> 50:26.400
 You see, when you know that you're never going to make it, that's the position you take.

50:26.400 --> 50:29.960
 What is it in Kung Fu Panda, which you've watched now?

50:29.960 --> 50:30.960
 Yes.

50:30.960 --> 50:31.960
 Yes.

50:31.960 --> 50:37.920
 What does Tai Lung say when he's looking for the Dragon Warrior and the Furious Five come

50:37.920 --> 50:41.160
 to defeat him on the bridge?

50:41.160 --> 50:46.320
 One of them gives up Poe's name accidentally and Tai Lung hears it.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.320
 Poe!

50:47.320 --> 50:48.920
 So that is his name.

50:48.920 --> 50:49.920
 Really.

50:49.920 --> 50:50.920
 A worthy opponent.

50:50.920 --> 50:53.520
 Our battle will be legendary, right?

50:53.520 --> 50:55.000
 He's excited.

50:55.000 --> 50:56.000
 Why is that?

50:56.000 --> 50:58.400
 Well, you learn about this in boxing.

50:58.400 --> 51:03.760
 Sometimes you'll see a division or an MMA, which is lousy with talent.

51:03.760 --> 51:09.520
 It's just you can't swing a cat without hitting an amazing athlete.

51:09.520 --> 51:12.920
 Sometimes you'll have a division, which at that particular moment has one star and no

51:12.920 --> 51:16.720
 real competition in that weight class or something.

51:16.720 --> 51:24.880
 That person is in bad shape because you can't build a legend without the other.

51:24.880 --> 51:28.560
 When you think of Muhammad Ali, what are the names that you immediately think of?

51:28.560 --> 51:35.960
 And you have to phrase your, you have to think of the other heavyweights, right?

51:35.960 --> 51:43.920
 So those opponents are in part what made Muhammad Ali Muhammad Ali.

51:43.920 --> 51:53.560
 And that's why the Mayweather, McGregor revelation that, okay, this guy has got his opponents

51:53.560 --> 51:54.920
 picture in his house.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.280
 How weird is that?

51:56.280 --> 51:59.760
 Well, because without the opponent, you may not be able to get there.

51:59.760 --> 52:05.880
 Now, I am not a huge fan of the wrong kinds of rivalries.

52:05.880 --> 52:08.120
 Do you have examples in mind?

52:08.120 --> 52:12.920
 Well, there are rivalries where people take each other's credit and screw each other over.

52:12.920 --> 52:19.160
 And then there are other rivalries like the RNA Tie Club, where these guys were so in

52:19.160 --> 52:22.600
 love with what they were doing that they couldn't wait to share everything.

52:22.600 --> 52:28.560
 And like, Nobel Prizes were so abundant that most people got Nobel Prizes just for being

52:28.560 --> 52:31.240
 a member of the RNA Tie Club and doing cool stuff.

52:31.240 --> 52:39.440
 And yeah, that's the golden kind of sweet spot.

52:39.440 --> 52:43.240
 Most of these people can't do what Elon's doing because they can't break rules.

52:43.240 --> 52:44.240
 They can't take the pressure.

52:44.240 --> 52:48.440
 I'll tell you what really concerns me about your perspective.

52:48.440 --> 52:53.680
 I think that there are a lot of genius ideas inside of people who don't have the stomach

52:53.680 --> 52:55.640
 for conflict and derision.

52:55.640 --> 53:00.160
 And I think a lot of those people are female.

53:00.160 --> 53:05.680
 And I think that until we come up with a world in which we can swat down the trolls, where

53:05.680 --> 53:10.680
 we can actually cause the trolls not to ruin everything.

53:10.680 --> 53:12.760
 And I don't necessarily mean by shutting them up.

53:12.760 --> 53:18.160
 I don't necessarily mean by being brutal to them, but somehow separating off people who

53:18.160 --> 53:21.200
 are working and people who are trolling.

53:21.200 --> 53:29.160
 I think that we're losing a huge amount of human genius in part because women in particular

53:29.160 --> 53:37.040
 are not necessarily going to push an idea if it results in 10 years of being derided.

53:37.040 --> 53:40.040
 Very few men are willing to do that either.

53:40.040 --> 53:45.560
 But there are some of us who are so dumb that we will pigheadedly stick to an idea for 10

53:45.560 --> 53:47.480
 years, even if the world collapses.

53:47.480 --> 53:51.920
 I don't think that there are as many women who are going to make that calculation, even

53:51.920 --> 53:54.000
 if they know the idea is correct.

53:54.000 --> 53:59.040
 And one of the things that I believe technology can help us fight the trolls of all definitions

53:59.040 --> 54:00.040
 of troll.

54:00.040 --> 54:02.720
 I believe that a better Twitter can be built.

54:02.720 --> 54:03.720
 Interesting.

54:03.720 --> 54:05.220
 I do not.

54:05.220 --> 54:10.080
 I don't believe that a Twitter successor can be built that solves most of the problems.

54:10.080 --> 54:14.760
 I think you can always improve what we have, but I don't think that converges in something

54:14.760 --> 54:18.320
 that really works because I think ultimately the problem isn't Twitter, the problem is

54:18.320 --> 54:19.320
 us.

54:19.320 --> 54:28.120
 For example, I've recently made a very disturbing realization, which is academics and trolls

54:28.120 --> 54:30.360
 have very many similar behaviors.

54:30.360 --> 54:31.860
 Absolutely.

54:31.860 --> 54:34.080
 It's largely a trolling community.

54:34.080 --> 54:42.280
 I tend to believe that the trolls are not, it's like the Peter Thiel mini mind idea,

54:42.280 --> 54:47.920
 which in all of the trolls, there's the possibility of goodness.

54:47.920 --> 54:52.360
 And all you have to do, not all you have to do, what you have to do is create technology

54:52.360 --> 55:03.160
 that incentivizes them to embrace, to discover, to embrace, to practice the better angels

55:03.160 --> 55:04.400
 of their nature.

55:04.400 --> 55:10.160
 And I believe that people actually want to do that.

55:10.160 --> 55:19.480
 The trolls is a short term dopamine rush of childish toxicity that all of us want to

55:19.480 --> 55:20.480
 overcome.

55:20.480 --> 55:24.200
 We believe that deep within, we want to overcome that.

55:24.200 --> 55:29.440
 I try to keep myself from believing what you believe.

55:29.440 --> 55:31.080
 Because you'd be disappointed if it's not true.

55:31.080 --> 55:35.280
 Because it's dangerous because a lot of these people are implacable foes and there aren't

55:35.280 --> 55:36.280
 many of them.

55:36.280 --> 55:39.920
 But when you meet somebody, it's like, yeah, I just like screwing people up.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.720
 I'm here for the pain.

55:42.720 --> 55:44.640
 I just believe even in them, there's a good...

55:44.640 --> 55:49.360
 There's a wonderful book that I'm going to recommend to you where I hope this comes from.

55:49.360 --> 55:54.480
 Maybe I've got the source wrong, but in any event, it's a great book called Maximum City

55:54.480 --> 55:57.000
 about Bombay.

55:57.000 --> 56:03.960
 And I believe the conceit is that the author leaves Bombay as a kid and comes back as an

56:03.960 --> 56:04.960
 adult.

56:04.960 --> 56:09.480
 And he realizes he has to rediscover the city because he can't live in the city he left.

56:09.480 --> 56:13.560
 So he gets in contact with all of the weird areas of the city.

56:13.560 --> 56:16.600
 And one of them is the underworld, hangs out with the police.

56:16.600 --> 56:20.440
 But in the underworld, he's talking to contract killers.

56:20.440 --> 56:22.840
 And he says, you know, it's really weird.

56:22.840 --> 56:26.800
 Everybody pleads for their life right before I kill them.

56:26.800 --> 56:31.760
 And they always say this thing about, I've got two kids at home.

56:31.760 --> 56:36.200
 He says, never say that to a contract killer because we have terrible relationships with

56:36.200 --> 56:37.200
 our parents.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.200
 Doesn't it dearest you?

56:39.200 --> 56:41.680
 And I was just thinking, oh, wow.

56:41.680 --> 56:44.160
 So there's a minus sign in front of that statement.

56:44.160 --> 56:46.480
 You're sitting there saying, you know, I've got a three year old.

56:46.480 --> 56:51.600
 It's like, OK, well, I'm going to take this POS out of that kid's life.

56:51.600 --> 56:53.320
 Maybe I'll have a chance.

56:53.320 --> 56:56.600
 You don't know how people are wired.

56:56.600 --> 57:01.720
 And as much as I hate to say it, there are people whose wiring is so disturbing and so

57:01.720 --> 57:08.240
 different from yours that you will never guess why you can't reach them or how much pleasure

57:08.240 --> 57:12.080
 they may have gotten because they may have gone over a point of no return.

57:12.080 --> 57:19.120
 Nevertheless, you are just a smart guy who is using his intuition to make a hypothesis.

57:19.120 --> 57:21.080
 You do not know this for sure.

57:21.080 --> 57:22.080
 No.

57:22.080 --> 57:31.080
 And I am a, you know, whatever the hell I am that has a different hypothesis that even

57:31.080 --> 57:38.000
 in the darkest human beings that seem to be only full of evil, there's a good person there

57:38.000 --> 57:39.520
 that could be discovered.

57:39.520 --> 57:48.240
 One of the reasons I love doing your show is that you have these beliefs even as a Russian.

57:48.240 --> 57:49.560
 The Russian special.

57:49.560 --> 57:55.440
 As you know, the Russian, there is a weirdness, which is a total cynicism and total idealism

57:55.440 --> 57:57.040
 locks together, right?

57:57.040 --> 58:00.800
 That's very much part of the Russian character.

58:00.800 --> 58:04.280
 The reason I was kept bothering you, kept bothering you to have this conversation is

58:04.280 --> 58:08.640
 I'm really worried about the next couple of months.

58:08.640 --> 58:10.920
 No kidding.

58:10.920 --> 58:20.960
 And if there's anybody in this world that could help alleviate my worry by at least

58:20.960 --> 58:26.240
 walking along with me through this worry of mine, it's you.

58:26.240 --> 58:32.480
 Do you think we're headed towards some kind of civil war, some kind of division that explodes

58:32.480 --> 58:40.200
 beyond just stuff on Twitter, but something that's really destructive to the fabric of

58:40.200 --> 58:41.200
 our society?

58:41.200 --> 58:47.040
 Well, I believe we're in a revolution, as you know, I've called it the no name revolution

58:47.040 --> 58:48.480
 or N squared revolution.

58:48.480 --> 58:51.520
 I've been talking about it for years.

58:51.520 --> 58:58.600
 I don't think, I think waiting for this to be called a civil war is not smart.

58:58.600 --> 59:00.280
 Only history will call it such.

59:00.280 --> 59:01.280
 Fine.

59:01.280 --> 59:04.320
 The thing that the problem is is that you're encountering things that you've never seen

59:04.320 --> 59:08.800
 trying to fit them into things that you already know, right?

59:08.800 --> 59:10.800
 But history repeats itself.

59:10.800 --> 59:11.800
 Yes.

59:11.800 --> 59:12.800
 Ish.

59:12.800 --> 59:15.720
 You don't see lessons from history.

59:15.720 --> 59:16.720
 I do.

59:16.720 --> 59:17.720
 We see today.

59:17.720 --> 59:19.200
 But I don't see it repeating itself.

59:19.200 --> 59:20.200
 What about violence?

59:20.200 --> 59:22.160
 The famous quote is that it rhymes.

59:22.160 --> 59:23.160
 It rhymes.

59:23.160 --> 59:29.800
 I mean, the thing I guess I'm speaking to is violence and we're in there.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.920
 The abstraction of violence.

59:31.920 --> 59:38.400
 Imagine you were coding up violence as an abstract class, okay?

59:38.400 --> 59:40.800
 Thank you for speaking to the audience.

59:40.800 --> 59:42.320
 Trying to lose these people.

59:42.320 --> 59:43.320
 Come with me.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.320
 Go on.

59:44.320 --> 59:47.320
 No, no, no.

59:47.320 --> 59:51.720
 I've dealt with your audience and your audience contains the smartest people around.

59:51.720 --> 59:55.880
 I guarantee you if I say some stuff, first of all, any wrong thing that I'll say, they're

59:55.880 --> 1:00:00.520
 in the detail, so that'll be a little bit of catnip to bring in the smart people.

1:00:00.520 --> 1:00:02.160
 But they'll also digest it for each other.

1:00:02.160 --> 1:00:05.160
 It's one of the great lessons of long form podcasting.

1:00:05.160 --> 1:00:09.160
 If you don't waste all your time explaining things, that's the job of the audience to

1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:14.520
 do amongst themselves, they're happy doing the work and those who aren't, they leave.

1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:15.520
 Isn't that great?

1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:16.520
 They'll leave.

1:00:16.520 --> 1:00:20.200
 The people who don't want to struggle will leave and you can get rid of them.

1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:28.640
 I think that the point is you would want to say violence is defined relative to a context.

1:00:28.640 --> 1:00:32.400
 Let's call it meta violence so that we don't get into the problem.

1:00:32.400 --> 1:00:34.760
 We already have a term for physical violence.

1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:37.440
 We have meta violence and physical violence.

1:00:37.440 --> 1:00:40.760
 I would say that physical violence is subclassed from meta violence.

1:00:40.760 --> 1:00:44.000
 Meta violence is the disruption of a system.

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:53.040
 For example, if a cell dies, you can die through apoptosis or necrosis.

1:00:53.040 --> 1:00:56.920
 Apoptosis is controlled, programmed cell death.

1:00:56.920 --> 1:01:00.040
 Necrosis is just like, okay, this didn't work.

1:01:00.040 --> 1:01:02.400
 That was a violent disruption of the system.

1:01:02.400 --> 1:01:05.800
 This meta class is presumed in the documentation.

1:01:05.800 --> 1:01:07.240
 Is it all negative?

1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:08.240
 No.

1:01:08.240 --> 1:01:11.040
 What are you talking about?

1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:18.560
 This is part of the problem in the madness of our age, which is if you open up a drawer

1:01:18.560 --> 1:01:26.160
 in your cabinet, in your kitchen, and you see knives, spoons, and forks, do you have

1:01:26.160 --> 1:01:30.760
 a sense that the spoons are good utensils and the knives or forks are bad utensils because

1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:32.800
 they're mean?

1:01:32.800 --> 1:01:39.160
 If you start thinking in these terms, that knife is there to do violence.

1:01:39.160 --> 1:01:43.120
 That's violence you want done.

1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:46.560
 When I cut a mango, I'm doing violence to the mango.

1:01:46.560 --> 1:01:50.320
 The mango expects that I will do violence to it because otherwise I won't be able to

1:01:50.320 --> 1:01:57.480
 get the meat and it won't get its seed spread somewhere else.

1:01:57.480 --> 1:02:02.000
 In part, violence is absolutely part of our story.

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:05.880
 There's this meta violence class.

1:02:05.880 --> 1:02:10.240
 The meta violence class is already, it's a multiple inheritance pattern.

1:02:10.240 --> 1:02:12.960
 Whatever's going on right now inherits from meta violence.

1:02:12.960 --> 1:02:22.240
 No, but there's certain subclasses that allow evil to emerge.

1:02:22.240 --> 1:02:25.320
 What I'm specifically worried about is that the fact...

1:02:25.320 --> 1:02:26.480
 What's on your mind, Lex?

1:02:26.480 --> 1:02:29.480
 What's really going on?

1:02:29.480 --> 1:02:42.440
 I worry that amidst the chaos of these protests or the chaos that could be created by the

1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:49.560
 feeling that the election does not represent the voice of the people, saying that whoever

1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:55.320
 gets, quote unquote, wins the election according to some kind of reporting of the numbers

1:02:55.320 --> 1:03:03.400
 that come out that's not going to represent what people actually want to be the leader.

1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:10.000
 Something in that narrative will create so much division that people will resort to literal

1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:14.520
 violence, protests that really...

1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:18.720
 That the United States loses its united aspect.

1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:24.720
 Because of that, because of that chaos and tension, evil people, evil forces, that my

1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:33.440
 definition of evil is just cruel human beings use that moment to attain power, the kind

1:03:33.440 --> 1:03:39.320
 of power that ultimately goes against the ideal of the United States.

1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:40.840
 That could be Donald Trump.

1:03:40.840 --> 1:03:42.520
 That could be another human being.

1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:44.800
 It doesn't really matter.

1:03:44.800 --> 1:03:50.400
 My worry is that love doesn't win out in this, the unity doesn't win out in this.

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:59.520
 I feel like you and I have a responsibility, it's small.

1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:05.040
 How do we let love win in this moment of potential chaos?

1:04:05.040 --> 1:04:07.560
 We're going to have to fight for it.

1:04:07.560 --> 1:04:09.920
 You're going to have to become a fighter.

1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:13.880
 You're going to have to throw some serious punches if that's what you want.

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:20.680
 You have to be Muhammad Ali here because the moment you start criticizing anything,

1:04:20.680 --> 1:04:23.440
 you have to be a masterful communicator because...

1:04:23.440 --> 1:04:25.160
 That's why you're here.

1:04:25.160 --> 1:04:35.080
 Look, Lex, in part, your decency is allowing you to do things that you couldn't otherwise

1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:36.080
 do.

1:04:36.080 --> 1:04:39.920
 I saw that you had Michael Malis on your podcast.

1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:47.440
 Michael Malis is, I think, of somebody who at his best is extremely shrewd and insightful.

1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:49.440
 Yes?

1:04:49.440 --> 1:04:53.280
 He's also got this trolling game, which he's quite open about and you talk to him about

1:04:53.280 --> 1:04:56.240
 it, which I can't stand.

1:04:56.240 --> 1:04:57.240
 This is the idea.

1:04:57.240 --> 1:04:58.240
 Oh, grandpa doesn't get the internet.

1:04:58.240 --> 1:04:59.240
 Well, I'm grandpa.

1:04:59.240 --> 1:05:00.240
 I don't get the internet.

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:02.040
 I don't love the trolling.

1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:07.680
 There are trolls of the past who were incredibly good.

1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:12.920
 I don't see any of the modern trolls as being that kind of genius level trolling the people

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:16.760
 who deserve it in the way that they deserve it.

1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:20.840
 Right now, what I see is that anything that stands up gets cut down.

1:05:20.840 --> 1:05:22.320
 It's like anything earnest.

1:05:22.320 --> 1:05:26.320
 You have to turn into cynicism and a meme.

1:05:26.320 --> 1:05:30.880
 It's this idea that the people who believe that the world is chaos and has no point are

1:05:30.880 --> 1:05:36.760
 constantly trying to let you know, don't try to use the internet for meaning, for decency,

1:05:36.760 --> 1:05:41.840
 for goodness, because we are going to find out that that's all sanctimonious hypocrisy

1:05:41.840 --> 1:05:44.960
 and we will make you suffer.

1:05:44.960 --> 1:05:48.480
 I do think that there's a lot of sanctimonious hypocrisy in the world.

1:05:48.480 --> 1:05:53.320
 Some of it mine, some of it yours, but we all have it.

1:05:53.320 --> 1:05:58.600
 The trolls somewhat remove that, but it's not a judicious, kind, constructive, compassionate,

1:05:58.600 --> 1:06:00.480
 caring version most of the time.

1:06:00.480 --> 1:06:03.640
 A lot of those trolls, and I have this feeling about Michael Malis.

1:06:03.640 --> 1:06:08.160
 I don't know whether it's right, that there's somebody who deeply cares and loves beneath

1:06:08.160 --> 1:06:12.960
 it, and that that's motivating some of the trolling behavior, and you and I don't seem

1:06:12.960 --> 1:06:13.960
 to be doing that.

1:06:13.960 --> 1:06:16.200
 I don't see you as almost ever trolling.

1:06:16.200 --> 1:06:19.720
 You and I, I'm very much against trolling.

1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:21.360
 I'm very much against trolling.

1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:27.520
 It doesn't mean that it's selective, you know, I'm not even, it's not even true.

1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:31.280
 Everything we say, we say like, I'm for it, I'm against it.

1:06:31.280 --> 1:06:33.000
 This isn't my native language.

1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:34.000
 I speak nuance.

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:38.160
 I don't speak this internet shit.

1:06:38.160 --> 1:06:43.440
 And the more I have to communicate through internet shit, right, I almost never take

1:06:43.440 --> 1:06:51.320
 a tweet seriously if it contains the letters LMAO, LOL, RTFL, you know, FOL.

1:06:51.320 --> 1:06:57.000
 There's an interesting effect where people say stuff and then finish it with LOL.

1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.400
 You put it beautifully that it indicates to me that this is a person, we've talked about

1:07:01.400 --> 1:07:06.960
 like why we're the stupid suit, is like this is anti, this is to fight the LOL at the end

1:07:06.960 --> 1:07:12.120
 of sentences is take, like stand up for the words you're saying.

1:07:12.120 --> 1:07:17.760
 Don't finish stuff with LOL, removing completely the responsibility of the content of the sentence

1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:19.120
 that preceded it.

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:20.120
 Yeah.

1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:24.720
 Also, choosing the outfit that worked both for Men in Black and the Blues Brothers, not

1:07:24.720 --> 1:07:25.720
 a terrible choice.

1:07:25.720 --> 1:07:31.280
 Okay, but getting back, look, Lex, we're not in a position to do this.

1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:35.640
 You need to be seated in a different chair.

1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:37.160
 Your chair is the wrong chair.

1:07:37.160 --> 1:07:39.200
 You're in the wrong chair.

1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:46.760
 It's been so long, I want to talk about you and Joe Biden.

1:07:46.760 --> 1:07:54.080
 Joe Biden was a 29 year old guy with nothing particular going on so far as I can tell.

1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:55.720
 Okay.

1:07:55.720 --> 1:08:04.480
 I know people as impressive at age 29 as Joe Biden, 12 rows back, 3D, doesn't matter.

1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:06.040
 Huge number of people.

1:08:06.040 --> 1:08:08.840
 None of them, my age, can get to where he got to.

1:08:08.840 --> 1:08:12.520
 It's like we're all morons.

1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:19.520
 Anytime somebody takes out, like if you found Eddie Van Halen in a guitar shop, you'd be

1:08:19.520 --> 1:08:21.040
 angry.

1:08:21.040 --> 1:08:25.640
 What is this guy doing repairing guitars?

1:08:25.640 --> 1:08:28.200
 And somebody will say, maybe he loves to repair guitars.

1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:29.200
 Yeah.

1:08:29.200 --> 1:08:32.360
 I mean, what is your Russian piano tuner doing?

1:08:32.360 --> 1:08:33.920
 What is my Russian piano tuner?

1:08:33.920 --> 1:08:40.600
 That was the whole point of that story, which is what is it that happened in that life that

1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:41.800
 converted somebody?

1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:49.640
 I find this, for example, with Russian doctors who are technicians and offices now.

1:08:49.640 --> 1:08:56.840
 There's a huge amount of talent in the world that's not sitting in its proper seat.

1:08:56.840 --> 1:09:01.160
 And quite honestly, I've gotten to the point where my feeling is we've got to take the

1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:06.000
 seats.

1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:07.000
 Maybe we don't sit in them.

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:11.320
 Maybe the idea is that we take the seats and we put some smart Gen Z person in the seat

1:09:11.320 --> 1:09:14.640
 and say, look, no chanting.

1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:17.480
 I don't want to hear you say, no justice, no peace.

1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:22.000
 If there aren't verbs, if it rhymes, it's wrong.

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:26.480
 Like I used to have this thing, if it rhymes, things that rhyme are more true.

1:09:26.480 --> 1:09:30.760
 But in general, if something starts at one, two, three, four, I don't want to hear what

1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:34.680
 the rest of your sentence is.

1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:42.360
 But I feel like the responsibility that you carry that I carry, this is where Joe Rogan

1:09:42.360 --> 1:09:46.080
 generally removes himself from being, I'm just a comedian.

1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:49.640
 This idea of I'm just a comedian, I'll do that.

1:09:49.640 --> 1:10:01.440
 But at this moment in history, history literally can pivot on the words of a tattooed, ripped,

1:10:01.440 --> 1:10:04.440
 50 year old comedian.

1:10:04.440 --> 1:10:06.640
 And I think the same is true with you.

1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:07.640
 Okay.

1:10:07.640 --> 1:10:10.480
 Well, I'm interested and I care.

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:15.960
 Speaking of lyrics, there are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.

1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:18.440
 That's not us.

1:10:18.440 --> 1:10:19.520
 The hour is getting late.

1:10:19.520 --> 1:10:20.920
 That's not us.

1:10:20.920 --> 1:10:25.720
 In the song, the joker and the thief are on opposite sides of Jesus having this conversation

1:10:25.720 --> 1:10:27.920
 over Jesus.

1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:29.080
 You and I, we've been through that.

1:10:29.080 --> 1:10:30.080
 That's not our fate.

1:10:30.080 --> 1:10:33.560
 That's somebody else's fate to throw spitballs at the internet.

1:10:33.560 --> 1:10:34.680
 That's not your fate.

1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:35.920
 You're in earnest guy.

1:10:35.920 --> 1:10:36.920
 You're filled with love.

1:10:36.920 --> 1:10:38.640
 You're getting the most amazing podcast.

1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:39.640
 Yes.

1:10:39.640 --> 1:10:40.800
 But you can win over the internet.

1:10:40.800 --> 1:10:45.040
 This is the point I'm trying to make that you're saying, I'm just a grandpa, I don't

1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:46.040
 know.

1:10:46.040 --> 1:10:49.320
 I'm telling you, you're going to get bigger and then you're going to get cut down.

1:10:49.320 --> 1:10:52.120
 You're going to keep ascending for a while, Lex.

1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:55.960
 And then you're saying, naturally, there's, I'm telling you, I watched the same process.

1:10:55.960 --> 1:10:58.040
 People get up to a certain level.

1:10:58.040 --> 1:11:02.520
 And one of the things that's going on in my opinion with Joe Rogan is that when Joe Rogan

1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:08.440
 starts to talk about his misgivings about Joe Biden, you know, in a way that you find

1:11:08.440 --> 1:11:15.000
 it any bar in America about cognitive decline in a 77 year old who's about to be 78.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.960
 I believe in November.

1:11:17.960 --> 1:11:24.600
 We have never had anything remotely as insane as a 78 year old person slated to win the

1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:25.600
 White House.

1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:31.000
 And you're saying when that idea is being communicated, is there something about the

1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.560
 disc concept that you talk about, the system naturally starts to...

1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:38.600
 Some bad thing happens to Joe or one of Joe's close associates.

1:11:38.600 --> 1:11:45.160
 The ability to destroy people who become inconvenient has been documented.

1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:47.360
 This is what we have done in the past.

1:11:47.360 --> 1:11:52.240
 Whether we are doing it now, we don't know because we are not doing this church committee

1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:53.240
 too.

1:11:53.240 --> 1:11:57.680
 In order to know whether or not you are currently destroying American citizens as we did in

1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:04.040
 the past and as we have documented, as we found out in 1976, the federal government

1:12:04.040 --> 1:12:11.600
 destroyed Americans who had political beliefs that the government didn't want to continue.

1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:15.080
 And I don't know whether you are grasping that.

1:12:15.080 --> 1:12:21.720
 One interpretation of why John Stuart and why Joe Rogan and why Bill Maher, all these

1:12:21.720 --> 1:12:25.120
 people to some extent hide behind, it's a joke.

1:12:25.120 --> 1:12:29.320
 It's because they're trying to find a protected class.

1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:34.460
 Is there some place I can stand and speak the truth, which does not result in my being

1:12:34.460 --> 1:12:35.960
 garbage collected?

1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:36.960
 Interesting.

1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:38.480
 I guess you're right.

1:12:38.480 --> 1:12:43.400
 My intuition is you can stand as you gain more power.

1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:46.760
 You can stand behind your work for the better.

1:12:46.760 --> 1:12:49.120
 There's a fight over Joe Rogan right now.

1:12:49.120 --> 1:12:53.000
 I mean, I've talked about it for a few years now.

1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.760
 People did not understand how big that program was.

1:12:55.760 --> 1:12:57.560
 People didn't understand long form podcasting.

1:12:57.560 --> 1:13:05.640
 I was derided by people who I think of as being very shrewd for believing in these podcasts

1:13:05.640 --> 1:13:07.480
 as a major force.

1:13:07.480 --> 1:13:11.520
 And most of the people who derided me have said, wow, did I not get things?

1:13:11.520 --> 1:13:19.320
 It's like if you started to propose, you wanted to do the Sopranos in the era of 30

1:13:19.320 --> 1:13:22.880
 minute sitcoms, it's like, you don't get it, man.

1:13:22.880 --> 1:13:26.040
 The American people, they're not interested in these long plot storylines.

1:13:26.040 --> 1:13:27.540
 That's your weird thing.

1:13:27.540 --> 1:13:29.240
 Nobody cares, dude.

1:13:29.240 --> 1:13:32.200
 Everybody just wants short, fast, memorable.

1:13:32.200 --> 1:13:35.880
 And like, okay, so if you do that, you totally miss the opportunity.

1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:40.880
 The savvy people used to say, kid, let me tell you, nobody ever lost a dime underestimating

1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:42.760
 the intelligence of the American people.

1:13:42.760 --> 1:13:46.880
 Well, that was totally wrong because they didn't calculate opportunity costs.

1:13:46.880 --> 1:13:51.600
 I have been talking about the problem of Joe for a long time.

1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:56.600
 The problem is, is that when the system wakes up, they're going to want to control it.

1:13:56.600 --> 1:13:59.880
 And they come up with new different mechanisms of doing that.

1:13:59.880 --> 1:14:02.840
 I guess one interesting one is cancel culture.

1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:07.440
 Well, look at the number of people around Joe who they've come after since they've realized

1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:09.560
 that Joe is really big.

1:14:09.560 --> 1:14:17.520
 Joey Diaz, Brian Callan, Crystalia.

1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:28.360
 Now, I'm not saying that those are all related, but I do notice that there are at least correlations

1:14:28.360 --> 1:14:33.400
 between when Joe says something, when something bad happens in Joe's universe.

1:14:33.400 --> 1:14:40.400
 It's easier for me to believe that that's happening when it's happening around Joe himself.

1:14:40.400 --> 1:14:43.000
 But I'm worried about my friend.

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:48.960
 And I don't necessarily want to push him towards being more if he doesn't want it.

1:14:48.960 --> 1:14:51.800
 Because I don't want to conscript people.

1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:52.800
 He's got a great life.

1:14:52.800 --> 1:14:53.960
 He's got a great situation.

1:14:53.960 --> 1:14:55.640
 He's done a huge service.

1:14:55.640 --> 1:14:56.640
 Thank God.

1:14:56.640 --> 1:15:02.480
 Do you know how much do I owe Joe just for what he's done for you to say nothing of what

1:15:02.480 --> 1:15:07.120
 he's done for me or for Brett or for Sam or any of these people?

1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:10.960
 And I'd like to think that we all try to give back.

1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:13.900
 But I'm worried about Joe.

1:15:13.900 --> 1:15:15.400
 He's not worried.

1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:21.640
 One of the inspiring things about Joe is, I mean, he's in this war alone.

1:15:21.640 --> 1:15:25.640
 And the way he fights the war is by just enjoying life.

1:15:25.640 --> 1:15:26.640
 Well, that's his thing.

1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:30.600
 As long as he stays close to things that he loves and being, you know, one of the things

1:15:30.600 --> 1:15:32.800
 is he's honest about his drug use.

1:15:32.800 --> 1:15:34.800
 He loves to hunt.

1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:40.360
 So he does a certain amount of like semi vice signaling up front.

1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:41.520
 And then you just also know him.

1:15:41.520 --> 1:15:48.240
 This is why every time they try to take him down, you use the N word, you know, like unfortunately,

1:15:48.240 --> 1:15:51.160
 everybody knows who Joe is.

1:15:51.160 --> 1:15:58.480
 And yes, he doesn't act as if he went to a fancy finishing school, right?

1:15:58.480 --> 1:16:00.080
 That's not his energy.

1:16:00.080 --> 1:16:04.320
 The fact that you've got some super smart guy who always pretends to be a meathead,

1:16:04.320 --> 1:16:08.320
 just like, you know, hey, I'm a comedian, like all these defenses and disguises.

1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:09.320
 Okay.

1:16:09.320 --> 1:16:16.200
 He's a super smart guy who he's admitted to most of the things that, you know, you can

1:16:16.200 --> 1:16:20.760
 take him down for him because everybody's been effectively in his den or his basement.

1:16:20.760 --> 1:16:23.200
 Think about that studio as his basement.

1:16:23.200 --> 1:16:26.600
 People have hung out with Joe so many hours that you can't tell them something about Joe

1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:30.200
 or they're going to say, wow, I'm going to believe the New York Times and not the hundreds

1:16:30.200 --> 1:16:32.160
 of hours I've spent on the Joe Rogan experience.

1:16:32.160 --> 1:16:37.000
 But the cool thing is that this is what inspires me is that the way he's waging war against

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:45.080
 the system is just by being a good person and talking enough hours in a week where that

1:16:45.080 --> 1:16:50.000
 message like bleeds throughout the words and the gaps between.

1:16:50.000 --> 1:16:55.160
 And that, that's so inspiring to me that the good people can win by just being good.

1:16:55.160 --> 1:17:00.520
 And he's kind and he's tough and he also, he's no pushover.

1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:01.520
 No.

1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:06.960
 I always worry a little bit when I sit down in my chair, you still get scared that he

1:17:06.960 --> 1:17:10.600
 will call you on some kind of bullshit that you weren't even aware of.

1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:15.120
 The first time I was on the show, the energy wasn't great between us and it was in a sober

1:17:15.120 --> 1:17:16.520
 October situation.

1:17:16.520 --> 1:17:22.920
 So I think I hadn't understood that and maybe our egos got a little bit off.

1:17:22.920 --> 1:17:23.920
 I don't know.

1:17:23.920 --> 1:17:28.880
 I mean, I was having fun, but maybe it was just too complicated life forms getting to

1:17:28.880 --> 1:17:29.880
 know each other.

1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:37.680
 The first one was probably, yeah, that made me a little nervous for the future.

1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:42.360
 But then, you know, Joe and I become friends, although sometimes we have miscommunications

1:17:42.360 --> 1:17:49.240
 like on Yom Kippur, I texted him and I said, Joe, you know, I want to apologize for ways

1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:53.120
 of let you down as a friend that haven't been there for you and appreciate everything you've

1:17:53.120 --> 1:17:54.120
 done for me.

1:17:54.120 --> 1:17:58.240
 I was like, like, I get this text back and like, what the fuck is your problem?

1:17:58.240 --> 1:17:59.960
 You're great, dude.

1:17:59.960 --> 1:18:02.440
 I don't know what bad place you're in, but cheer up.

1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:07.720
 I was like, Joe, are there any Jews in your life that apologize for what they've done?

1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:11.680
 He was just like, dude, if you lost your mind, what the hell's gotten into you?

1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:12.680
 Yeah.

1:18:12.680 --> 1:18:17.840
 What do you think about the Spotify thing?

1:18:17.840 --> 1:18:18.840
 What about it?

1:18:18.840 --> 1:18:19.840
 Ask me a question.

1:18:19.840 --> 1:18:26.080
 He's now, as opposed to being just a comedian with a podcast, he now is just a comedian

1:18:26.080 --> 1:18:31.720
 with a podcast who stepped like in the middle of the center of cancel culture, which is

1:18:31.720 --> 1:18:37.200
 like, I know Spotify is in Sweden, but they represent Silicon Valley.

1:18:37.200 --> 1:18:43.560
 They represent the very kind of structures they contain and represent the kind of structures

1:18:43.560 --> 1:18:48.720
 that threaten to destroy the elons of the world.

1:18:48.720 --> 1:18:55.840
 And he just like stepped like with his Alex Jones and his Joe idea has just strolled right

1:18:55.840 --> 1:18:56.840
 into the middle of it.

1:18:56.840 --> 1:18:57.840
 Yeah.

1:18:57.840 --> 1:18:58.840
 I think it's awesome.

1:18:58.840 --> 1:19:00.040
 I love it.

1:19:00.040 --> 1:19:05.400
 But do you think he's strong enough to, I don't know, I mean, I don't even know the

1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:09.120
 right way to ask this, but is he strong enough to persevere?

1:19:09.120 --> 1:19:10.120
 It's a bit interesting.

1:19:10.120 --> 1:19:15.160
 It's like when Alliance decides, wow, that honey badger looks tasty, I'm going to swallow

1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:16.160
 it whole.

1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:17.160
 See what happens.

1:19:17.160 --> 1:19:19.280
 Because I talked to him offline.

1:19:19.280 --> 1:19:23.640
 He really seems to be willing to give away the hundred million, which gives him so much

1:19:23.640 --> 1:19:24.640
 power.

1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:33.480
 Oh, I don't, it's a powerful thing to be able to say, I don't, yeah, to the honey badger.

1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:36.400
 He just strolls in, but he's willing to walk away from anything in this.

1:19:36.400 --> 1:19:38.640
 Well, he's going to walk out the other side of the line.

1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.640
 I don't think he's going to go out the way he came in.

1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:41.640
 Yeah.

1:19:41.640 --> 1:19:42.640
 Well, you know what it is?

1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:45.800
 It's Tommy Lee Jones entering the bug.

1:19:45.800 --> 1:19:48.080
 This is like a giant alien who just walks into it.

1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:52.000
 He just, he gets swallowed by the bug and he blasts out from the inside.

1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:53.680
 I have it as Tommy Lee Jones.

1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:54.680
 Yeah.

1:19:54.680 --> 1:19:55.680
 That's Joe Rogan to you.

1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:56.680
 Yeah.

1:19:56.680 --> 1:19:59.560
 Is that my feeling is, is that Spotify doesn't understand what they're messing with.

1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:01.720
 I could be wrong, but I'm not.

1:20:01.720 --> 1:20:02.720
 No, you're right.

1:20:02.720 --> 1:20:03.720
 I'm right.

1:20:03.720 --> 1:20:07.000
 Because Joe doesn't need anything, man.

1:20:07.000 --> 1:20:08.760
 I mean, this is the weird thing about it.

1:20:08.760 --> 1:20:11.360
 It's like, I'm sure that he loves all his toys, whatever, blah, blah, blah.

1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:12.360
 He's a rich guy.

1:20:12.360 --> 1:20:13.360
 Yes.

1:20:13.360 --> 1:20:14.360
 He's got a few money.

1:20:14.360 --> 1:20:17.040
 He had a few money a long time ago.

1:20:17.040 --> 1:20:22.640
 And you're not, you know, the other thing about it's a bit weird being friends with

1:20:22.640 --> 1:20:23.640
 a dude like that.

1:20:23.640 --> 1:20:28.120
 It just is because like you call him up or he'll call you up and he's like, what's

1:20:28.120 --> 1:20:29.120
 going on in your life?

1:20:29.120 --> 1:20:30.120
 I don't know.

1:20:30.120 --> 1:20:32.000
 Kind of depressed, trying to get some math done.

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:33.000
 What are you up?

1:20:33.000 --> 1:20:34.720
 Oh, dude, I can cheer you up.

1:20:34.720 --> 1:20:37.600
 I just came off of a 29,000 person stadium.

1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:40.080
 It's like, oh, cool.

1:20:40.080 --> 1:20:41.080
 How'd you do that?

1:20:41.080 --> 1:20:42.080
 Oh, I don't know.

1:20:42.080 --> 1:20:46.960
 I was on Instagram a few days ago and it's filled up just like, oh, damn.

1:20:46.960 --> 1:20:47.960
 Yeah.

1:20:47.960 --> 1:20:48.960
 I mean, that thing is powerful.

1:20:48.960 --> 1:20:49.960
 So much love in that guy.

1:20:49.960 --> 1:20:50.960
 That thing is so powerful.

1:20:50.960 --> 1:20:51.960
 Yeah.

1:20:51.960 --> 1:20:52.960
 So there you go.

1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:54.440
 I mean, you could be that too.

1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:58.480
 The instant Joe takes an interest in politics and saving the world.

1:20:58.480 --> 1:20:59.920
 You might destroy all that.

1:20:59.920 --> 1:21:01.320
 It's going bye bye.

1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:02.320
 I promise.

1:21:02.320 --> 1:21:03.320
 I just disagree with you.

1:21:03.320 --> 1:21:04.320
 Okay.

1:21:04.320 --> 1:21:07.720
 I mean, because you have to do it like you've said this many times before.

1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:08.720
 I'll bet you.

1:21:08.720 --> 1:21:09.720
 Yeah.

1:21:09.720 --> 1:21:15.840
 You have a bottle of Stoli that you can get, if you get Joe Rogan to get highly politically

1:21:15.840 --> 1:21:19.920
 active and call out the system for all the bullshit that it is in a very pointed and

1:21:19.920 --> 1:21:23.640
 determined fashion.

1:21:23.640 --> 1:21:24.640
 And he doesn't get destroyed.

1:21:24.640 --> 1:21:25.640
 I'll give you.

1:21:25.640 --> 1:21:26.640
 I'll give you the vodka.

1:21:26.640 --> 1:21:27.640
 The vodka?

1:21:27.640 --> 1:21:28.640
 Yeah.

1:21:28.640 --> 1:21:29.640
 That sounds like a pretty damn good deal.

1:21:29.640 --> 1:21:30.640
 Yeah.

1:21:30.640 --> 1:21:31.640
 But you've said this.

1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:35.360
 I mean, no living heroes, my friend.

1:21:35.360 --> 1:21:36.600
 No living heroes.

1:21:36.600 --> 1:21:37.760
 I just.

1:21:37.760 --> 1:21:39.560
 No living heroes.

1:21:39.560 --> 1:21:40.560
 It's just difficult.

1:21:40.560 --> 1:21:42.280
 You just have to be good at it.

1:21:42.280 --> 1:21:48.160
 I mean, if you just say generic political things, no, no, you're going to be taken down.

1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:54.240
 But the more heroic you are with it, the more beautiful you are, the more you will be made

1:21:54.240 --> 1:21:56.640
 to suffer if they cannot get you on reputation.

1:21:56.640 --> 1:22:01.840
 If Jesus himself came down, I don't know if I ever read, I probably have never read to

1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:04.640
 you the hit piece I did on Jesus.

1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:05.640
 You don't know about this?

1:22:05.640 --> 1:22:06.640
 No, I did not know.

1:22:06.640 --> 1:22:09.840
 I did hit pieces on all of the best people in the world.

1:22:09.840 --> 1:22:10.840
 Wow.

1:22:10.840 --> 1:22:16.840
 So whoever it was who cured cancer, you know, discovered new particles or whatever it is,

1:22:16.840 --> 1:22:21.280
 I did a hit piece against them to prove that I can do it to anybody around anything at

1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:22.780
 any time.

1:22:22.780 --> 1:22:24.840
 Except Eddie Van Halen is what we're talking about.

1:22:24.840 --> 1:22:26.720
 Well, Eddie Van Halen is now dead.

1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:34.080
 But if this was a situation, you know, hot for teacher, canceled.

1:22:34.080 --> 1:22:35.080
 Disrespectful.

1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:36.080
 Absolutely.

1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:46.080
 Also, you know, packaging female objectification for young men, clearly Eddie Van Halen is

1:22:46.080 --> 1:22:48.000
 one of the worst people alive.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:56.240
 But was the skill, the incredible inspiration that is just radiating from his music inspires

1:22:56.240 --> 1:22:59.320
 so many millions that they will fight those canceled pieces.

1:22:59.320 --> 1:23:00.320
 They will fight those.

1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:01.320
 This is your thing.

1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:02.320
 Yeah.

1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:04.640
 You have this idea that there's a war between good and evil and the good is already been

1:23:04.640 --> 1:23:06.880
 decided, designated the winner.

1:23:06.880 --> 1:23:07.880
 Yeah.

1:23:07.880 --> 1:23:08.880
 It's not true.

1:23:08.880 --> 1:23:10.880
 But your belief in that it's true.

1:23:10.880 --> 1:23:13.880
 Take it till you make it, no?

1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:14.880
 You gotta...

1:23:14.880 --> 1:23:16.240
 It's motivating both of us.

1:23:16.240 --> 1:23:19.840
 Like, I also believe that we're going to win because if I don't, then I can't get out

1:23:19.840 --> 1:23:22.160
 of bed and it's pretty heavy at the moment.

1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:31.960
 Do you think 2021 can make us feel good about the trajectory of society?

1:23:31.960 --> 1:23:38.400
 Where we emerge from this year feeling good, like there's a smile, an air quintess phase

1:23:38.400 --> 1:23:43.360
 and the next time we talk, we'll be doing some kind of duet and guitar and not having

1:23:43.360 --> 1:23:46.560
 this worried look on our faces.

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:47.560
 No.

1:23:47.560 --> 1:23:48.560
 Okay.

1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:53.960
 But you've also promised that you're going to somehow end this in a positive...

1:23:53.960 --> 1:23:54.960
 Okay.

1:23:54.960 --> 1:23:57.760
 So, how do you turn the no around?

1:23:57.760 --> 1:23:59.680
 What's the U turn from the no?

1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:06.160
 Will we get some actually decent people in the right chairs who are not constantly thinking

1:24:06.160 --> 1:24:10.560
 about their next paycheck, I don't see a solution.

1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:14.640
 Let me just say what the prerequisites for a solution are and to let you know why I

1:24:14.640 --> 1:24:18.760
 don't think it's coming.

1:24:18.760 --> 1:24:23.840
 First of all, both of these political parties, the leadership of them is disgusting and has

1:24:23.840 --> 1:24:24.840
 to go.

1:24:24.840 --> 1:24:26.680
 They're tearing us apart.

1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:32.360
 They lack the will to be Americans, they don't understand the subtlety of the project.

1:24:32.360 --> 1:24:36.760
 They're simply the people who figured out how to inhabit the seats and that is their

1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:41.120
 great achievement.

1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:45.640
 I believe that in order to solve this, you need people who can integrate, who are not

1:24:45.640 --> 1:24:51.280
 partisan at the level of the partisan warriors that we're seeing, people who believe in dividing

1:24:51.280 --> 1:24:56.520
 the pies of the future rather than the present pie as our main task as Americans because

1:24:56.520 --> 1:25:02.920
 we are built around growth, I'm sorry to say it.

1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:10.240
 You need an ability to have subtle conversations and you need the ability to exclude.

1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.040
 At the moment, everyone knows inclusion is good, which it isn't.

1:25:14.040 --> 1:25:16.320
 It's like saying, well, water is good.

1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:18.920
 If I say water is good, everybody will agree with me.

1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:20.200
 It's not.

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:22.560
 People drown.

1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:24.640
 People need to get dehydrated.

1:25:24.640 --> 1:25:27.400
 It can be life saving or life ending.

1:25:27.400 --> 1:25:28.960
 It isn't good or bad.

1:25:28.960 --> 1:25:30.800
 Inclusion is not good or bad.

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:32.320
 Inclusion is just inclusion.

1:25:32.320 --> 1:25:34.680
 Exclusion is part of inclusion.

1:25:34.680 --> 1:25:44.160
 We've taught people that they can reason through the world as subcocker spaniels.

1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:47.600
 They just bark things at each other.

1:25:47.600 --> 1:25:48.600
 I'm for safety.

1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:49.720
 I'm for inclusion.

1:25:49.720 --> 1:25:50.720
 I'm for growth.

1:25:50.720 --> 1:25:51.720
 Oh, really?

1:25:51.720 --> 1:25:54.560
 Do you guys use verbs?

1:25:54.560 --> 1:25:57.680
 In clauses, are there compound, complex sentences?

1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:01.080
 Where are we in this sea of nonsense?

1:26:01.080 --> 1:26:07.560
 You have to be able to build a place where you have smart, talented people who represent

1:26:07.560 --> 1:26:10.780
 a diverse group of correct opinions.

1:26:10.780 --> 1:26:15.160
 You need to get rid of almost all of the people who have opinions that are antithetical

1:26:15.160 --> 1:26:17.760
 to what we're trying to accomplish.

1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:21.880
 You need to give them insulation, which we're terrified because we don't trust anybody,

1:26:21.880 --> 1:26:23.320
 so everything has to be transparent.

1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:26.520
 If you're going to the bathroom, I want those walls to be plexiglass so I can see what you're

1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:27.520
 doing.

1:26:27.520 --> 1:26:29.520
 That's too much transparency.

1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:33.720
 We have too much and not enough at the same time.

1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:39.120
 In essence, you need to ensure that people aren't worried about feeding their family

1:26:39.120 --> 1:26:42.120
 every four seconds for being real.

1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:43.720
 None of that is happening.

1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:47.360
 Our billionaires are pathetic.

1:26:47.360 --> 1:26:51.840
 What is the point of billionaires if you're not going to do billionaire type cool stuff

1:26:51.840 --> 1:27:01.320
 like saying F you, and I'm going to throw $3 billion at the project of restoring the

1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:05.160
 national conversation?

1:27:05.160 --> 1:27:06.920
 I don't grasp this.

1:27:06.920 --> 1:27:11.160
 What is the point of creating obscene wealth if we don't have anyone smart enough and caring

1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:12.400
 enough to use it?

1:27:12.400 --> 1:27:15.720
 I agree with that last part for sure.

1:27:15.720 --> 1:27:22.800
 Let me slightly push back on the idea that the leaders themselves are broken.

1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:31.880
 I feel like this goes to Joe Rogan, Joe Biden, and Trump having a debate on that program.

1:27:31.880 --> 1:27:39.720
 I feel like Joe Biden has a lot of really interesting ideas that he's almost forgot

1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:40.720
 how to communicate.

1:27:40.720 --> 1:27:44.120
 He's been fake for so long within the system.

1:27:44.120 --> 1:27:45.440
 Hillary was fake for too long.

1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:49.720
 I'm sure she had real ideas at the beginning that she still was campaigning on decades

1:27:49.720 --> 1:27:50.720
 later.

1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:56.800
 If the system, if the platforms empowered you to search to be honest, to be real, to

1:27:56.800 --> 1:28:03.840
 search for those ideas within yourself like long form conversations do, then even the

1:28:03.840 --> 1:28:10.600
 Donald Trump and Joe Biden leaders we have now would take this country to a better place

1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:13.560
 that would unite people.

1:28:13.560 --> 1:28:17.760
 We can keep the current Congress, we just need to create better platforms.

1:28:17.760 --> 1:28:21.560
 This is going to the intuition that there's good in Donald Trump.

1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:26.320
 There is depth and complexity in intelligence and the same with Joe Biden.

1:28:26.320 --> 1:28:28.280
 There's good in Joe Biden.

1:28:28.280 --> 1:28:33.480
 It's just we're not incentivizing.

1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:35.080
 There's several things I think are broken.

1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:38.160
 One of them is Twitter, the other is journalism.

1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:41.560
 It's just the platforms of us communicating with each other.

1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:47.280
 One of the reasons that I try to come up with unifying explanations is that if you look

1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:52.280
 at the number of wildfires in California, let's say that we've just seen, if you treat

1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:58.240
 them all as spontaneous uncorrelated instances, it feels like, oh my God, it's just whack

1:28:58.240 --> 1:28:59.240
 them all.

1:28:59.240 --> 1:29:02.200
 Every time I send a fire truck here, there's a fire over there.

1:29:02.200 --> 1:29:07.160
 You want to come up with something like a central theory, which is why do I suddenly

1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:10.240
 have a problem when I hadn't had a problem before?

1:29:10.240 --> 1:29:14.840
 I look for these unifying explanations and I found one the other day that really speaks

1:29:14.840 --> 1:29:17.340
 to me.

1:29:17.340 --> 1:29:20.680
 People are very frustrated because they've been trained to think about this incorrectly

1:29:20.680 --> 1:29:25.240
 in my opinion, but here's the graph that you need to look at.

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:37.120
 On the X axis is time by year and on the Y axis is something like average age of a human.

1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:44.840
 The title of the graph is Any Desirable Situation Involving Institutions.

1:29:44.840 --> 1:29:53.760
 That could be CEO, it could be tenured professor, it could be who's getting grants, it could

1:29:53.760 --> 1:30:01.920
 be the age at which people win Nobel Prizes.

1:30:01.920 --> 1:30:11.440
 In other words, for a long period of time, the average age of the person in a desirable

1:30:11.440 --> 1:30:19.360
 situation has been increasing something like nine months for every 12.

1:30:19.360 --> 1:30:22.120
 Those graphs have to go down at some point.

1:30:22.120 --> 1:30:31.880
 The specter of having five people all born in the 1940s as the final entrance in the

1:30:31.880 --> 1:30:36.440
 many presidential context, that makes no sense.

1:30:36.440 --> 1:30:40.440
 Think about how bizarre a thing that nobody's even really talking about.

1:30:40.440 --> 1:30:50.680
 The last five people were all ancient by presidential standards, not one, not two, but five.

1:30:50.680 --> 1:30:57.760
 We are talking about a contest between somebody who is the oldest of the baby boomers, the

1:30:57.760 --> 1:31:03.520
 very beginning of the baby boom, summer of 46th birthday, fighting somebody who is in

1:31:03.520 --> 1:31:09.560
 the silent generation, the silent generation guy in a town hall in Florida gets this question

1:31:09.560 --> 1:31:14.200
 from a Gen Z guy saying, what's going on with my future?

1:31:14.200 --> 1:31:20.160
 Joe Biden has the audacity to say, I'm a transitional president.

1:31:20.160 --> 1:31:23.160
 You guys are the highly educated one.

1:31:23.160 --> 1:31:28.680
 Biden has any generation in history needed a transitional 78 year old person to take

1:31:28.680 --> 1:31:29.680
 office.

1:31:29.680 --> 1:31:30.680
 It's bizarre.

1:31:30.680 --> 1:31:31.680
 It's preposterous.

1:31:31.680 --> 1:31:35.320
 That graph is the graph we can't talk about.

1:31:35.320 --> 1:31:44.320
 That graph is the graph of our destruction because it has the, you can make a one line

1:31:44.320 --> 1:31:51.200
 argument, which is sounds like ageism, which isn't a very good argument now.

1:31:51.200 --> 1:31:54.720
 But what it does is it muddles the conversation.

1:31:54.720 --> 1:31:58.800
 And you always have to ask yourself the question, if this conversation becomes muddled, who

1:31:58.800 --> 1:32:01.600
 wins as a result of the muddling?

1:32:01.600 --> 1:32:02.600
 It's a battle.

1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:04.280
 Let's just win it.

1:32:04.280 --> 1:32:05.280
 Let's win the battle.

1:32:05.280 --> 1:32:06.280
 Are you running?

1:32:06.280 --> 1:32:07.280
 I'll run.

1:32:07.280 --> 1:32:12.320
 I was born in Russia, can't run.

1:32:12.320 --> 1:32:15.680
 But we Russians can hack elections, so we'll figure it out.

1:32:15.680 --> 1:32:17.600
 This is me officially announcing my run.

1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:21.880
 I was born in St. Petersburg, Florida.

1:32:21.880 --> 1:32:26.680
 Lex, what is it that you really want to ask?

1:32:26.680 --> 1:32:34.480
 I want to put some responsibility on the portal, the portal, the portal, that the portal gives

1:32:34.480 --> 1:32:39.440
 power to the people in that graph.

1:32:39.440 --> 1:32:45.040
 Because you put it quite brilliantly, that the people that move the world, their age

1:32:45.040 --> 1:32:50.240
 has been going up, and not move the world, but put in the position where they get the

1:32:50.240 --> 1:32:54.400
 chance to affect the world.

1:32:54.400 --> 1:33:00.200
 These new platforms, I think Twitter falls in them, give power to the younger people.

1:33:00.200 --> 1:33:04.240
 It doesn't have to be about Asia necessarily, but the younger thinking people.

1:33:04.240 --> 1:33:06.840
 So that's a promising thing.

1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:09.240
 And you're like Gandalf.

1:33:09.240 --> 1:33:14.240
 You get to pick your photos, whatever, I'm not very good with the analogy.

1:33:14.240 --> 1:33:16.240
 But the whole point is for you as Gandalf to find a photo.

1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:18.040
 I don't know that I make that much sense.

1:33:18.040 --> 1:33:20.000
 Gandalf makes sense.

1:33:20.000 --> 1:33:24.920
 I don't know if people know how to fit me into this ecosystem.

1:33:24.920 --> 1:33:27.680
 I think there's something in my presentation that people find very confusing.

1:33:27.680 --> 1:33:28.680
 No, figure it out.

1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:33.000
 I disagree with you, but you need to look at the mirror and think like, what is it?

1:33:33.000 --> 1:33:36.080
 Is it maybe you need a mustache?

1:33:36.080 --> 1:33:38.520
 I don't know.

1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:43.800
 But there's something about figuring out how to be a charismatic communicator in this.

1:33:43.800 --> 1:33:45.240
 And that's the responsibility.

1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:50.920
 You said like finishing sentences with the LOL is painful for your soul.

1:33:50.920 --> 1:33:54.920
 That's just how somebody lets me know I don't have to take their opinion seriously.

1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:59.160
 It's still the language, the way that people are communicating and you're swimming that

1:33:59.160 --> 1:34:00.160
 wave.

1:34:00.160 --> 1:34:01.160
 You have a big platform.

1:34:01.160 --> 1:34:02.680
 I have a growing platform.

1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:05.200
 It feels like this is the place to give power.

1:34:05.200 --> 1:34:06.200
 I agree.

1:34:06.200 --> 1:34:07.400
 But we're going to get swatted down.

1:34:07.400 --> 1:34:08.600
 I just don't think so.

1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:09.600
 You're wrong.

1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:13.280
 Why are you afraid of the big, like this is I've studied it.

1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:15.600
 Because I've studied.

1:34:15.600 --> 1:34:18.840
 Let me ask you a question, Lex.

1:34:18.840 --> 1:34:25.400
 I believe that every society is supposed to have a collection of what I call break glass

1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:27.560
 in case of emergency people.

1:34:27.560 --> 1:34:33.120
 Yeah, these are people who are universally loved and trusted by your society.

1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:39.600
 For example, David Attenborough, the great British naturalist and presenter recently

1:34:39.600 --> 1:34:40.600
 came on Instagram.

1:34:40.600 --> 1:34:43.160
 He's worried about the planet.

1:34:43.160 --> 1:34:46.640
 And I said, you know, look, there are very few of these people left.

1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:48.480
 Let's pay attention, find out what he has to say.

1:34:48.480 --> 1:34:49.840
 Maybe he's going to be an ass.

1:34:49.840 --> 1:34:50.840
 Maybe he's going to be in it.

1:34:50.840 --> 1:34:51.840
 Maybe he's going to say wrong things.

1:34:51.840 --> 1:34:52.840
 Don't know.

1:34:52.840 --> 1:34:57.520
 Tell me about your top 10 universal American heroes.

1:34:57.520 --> 1:34:59.680
 This is not a rhetorical question.

1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:00.680
 No.

1:35:00.680 --> 1:35:02.440
 Give me five.

1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:05.880
 Everybody looks to that person and says, yep, the best of us.

1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:08.280
 Well, not divisive.

1:35:08.280 --> 1:35:11.440
 Well, everybody's an interesting concept.

1:35:11.440 --> 1:35:15.000
 I mean, Elon Musk is very divisive, right?

1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:20.440
 I'm talking about overwhelmingly, people would follow that person if that person gave

1:35:20.440 --> 1:35:28.360
 a rousing, intelligent speech that said, we must act now because we're in dire straits.

1:35:28.360 --> 1:35:30.040
 I think a lot of people fall in that category.

1:35:30.040 --> 1:35:34.920
 For me, it would be in the tech world, in the engineering world.

1:35:34.920 --> 1:35:35.920
 No, no, no.

1:35:35.920 --> 1:35:36.920
 How many names?

1:35:36.920 --> 1:35:37.920
 Elon Musk.

1:35:37.920 --> 1:35:38.920
 Elon Musk.

1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:43.360
 The Rock.

1:35:43.360 --> 1:35:46.320
 I'm thinking, who is the most eloquent actor?

1:35:46.320 --> 1:35:48.200
 You think celebrities, so people with platforms.

1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:49.200
 I didn't say celebrities.

1:35:49.200 --> 1:35:50.200
 They have to be well known.

1:35:50.200 --> 1:35:59.840
 I believe, yeah, so this goes to Joe Rogan.

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:04.880
 First two did not really impress me as being what I said, but okay.

1:36:04.880 --> 1:36:08.360
 Elon, several years ago, would have.

1:36:08.360 --> 1:36:11.480
 Can you try to, Joe Rogan has.

1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:12.480
 Why do they fail?

1:36:12.480 --> 1:36:13.480
 Why is Elon Musk?

1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:18.280
 Lots of people treat Joe Rogan as if he's some sort of right wing racist because they've

1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:19.680
 never watched his program.

1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:20.680
 They don't know who his friends are.

1:36:20.680 --> 1:36:21.680
 I don't know.

1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:29.080
 Oh, but when I thought you said everybody, I thought you meant a large enough people

1:36:29.080 --> 1:36:33.760
 where a huge change can happen, not actually literally everybody.

1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:40.440
 I mean, people who've pulled off something where everybody's convinced that that person

1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:51.240
 just deeply, I think I've told you the story before, but the one time I've seen the power

1:36:51.240 --> 1:36:57.200
 of a figure like this, very few times I've been in a large crowd and I've seen people

1:36:57.200 --> 1:37:02.160
 just moved where they would do almost anything good, bad, and different because they were

1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:05.220
 primed.

1:37:05.220 --> 1:37:07.560
 One was a Rolling Stones concert.

1:37:07.560 --> 1:37:14.160
 The other one was Nelson Mandela coming to Boston and man, you've never seen anything

1:37:14.160 --> 1:37:15.160
 like this.

1:37:15.160 --> 1:37:22.240
 You check out the photos from the banks of the Charles River when Nelson Mandela came.

1:37:22.240 --> 1:37:26.160
 There are people that you need in your dark hours and we can't agree on who they are and

1:37:26.160 --> 1:37:29.440
 as soon as they emerge, we tar them with shit.

1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:31.640
 We get out the shit breach.

1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:32.880
 I just disagree with this.

1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:33.880
 I think...

1:37:33.880 --> 1:37:35.680
 What do we disagree about here?

1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:37.520
 I think it doesn't matter who it is.

1:37:37.520 --> 1:37:41.360
 I think really good speeches are needed and I think a lot...

1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:42.360
 I was going to give them.

1:37:42.360 --> 1:37:44.560
 I saw Killer Mike try to give a good speech.

1:37:44.560 --> 1:37:45.560
 Yeah, he did.

1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:46.560
 In Atlanta, right?

1:37:46.560 --> 1:37:47.560
 Yeah.

1:37:47.560 --> 1:37:48.560
 He did.

1:37:48.560 --> 1:37:49.560
 That was something.

1:37:49.560 --> 1:37:50.560
 Very impressed.

1:37:50.560 --> 1:37:51.560
 Yeah.

1:37:51.560 --> 1:37:59.800
 Even Killer Mike immediately gets into this sell out, like, yeah, but he didn't take up

1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:06.040
 the responsibility, I would say, of going bigger.

1:38:06.040 --> 1:38:09.920
 He was speaking to the community on this particular moment.

1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:13.760
 He's exceptional at it and he was speaking to this particular moment.

1:38:13.760 --> 1:38:23.520
 He didn't take it a step farther, which is giving the same speech but bigger than race,

1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:29.520
 bigger than this particular moment, but more about the American project.

1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:31.840
 You know the guy who landed the plane in the Hudson?

1:38:31.840 --> 1:38:32.840
 Yes.

1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:33.840
 Yeah, there you go.

1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:34.840
 That's a good example.

1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:40.520
 That guy, until we screw him up, is the kind of thing that I'm talking about.

1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:41.520
 Yeah, exactly.

1:38:41.520 --> 1:38:42.840
 I mean, Jaco, maybe.

1:38:42.840 --> 1:38:43.840
 That's another...

1:38:43.840 --> 1:38:45.840
 Jaco's pretty good.

1:38:45.840 --> 1:38:47.240
 Jaco is pretty good.

1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:48.480
 Can't really tell.

1:38:48.480 --> 1:38:49.480
 Is he a Democrat?

1:38:49.480 --> 1:38:50.480
 Is he a Republican?

1:38:50.480 --> 1:38:51.480
 I don't know.

1:38:51.480 --> 1:38:52.480
 He's an American.

1:38:52.480 --> 1:38:53.480
 That's for damn sure.

1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:54.480
 Yeah.

1:38:54.480 --> 1:38:55.480
 I think there's a lot of folks.

1:38:55.480 --> 1:38:56.980
 No, I think Jaco...

1:38:56.980 --> 1:38:57.980
 There aren't.

1:38:57.980 --> 1:38:59.480
 That's one of the reasons why Jaco is so important.

1:38:59.480 --> 1:39:00.960
 Yeah.

1:39:00.960 --> 1:39:08.160
 Your podcast, The Portal, is something in my little universe, is something a lot of people

1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:11.320
 really love, and it moves them.

1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:18.920
 They draw a lot of meaning from it, and also especially in difficult times.

1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:20.120
 They...

1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:24.360
 It gives them a comfort of through this kind of...

1:39:24.360 --> 1:39:26.080
 It's not just nuance.

1:39:26.080 --> 1:39:31.880
 There's like, even when you're talking about chaos, there's love underneath all of it,

1:39:31.880 --> 1:39:39.040
 and I think people draw a lot of meaning from it, which is why they are wondering why you

1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:44.880
 haven't been doing that many podcasts, or you haven't done it in maybe a month and a

1:39:44.880 --> 1:39:49.840
 half or two months in this most difficult of times.

1:39:49.840 --> 1:39:51.840
 Is there a good reason?

1:39:51.840 --> 1:39:52.840
 Yeah.

1:39:52.840 --> 1:39:56.920
 There are lots of good reasons.

1:39:56.920 --> 1:40:03.880
 The first one is kind of weird, which is everybody assumes that everyone wants to be famous.

1:40:03.880 --> 1:40:07.120
 If you say, I don't want to be famous, it's like, oh, you're just saying that because

1:40:07.120 --> 1:40:08.120
 you want to be...

1:40:08.120 --> 1:40:09.120
 Everyone would think you're famous.

1:40:09.120 --> 1:40:10.120
 You're not that famous.

1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:11.120
 Okay.

1:40:11.120 --> 1:40:12.120
 Yeah.

1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:19.960
 I don't love being as well known as I've become.

1:40:19.960 --> 1:40:21.520
 There's lots of things that are fun about it.

1:40:21.520 --> 1:40:27.320
 It's wonderful that I can go to any city in the world, there are portal listeners there.

1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:30.880
 All I need to do is put out a tweet and 20 people show up for a drink.

1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:32.040
 They're amazing people.

1:40:32.040 --> 1:40:33.040
 They're...

1:40:33.040 --> 1:40:34.040
 Almost.

1:40:34.040 --> 1:40:37.480
 I mean, you can see my live Q&As on my Instagram page.

1:40:37.480 --> 1:40:41.800
 If you go to Eric R. Weinstein, I'd just pick somebody randomly, and I was really worried

1:40:41.800 --> 1:40:47.520
 about it at first, and maybe I should be worried about it, but in general, people all over the

1:40:47.520 --> 1:40:51.480
 world are just so positive and so...

1:40:51.480 --> 1:40:54.200
 And thoughtful and deep and have a story that's kind of...

1:40:54.200 --> 1:40:55.800
 Because they're self selected, right?

1:40:55.800 --> 1:40:56.800
 Yeah.

1:40:56.800 --> 1:40:58.300
 But I don't like the fame.

1:40:58.300 --> 1:41:00.320
 The thing we just described comes with the fame.

1:41:00.320 --> 1:41:01.320
 It's a beautiful thing.

1:41:01.320 --> 1:41:02.320
 You don't...

1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:03.840
 You're worried that it's getting...

1:41:03.840 --> 1:41:04.840
 It's ephemeral.

1:41:04.840 --> 1:41:05.840
 It'll...

1:41:05.840 --> 1:41:10.200
 Look, Lex, it'll turn on you in a heartbeat.

1:41:10.200 --> 1:41:15.640
 It'll turn on you in a heartbeat, and the other problem is I don't like my audience being

1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:16.640
 my audience.

1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:18.080
 I want to get closer to them.

1:41:18.080 --> 1:41:19.080
 I want to talk to them.

1:41:19.080 --> 1:41:21.120
 I want to find out what is this doing in your life?

1:41:21.120 --> 1:41:24.760
 My house fills up with art that people send me.

1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:28.240
 The lightest thing is an effects pedal called something like...

1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:29.240
 I don't know.

1:41:29.240 --> 1:41:32.120
 It's a bow tie overdrive from a guy in Mexico.

1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:33.120
 Right?

1:41:33.120 --> 1:41:34.120
 Yeah.

1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:36.640
 You play electric, by the way, in a tiny little tangent.

1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:37.840
 Did you play electric?

1:41:37.840 --> 1:41:41.960
 I have a Stratocaster, but it doesn't have a strap, and I don't know what to do with

1:41:41.960 --> 1:41:43.040
 it, and I have a bad amp.

1:41:43.040 --> 1:41:46.960
 So you should hook me up with the...

1:41:46.960 --> 1:41:49.520
 We'll find it a home, maybe.

1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:51.840
 You're starting to sense that this is too much?

1:41:51.840 --> 1:41:52.840
 No.

1:41:52.840 --> 1:41:54.680
 I want to be here.

1:41:54.680 --> 1:42:00.680
 I want to do the work very simply.

1:42:00.680 --> 1:42:03.400
 I don't have an ability to fully explain myself.

1:42:03.400 --> 1:42:06.880
 I don't want to claim that I don't love the fact that...

1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:11.120
 How much love do we get from these programs?

1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:16.640
 Actually, people are incredibly generous.

1:42:16.640 --> 1:42:22.000
 People have begged me, set up a Patreon account, and I haven't been able to do it.

1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:23.000
 I should do it.

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:26.840
 I've said to everybody, it's a business, it's a business, it's a business, but they're

1:42:26.840 --> 1:42:31.760
 so used to being defrauded when somebody starts thinking about monetary incentives.

1:42:31.760 --> 1:42:34.720
 My goal was to say, I'm going to keep talking to you about...

1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:38.560
 You want to know why I started doing ads on my show was because I wanted people to think

1:42:38.560 --> 1:42:45.600
 from the get go, this is a business, this is what I sound like when I'm selling.

1:42:45.600 --> 1:42:49.280
 But you see, I've lost weight.

1:42:49.280 --> 1:42:51.200
 A lot of that is due to Athletic Greens.

1:42:51.200 --> 1:42:53.200
 Athletic Greens.

1:42:53.200 --> 1:42:56.200
 Code...

1:42:56.200 --> 1:42:59.560
 I don't know what my promo code is for Athletic Greens.

1:42:59.560 --> 1:43:01.920
 They're probably athleticgreens.com slash portal.

1:43:01.920 --> 1:43:02.920
 But doesn't matter.

1:43:02.920 --> 1:43:03.920
 Just slash portal.

1:43:03.920 --> 1:43:08.760
 Fitbit, who doesn't advertise, has also been instrumental as well as a guy named Steven

1:43:08.760 --> 1:43:14.120
 Cates, who was a fan from the show, found me on the street and just said, I'm a trainer.

1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:15.120
 I want to help train you.

1:43:15.120 --> 1:43:19.080
 It's got me on a good path.

1:43:19.080 --> 1:43:25.640
 That's one paid advertiser and two people I'm calling out just because two outfits, Steven

1:43:25.640 --> 1:43:28.600
 Cates and Fitbit, that have changed my life.

1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:32.000
 I wanted people to say, you don't have to be afraid of advertising.

1:43:32.000 --> 1:43:36.600
 If I do it in this way, this is powering your show.

1:43:36.600 --> 1:43:41.440
 But the whole issue of money is weird because people have these crazy feelings like, oh,

1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:44.160
 wow, I knew he was a shill.

1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:45.160
 He's a grifter.

1:43:45.160 --> 1:43:46.160
 Okay.

1:43:46.160 --> 1:43:47.160
 I didn't love that.

1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:48.160
 I didn't love the issues.

1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:50.440
 So I didn't set up a Patreon.

1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:56.520
 The security issues for talking and being me are significant.

1:43:56.520 --> 1:44:00.560
 And I don't have the kind of money to hire around the clock.

1:44:00.560 --> 1:44:06.200
 I mean, I desperately want to get to a level of wealth where I don't have to think about

1:44:06.200 --> 1:44:07.200
 money.

1:44:07.200 --> 1:44:08.360
 I don't think it's...

1:44:08.360 --> 1:44:12.320
 Some people want money because they need it for status.

1:44:12.320 --> 1:44:16.280
 I think I can handle status if I want it doing this.

1:44:16.280 --> 1:44:21.880
 I don't want the status necessarily and I don't want the status, but I don't want the

1:44:21.880 --> 1:44:24.680
 fame that goes with it.

1:44:24.680 --> 1:44:25.680
 I want the money.

1:44:25.680 --> 1:44:31.920
 I don't want to be seen as this is about money because it's about a substance.

1:44:31.920 --> 1:44:34.840
 All of those things, that's part of...

1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:37.520
 I haven't solved these issues.

1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:40.280
 I've been feeling bad because people say, where's the Port Award?

1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:41.280
 We're desperate.

1:44:41.280 --> 1:44:42.280
 These are difficult times.

1:44:42.280 --> 1:44:43.280
 We have an election coming up.

1:44:43.280 --> 1:44:48.120
 And it's just like, do you think for a moment that I want to explain that I actually got

1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:51.760
 really uncomfortable being as well known as I was and then what is it that I want?

1:44:51.760 --> 1:44:55.040
 Because I want to be better known and less well known at the same time.

1:44:55.040 --> 1:44:56.040
 It doesn't...

1:44:56.040 --> 1:44:57.040
 There's nothing the audience can do.

1:44:57.040 --> 1:44:58.480
 I don't want the audience to be the audience.

1:44:58.480 --> 1:44:59.680
 That doesn't make sense to people.

1:44:59.680 --> 1:45:03.840
 I want it to be a business, but I don't think people need to fear a business if the business

1:45:03.840 --> 1:45:06.920
 is open about being a business.

1:45:06.920 --> 1:45:09.240
 And then that's all to the side.

1:45:09.240 --> 1:45:15.800
 What you're seeing now in front of the election is an incredibly meta violent period in our

1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:19.560
 online existence.

1:45:19.560 --> 1:45:25.080
 And I believe that anybody who attempts to say these two parties are completely screwed

1:45:25.080 --> 1:45:30.720
 at the moment, the leadership of these parties is unsalvageable, unworkable.

1:45:30.720 --> 1:45:33.400
 Everyone hears that from inside the two party system.

1:45:33.400 --> 1:45:35.080
 Oh, I get it.

1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:36.800
 He's trying to subtract votes off of Biden.

1:45:36.800 --> 1:45:37.800
 Oh, I get it.

1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:38.800
 He's trying to scuttle Trump.

1:45:38.800 --> 1:45:40.400
 Oh, I get it.

1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.320
 This is a play for his show because he's trying to plug in to discuss.

1:45:44.320 --> 1:45:46.440
 There's a Bill Hicks routine on marketing.

1:45:46.440 --> 1:45:48.280
 Have you ever seen this?

1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:49.280
 Brilliant.

1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:54.280
 He recommended it to everyone where he comes out on stage and he says, are there any people

1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:56.560
 in marketing and sales in the audience?

1:45:56.560 --> 1:45:58.000
 Okay, great.

1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.960
 Can you do us all a favor and die?

1:46:00.960 --> 1:46:02.360
 And like everybody laughs.

1:46:02.360 --> 1:46:04.200
 He's like, no, I'm not laughing.

1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:05.200
 I'm seeing him being serious.

1:46:05.200 --> 1:46:07.440
 So he talks about how marketing is horrible.

1:46:07.440 --> 1:46:09.480
 So you're like, where's this act going?

1:46:09.480 --> 1:46:15.040
 Then he gets to the point where it's like, oh, I know how you marketing people think.

1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:17.760
 Bill's going after that resentment dollar.

1:46:17.760 --> 1:46:18.760
 That's good dollar.

1:46:18.760 --> 1:46:20.600
 Let's get that resentment anti marketing dollar.

1:46:20.600 --> 1:46:21.600
 Yeah.

1:46:21.600 --> 1:46:22.600
 It's like, no, that's not what I'm saying.

1:46:22.600 --> 1:46:23.600
 I really hate marketers.

1:46:23.600 --> 1:46:24.600
 Oh, that's good.

1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:26.600
 It's the authenticity dollar.

1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:31.800
 You can't escape this kind of negative marketing thought.

1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:41.280
 And I guess that gets to the issue that I don't want to be destroyed in advance of this election.

1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:48.280
 I don't think it's a good use of my relationship to my audience to be broadcasting how completely

1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:52.640
 ridiculous Donald Trump and Joe Biden are as candidates for the president of the United

1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:53.640
 States.

1:46:53.640 --> 1:46:54.640
 Full stop.

1:46:54.640 --> 1:46:55.760
 None of this makes any sense.

1:46:55.760 --> 1:47:01.760
 These moderators of these pseudo debates, we're in the wrong format with the wrong people.

1:47:01.760 --> 1:47:05.840
 No part of this makes a wit of sense.

1:47:05.840 --> 1:47:09.120
 Can I try to push back several claims?

1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:19.920
 One is I don't believe the systems as they stand now can destroy their request on voice,

1:47:19.920 --> 1:47:20.920
 the voice.

1:47:20.920 --> 1:47:21.920
 You're a child.

1:47:21.920 --> 1:47:23.520
 I'm sorry to say that.

1:47:23.520 --> 1:47:26.280
 But well, let me, well, it's also possible.

1:47:26.280 --> 1:47:27.280
 Let's fight.

1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:33.400
 It's entirely possible that you're the child, because a child would say you would call other

1:47:33.400 --> 1:47:34.400
 people a child.

1:47:34.400 --> 1:47:35.400
 Yeah.

1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:36.400
 Get in the first blow.

1:47:36.400 --> 1:47:40.880
 That's a big reveal to tell.

1:47:40.880 --> 1:47:44.960
 Because the only power they have is to attack you psychologically.

1:47:44.960 --> 1:47:45.960
 No.

1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:55.160
 Well, I believe that the army of people that love you is much more powerful than mainstream

1:47:55.160 --> 1:48:00.960
 media, than people that you might hear it say ridiculous things that you just said,

1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:09.400
 which has tried to reduce you, like the marketing thinking, I just believe there's an army,

1:48:09.400 --> 1:48:16.320
 maybe there's a better term, of people that see you for who you are and are hungry.

1:48:16.320 --> 1:48:17.720
 I'm not disputing those things.

1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:19.480
 I know what I'm saying.

1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:28.600
 I would venture to say as your therapist that you're actually, the battle is all in

1:48:28.600 --> 1:48:38.080
 your mind that you have found these demons in the system and they're just a tiny minority

1:48:38.080 --> 1:48:39.440
 and it's all in your mind.

1:48:39.440 --> 1:48:47.760
 They cannot actually remove, they're not strong enough to remove the voice of Eric Weinstein

1:48:47.760 --> 1:48:48.960
 to silence the voice.

1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:50.800
 I love this.

1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:57.120
 This is some of the best fiction writing I've ever heard.

1:48:57.120 --> 1:49:02.400
 Let me tell you, I have relatives who've known me my entire life, where one article

1:49:02.400 --> 1:49:05.920
 in the New York Times, they will believe that over me.

1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:11.200
 My contention is that that has no power except to affect your psychology.

1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:12.200
 You're not hearing me.

1:49:12.200 --> 1:49:13.840
 What you have to do is the Rogan thing, just laugh.

1:49:13.840 --> 1:49:14.840
 You're not hearing me.

1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:15.840
 Just laugh.

1:49:15.840 --> 1:49:16.840
 I am laughing.

1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:17.840
 I know.

1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:18.840
 But more.

1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:19.840
 No.

1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:20.840
 I'm telling you something.

1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:21.840
 Yes.

1:49:21.840 --> 1:49:26.600
 The way this works is through ruin.

1:49:26.600 --> 1:49:27.600
 Ruin can come to anyone.

1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:29.960
 There's no one who cannot be ruined.

1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:37.120
 Every single person is signed up right now to be ruined by the system.

1:49:37.120 --> 1:49:41.440
 Don't you understand that you have more power than the system?

1:49:41.440 --> 1:49:43.600
 You can ruin the system.

1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:47.800
 Your Twitter account, the podcast, that's what I'm telling you about the army.

1:49:47.800 --> 1:49:52.440
 I agree that my Twitter account, my pocket, but what we've seen, for example, you saw

1:49:52.440 --> 1:49:55.320
 what happened to Brett's Articles of Unity project?

1:49:55.320 --> 1:49:56.320
 Yes.

1:49:56.320 --> 1:49:57.320
 Okay.

1:49:57.320 --> 1:49:58.320
 What happened?

1:49:58.320 --> 1:49:59.320
 On the Twitter site.

1:49:59.320 --> 1:50:00.320
 On the Twitter site.

1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:02.800
 What happened?

1:50:02.800 --> 1:50:03.800
 What happened?

1:50:03.800 --> 1:50:04.800
 Well, actually, that's not an answer.

1:50:04.800 --> 1:50:05.800
 Say the word.

1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:08.000
 It was blocked or removed from Twitter.

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.000
 Suspended.

1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:10.000
 Sounds suspended.

1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:11.000
 Okay.

1:50:11.000 --> 1:50:14.600
 I have a direct line to Jack.

1:50:14.600 --> 1:50:15.600
 Yeah.

1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:16.600
 Okay.

1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:21.000
 So I'm talking to the CEO who I am crazy enough to still believe in.

1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:22.000
 Good.

1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:23.000
 I do too.

1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:24.000
 I believe it.

1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:27.240
 There's a very strange thing going on with Jack Dorsey.

1:50:27.240 --> 1:50:34.680
 I cannot possibly reconcile the actions with the person I've... That is a next level mind

1:50:34.680 --> 1:50:37.040
 in there.

1:50:37.040 --> 1:50:39.880
 I don't know it well enough to say that it's all next level.

1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:42.080
 I'm not claiming he doesn't have any blind spots.

1:50:42.080 --> 1:50:43.880
 Every smart person I know has blind spots.

1:50:43.880 --> 1:50:46.800
 I don't know what he's up against, blah, blah, blah.

1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:52.240
 There's no way that the Jack Dorsey that I've talked to and the Jack Dorsey that interacted

1:50:52.240 --> 1:50:55.560
 over articles of unity can be the same person.

1:50:55.560 --> 1:50:59.560
 He is constrained by that company in some way that doesn't make sense to me.

1:50:59.560 --> 1:51:02.640
 Either that or he's the most deplicitest person on earth and I'm not believing it.

1:51:02.640 --> 1:51:03.960
 I just don't buy it.

1:51:03.960 --> 1:51:04.960
 Okay?

1:51:04.960 --> 1:51:05.960
 Yeah.

1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:10.240
 Something horrible is happening.

1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:17.440
 My claim is I can remove you functionally from the chessboard in a tiny number of moves,

1:51:17.440 --> 1:51:21.080
 no matter who you are, no matter how virtuous or how much of a bastard you've been your

1:51:21.080 --> 1:51:26.720
 entire life, it doesn't take more than three or four moves to basically neuter you as a

1:51:26.720 --> 1:51:27.720
 force.

1:51:27.720 --> 1:51:28.720
 Yeah.

1:51:28.720 --> 1:51:34.160
 I disagree that if that's possible, that means I'm not very good at chess.

1:51:34.160 --> 1:51:40.320
 Unity 2020 was removed from Twitter because it's not good enough, not within the system.

1:51:40.320 --> 1:51:46.280
 The army of people that feel the brilliance of the idea was too small.

1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:47.280
 Okay.

1:51:47.280 --> 1:51:51.640
 Your uncertainty in doubt is the name of the game, the coin of the realm.

1:51:51.640 --> 1:51:52.640
 Psychology though.

1:51:52.640 --> 1:51:53.800
 It's not real power.

1:51:53.800 --> 1:51:55.160
 It just affects the mind.

1:51:55.160 --> 1:51:56.160
 Okay.

1:51:56.160 --> 1:51:57.620
 I have a reading assignment for you.

1:51:57.620 --> 1:52:01.400
 Because you're Russian, you'll really enjoy this.

1:52:01.400 --> 1:52:06.800
 As part of the Great American Tobacco Settlement, the Tobacco Institute had to discourage its

1:52:06.800 --> 1:52:12.240
 archives of all of its strategies, all of its skull duggery, and put it on the web for

1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:18.400
 all time so that we can all understand how the tobacco companies got together and destroyed

1:52:18.400 --> 1:52:19.400
 people.

1:52:19.400 --> 1:52:20.400
 Right?

1:52:20.400 --> 1:52:22.600
 You see, tobacco destroys people.

1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:26.320
 You can see, Scientology destroys people.

1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:36.240
 There are various vindictive organizations that will not tolerate reality in opposition

1:52:36.240 --> 1:52:37.240
 to them.

1:52:37.240 --> 1:52:38.240
 Let's take them down.

1:52:38.240 --> 1:52:39.240
 Okay.

1:52:39.240 --> 1:52:40.600
 That's what I'm trying to tell you is.

1:52:40.600 --> 1:52:41.600
 Okay.

1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:44.080
 Well, why aren't you doing the podcast to return?

1:52:44.080 --> 1:52:47.760
 Because that's one of the weapons of war.

1:52:47.760 --> 1:52:58.000
 Well, first of all, if you're at war, I don't want to discuss strategy on a podcast, right?

1:52:58.000 --> 1:52:59.000
 But that's your misunderstanding.

1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:02.120
 What did Montgomery say about Rommel?

1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:05.400
 But wasn't his line, I read your book, You Beautiful Bastard?

1:53:05.400 --> 1:53:09.040
 It's like, why are you using the tactics that you already explained?

1:53:09.040 --> 1:53:10.040
 Okay.

1:53:10.040 --> 1:53:14.200
 So, one of the things I'm doing is I'm not having a strategic conversation with you and

1:53:14.200 --> 1:53:20.320
 several hundred thousand of our closest friends.

1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:28.560
 I pulled back because this is not the battle that I know what I'm doing.

1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:34.200
 I do not feel passionately enough about defeating Donald Trump to elect Joe Biden, even if that's

1:53:34.200 --> 1:53:39.720
 the way I'm going to ultimately vote, right?

1:53:39.720 --> 1:53:42.560
 I don't believe in the Biden Democratic Party.

1:53:42.560 --> 1:53:45.480
 I don't believe in the Trump Republican Party.

1:53:45.480 --> 1:53:48.600
 So yes, it's an incredibly consequential election.

1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:54.120
 But to me, it's like the Crips and the Bloods and the Latin Kings fighting over the right

1:53:54.120 --> 1:54:00.280
 to extort a business and the business trying to figure out who it wants to do the extorting.

1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:04.280
 But don't you think, listen, there's very few people that are as good with the English

1:54:04.280 --> 1:54:05.280
 language as you.

1:54:05.280 --> 1:54:15.120
 Don't you think it's possible to draw a line that in between, that finds how we find our

1:54:15.120 --> 1:54:22.440
 common humanity, that ensures a better 2021 without having to say like Donald Trump is

1:54:22.440 --> 1:54:27.760
 evil or Joe Biden is incompetent or any of that, just somehow draw beautiful lines.

1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:30.680
 I am seeing people did so much pain.

1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:37.080
 This election is chewing up the integrity of everyone who comments on it, Lex.

1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:38.400
 Maybe they're not good enough.

1:54:38.400 --> 1:54:39.400
 They're not good enough.

1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:40.400
 No.

1:54:40.400 --> 1:54:41.400
 Okay.

1:54:41.400 --> 1:54:42.880
 Do you believe in me?

1:54:42.880 --> 1:54:43.880
 Yes.

1:54:43.880 --> 1:54:44.880
 You do?

1:54:44.880 --> 1:54:45.880
 Yes.

1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:46.880
 Listen to me very carefully.

1:54:46.880 --> 1:54:53.160
 My spider sense, my intuition that has allowed me to survive in this space, I've been mouthing

1:54:53.160 --> 1:55:00.640
 off since the 80s, tells me this is a super dangerous time for smart people.

1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:05.640
 To be spending the dry powder because the election doesn't make sense.

1:55:05.640 --> 1:55:10.360
 It doesn't mean that I don't have a sense that one outcome would be better than the

1:55:10.360 --> 1:55:16.080
 other probably, but the variance on that, I'm not even positive that I'm right.

1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:22.680
 These two options are so completely inappropriate to the world of 2020.

1:55:22.680 --> 1:55:27.680
 What we need is so diametrically opposed to more boomers and more silent generation

1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:36.200
 people trying to sort out a highly technical world being mediated through social media.

1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:37.800
 We need more exclusion.

1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:39.920
 We need more actual elites.

1:55:39.920 --> 1:55:42.440
 The people we've called the elites are not the elite.

1:55:42.440 --> 1:55:43.440
 They need to go.

1:55:43.440 --> 1:55:44.440
 Yeah.

1:55:44.440 --> 1:55:45.920
 We need excellence, competence.

1:55:45.920 --> 1:55:50.480
 We need people who can be trusted behind closed doors and we need to close the doors

1:55:50.480 --> 1:55:55.080
 so we can't see what those people are doing.

1:55:55.080 --> 1:55:56.080
 Here's the thing.

1:55:56.080 --> 1:56:01.920
 Imagine you had a bunch of people who'd all seen action in combat, had all volunteered

1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:06.000
 to be part of the armed services, had all come from backgrounds where they didn't need

1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:07.000
 to.

1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.960
 So you were convinced that these people had put their lives on their line for their

1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:12.720
 country, not for a payday.

1:56:12.720 --> 1:56:16.080
 Imagine you had 10 of these people with technical backgrounds.

1:56:16.080 --> 1:56:22.360
 Men, women, black, white, Muslim, Jew, doesn't matter.

1:56:22.360 --> 1:56:27.440
 I would trust those people and I'd close the door.

1:56:27.440 --> 1:56:29.240
 I don't want to know what they talked about.

1:56:29.240 --> 1:56:33.440
 I don't want transparency into all of their negotiations.

1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:37.120
 I want to know that they're patriotic, that they see something in the world bigger than

1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:40.120
 themselves and their family fortunes.

1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:42.440
 I want to know that they're courageous.

1:56:42.440 --> 1:56:46.760
 I want to know that they've got all of our well being and I'm willing to roll the dice

1:56:46.760 --> 1:56:49.640
 and if they screw us over, I'd rather go down like that.

1:56:49.640 --> 1:56:50.640
 Okay.

1:56:50.640 --> 1:56:57.080
 So I disagree with you there because there's a difference between those and Jaco because

1:56:57.080 --> 1:57:00.360
 you're not speaking to people with credentials of a particular...

1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:02.480
 No, I'm talking about self credentialed people.

1:57:02.480 --> 1:57:04.640
 I view Jaco as self credentialed.

1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:10.440
 But the powerful thing about Jaco is he's not only self credentialed, but he's been

1:57:10.440 --> 1:57:12.840
 real with people.

1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:16.840
 The magical thing about Jaco isn't his book, isn't his life story.

1:57:16.840 --> 1:57:19.640
 He's been talking on a podcast for a long.

1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:21.880
 There's something real that happens.

1:57:21.880 --> 1:57:22.880
 Okay.

1:57:22.880 --> 1:57:29.720
 So if you took Dan Crenshaw and Tulsi Gabbard and you took Jaco Willing and maybe Jesse

1:57:29.720 --> 1:57:32.640
 Ventura, right?

1:57:32.640 --> 1:57:38.840
 You can take Bernie Sanders who's a lone voice.

1:57:38.840 --> 1:57:44.280
 You take all of these people who've really just risked.

1:57:44.280 --> 1:57:45.280
 Why do we trust...

1:57:45.280 --> 1:57:48.280
 Why is Catherine Hepburn the best that Hollywood ever produced?

1:57:48.280 --> 1:57:54.280
 Because she told Hollywood to go fuck itself, hard.

1:57:54.280 --> 1:57:58.200
 They gave her four Academy Awards and she said, love you, sweeties.

1:57:58.200 --> 1:58:01.600
 I'm going to use them as the doorstop for the bathrooms in my house.

1:58:01.600 --> 1:58:02.600
 See that's skill.

1:58:02.600 --> 1:58:04.100
 That's just...

1:58:04.100 --> 1:58:05.840
 That's what you were talking about.

1:58:05.840 --> 1:58:08.120
 Be Catherine Hepburn.

1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:12.400
 Audrey Hepburn is pretty amazing, but Catherine Hepburn is next level, right?

1:58:12.400 --> 1:58:13.400
 Well, you...

1:58:13.400 --> 1:58:14.720
 I mean, that's what you're trying to say to me.

1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:15.720
 Yeah.

1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:16.720
 Okay.

1:58:16.720 --> 1:58:17.720
 I'm trying to figure it out, Lex.

1:58:17.720 --> 1:58:18.720
 I haven't answered yet.

1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:23.800
 What I do know is that this election is chewing people up and I mean two separate things.

1:58:23.800 --> 1:58:29.080
 One that parties don't have enough integrity, that if you comment either for or against,

1:58:29.080 --> 1:58:34.960
 there's a short sequence where you make a comment that's nuanced, you get referenced

1:58:34.960 --> 1:58:36.360
 to something, right?

1:58:36.360 --> 1:58:41.640
 Like, take this thing about, you know, find people on both sides.

1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:49.120
 That is non resolved after n years, whether the context should be reported or not.

1:58:49.120 --> 1:58:55.000
 We are in some situation in which Democrats and Republicans are primed to fight each other

1:58:55.000 --> 1:59:01.160
 the way introducing two ants from two different ant colonies always produces a battle, okay?

1:59:01.160 --> 1:59:07.400
 I don't want to be in that fray because those people are going to kill each other mindlessly

1:59:07.400 --> 1:59:13.840
 like robots and until the election is concluded, like, do I think this is dire?

1:59:13.840 --> 1:59:14.840
 Yes.

1:59:14.840 --> 1:59:15.840
 Could it be make or break?

1:59:15.840 --> 1:59:16.840
 Absolutely.

1:59:16.840 --> 1:59:17.840
 I'm not saying that.

1:59:17.840 --> 1:59:18.840
 Do I know which way this goes?

1:59:18.840 --> 1:59:22.520
 I can make an excellent argument that we need to elect Joe Biden right now, that we've

1:59:22.520 --> 1:59:26.840
 got a situation which can only be cured by voting for Joe Biden.

1:59:26.840 --> 1:59:31.840
 I can make another argument that we could have a situation that can only be cured by defeating

1:59:31.840 --> 1:59:38.840
 Joe Biden right now and all of the things that the modern Democratic Party represents.

1:59:38.840 --> 1:59:43.960
 I don't have, you know, it's not the lady and the tiger.

1:59:43.960 --> 1:59:45.960
 We're choosing between the tiger and the tiger.

1:59:45.960 --> 1:59:49.240
 It's the Sumatran tiger versus the Siberian tiger, right?

1:59:49.240 --> 1:59:54.400
 I'm trying to think, well, which tiger do I have a better chance against?

1:59:54.400 --> 2:00:00.400
 The key problem for us politically is that we have to divorce the concept of the center

2:00:00.400 --> 2:00:04.040
 and moderation from kleptocracy.

2:00:04.040 --> 2:00:08.320
 Every time we try to say something like, we need more moderate solutions, we need more

2:00:08.320 --> 2:00:13.200
 pluralistic solutions, people will say, wow, you just want to hand us right back into the

2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:14.200
 swamp, don't you?

2:00:14.200 --> 2:00:20.760
 Those swamp people, because the moderates and the swamp people are the same people, right?

2:00:20.760 --> 2:00:23.200
 So then we have these two crazy wings.

2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:25.320
 We can't have crazy right wing people.

2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:27.880
 I don't want any Tiki torch BS.

2:00:27.880 --> 2:00:29.560
 We can't have crazy left wing.

2:00:29.560 --> 2:00:32.000
 Don't attack my courthouse.

2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.320
 Really don't attack my courthouse.

2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:35.320
 And we can't have moderates.

2:00:35.320 --> 2:00:39.760
 It's like, okay, how do we install our children and rape pillage and get these speaking fees

2:00:39.760 --> 2:00:44.920
 when we're out of office and become, you know, cozy with the things when we're supposed

2:00:44.920 --> 2:00:49.280
 to be regulating them and then, you know, become their lobbyists, you know, immediately

2:00:49.280 --> 2:00:51.780
 when we leave office, all of this stuff.

2:00:51.780 --> 2:00:54.120
 We need an entirely different system.

2:00:54.120 --> 2:00:57.200
 And I can't talk about that at the moment.

2:00:57.200 --> 2:01:00.760
 When I talk, people say, oh, wow, so you're going to sit this one out because you're a

2:01:00.760 --> 2:01:02.760
 pussy, because you're a coward.

2:01:02.760 --> 2:01:03.760
 Great to know, Eric.

2:01:03.760 --> 2:01:04.760
 We thought better of you.

2:01:04.760 --> 2:01:06.160
 Buy, click, you know.

2:01:06.160 --> 2:01:07.160
 I don't know what to do.

2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:10.360
 So are you thinking of what to do?

2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:11.360
 Yeah.

2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:13.600
 Oh, you better believe it.

2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:20.440
 Look, Brett had this idea of Unity 2020 and I told him it was a wrong idea.

2:01:20.440 --> 2:01:23.160
 I didn't tell him that Unity 2024 was a wrong idea.

2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:25.880
 I didn't tell him that Unity 2028 is a wrong idea.

2:01:25.880 --> 2:01:29.360
 And if I were to make the case that he was right and I was wrong, because he's now shuttered

2:01:29.360 --> 2:01:31.840
 the thing, right?

2:01:31.840 --> 2:01:37.200
 I would say that the case to be made that he was correct was that by doing this in 2020,

2:01:37.200 --> 2:01:39.520
 we found out what we were up against.

2:01:39.520 --> 2:01:43.960
 It's good to know that Twitter can turn this off at the drop of a hat.

2:01:43.960 --> 2:01:45.200
 Great to know.

2:01:45.200 --> 2:01:53.240
 It's good to know as we learned that you cannot have meetings of presidential candidates in

2:01:53.240 --> 2:01:59.760
 a primary that are not approved of by the party, right?

2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:03.320
 They've got this thing figured out so we don't have any way in.

2:02:03.320 --> 2:02:10.480
 And now Unity 2024 makes sense because Unity 2020 was tried.

2:02:10.480 --> 2:02:16.520
 I don't know that we get to 2024 under all circumstances and some we do and some we don't.

2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:21.000
 There's a game theoretic thing that I'm not sure you're counting for, but you probably

2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:22.000
 are.

2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:30.680
 I just want to make an argument is Jack Dorsey very likely listens to your podcast.

2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:34.680
 And wait, this is the power of these words.

2:02:34.680 --> 2:02:41.980
 Something deep went wrong, but we can change it with the power of words.

2:02:41.980 --> 2:02:44.040
 Something went wrong at Twitter.

2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:46.080
 They have so much division on their platform.

2:02:46.080 --> 2:02:47.160
 It's what I'm trying to say.

2:02:47.160 --> 2:02:48.160
 They've gotten...

2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:49.160
 It's not wrong.

2:02:49.160 --> 2:02:50.160
 They just don't know.

2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:51.160
 They're understaffed.

2:02:51.160 --> 2:02:53.840
 They have an insoluble problem.

2:02:53.840 --> 2:02:54.840
 Difficult to solve.

2:02:54.840 --> 2:02:55.840
 They have an insoluble problem.

2:02:55.840 --> 2:02:58.240
 This is where you and I disagree.

2:02:58.240 --> 2:02:59.240
 Because...

2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:00.240
 All right.

2:03:00.240 --> 2:03:01.240
 Or I'd like to create a competitor.

2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:03.680
 No, so then give it to me.

2:03:03.680 --> 2:03:04.680
 Create the competitor.

2:03:04.680 --> 2:03:08.240
 Show me that you actually have understood this because my guess is that most of the

2:03:08.240 --> 2:03:12.600
 things that you'll think about, I mean, I can tell you things I've talked to Jack about,

2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:15.520
 which I know would make Twitter much better.

2:03:15.520 --> 2:03:23.200
 However, I think that this problem of instantaneous communication across the planet, and you subtract

2:03:23.200 --> 2:03:26.840
 off all sorts of context and mutual self knowledge.

2:03:26.840 --> 2:03:28.360
 The problem is us.

2:03:28.360 --> 2:03:29.920
 It's not the platforms.

2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:34.500
 You're thinking about a technological solution, and I'm saying the problem is, is that we

2:03:34.500 --> 2:03:37.120
 are ultimately the product.

2:03:37.120 --> 2:03:39.120
 And I just disagree with that, and there's a lot of...

2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:40.640
 That's probably could save that for tomorrow.

2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:47.440
 I look forward to spending summers in your villa when you debut this product, and I would

2:03:47.440 --> 2:03:50.560
 love to angel invest in it.

2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:55.200
 By the way, in terms of money, I'll never have a villa.

2:03:55.200 --> 2:03:56.200
 Yeah?

2:03:56.200 --> 2:03:58.520
 No, I will always give away everything I own.

2:03:58.520 --> 2:03:59.520
 Don't do that.

2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:05.200
 No, sorry, invest into things like you mentioned, awesome things.

2:04:05.200 --> 2:04:06.440
 Yeah, yeah.

2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:12.640
 Just fine, but a little bit of avuncular advice.

2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:20.360
 Don't pledge to be the person who disgorges themselves of security.

2:04:20.360 --> 2:04:21.920
 Money is freedom.

2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:22.920
 That's what it is.

2:04:22.920 --> 2:04:26.520
 It's a big hunking pile of freedom.

2:04:26.520 --> 2:04:30.720
 You can choose to use it as the freedom to imprison you, if you don't, so you can use

2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:33.760
 it as freedom to make yourself a prisoner of your money.

2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:39.760
 And generally speaking, Lex, money is freedom, and your voice is important.

2:04:39.760 --> 2:04:46.280
 At least retain the amount of money, security you need to follow Joe's advice.

2:04:46.280 --> 2:04:50.080
 What is the point of FU money if you don't say FU?

2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:55.120
 The number of people who have FU money who don't say FU indicates the number of people

2:04:55.120 --> 2:04:59.160
 who chose the freedom of their wealth to create a prison.

2:04:59.160 --> 2:05:04.040
 They built a prison with the freedom they had, and they walked into it, locked the door.

2:05:04.040 --> 2:05:06.680
 I think it's too difficult not to create.

2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:09.880
 The reason I want to give away the money is because I just know my own psychology and

2:05:09.880 --> 2:05:12.040
 you create prisons.

2:05:12.040 --> 2:05:14.120
 Our human mind just creates those prisons.

2:05:14.120 --> 2:05:21.440
 The FU money is enough for basic shelter and basic food.

2:05:21.440 --> 2:05:23.720
 That's the optimal FU.

2:05:23.720 --> 2:05:26.920
 This is the problem.

2:05:26.920 --> 2:05:35.600
 So this is me, single Lex, speaking, but future Lex, I'm talking to future Lex.

2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:38.200
 Single present Lex, please don't listen.

2:05:38.200 --> 2:05:39.200
 Don't be an ass.

2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:45.280
 You're going to need some money, and don't make these pledges to say on a podcast.

2:05:45.280 --> 2:05:47.040
 I want to save you from yourself.

2:05:47.040 --> 2:05:51.960
 You need money to do many of the beautiful things that we're counting on you to do.

2:05:51.960 --> 2:05:53.360
 Don't eff it up.

2:05:53.360 --> 2:05:58.840
 Can I talk to you about Roger Penderos?

2:05:58.840 --> 2:05:59.840
 Sure.

2:05:59.840 --> 2:06:05.760
 You've talked to Roger on the portal, but also in between the lines and offline, just

2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:08.760
 everything you've said about Roger Penderos.

2:06:08.760 --> 2:06:16.400
 For people who don't know, he just recently, a few days ago, won the 2020, shared the 2020

2:06:16.400 --> 2:06:18.200
 Nobel Prize for physics.

2:06:18.200 --> 2:06:26.240
 But it's clear to me that he had a deep personal impact on you, a connection with you, in terms

2:06:26.240 --> 2:06:30.720
 of both your love of mathematics, just the way you see the world.

2:06:30.720 --> 2:06:32.640
 This is the Eddie Van Halen conversation.

2:06:32.640 --> 2:06:36.040
 This is clearly somebody who's profound in your worldview.

2:06:36.040 --> 2:06:38.000
 Can you talk about Roger?

2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:42.720
 Can you talk about what it means that he won this highest of prizes?

2:06:42.720 --> 2:06:44.400
 Just in general, let's celebrate the man.

2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:45.400
 Yeah.

2:06:45.400 --> 2:06:46.400
 Okay.

2:06:46.400 --> 2:06:49.560
 For the two other people who won this prize, I'm sorry, I just didn't happen to know who

2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:54.360
 they were before they won.

2:06:54.360 --> 2:07:02.360
 Roger is a very, it is not Roger in particular, but the class from which Roger comes that

2:07:02.360 --> 2:07:04.360
 is so important.

2:07:04.360 --> 2:07:18.040
 I would put Roger in the class of Feynman, Einstein, Dirac, Yang, put Witten in there.

2:07:18.040 --> 2:07:25.320
 Witten's a special case, but Witten is weirdly the reverse of the Roger Penderos story, because

2:07:25.320 --> 2:07:32.080
 Witten is the first physicist to win a mathematical fields medal, the highest honor in mathematics.

2:07:32.080 --> 2:07:36.720
 Penderos is in some sense a mathematician who's now won the Nobel Prize, so it's a perfect

2:07:36.720 --> 2:07:41.720
 sort of a couplet.

2:07:41.720 --> 2:07:45.440
 Roger's class means everything to me.

2:07:45.440 --> 2:07:49.520
 That's the highest achievement of the human mind.

2:07:49.520 --> 2:07:56.040
 I'd probably throw Bach in with Feynman and Dirac in company, right?

2:07:56.040 --> 2:07:59.400
 I think that he was so inventive.

2:07:59.400 --> 2:08:01.760
 It was very frustrating to watch this career.

2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:06.160
 It was a little bit frustrating to watch Feynman's career.

2:08:06.160 --> 2:08:16.440
 Feynman was so good, and had he been born at a slightly different time, I believe his

2:08:16.440 --> 2:08:21.480
 claim on physics would be far greater.

2:08:21.480 --> 2:08:26.800
 I feel like Penderos in some sense came up a very difficult path, because Einstein effectively

2:08:26.800 --> 2:08:32.040
 solved most of the most important problems in general relativity right at the beginning.

2:08:32.040 --> 2:08:36.720
 As a result, the children of Einstein are impoverished, because there wasn't as much

2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:42.880
 to pick off of the trees and sell at the market, whereas Bohr and Planck didn't do nearly

2:08:42.880 --> 2:08:47.280
 as good of a job with quantum theory, so there's lots to do in quantum theory.

2:08:47.280 --> 2:08:56.000
 I think that Roger affected me personally by a diagram that I saw in a paper of Herman

2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.240
 Gluck at the University of Pennsylvania.

2:08:58.240 --> 2:09:04.880
 It was the first picture I'd ever seen of the Hopf vibration sketched, and that weirdly

2:09:04.880 --> 2:09:11.280
 I brought that to the Rogan program in order to convey the wonder, it was recapitulating

2:09:11.280 --> 2:09:14.280
 my own journey.

2:09:14.280 --> 2:09:21.040
 I think I probably saw that at age 16 or something, and it just flipped my mind.

2:09:21.040 --> 2:09:23.640
 Roger is incredibly visual, he's incredibly geometric.

2:09:23.640 --> 2:09:29.360
 He's incredibly sui generis, he just does his own thing.

2:09:29.360 --> 2:09:31.200
 He's got lots of bets.

2:09:31.200 --> 2:09:36.520
 None of them had really come through the way you had hoped, and I think they stretched

2:09:36.520 --> 2:09:38.480
 the rules to be blunt about it.

2:09:38.480 --> 2:09:40.480
 To give them the prize.

2:09:40.480 --> 2:09:41.480
 Yeah, I do.

2:09:41.480 --> 2:09:46.120
 You said this thing on Twitter, which is beautiful, that every once in a while comes a human being

2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:52.640
 that gives value to the prize versus the prize giving value to the human.

2:09:52.640 --> 2:09:54.040
 Two different kinds of prizes.

2:09:54.040 --> 2:09:59.320
 The reason that we care about the Nobel Prize isn't because of Alfred Nobel.

2:09:59.320 --> 2:10:11.160
 It's because it came along at the right time to reward Einstein, Dirac, Schrodinger, Feynman.

2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:15.160
 Most of the people who should have won won.

2:10:15.160 --> 2:10:21.680
 Most of the awards are not good in the sense that they don't really follow.

2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:26.800
 The prize is used to rewrite history, that's the problem.

2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:30.600
 You should have a love hate relationship with it, because on the one hand, it does focus

2:10:30.600 --> 2:10:34.880
 the world on what really matters, and on the other hand, it distorts what really matters,

2:10:34.880 --> 2:10:38.080
 and both of those functions take place simultaneously.

2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:42.520
 In this case, I think that they violated their own rules slightly.

2:10:42.520 --> 2:10:50.520
 It wasn't really clearly a case of a prediction and a discovery in the typical fashion, but

2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:56.440
 we better give this award to somebody of that highest caliber to make sure that the prize

2:10:56.440 --> 2:10:59.960
 is fully funded with prestige going forward.

2:10:59.960 --> 2:11:04.480
 That's my weird speculative guess as to what happened.

2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:09.680
 Roger's getting on in years, and the person should be alive.

2:11:09.680 --> 2:11:13.400
 I think they've bent the rules, and I think they couldn't have bent it for a better person,

2:11:13.400 --> 2:11:18.400
 and I hope they will not bend the rules out of weakness, but out of strength in the future.

2:11:18.400 --> 2:11:26.120
 It would be great to get Madame Wu and Emmy Nerder, a posthumous prize along with Doug

2:11:26.120 --> 2:11:35.040
 Prasher, George Sudarshan, and George Zweig, as well as Ernst Stuckelberg, Nobel Prizes.

2:11:35.040 --> 2:11:42.760
 There have been some terrible omissions, the first two being females who revolutionized

2:11:42.760 --> 2:11:45.520
 our view of the world.

2:11:45.520 --> 2:11:51.680
 I take a very dim view of people pushing for prizes for people from ethnic groups or

2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:57.240
 genders or whatever in order to make it plural and inclusive if it's not following the work,

2:11:57.240 --> 2:12:00.920
 and I feel very clear that in a few cases, we know there was a real problem with the

2:12:00.920 --> 2:12:06.360
 Nobel Committee because we have stunning accomplishments.

2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:12.000
 Try to get through a day as a physicist without Nerder's theorem, and try to imagine the universe

2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:17.440
 without Madame Wu's discovery that left and right don't appear to be symmetric.

2:12:17.440 --> 2:12:23.480
 These are terrible omissions, and they're a huge blot on science for not being more

2:12:23.480 --> 2:12:25.040
 inclusive when it matters.

2:12:25.040 --> 2:12:26.040
 Yeah.

2:12:26.040 --> 2:12:30.280
 So just like you said, the Nobel Prize is plagued by omissions as much as...

2:12:30.280 --> 2:12:31.600
 And distortions and dilutions.

2:12:31.600 --> 2:12:35.920
 For example, Dirac and Schrödinger, where I believe, given the prize in the same year,

2:12:35.920 --> 2:12:39.360
 there's no reason that those two people needed to dilute each other.

2:12:39.360 --> 2:12:43.680
 The same thing with Dyson was an omission.

2:12:43.680 --> 2:12:48.960
 Toma Naga probably got included in part because we had an opportunity to show that something

2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:53.760
 had happened on both sides of the Pacific after the war.

2:12:53.760 --> 2:12:58.920
 But I don't think we needed to dilute Weinberg or Feynman or Schwinger.

2:12:58.920 --> 2:13:01.920
 It just makes me somewhat sick.

2:13:01.920 --> 2:13:07.040
 All of these people are such important giants, and it has to do with the field, I think,

2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:12.720
 not wanting to create luminaries and superstars who could have defended the field from budget

2:13:12.720 --> 2:13:15.000
 cuts and worldly pressure.

2:13:15.000 --> 2:13:20.840
 So I think it's really important that we have absolute superstars because we produce superstars.

2:13:20.840 --> 2:13:26.160
 We acknowledge them, we don't dilute them, and that we bend the rules to make sure that

2:13:26.160 --> 2:13:33.080
 the prize stays funded with the prestige that comes from giving it to the Roger Penrose's

2:13:33.080 --> 2:13:36.760
 Albert Einstein's and Paul Dirac's of the world.

2:13:36.760 --> 2:13:39.480
 Can we talk a little bit about evil?

2:13:39.480 --> 2:13:40.480
 Sure.

2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:49.560
 I haven't actually talked to you about this topic, and it's been sitting on my mind mostly

2:13:49.560 --> 2:13:56.680
 because everybody at MIT is quiet about it, which is Jeffrey Epstein.

2:13:56.680 --> 2:14:02.400
 I didn't get a chance to experience what MIT was like at the time when Jeffrey Epstein

2:14:02.400 --> 2:14:15.320
 was part of this, but I'd love to try to understand how evil was allowed to flourish in a place

2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:25.520
 that I love, whether you think, maybe let me ask the question this way, was it the man

2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:35.420
 evil or was the system evil or is evil too strong a word?

2:14:35.420 --> 2:14:44.920
 Because what I see is the presence of this particular human being in the eyes of many

2:14:44.920 --> 2:14:55.360
 destroyed the reputations of many really strong scientists and also weakened the ability

2:14:55.360 --> 2:15:04.040
 to weaken the institution of MIT by making everybody quiet, almost making them unable

2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:10.240
 to say anything interesting or difficult.

2:15:10.240 --> 2:15:11.240
 What is that?

2:15:11.240 --> 2:15:14.360
 What am I supposed to...?

2:15:14.360 --> 2:15:15.360
 We don't know.

2:15:15.360 --> 2:15:16.640
 Why is everyone quiet about Jeffrey?

2:15:16.640 --> 2:15:17.800
 We don't know.

2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:24.520
 Obviously, I want to scream about it too, and I probably have said too much about Jeffrey

2:15:24.520 --> 2:15:25.520
 Epstein.

2:15:25.520 --> 2:15:29.480
 Look, something horrible happened.

2:15:29.480 --> 2:15:37.560
 I don't know what it is, but something horrible happened.

2:15:37.560 --> 2:15:38.560
 One thing that...

2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:39.560
 Okay.

2:15:39.560 --> 2:15:40.560
 Let's just do this.

2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:47.440
 The first thing I need to do is I need to get rid of this woke crap about power differentials.

2:15:47.440 --> 2:15:54.960
 In general, you can talk about...hypergamy and power differentials are Russell conjugates

2:15:54.960 --> 2:16:01.280
 of the same concept, just the way particular proportions and symmetries are mathematically

2:16:01.280 --> 2:16:08.000
 provable to be attractive in females to males.

2:16:08.000 --> 2:16:14.280
 Male attractiveness is largely determined by male competence and ability to amass power

2:16:14.280 --> 2:16:18.240
 and success and all these sorts of things.

2:16:18.240 --> 2:16:25.120
 The relationship between consenting adults is, quite frankly, not something I want to

2:16:25.120 --> 2:16:26.720
 sort out.

2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:37.880
 The relationship between the sexuality of adults and minors, and particularly, there's

2:16:37.880 --> 2:16:46.680
 the 17, 18 issue, that's very different than 12, 13.

2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:52.640
 We're talking about really sick depravity with respect to what appears that Jeffrey

2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:56.160
 Epstein was involved in at some level.

2:16:56.160 --> 2:17:01.240
 I believe this story is super complicated in part because I think one thing which Jeffrey

2:17:01.240 --> 2:17:09.880
 Epstein was doing was providing money, encouragement, and support to scientists.

2:17:09.880 --> 2:17:15.800
 Another thing he was doing, I believe, was giving tax advice to very rich people.

2:17:15.800 --> 2:17:26.280
 I believe another thing he was doing was hooking very wealthy people up with young adult females.

2:17:26.280 --> 2:17:36.440
 Another thing he was doing, I think, was doing stuff with children that will curl your toes.

2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:39.440
 There's an entire spectrum of different stuff.

2:17:39.440 --> 2:17:46.680
 At the moment, nobody can pull apart or deconflate anything because the woke thing comes over

2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:54.000
 it and says, I think it's disgusting that a 43 year old billionaire would be partying

2:17:54.000 --> 2:17:58.520
 with a 23 year old.

2:17:58.520 --> 2:18:00.120
 I don't want to adjudicate that.

2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:05.040
 I'm worried about 12 and 14 year olds that we're not talking about.

2:18:05.040 --> 2:18:08.480
 I don't think MIT was deep into pedophilia.

2:18:08.480 --> 2:18:10.520
 My guess is that that did not happen.

2:18:10.520 --> 2:18:18.280
 I don't think that the scientists were the targets of the really sick depraved stuff.

2:18:18.280 --> 2:18:19.920
 It's my guess.

2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:24.960
 My guess is that what you're looking at was a government construct.

2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:25.960
 It may have been our government.

2:18:25.960 --> 2:18:28.000
 It may have been a joint government project.

2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:29.280
 It may have been somebody else's government.

2:18:29.280 --> 2:18:31.320
 I don't know.

2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:37.120
 I believe that in part, we don't really understand Robert Maxwell.

2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:39.640
 Sorry, who's Robert Maxwell?

2:18:39.640 --> 2:18:44.720
 Gilean Maxwell's father was very active in scientific publishing.

2:18:44.720 --> 2:18:46.520
 I don't know where peer review came from.

2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:50.320
 I would love to run down the relationship between peer review and Robert Maxwell.

2:18:50.320 --> 2:18:56.080
 I would love to run down the missing fortune of Robert Maxwell and the mysterious fortune

2:18:56.080 --> 2:19:00.160
 of Jeffrey Epstein because I don't think Jeffrey Epstein ever ran a hedge fund.

2:19:00.160 --> 2:19:04.920
 I don't think he was a money advisor the way people claimed.

2:19:04.920 --> 2:19:06.560
 There's two things I want to talk about.

2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:13.560
 One is the shallow conversations of woke identity politics that you're referring to

2:19:13.560 --> 2:19:23.480
 seems to be removing everyone's ability to talk about what the hell is this person and

2:19:23.480 --> 2:19:30.160
 how is he allowed, most importantly, to how do we prevent it in the future.

2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:35.840
 From the individual perspective, the question for me is the same question I ask about 1930s

2:19:35.840 --> 2:19:36.840
 Nazi Germany.

2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:41.560
 I've been reading way too much probably or not enough about that period currently is

2:19:41.560 --> 2:19:47.240
 if I was in Germany at that time, what is the heroic action to take?

2:19:47.240 --> 2:19:51.600
 When I think about MIT with Jeffrey Epstein, what is the heroic action to take?

2:19:51.600 --> 2:19:53.520
 We're not talking about virtue signaling action.

2:19:53.520 --> 2:19:57.040
 You wouldn't know what you're up against, Lex.

2:19:57.040 --> 2:19:58.840
 You're not hearing me.

2:19:58.840 --> 2:20:02.680
 The problem here is what was Jeffrey Epstein?

2:20:02.680 --> 2:20:05.920
 That question might be the heroic action to take.

2:20:05.920 --> 2:20:08.320
 I'm just trying to get my first question.

2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:10.960
 You have to map the silence with Jeffrey Epstein.

2:20:10.960 --> 2:20:17.600
 What you're describing is a map of the silence at MIT.

2:20:17.600 --> 2:20:24.160
 Is there a map of the silence in Washington State around Jeffrey Epstein, the Bay Area,

2:20:24.160 --> 2:20:26.160
 New York City?

2:20:26.160 --> 2:20:31.600
 The amount of silence around Jeffrey Epstein should be telling you everything.

2:20:31.600 --> 2:20:36.480
 The number of dogs that don't bark is like nothing we've ever seen.

2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:40.360
 You're exactly correct, but I want to know what is it telling us?

2:20:40.360 --> 2:20:49.600
 Because what is telling me is not some kind of conspiracy, but more a disappointing weakness.

2:20:49.600 --> 2:20:51.160
 Not some kind of conspiracy?

2:20:51.160 --> 2:20:52.880
 It's not some kind of conspiracy.

2:20:52.880 --> 2:20:55.080
 You've got to be kidding.

2:20:55.080 --> 2:20:58.800
 You're so afraid of saying the word conspiracy that you don't think it's a conspiracy?

2:20:58.800 --> 2:21:04.640
 I personally, I just think it's people who I thought were my heroes just being weak.

2:21:04.640 --> 2:21:05.640
 No.

2:21:05.640 --> 2:21:07.520
 Be of good cheer, sir.

2:21:07.520 --> 2:21:09.000
 A cheer?

2:21:09.000 --> 2:21:10.160
 Be of good cheer.

2:21:10.160 --> 2:21:11.160
 Be of good cheer.

2:21:11.160 --> 2:21:12.160
 Yeah.

2:21:12.160 --> 2:21:13.160
 You think that there is a conspiracy?

2:21:13.160 --> 2:21:15.160
 I think there is a conspiracy.

2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:18.480
 I'd be a very impressive one.

2:21:18.480 --> 2:21:20.240
 That's the scale of it.

2:21:20.240 --> 2:21:25.640
 I tend to believe that large scale can only be an emergent phenomena.

2:21:25.640 --> 2:21:26.640
 Really?

2:21:26.640 --> 2:21:28.080
 I find this so fascinating.

2:21:28.080 --> 2:21:29.080
 Yeah.

2:21:29.080 --> 2:21:35.200
 Because I always see you as like a logic and love drive your soul.

2:21:35.200 --> 2:21:36.200
 You're very logical.

2:21:36.200 --> 2:21:37.200
 You're relentless.

2:21:37.200 --> 2:21:38.800
 You've got a lot of love in your heart.

2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:41.840
 I believe that if you would review the video, where is it from?

2:21:41.840 --> 2:21:47.560
 Dubai or Abu Dhabi of the mysterious hit on the hotel guest?

2:21:47.560 --> 2:21:48.560
 Ever seen this thing?

2:21:48.560 --> 2:21:49.560
 Yeah.

2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:50.560
 Oh, it happened.

2:21:50.560 --> 2:21:57.480
 It's the assassination in 2010, 10 years ago of Mahmoud Al Mabou, something like that,

2:21:57.480 --> 2:22:07.600
 in Dubai where I believe 26 separate individuals on multiple teams are shown converging, coming

2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:15.480
 in from all over the world on false passports, pretending to be tennis players or business

2:22:15.480 --> 2:22:19.800
 people or vacationers.

2:22:19.800 --> 2:22:27.960
 All of these teams have different functions, and they murder this guy in his hotel room.

2:22:27.960 --> 2:22:35.240
 The Dubai, I guess, chief of police or security officer was so angered that he put together

2:22:35.240 --> 2:22:39.780
 this amazing video that says, we can completely detail what you did.

2:22:39.780 --> 2:22:42.680
 We caught you on closed circuit TV.

2:22:42.680 --> 2:22:46.880
 We don't know exactly who you are because your disguise is in your false passports.

2:22:46.880 --> 2:22:51.000
 But yeah, 26 people converged to kill one.

2:22:51.000 --> 2:22:53.560
 No, I don't believe you.

2:22:53.560 --> 2:23:02.840
 I don't believe after Cointel Pro, an operation paperclip and Operation Mockingbird.

2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:07.600
 I don't know whether I should even bring up Rex 84.

2:23:07.600 --> 2:23:12.120
 To not believe in conspiracies is an idiocy.

2:23:12.120 --> 2:23:18.200
 You have a sense that evil can be as competent or more competent than…

2:23:18.200 --> 2:23:22.360
 First of all, when evil wants to operate at scale, it needs to make sure that people

2:23:22.360 --> 2:23:25.120
 don't try to figure out evil.

2:23:25.120 --> 2:23:32.380
 When evil operates at scale, from first principles, you have to realize that evil must not want

2:23:32.380 --> 2:23:35.160
 it investigated.

2:23:35.160 --> 2:23:42.240
 The most efficient way to keep yourself from being investigated, if you are an evil institutional

2:23:42.240 --> 2:23:47.720
 player who needs to do this repeatedly, is to invest in a world in which no one can afford

2:23:47.720 --> 2:23:49.960
 to say the word conspiracy.

2:23:49.960 --> 2:23:54.520
 You'll notice that there is a special radioactivity around the word conspiracy.

2:23:54.520 --> 2:23:56.160
 We have provable conspiracies.

2:23:56.160 --> 2:23:57.840
 We have admitted to conspiracies.

2:23:57.840 --> 2:24:00.040
 You have been invited to conspiracy.

2:24:00.040 --> 2:24:02.880
 There is no shortage, conspiracies are everywhere.

2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:04.240
 Some of them are mundane.

2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:12.000
 Some of them are like price fixing cartels or trade groups are generally speaking conspiracies.

2:24:12.000 --> 2:24:19.560
 The first thing you have to realize is that all of us are under a mimetic complex where

2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:22.520
 you can be taken off the chessboard by saying, conspiracy theorists.

2:24:22.520 --> 2:24:23.520
 Good done.

2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:25.040
 It's like a one line proof.

2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:26.240
 We don't have to listen to Rex.

2:24:26.240 --> 2:24:29.520
 He said he was a conspiracy theorist on this show.

2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:32.640
 That is partially distorting our conversation.

2:24:32.640 --> 2:24:37.080
 If you want to ask me about Jeffrey Epstein, you have to agree with me that that is a logical

2:24:37.080 --> 2:24:41.160
 description of what you would have to have if you wanted to commit conspiracies is that

2:24:41.160 --> 2:24:46.400
 you have to make sure that people are dissuaded from investigating this.

2:24:46.400 --> 2:24:52.920
 But it's a very, it's a fascinatingly difficult idea then because the world with conspiracy

2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:59.000
 theories and the world without conspiracy theories to the shallow glance looks the same.

2:24:59.000 --> 2:25:06.120
 Well, my point, there is responsible conspiracy theorizing where you look at the history of

2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:11.280
 unearthed conspiracies and just like you would with any other topic, just think about how

2:25:11.280 --> 2:25:17.280
 different the rules in your mind are for conspiracy theorizing versus X theorizing where X can

2:25:17.280 --> 2:25:20.280
 be anything.

2:25:20.280 --> 2:25:28.840
 If I say to you, I can say the statement that average weight is not the same between

2:25:28.840 --> 2:25:34.800
 widely separated populations, you'd say, yeah, I'd say average height is not the same between

2:25:34.800 --> 2:25:36.320
 widely separated populations.

2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:44.720
 You'd say, yeah, then I say, in fact, no continuous variable that shows variation should be expected

2:25:44.720 --> 2:25:46.800
 to be identical between widely separate.

2:25:46.800 --> 2:25:52.320
 Of course, Eric, like IQ, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, right?

2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:56.800
 So we have a violent reaction to specific topics.

2:25:56.800 --> 2:26:02.960
 So the first thing I want to do is just to notice that conspiracy has that built into

2:26:02.960 --> 2:26:05.240
 everyone's mind.

2:26:05.240 --> 2:26:07.280
 That's really important to state, yeah.

2:26:07.280 --> 2:26:14.000
 It's very interesting that and as a prerequisite, as you're saying, that will be the first step

2:26:14.000 --> 2:26:20.840
 if you wanted to pull off a conspiracy in a competent way, that's you would have to first

2:26:20.840 --> 2:26:21.840
 convince the world of that.

2:26:21.840 --> 2:26:27.680
 I just watched the film 1971 about my favorite conspiracy of all time, I highly recommend

2:26:27.680 --> 2:26:28.680
 it.

2:26:28.680 --> 2:26:29.680
 1971.

2:26:29.680 --> 2:26:34.840
 Well, the film is titled 1971, and it's about the Citizens Committee to Investigate the

2:26:34.840 --> 2:26:43.040
 FBI, which was run by a student of Murray Gelman, a physicist, and broke into FBI offices

2:26:43.040 --> 2:26:48.840
 in Pennsylvania to steal files which allowed freedom of information requests that discovered

2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:49.840
 a huge conspiracy.

2:26:49.840 --> 2:26:55.760
 So it was a conspiracy that unearthed a conspiracy inside the federal government, a double conspiracy

2:26:55.760 --> 2:27:00.680
 story which launched multiple conspiracies.

2:27:00.680 --> 2:27:05.640
 I think that the problem with modern Americans is that they are so timid that they don't

2:27:05.640 --> 2:27:10.920
 even learn about the history of conspiracies that we have absolutely proven.

2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:19.400
 So with that done, Jeff Epstein, in my opinion, represented somebody's construction.

2:27:19.400 --> 2:27:20.400
 I don't think that...

2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:21.400
 Kind of scary to think about.

2:27:21.400 --> 2:27:22.400
 Yeah.

2:27:22.400 --> 2:27:24.960
 Well, what part of the story isn't scary?

2:27:24.960 --> 2:27:31.040
 I in part did something which I imagine may get me destroyed because I was more worried

2:27:31.040 --> 2:27:37.720
 about being destroyed by somebody else I had a conversation with around Jeff Epstein, right?

2:27:37.720 --> 2:27:43.240
 So I'm just trying to let it be known that I don't know anything more than I've already

2:27:43.240 --> 2:27:44.240
 said.

2:27:44.240 --> 2:27:51.600
 Now, your friends at MIT, their problem is that Jeff Epstein showed up as the only person

2:27:51.600 --> 2:27:58.080
 capable of continuing U.S. scientific tradition.

2:27:58.080 --> 2:28:04.240
 You see, the U.S. scientific tradition is a little bit like the Russian.

2:28:04.240 --> 2:28:09.160
 It's combative, okay?

2:28:09.160 --> 2:28:12.400
 And we're a free society and we act like a free society.

2:28:12.400 --> 2:28:15.800
 We're a rich society and we researched like we're a rich society.

2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:16.800
 That is historically.

2:28:16.800 --> 2:28:22.440
 And then came the 1970s and William Proxmire and the Golden Fleece Awards and the idea

2:28:22.440 --> 2:28:23.440
 that we have to...

2:28:23.440 --> 2:28:27.720
 We're paying too much and these are welfare queens and lab coats and blah, blah, blah,

2:28:27.720 --> 2:28:28.720
 blah.

2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:31.440
 We need more transparency, more oversight.

2:28:31.440 --> 2:28:37.440
 Everything went to hell and the national culture of U.S. science was lost.

2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:43.400
 The thing that produced all this prosperity and security and power was lost.

2:28:43.400 --> 2:28:52.840
 And then Jeff Epstein shows up and a tiny number of funders, maybe Fred Cavley, maybe

2:28:52.840 --> 2:28:59.680
 Yuri Milner, maybe who else would be in this category?

2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:05.440
 Peter Thiel to an extent, Howard Hughes would be the largest of these things, which has

2:29:05.440 --> 2:29:11.920
 different grant structures than the NIH, gave people a modicum of risk taking ability.

2:29:11.920 --> 2:29:12.920
 Okay.

2:29:12.920 --> 2:29:20.480
 Well, when Jeff Epstein showed up, everybody wanted to take risk in science and suddenly

2:29:20.480 --> 2:29:24.320
 a charismatic billionaire says, hey, I can make that work for you.

2:29:24.320 --> 2:29:25.760
 Here's $100,000.

2:29:25.760 --> 2:29:27.800
 Go research something crazy.

2:29:27.800 --> 2:29:34.640
 Well, that money was supposed to be provided by the federal government under the terms

2:29:34.640 --> 2:29:39.080
 of the endless frontier compact between the federal government and the universities.

2:29:39.080 --> 2:29:43.800
 And the federal government, the taxpayers welched, okay?

2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:49.100
 So that's one place to lay the blame for Jeff Epstein as at the failure of the federal

2:29:49.100 --> 2:29:55.360
 government to honor its commitment, right?

2:29:55.360 --> 2:29:58.000
 So the universities became psychopathic.

2:29:58.000 --> 2:30:02.460
 It's not like everybody doesn't remember what we're supposed to be doing to be moral,

2:30:02.460 --> 2:30:05.000
 but the point was there wasn't enough money to be moral.

2:30:05.000 --> 2:30:11.480
 So it was time to eye each other as a source of protein, as I like to say.

2:30:11.480 --> 2:30:17.760
 And in that process, Jeffrey Epstein said, hey, come to my world.

2:30:17.760 --> 2:30:22.000
 We can do it like we used to do.

2:30:22.000 --> 2:30:28.880
 So in part, my point is, is that almost none of your colleagues at MIT have that kind of

2:30:28.880 --> 2:30:35.800
 religious commitment to science that they're willing to go down with ship science.

2:30:35.800 --> 2:30:41.120
 The Galileo Galilei thing became very important to science because occasionally you just have

2:30:41.120 --> 2:30:46.160
 to say, look, this isn't about me and you.

2:30:46.160 --> 2:30:50.520
 There isn't enough money in the world to buy the kind of legacy I want to leave to this

2:30:50.520 --> 2:30:51.520
 planet.

2:30:51.520 --> 2:30:55.080
 This is one of the great things about science.

2:30:55.080 --> 2:30:59.040
 You know, potentially it's worth dying for.

2:30:59.040 --> 2:31:03.360
 Yeah, I'm glad you said it.

2:31:03.360 --> 2:31:08.120
 Science is one of the things that is best that's worth dying for.

2:31:08.120 --> 2:31:17.280
 I mean, I'm not eager to murder myself, but I've certainly risked my health, my fortune.

2:31:17.280 --> 2:31:24.160
 You know, I've destroyed myself economically over science.

2:31:24.160 --> 2:31:30.240
 And my need to oppose these sons of bitches in chaired professorships who are destroying

2:31:30.240 --> 2:31:33.000
 our system along with everyone else.

2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:39.040
 Let me bring in Grandmaster Oogway into this.

2:31:39.040 --> 2:31:40.040
 Oogway.

2:31:40.040 --> 2:31:41.040
 Oogway.

2:31:41.040 --> 2:31:42.040
 Master Oogway.

2:31:42.040 --> 2:31:43.880
 I think he's a grandmaster.

2:31:43.880 --> 2:31:46.960
 Oh, that would make him a chess playing turtle.

2:31:46.960 --> 2:31:48.840
 So I've read some Wikipedia.

2:31:48.840 --> 2:31:49.840
 Uh oh.

2:31:49.840 --> 2:31:54.760
 And Shifu is a master, there's apparently only one grandmaster.

2:31:54.760 --> 2:31:55.760
 That's Oogway.

2:31:55.760 --> 2:31:56.760
 Anyway.

2:31:56.760 --> 2:31:59.280
 Is the phrase grandmaster ever uttered in the script?

2:31:59.280 --> 2:32:00.280
 I don't think so.

2:32:00.280 --> 2:32:01.280
 I don't think so.

2:32:01.280 --> 2:32:02.280
 But there's a story.

2:32:02.280 --> 2:32:05.400
 Oh, there's off script canon.

2:32:05.400 --> 2:32:08.800
 I'm going to call Glenberger right now and find out if any of this is true.

2:32:08.800 --> 2:32:09.800
 All right.

2:32:09.800 --> 2:32:14.000
 You're not supposed to call out my journalistic integrity.

2:32:14.000 --> 2:32:15.920
 But Master Oogway.

2:32:15.920 --> 2:32:17.420
 Master Oogway.

2:32:17.420 --> 2:32:20.760
 He says a couple of things I'd like to bring up with you.

2:32:20.760 --> 2:32:31.880
 So one, as part of a longer quote, recommends that you should find a battle worth fighting.

2:32:31.880 --> 2:32:35.840
 We've talked about several battles just now.

2:32:35.840 --> 2:32:38.440
 What is the battle worth fighting for?

2:32:38.440 --> 2:32:43.720
 For Erich Weinstein in the next few months, in the next year?

2:32:43.720 --> 2:32:49.760
 There's only one.

2:32:49.760 --> 2:32:50.760
 It's the Moses.

2:32:50.760 --> 2:32:52.960
 It's the Moses thing.

2:32:52.960 --> 2:32:53.960
 It's time to go.

2:32:53.960 --> 2:32:54.960
 It's time to leave.

2:32:54.960 --> 2:32:57.440
 This place is over to get off the planet.

2:32:57.440 --> 2:33:03.600
 Yeah, I freak people out when I say that, but look at your world.

2:33:03.600 --> 2:33:07.440
 You just got introduced to the problem of a virus.

2:33:07.440 --> 2:33:11.960
 Wait till it's fusion devices and you understand what it means to have one interconnected planet

2:33:11.960 --> 2:33:17.120
 with no uncorrelated experiments happening anywhere else.

2:33:17.120 --> 2:33:28.560
 So do you see the foray, your work in physics, and maybe the echoes of it in ship Elon?

2:33:28.560 --> 2:33:34.920
 Everybody who has a possible plan to avoid what is coming if we don't have one should

2:33:34.920 --> 2:33:40.200
 work on the plan that he, she thinks best.

2:33:40.200 --> 2:33:41.200
 Right?

2:33:41.200 --> 2:33:43.880
 So Elon wants to do rockets.

2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:46.480
 People misinterpret me.

2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:51.720
 Meta Erich says, I don't think that's a smart plan.

2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:59.320
 Regular Erich says all people who have hope should do that thing.

2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:00.320
 Yeah.

2:34:00.320 --> 2:34:01.840
 At least it's Mars, man.

2:34:01.840 --> 2:34:05.040
 At least it's the moon and Mars and maybe Titan and whatever.

2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:07.840
 And I don't think it'll work and it doesn't make sense and it looks silly.

2:34:07.840 --> 2:34:10.000
 But that's exactly the kind of fight worth fighting.

2:34:10.000 --> 2:34:14.560
 But it's the kind of, it's for the same reason that I went on Brett's Unity 2020 thing when

2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:18.280
 I didn't think it had a hope in hell and people are making fun of it.

2:34:18.280 --> 2:34:23.480
 We got to do things that make us feel dumb and silly and childish that possibly have

2:34:23.480 --> 2:34:25.440
 a hope of working.

2:34:25.440 --> 2:34:27.240
 So everybody should do something.

2:34:27.240 --> 2:34:31.720
 My version of this, I'm the most hopeful about because I wouldn't have chosen to do it.

2:34:31.720 --> 2:34:39.000
 If I thought that Daniel Schmockenberger's wisdom project was a better hope, I'd do that.

2:34:39.000 --> 2:34:41.920
 It's more down to earth in a certain way.

2:34:41.920 --> 2:34:43.880
 I just think that it's more probable.

2:34:43.880 --> 2:34:49.560
 Look, we got from a powered flight with the Wright brothers and wind tunnels to sending

2:34:49.560 --> 2:34:56.580
 back images from the surface of Titan via Huygens Cassini in less than a century.

2:34:56.580 --> 2:35:02.720
 What we can do if we can change the laws of physics is something we can't even conceive

2:35:02.720 --> 2:35:03.720
 of.

2:35:03.720 --> 2:35:06.480
 It may be that it buys us nothing.

2:35:06.480 --> 2:35:11.920
 And at least we will know why we died on this planet.

2:35:11.920 --> 2:35:18.120
 As a small aside, I think this is not the right time to take the full journey.

2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:22.640
 But I feel like you'll guide me like Master Wei did.

2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:24.560
 And I'm the Kung Fu Panda at some point.

2:35:24.560 --> 2:35:27.840
 They only have one conversation.

2:35:27.840 --> 2:35:28.840
 We're on our likewise.

2:35:28.840 --> 2:35:29.840
 We didn't.

2:35:29.840 --> 2:35:33.120
 Well, we're Jews and they weren't.

2:35:33.120 --> 2:35:35.060
 So we talked too much.

2:35:35.060 --> 2:35:37.880
 But the guide doesn't have to be with words.

2:35:37.880 --> 2:35:39.840
 You don't think Poe is Jewish?

2:35:39.840 --> 2:35:40.840
 It's debatable.

2:35:40.840 --> 2:35:42.720
 We'll have to go back to the Wikipedia.

2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:43.720
 Really like Poe.

2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:44.720
 Yeah.

2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:45.720
 Okay.

2:35:45.720 --> 2:35:55.560
 Is there that you would guide me through some more intuition about the source code,

2:35:55.560 --> 2:35:58.040
 the source code of our universe?

2:35:58.040 --> 2:36:03.160
 Can you comment on where, since the last book, where your thinking has been, has roamed

2:36:03.160 --> 2:36:08.320
 around geometric unity, around that work in physics, in this fight?

2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:12.680
 Yeah, I'm trying to figure out when to release it and how.

2:36:12.680 --> 2:36:15.440
 I mean, I've released the video.

2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:19.880
 The video, quite honestly, I think it has a very bizarre reaction.

2:36:19.880 --> 2:36:23.200
 I think one of the things that I've learned from the video, because the video is coming

2:36:23.200 --> 2:36:31.040
 up on half a million views on YouTube alone to say nothing of the audio.

2:36:31.040 --> 2:36:34.720
 But yeah, it produced a very strange reaction.

2:36:34.720 --> 2:36:41.440
 One of the things I don't think that I properly understood is that most physicists don't talk

2:36:41.440 --> 2:36:46.680
 in this geometric language.

2:36:46.680 --> 2:36:53.120
 I thought that more of the physics world probably had converted over into manifolds, bundles,

2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:57.160
 differential forms, connections, curvature, tensors, et cetera.

2:36:57.160 --> 2:37:02.240
 And I saw a lot of the comments would say things like, I have a PhD in theoretical physics

2:37:02.240 --> 2:37:05.240
 and I'm not even familiar with all of these concepts.

2:37:05.240 --> 2:37:11.960
 And I think that was probably a distortion coming from living in Cambridge, Massachusetts

2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:14.840
 for almost 20 years.

2:37:14.840 --> 2:37:16.240
 So what's the solution to that?

2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:18.560
 Well, I mean, I can translate it into that.

2:37:18.560 --> 2:37:21.280
 I can make this make as much sense as anybody needs to.

2:37:21.280 --> 2:37:31.000
 My problem is that my calculation is that as long as the boomers are still in charge,

2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:35.880
 the same people have these perverse incentives on them, where they've invested in these programs

2:37:35.880 --> 2:37:36.880
 that didn't work.

2:37:36.880 --> 2:37:41.880
 So they're extremely hostile and difficult to deal with.

2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:47.280
 The fact that I'm not a physicist has its own set of issues, which is that effectively

2:37:47.280 --> 2:37:53.040
 it's like the Hermit Kingdom, they don't get any visitors and they don't necessarily want

2:37:53.040 --> 2:37:56.960
 somebody rolling up and saying, I know how to do physics.

2:37:56.960 --> 2:38:01.800
 So I'm always very clear, I'm not a physicist.

2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:06.160
 That said, if I wait too long, I don't know that theoretical physics is really going to

2:38:06.160 --> 2:38:12.200
 exist after the boomers because everyone in you, I think you had Wolfram on your program.

2:38:12.200 --> 2:38:16.000
 I don't remember whether he said this to you or Brian Keating, but he said something like

2:38:16.000 --> 2:38:17.720
 everybody got discouraged.

2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:19.220
 It was too hard.

2:38:19.220 --> 2:38:21.960
 We can't do that, guys.

2:38:21.960 --> 2:38:23.120
 We cannot do that.

2:38:23.120 --> 2:38:27.480
 There's something about the renormalization revolution that innervated the physics community

2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:31.720
 because it taught them just because you can see in this energy regime doesn't mean you

2:38:31.720 --> 2:38:37.760
 can extrapolate somewhere else unless you understand how coupling constants run and what

2:38:37.760 --> 2:38:41.720
 kind of UV fixed points exist, blah, blah, blah.

2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:46.000
 Somehow that discouraged people from guessing, from believing everything became an effective

2:38:46.000 --> 2:38:47.000
 theory.

2:38:47.000 --> 2:38:51.720
 The beauty of the effective theory wasn't taken to be really the beauty of the universe,

2:38:51.720 --> 2:38:53.400
 just the beauty of an energy level.

2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:58.920
 So I think that renormalization was one of the most important revolutions that ever happened

2:38:58.920 --> 2:39:04.200
 in science and also its interpretation by the physics community was catastrophic.

2:39:04.200 --> 2:39:10.200
 Well, the story I'm telling myself is that in part I'm waiting for them to get weaker,

2:39:10.200 --> 2:39:13.160
 but on the other hand, I don't know that we have any time left.

2:39:13.160 --> 2:39:22.560
 Are you also thinking about ways of, you know, the podcast medium is revolutionary for public,

2:39:22.560 --> 2:39:23.560
 for discourse, for what?

2:39:23.560 --> 2:39:25.920
 I mean, I don't even know the right words for it.

2:39:25.920 --> 2:39:30.720
 Are you thinking of revolutionary ideas for reenergizing the physics community?

2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:33.000
 So basically for communicating geometry.

2:39:33.000 --> 2:39:36.960
 Look, I have a fantasy.

2:39:36.960 --> 2:39:40.040
 My fantasy is that all of these things are the same problem.

2:39:40.040 --> 2:39:46.960
 And it goes back to this thing that I read about in Feynman's books about Tartaglia.

2:39:46.960 --> 2:39:50.080
 They asked him this question, like, what's the greatest thing that ever happened in math?

2:39:50.080 --> 2:39:55.880
 And he says, Tartaglia's solution to the cubic is just like the weirdest answer.

2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:58.120
 So you're like, okay, I'll bite.

2:39:58.120 --> 2:40:00.400
 Why is it Tartaglia's solution to the cubic?

2:40:00.400 --> 2:40:04.280
 And he said, because it was the first time a modern person had done something profound

2:40:04.280 --> 2:40:09.440
 that the ancients had failed to do, it's like, oh, I got it.

2:40:09.440 --> 2:40:14.480
 It's the thing that opens up new psychology that says maybe things are possible again.

2:40:14.480 --> 2:40:19.680
 It's a new orchard, new orchard.

2:40:19.680 --> 2:40:23.840
 New farmers, new people who can find fruit that they can pick.

2:40:23.840 --> 2:40:26.920
 And once you have one person do that, very often you get many.

2:40:26.920 --> 2:40:30.200
 Like one of the things that we were talking about with Eddie Van Halen, the reason that

2:40:30.200 --> 2:40:35.960
 he created a revolution in somebody like Roy Buchanan did not is that you could follow

2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:36.960
 Eddie Van Halen.

2:40:36.960 --> 2:40:38.200
 You couldn't pioneer it.

2:40:38.200 --> 2:40:42.320
 And maybe you couldn't play as well and as cleanly and as fast and as inventively.

2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:44.640
 But you could follow.

2:40:44.640 --> 2:40:48.440
 Once you understand that there is a tapping principle, it was just the beginning of something

2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:53.320
 called percussive guitar.

2:40:53.320 --> 2:41:00.160
 My belief is that once we start innovating in the present, everything will come.

2:41:00.160 --> 2:41:04.080
 Because everything that around us is screwed up.

2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:10.560
 On that, let me, with one last question, bring back Master Ugwe, the probably the most famous

2:41:10.560 --> 2:41:17.640
 quote of his, right, with yesterday's history, tomorrow's a mystery, but today is a gift.

2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:20.080
 That is why it is called the present.

2:41:20.080 --> 2:41:26.400
 It's very beautiful, although I would have gone with quit, don't quit, noodles, don't

2:41:26.400 --> 2:41:27.400
 noodles.

2:41:27.400 --> 2:41:32.280
 I feel like people need to know way too much context to put that to make sense.

2:41:32.280 --> 2:41:35.720
 It's your audience, just to hell with context.

2:41:35.720 --> 2:41:37.280
 Yeah, they'll figure it out.

2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:41.800
 Well, let me ask, what are you grateful for today?

2:41:41.800 --> 2:41:44.040
 What is your present?

2:41:44.040 --> 2:41:50.400
 We've talked about a lot of dark things, but what are you brings you joy to your heart

2:41:50.400 --> 2:41:55.400
 that I can't believe I'm lucky enough to have this?

2:41:55.400 --> 2:42:06.000
 No, Nyla and Zev, my wife, Pia, the fact that we've got our health, all the little things,

2:42:06.000 --> 2:42:08.440
 saying grace after meals.

2:42:08.440 --> 2:42:13.720
 You're coming over for Friday night Shabbat dinner, so we'll bench together and say grace.

2:42:13.720 --> 2:42:24.200
 It's important to just, this bottle of water in front of me, I made a point of just thinking

2:42:24.200 --> 2:42:27.840
 about how wonderful it is that there's a quenching bottle that happens to be placed in front

2:42:27.840 --> 2:42:30.040
 of me because somebody cared.

2:42:30.040 --> 2:42:37.280
 That small thing made a difference to me.

2:42:37.280 --> 2:42:40.800
 I still have strength for the fight so far.

2:42:40.800 --> 2:42:43.040
 I think that's something I'm grateful for.

2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:51.080
 I can't believe that I'm not more beaten down after all of this nonsense.

2:42:51.080 --> 2:42:54.240
 I have the most interesting set of friends.

2:42:54.240 --> 2:42:56.920
 I really do.

2:42:56.920 --> 2:43:02.000
 I'm not that rich by monetary standards, but if there were friend billionaires, Forbes

2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:07.320
 would be all over my ass.

2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:12.600
 I just can't believe who I can talk to at the drop of a hat.

2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:22.480
 I'm really grateful.

2:43:22.480 --> 2:43:29.160
 I think this is the end of something profound, and it's the beginning of whatever is next.

2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:33.240
 Whatever is next could be terminal, whatever is next could be amazing, whatever is next

2:43:33.240 --> 2:43:38.960
 could be a return to the horrors of the early 20th century that doesn't manage to go totally

2:43:38.960 --> 2:43:45.240
 catastrophic but takes hundreds of millions of lives in the process.

2:43:45.240 --> 2:43:50.880
 I'm grateful to having half of my life in the rearview mirror.

2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:56.600
 Maybe it took place in a bubble and maybe it was unsustainable, but it was nice to be

2:43:56.600 --> 2:43:59.320
 able to move around the world without a mask.

2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:05.760
 It was nice to be able to see a little bit of the world even if it was from a cot in

2:44:05.760 --> 2:44:09.320
 a hostel in some country.

2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:11.320
 To fall in love.

2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:12.320
 Absolutely.

2:44:12.320 --> 2:44:15.160
 I mean, it was a good life.

2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:17.800
 Find the last Indian Jewish girl left.

2:44:17.800 --> 2:44:21.000
 Who knew?

2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:22.000
 You're a lucky guy.

2:44:22.000 --> 2:44:23.000
 Well, let me just say...

2:44:23.000 --> 2:44:26.200
 Actually, it's something I wanted to just say before you get to that.

2:44:26.200 --> 2:44:27.200
 Yes.

2:44:27.200 --> 2:44:29.000
 I forgot to say something.

2:44:29.000 --> 2:44:34.480
 Falling in love with an intellectual collaborator is a special thing that not everybody gets

2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:36.320
 a chance to do.

2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:43.960
 I think when I met Pia, I fell deeply in love with her, all her normal characteristics.

2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:50.800
 She and I had an antagonistic relationship around geometry and economics.

2:44:50.800 --> 2:44:55.560
 Then weirdly, just like in a buddy picture where in the first half of the film, they

2:44:55.560 --> 2:44:59.880
 hate each other, the two fields were fighting with each other, cats and dogs.

2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:05.000
 Finally, the sexual tension clearly was so thick you could cut it with a knife.

2:45:05.000 --> 2:45:10.000
 We came up with geometric marginalism, which is this other theory, not geometric unity,

2:45:10.000 --> 2:45:18.960
 which allowed me to inhabit space with somebody who I already knew intimately and had fallen

2:45:18.960 --> 2:45:23.880
 in love with and to see the quality and beauty of their mind and to play and to dance.

2:45:23.880 --> 2:45:28.320
 It's the intellectual version of the tango.

2:45:28.320 --> 2:45:33.200
 One of the most romantic periods of my life that doesn't fall into most people's experience.

2:45:33.200 --> 2:45:38.440
 That was a chance to see something totally unexpected, haven't really had it since because

2:45:38.440 --> 2:45:42.880
 she doesn't want to revisit the material, but something I'm super grateful for that's

2:45:42.880 --> 2:45:45.640
 very particular and unique.

2:45:45.640 --> 2:45:53.760
 But to flip the tables on you for hundreds of thousands, I think millions of people,

2:45:53.760 --> 2:46:02.800
 I can speak, me and them are really grateful, one, that you exist and two, sorry for your

2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:14.200
 podcast and I do hope your voice in some form continues to reverberate, I think, at least

2:46:14.200 --> 2:46:19.920
 in the 2021s and beyond, even if it takes a brief pause.

2:46:19.920 --> 2:46:21.640
 We're pausing at the moment.

2:46:21.640 --> 2:46:27.280
 We've recorded some for future episodes and I'm recording for you, I really appreciate

2:46:27.280 --> 2:46:28.280
 that.

2:46:28.280 --> 2:46:33.960
 I mean, earnestness trades at a discount at the moment because it's easy to make fun

2:46:33.960 --> 2:46:34.960
 of it.

2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:39.000
 One of the things I like best about you is that you and I are both fairly earnest.

2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:45.120
 We may joke and jab, but honestly, there's a project here in a world to win as they say.

2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:52.920
 The thing that I want my and your listeners to know is that I'm not stepping away from

2:46:52.920 --> 2:47:01.240
 the podcast because I don't appreciate that people really want more.

2:47:01.240 --> 2:47:05.240
 This is hugely financially costly to me.

2:47:05.240 --> 2:47:12.480
 I want to make sure you guys are getting the best that I can do and destroying myself

2:47:12.480 --> 2:47:16.080
 right in front of an election, I think Lex is incorrect.

2:47:16.080 --> 2:47:20.360
 I think that the forces that are trying to make sure that there aren't any planes in

2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:27.560
 the sky that aren't either colored red or colored blue is a big danger given how angry

2:47:27.560 --> 2:47:31.600
 I am at the system and I don't want to be removed from the chessboard because if nobody's

2:47:31.600 --> 2:47:33.880
 going to talk about Jeff Epstein, there need to be people.

2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:38.080
 If nobody's going to talk about various things that we've talked about on these programs,

2:47:38.080 --> 2:47:39.880
 I want to make sure that I'm there.

2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:42.360
 Do I think that this is potentially an existential election?

2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:43.360
 Yes.

2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:45.880
 Am I positive that I know that my way to bed is the right way out?

2:47:45.880 --> 2:47:47.400
 No, I'm not.

2:47:47.400 --> 2:47:48.400
 I don't know people.

2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:54.600
 I just don't know and where we are right now seems so dumb and so catastrophic in terms

2:47:54.600 --> 2:48:01.240
 of how it is chewing up smart people that I decided it's really not about cowardice

2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:04.240
 because it's hard for me to restrain myself.

2:48:04.240 --> 2:48:07.880
 I have so many reactions every day.

2:48:07.880 --> 2:48:12.280
 This is really about trying to plan for all of our futures to make sure that I'm around.

2:48:12.280 --> 2:48:16.240
 I had a huge concern that what happened to Brett's articles of unity was going to happen

2:48:16.240 --> 2:48:17.240
 to Brett.

2:48:17.240 --> 2:48:19.360
 It's going to happen to the YouTube channels.

2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:22.880
 I want to make sure that we don't have all of our eggs in one basket.

2:48:22.880 --> 2:48:27.000
 If something goes wrong over there, that's the whole idea of the intellectual dark web,

2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:31.000
 which is at some level a loose confederation.

2:48:31.000 --> 2:48:35.200
 It can become a strong confederation if somebody wants to back it and make it work.

2:48:35.200 --> 2:48:40.360
 It can dissolve so that there really isn't anything.

2:48:40.360 --> 2:48:46.560
 The thing is to be hard to kill because ultimately, when the hit pieces come, they don't come

2:48:46.560 --> 2:48:48.640
 for what it is that they're angry at you about.

2:48:48.640 --> 2:48:51.720
 They come for where they can get you.

2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:58.840
 It's very important that right in front of an election, I think that the desire of the

2:48:58.840 --> 2:49:05.960
 old system to defend itself through reputational destruction is one of the most pernicious aspects

2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:07.360
 of the new America.

2:49:07.360 --> 2:49:14.440
 We have to fight the ability to destroy reputations as a means of institutions keeping individuals

2:49:14.440 --> 2:49:20.280
 with podcasts and the ability to reach millions like through Substack out of their domain.

2:49:20.280 --> 2:49:22.400
 I don't surrender this domain to them.

2:49:22.400 --> 2:49:27.000
 They have plenty of weaponry with which to fight us, and I believe that they could remove

2:49:27.000 --> 2:49:28.640
 you or me in an instant.

2:49:28.640 --> 2:49:32.960
 By the end of today, if they wanted us off the chessboard, we would be off the chessboard.

2:49:32.960 --> 2:49:34.960
 I know that's not your perspective.

2:49:34.960 --> 2:49:41.440
 My goal is to stay here as long as possible to make sure that you have enough of a counterbalancing

2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:48.600
 set of ideas and to let and help other podcasters start.

2:49:48.600 --> 2:49:56.520
 My hope is that that works, but long heroism, short martyrdom is a good motto for anyone,

2:49:56.520 --> 2:50:01.640
 and I try to remember the short martyrdom part of that.

2:50:01.640 --> 2:50:03.200
 First of all, beautifully put.

2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:08.080
 Second of all, wait to end the conversation and the disagreement, which is how you hook

2:50:08.080 --> 2:50:11.280
 them for the next conversation to be continued.

2:50:11.280 --> 2:50:12.280
 When Lex says …

2:50:12.280 --> 2:50:15.440
 Eric, it's a huge honor.

2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:17.080
 Thank you once again.

2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:19.120
 Lex really appreciate every time we get together.

2:50:19.120 --> 2:50:20.120
 Thanks, buddy.

2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:25.280
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Eric Weinstein, and thank you to our sponsors,

2:50:25.280 --> 2:50:30.040
 Grammarly, a service I use in my writing to check spelling, grammar, sentence structure

2:50:30.040 --> 2:50:35.760
 and readability, Sunbasket, a meal delivery service I use to add healthy variety into

2:50:35.760 --> 2:50:43.400
 my culinary life, SEM Rush, the most advanced SEO optimization tool I've ever come across.

2:50:43.400 --> 2:50:46.440
 I don't like looking at numbers, but someone should.

2:50:46.440 --> 2:50:48.640
 It helps you make good decisions.

2:50:48.640 --> 2:50:54.520
 And finally, ExpressVPN, the VPN I've used for many years to protect my privacy on the

2:50:54.520 --> 2:50:55.960
 internet.

2:50:55.960 --> 2:51:00.760

2:51:12.200 --> 2:51:18.520
 And now, let me leave you with some words from Leonard Cohen in the song titled, Hallelujah.

2:51:18.520 --> 2:51:25.280
 Well, maybe there's a God above, but all I've ever learned from love was how to shoot somebody

2:51:25.280 --> 2:51:27.000
 who outdrew you.

2:51:27.000 --> 2:51:30.600
 And it's not a cry that you hear at night.

2:51:30.600 --> 2:51:37.880
 It's not somebody who's seen the light, it's a cold, and it's a broken hallelujah.

2:51:37.880 --> 2:51:50.000
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
