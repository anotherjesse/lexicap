00:00.000 --> 00:06.520
 The following is a conversation with Ben Askren, wrestler, MMA fighter, and a brilliant,

00:06.520 --> 00:12.200
 opinionated, and fun personality in the world of martial arts, and yes, he occasionally

00:12.200 --> 00:14.840
 likes to talk a little trash.

00:14.840 --> 00:22.320
 Given his wild online antics and his boxing match with Jake Paul, some people may forget

00:22.320 --> 00:29.040
 just how dominant he was in the sport of wrestling and in MMA for most of his career.

00:29.040 --> 00:36.320
 In wrestling, he is a two time NCAA division one national champion and four time finalist.

00:36.320 --> 00:41.440
 In mixed martial arts, he went undefeated for 10 years with the record of 19 and 0 before

00:41.440 --> 00:47.400
 losing to Jorge Mazvedal with the flying knee that caught everyone by surprise.

00:47.400 --> 00:53.400
 He's also into cryptocurrency, disc golf, and is the cohost of Flow Wrestling Radio

00:53.400 --> 00:55.000
 Live.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.180

01:00.840 --> 01:06.760
 And now, here's my conversation with Ben Askren.

01:06.760 --> 01:12.200
 Before we talk about your incredible wrestling career, your MMA career, let me ask you,

01:12.200 --> 01:17.280
 I have to ask you, what did you think about the Jake Paul versus Tyron Woodley fight?

01:17.280 --> 01:20.720
 Well, I thought, I mean, I was in bias.

01:20.720 --> 01:26.920
 I thought Tyron one, I had five rounds of three, and again, this maybe this is my bias

01:26.920 --> 01:27.920
 in the way I was seeing it.

01:27.920 --> 01:31.640
 I thought he was more effective with the striking and he was more aggressive, no, Jake had more

01:31.640 --> 01:36.080
 volume, but that was the only thing I would give him.

01:36.080 --> 01:38.120
 And I guess a lot of people just didn't see it that way.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.080
 They thought he landed more significantly more punches.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.840
 I just didn't think I really did any damage.

01:42.840 --> 01:44.640
 It was a split decision.

01:44.640 --> 01:45.640
 Split decision.

01:45.640 --> 01:46.640
 Yeah.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.640
 Were you surprised?

01:47.640 --> 01:53.680
 Well, it was the thing, so the thing I said when I went in to fight him, I said, maybe

01:53.680 --> 01:54.680
 he's good.

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
 Maybe he's not.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.040
 We really have no idea to this point, you know?

01:58.040 --> 02:02.200
 And so I knew Tyron was a lot better boxing than I was.

02:02.200 --> 02:08.120
 And so I thought, okay, Tyron's, I think he's a good likely that Tyron beats him up.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.640
 But there's a chance that Jake's kind of good at this.

02:10.640 --> 02:13.800
 And I think that's kind of what played out is he's kind of good at it.

02:13.800 --> 02:18.000
 And if you saw it the way I saw it, he still was impressive in his showing and he's obviously

02:18.000 --> 02:19.400
 put a lot of time into it.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.400
 So he's, he's not bad.

02:21.400 --> 02:23.560
 We'll say that much, you know?

02:23.560 --> 02:30.720
 But isn't it surprising to you that like a elite level athlete, combat athlete, lost

02:30.720 --> 02:36.280
 to somebody who just takes it really seriously, but is nevertheless not elite level?

02:36.280 --> 02:37.280
 Hmm.

02:37.280 --> 02:39.640
 But I think boxing is a really specific rule set.

02:39.640 --> 02:41.920
 So I'll speak about Tyron, not myself.

02:41.920 --> 02:47.880
 Tyron had good striking, but obviously it was his first boxing match ever.

02:47.880 --> 02:52.280
 And within mixed martial arts, you have the fear of the takedown and the fear of the kick

02:52.280 --> 02:55.000
 and fear of other things to go along with the punching.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.400
 And so if you look at Tyron throughout his MMA career, a lot of times what set up his

02:59.400 --> 03:04.440
 punches were like level change fakes at a takedown, they dropped, boom, and then something

03:04.440 --> 03:05.960
 comes over the top, right?

03:05.960 --> 03:09.320
 So there's many more elements to worry about in mixed martial arts where as boxing there's

03:09.320 --> 03:10.560
 only one.

03:10.560 --> 03:13.760
 If it was his first fight, yes, I thought Tyron was going to win.

03:13.760 --> 03:14.840
 I thought this was going to happen.

03:14.840 --> 03:19.360
 But like I said, I mean, it's pretty evident that Jake's, he's not bad at boxing.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.360
 He's pretty solid, you know?

03:20.360 --> 03:23.360
 He gets in there and works hard at it, I guess.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.200
 How did ten times, how many times do you think Jake wins?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.200
 I guess Tyron.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.280
 I guess Tyron.

03:28.280 --> 03:29.280
 Hmm.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.080
 If they fight again and again and again, like iterative.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.080
 Yeah.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.680
 So I mean, part of the thing is, okay, so Jake's corner said you need to knock out going into

03:37.680 --> 03:38.680
 the eighth round, right?

03:38.680 --> 03:42.960
 So I think they thought, maybe they're trying to motivate him, but I don't see it that way

03:42.960 --> 03:46.760
 because if they were actually thought that he was winning, why would they encourage him

03:46.760 --> 03:49.800
 to take a dumb risk when Tyron has clearly his knockout power, right?

03:49.800 --> 03:53.120
 It's a really stupid coaching philosophy if that's what you're thinking.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.320
 So you obviously are thinking, hey, this is actually in the balance, it's competitive.

03:57.320 --> 04:02.800
 And I feel like Tyron thought maybe he was winning and didn't have the urgency necessary.

04:02.800 --> 04:06.760
 And so I think there's a chance he turns it up a lot.

04:06.760 --> 04:07.760
 Hmm.

04:07.760 --> 04:12.800
 Man, I would want to watch him again before I, so I have this problem with my personality.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.440
 Here's my personality, Lex.

04:14.440 --> 04:17.720
 I have an issue with not being able to give really exact answers.

04:17.720 --> 04:22.440
 So I hate giving you an answer that like, I don't feel like is 100% calculated.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.800
 So I would like to see them go once more because I would like to see, hey, can Tyron, if, because

04:26.800 --> 04:30.560
 if Tyron can turn the pace and Jake can't handle it, then I think it's an eight, one

04:30.560 --> 04:32.840
 or nine, two, right?

04:32.840 --> 04:36.560
 If it goes the exact same way and maybe Tyron was a close split decision, I'm saying, oh,

04:36.560 --> 04:38.360
 it's probably going to be close every single time.

04:38.360 --> 04:41.200
 We're probably going to get a five to five type of thing, you know?

04:41.200 --> 04:46.920
 So it's like, I feel like out of one match, it's not totally indicative of what the future

04:46.920 --> 04:47.920
 is going to look like.

04:47.920 --> 04:52.200
 I feel like Tyron would get a knockout and then you would still be in the same place.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.640
 Like not, not knowing, not knowing what to predict.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.640
 Yeah.

04:56.640 --> 04:57.640
 Okay.

04:57.640 --> 05:03.560
 So your fight with Jake Paul, looking back, you ever had a little bit of time now.

05:03.560 --> 05:06.680
 How would you analyze that fight?

05:06.680 --> 05:10.880
 Oh, well, I mean, the fight specifically, I got cracked with an overhand right.

05:10.880 --> 05:14.160
 So I mean, it kind of sucks.

05:14.160 --> 05:19.720
 I would say, you know, and this is where I was like, I don't, I really don't care.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.880
 And everyone's like, why would you get me to turn to your reputation?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.600
 It's like, well, I wanted to do it.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.080
 I had an enjoyable time training and in the buildup.

05:26.080 --> 05:29.840
 Obviously, I wasn't skillful enough to, to get the win.

05:29.840 --> 05:33.600
 I did it even, even despite the fact that I know what's going to happen, what happened,

05:33.600 --> 05:37.000
 if someone asked me to do it again, I probably would have done it again, you know.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.000
 And so the way I was thinking about when I was starting, whether to do it or not, because

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
 I got the offer.

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
 It's like, okay, is this money, it can change my life.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.160
 Yeah, it could, right?

05:46.160 --> 05:49.960
 It's not going to double my net worth, but it's going to add significantly and make

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
 my life easier.

05:50.960 --> 05:54.320
 Number two is like, when I was in high school, we used to do boxing matches for free just

05:54.320 --> 05:55.320
 because we thought it was fun.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.200
 We didn't have something going on Friday night.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.160
 Me and my buddies would get together and we had some boxing goes to my base and we'd

06:00.160 --> 06:01.800
 punch each other in the head.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.200
 So it's like, for something I think is enjoyable and not going to pay me a whole bunch of

06:04.200 --> 06:05.200
 money.

06:05.200 --> 06:06.200
 Yeah, sure.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.600
 I'll do it.

06:07.600 --> 06:12.560
 Would you, do you think if you got the rematch, if you did the rematch, would you, what are

06:12.560 --> 06:13.560
 the odds you win?

06:13.560 --> 06:14.560
 Okay, let's see.

06:14.560 --> 06:15.560
 Probably not very good.

06:15.560 --> 06:17.800
 I think he's pretty good actually and I'm not very good.

06:17.800 --> 06:22.120
 Now it's probably at a low point for me because, so when I started training for that, I was

06:22.120 --> 06:24.080
 like 215 pounds, which is the heaviest I've ever been.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.600
 I came off my hip surgery.

06:25.600 --> 06:31.600
 Like when I said, yes, like I'll do it, like I literally started working out like the week

06:31.600 --> 06:35.680
 before for the first time in my, you know, it's just a surgery because I wasn't able

06:35.680 --> 06:37.280
 to do anything.

06:37.280 --> 06:39.920
 So could I, could I perform better?

06:39.920 --> 06:40.920
 Yeah.

06:40.920 --> 06:44.040
 But now after watching him box Tyron, like if you ask me, Ben, can you beat Tyron?

06:44.040 --> 06:45.040
 Probably not.

06:45.040 --> 06:48.080
 But I don't think I can beat Tyron.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.080
 So in boxing.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.080
 In boxing.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.080
 Correct.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
 In boxing.

06:52.080 --> 06:53.080
 Yeah.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.560
 So my chances of beating him, you know, and watching that card, it's like, damn, like,

06:55.560 --> 06:59.160
 it's kind of be fun to box someone who I know sucks, who I know can beat.

06:59.160 --> 07:04.000
 That's what would be fun, you know, because like the training, the preparation was fun.

07:04.000 --> 07:08.880
 But then obviously, I got my butt kicked that sucked, you know, because we're on this podcast.

07:08.880 --> 07:09.880
 Yeah, of course.

07:09.880 --> 07:10.880
 Okay.

07:10.880 --> 07:11.880
 Well, I was going to drop an F5, but I wasn't quite sure.

07:11.880 --> 07:12.880
 I think it sucked.

07:12.880 --> 07:16.880
 Is this where you could, you could drop all, all of the F bombs you want.

07:16.880 --> 07:23.840
 So preparation wise, do you think you were more prepared for that fight or the, the Jordan

07:23.840 --> 07:25.840
 boroughs exhibition?

07:25.840 --> 07:29.800
 I mean, like, how did you approach it mentally?

07:29.800 --> 07:30.800
 You know?

07:30.800 --> 07:33.560
 Well, the boroughs thing, I, I obviously, it's okay.

07:33.560 --> 07:39.120
 So when I retired the first time in 2017, boroughs was the only current, like, we'll

07:39.120 --> 07:42.120
 say really elite level wrestling that I'd never trained with.

07:42.120 --> 07:45.120
 I was really good friends with the Nebraska head of the coach, still am.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.520
 And I said, Hey, I just want, I'm going to pay my own way.

07:47.520 --> 07:50.200
 I want to come down and train with Jordan because I want to see what it feels like.

07:50.200 --> 07:51.600
 You know, I want to, I want to get in there and mix it up.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.080
 I've mixed it up with David Taylor and Kyle Dake.

07:54.080 --> 07:57.440
 I mean, there's just something about wrestling that I love.

07:57.440 --> 08:01.720
 And so I flew myself down there in January of 2018 and I spent four days training with

08:01.720 --> 08:02.720
 Jordan.

08:02.720 --> 08:03.720
 It was a really good time.

08:03.720 --> 08:08.360
 It gave me some great insight into how he thinks and, you know, what a great champion

08:08.360 --> 08:09.360
 he is.

08:09.360 --> 08:10.360
 What was the like training with him?

08:10.360 --> 08:12.160
 Like what, can you give some insights?

08:12.160 --> 08:13.160
 Yeah, of course.

08:13.160 --> 08:18.600
 Like what the, like how hard is the, the live training?

08:18.600 --> 08:19.600
 Is it more drilling?

08:19.600 --> 08:20.600
 Is it technical?

08:20.600 --> 08:25.080
 How does his, it seems like his style is very different than yours.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.400
 So how does that match up in the room in terms of like what you learn from each other, that

08:29.400 --> 08:30.400
 kind of thing?

08:30.400 --> 08:33.840
 We only went full live for one, I think it was like a 12 or 15 minute go where it was

08:33.840 --> 08:36.440
 just go wrestle.

08:36.440 --> 08:42.000
 We did a bunch of simulated live, but obviously he, he had, so I was a senior in college and

08:42.000 --> 08:45.080
 he was a freshman in Nebraska and so we, our teams had dueled each other.

08:45.080 --> 08:50.320
 He was obviously a lot smaller at that point in time, but he had followed my career.

08:50.320 --> 08:54.520
 And so when I went in there, it was like, Hey, I know you're really good at this position.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.520
 What about this position?

08:55.520 --> 08:56.520
 What are you trying to do?

08:56.520 --> 08:57.880
 How exactly does it work?

08:57.880 --> 08:59.440
 And then let's wrestle there.

08:59.440 --> 09:00.440
 You know?

09:00.440 --> 09:01.800
 And then, Hey, what about this position?

09:01.800 --> 09:07.760
 And so, you know, we would spend 30 to 40 minutes talking about that position on the

09:07.760 --> 09:12.160
 ground or, it was like, uh, when was the chest strap, it wasn't my headlock, one was, uh,

09:12.160 --> 09:16.960
 I don't know, it's called the, we called the lightning dump, but it's a lightning dump.

09:16.960 --> 09:17.960
 Yeah.

09:17.960 --> 09:20.560
 So my buddy's name was lightning Luke Smith in high school and he was the first person

09:20.560 --> 09:21.560
 I saw do it.

09:21.560 --> 09:25.040
 So usually when I see someone do something, then I name that move after them.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.040
 Got it.

09:26.040 --> 09:27.760
 Um, I don't know, right?

09:27.760 --> 09:28.760
 Great name.

09:28.760 --> 09:29.760
 It's a good name.

09:29.760 --> 09:30.760
 So, uh, yeah.

09:30.760 --> 09:33.520
 But so what I said with that is like, he was still trying to be the best in the world.

09:33.520 --> 09:39.120
 I was just trying to go work out Jordan Burroughs cause I enjoyed wrestling, um, is like someone

09:39.120 --> 09:44.480
 who at that point when he has five world titles at that four or five at that point a lot.

09:44.480 --> 09:48.160
 And so I use it in my high school kids is like, Hey, this is the guy who's the best in

09:48.160 --> 09:50.800
 the world, who's bringing someone in and saying, well, how do I do this?

09:50.800 --> 09:51.800
 How do I do that?

09:51.800 --> 09:52.800
 What about this?

09:52.800 --> 09:53.800
 What about that?

09:53.800 --> 09:58.360
 And so the level of inquisitive, inquisitive, that's a hard word, inquisitiveness he has

09:58.360 --> 09:59.600
 is really impressive.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.000
 And then it's obvious why he got to the level he did because he's figuring out all these

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
 little situations.

10:04.000 --> 10:08.400
 And that's honestly one of the biggest things I think wrestlers, a lot of wrestlers fail

10:08.400 --> 10:10.160
 to do as they get older.

10:10.160 --> 10:13.080
 Even when they get to early college age, they say, this is my style.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.080
 This is what I do.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.520
 I'm going to lift and work out hard.

10:16.520 --> 10:20.680
 And I'm, and I'm not going to add anything to my game, you know, whereas you've seen

10:20.680 --> 10:24.600
 many progressions in Jordan Burroughs game, he just made his 10th world team.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.600
 And you, yeah.

10:25.600 --> 10:29.760
 And I, you know, if you have a really keen eye, you've been able to watch him change.

10:29.760 --> 10:32.360
 You know, so I've been watching him since 2007.

10:32.360 --> 10:38.960
 He's changed so much and obviously still maintained a world class level almost the entire time.

10:38.960 --> 10:40.920
 When you say change, like what changed?

10:40.920 --> 10:42.520
 Cause he's, he's got that double leg.

10:42.520 --> 10:43.520
 Yeah.

10:43.520 --> 10:44.520
 I didn't get that one anymore.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.520
 Was that?

10:45.520 --> 10:48.120
 He like hit his double leg for the first time against Alex Deer, he hadn't hit it in years.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.120
 Hmm.

10:49.120 --> 10:50.120
 Yeah.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.160
 So that's like, when people think about Jordan Burroughs, they think about the double leg

10:52.160 --> 10:55.880
 because in his early years, fire, he had a great double leg, right?

10:55.880 --> 11:00.720
 And even in the, so in those years, I would say the, the biggest thing with Jordan Burroughs

11:00.720 --> 11:04.160
 double leg wasn't his level of explosiveness.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.880
 It was his level of persistence.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.600
 He would shoot and shoot and shoot and shoot.

11:08.600 --> 11:12.000
 And it would, a lot of times it would be from fun, creative angles and out of scams, boop,

11:12.000 --> 11:15.480
 all things on you, you know, and it was just, he was just super persistent with it.

11:15.480 --> 11:17.680
 And I think that was probably the key.

11:17.680 --> 11:21.480
 And then you saw, you know, when he came out to the, one of the first world championships

11:21.480 --> 11:24.320
 in 2011, it was kind of that type of mentality.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.080
 And then shortly after then, obviously everyone was starting to lower their stance getting

11:27.080 --> 11:30.760
 lower and he developed a really good like mantis go behind series where he would go

11:30.760 --> 11:32.480
 one way or the other way.

11:32.480 --> 11:36.760
 Then he started developing really good, like low single ankle pick type thing, you know,

11:36.760 --> 11:41.960
 and then his hand, his hand fighting got really tremendous, like 15, 16, 17, his hand fighting

11:41.960 --> 11:43.240
 was really good.

11:43.240 --> 11:47.400
 And now I just commented at the 21 trials, like a few of the defensive sequences he got

11:47.400 --> 11:51.360
 into is like, holy shit, like just not from an athletics standpoint, from a technical

11:51.360 --> 11:53.880
 standpoint, the things he were doing was just tremendous.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.640
 So I've seen him as someone like who's continued to reinvent themselves over the course of

11:58.640 --> 12:05.720
 the last 10, 12 years, especially in the, as a junior and senior in college, you're exceptionally

12:05.720 --> 12:06.720
 dominant.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.720
 Yeah.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.560
 If you were to face him at the peak, both of your peaks of NCAA wrestling, could you

12:11.560 --> 12:13.520
 beat him?

12:13.520 --> 12:17.360
 And if you can beat him, well, of course you can beat him.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.360
 Yeah.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.720
 How do you solve the Jordan Barrow's problem?

12:20.720 --> 12:26.640
 Well, so for a, a folks out wrestling standpoint, folks out, so, you know, he, he had some competitive

12:26.640 --> 12:30.880
 matches, a junior senior year, he had a two one win over, or maybe three, two over Michael

12:30.880 --> 12:34.600
 Chandler, who was my teammate who's fighting, you'll see now, he had a two and one over

12:34.600 --> 12:36.800
 title called well.

12:36.800 --> 12:41.520
 So I think you can glean some insight into that, you know, he got ridden, he got so mad

12:41.520 --> 12:42.520
 about this up on the podcast.

12:42.520 --> 12:45.400
 So during Corona, we had to make up all kinds of bullshit to talk about.

12:45.400 --> 12:46.400
 Yeah.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.320
 And we were doing like the last 10 years, best 165s.

12:49.320 --> 12:51.400
 And I said, Kyle Dake would ride him for over a minute.

12:51.400 --> 12:52.400
 Oh, wow.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.080
 He got so mad, he wanted to come on the podcast the next day.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.880
 So hopefully he doesn't listen to this like, fuck you, man.

12:56.880 --> 12:59.000
 You know, but you know,

12:59.000 --> 13:00.000
 When was this?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.000
 This is during Corona.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.000
 Corona last year.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
 He got mad.

13:03.000 --> 13:04.000
 We were talking about, we were.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.000
 Before the trials.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
 Yeah.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
 Correct.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.000
 Yeah.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.800
 So, you know, Michael Chandler wrote him for two minutes plus and that was his junior

13:09.800 --> 13:14.120
 year, not a senior year, sure, right, but it's close.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.520
 So I think there's some things there.

13:15.520 --> 13:19.240
 I think the interesting thing would be if, if I would have stuck around, right?

13:19.240 --> 13:23.120
 So I chose to go into mixed martial arts after a dozen eight, I would have been 74 and he

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
 would have been 74.

13:24.120 --> 13:25.120
 So we would have had a wrestle.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.720
 And then I think that the freestyle Jordan Burroughs puzzle is a lot more difficult to

13:28.720 --> 13:31.160
 solve than the folk style Jordan Burroughs puzzle.

13:31.160 --> 13:35.040
 And I think, I don't think he would, I think he would acknowledge that he's much better

13:35.040 --> 13:39.280
 at freestyle than he was at folk style, you know, although he was very good, he's better.

13:39.280 --> 13:44.480
 This is like raw speed, explosiveness, present a problem to you.

13:44.480 --> 13:50.720
 Well, so he was never, I mean, he didn't really excel on the mat in kind of either style in

13:50.720 --> 13:51.720
 freestyle.

13:51.720 --> 13:54.800
 He has got some good lace transitions, but in folk style, like his whole, like in his

13:54.800 --> 13:59.400
 entire college career, I think he has like 10 pins, which is almost nothing, you know?

13:59.400 --> 14:03.320
 So he was getting no value off the top position.

14:03.320 --> 14:07.360
 He was good enough on most people to get off bottom without it being an issue, but it wasn't

14:07.360 --> 14:08.360
 like, oh my gosh.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.160
 This is an area where we really have to be careful.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.840
 There's a lot of things here.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.040
 You know, it's just, he wasn't gaining value there.

14:14.040 --> 14:18.680
 Whereas in freestyle, he, I don't want to say never, but the amount of times he gets turned

14:18.680 --> 14:21.680
 is incredibly rare, very, very rare.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.200
 And he does have a lace transition, so he gets a lot of points there.

14:24.200 --> 14:30.240
 So, and obviously freestyle is, it can be geared way more in the neutral position, right?

14:30.240 --> 14:31.760
 Where we're only doing takedowns.

14:31.760 --> 14:32.760
 So yeah.

14:32.760 --> 14:38.480
 Were you surprised that he lost to Dake in the trials, to Kyle Dake?

14:38.480 --> 14:41.120
 Oh, Kyle's so, so he's so good, right?

14:41.120 --> 14:46.800
 I mean, I think, I think his performance in the Olympics was, was, his loss then was,

14:46.800 --> 14:50.200
 was shocking to, I mean, we noticed that happened to Kyle Dake, you know?

14:50.200 --> 14:54.200
 He's been a guy who's competed with Jordan Burroughs for ever, and obviously he was on

14:54.200 --> 14:58.160
 the losing side for a while, and now he's on the winning side.

14:58.160 --> 15:01.840
 But I think a lot of people thought it was a coin flip, and I think actually Kyle Dake

15:01.840 --> 15:04.720
 made it feel like it's not a coin flip.

15:04.720 --> 15:09.080
 Now, to me, it feels like Kyle Dake is going to win that match significantly more times

15:09.080 --> 15:11.360
 than he isn't, is what it feels like.

15:11.360 --> 15:12.360
 Yeah.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.440
 I forgot which trials it was.

15:14.440 --> 15:23.240
 Was it four years ago, where Kyle Dake threw him, like he, he, you saw in clings of like,

15:23.240 --> 15:27.160
 oh wow, there might be eventually a changing of the guard.

15:27.160 --> 15:28.160
 Yeah.

15:28.160 --> 15:35.240
 In 19, Kyle came out and he had the one throw, but then he lost one of the matches decisively.

15:35.240 --> 15:38.080
 And then he was hurting 14.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.320
 And in 16, Kyle Dake actually went up to 86 kilograms.

15:41.320 --> 15:46.520
 So in, actually in 16, at the trials we had, so Jake Herbert was number one seed.

15:46.520 --> 15:50.280
 He was former, as Guy Russell was a former world silver medalist.

15:50.280 --> 15:54.320
 So you had David Taylor, who had not made a team yet, who is now a world champion, Olympic

15:54.320 --> 15:55.320
 champion.

15:55.320 --> 15:59.120
 Dake in the bracket, who was a two time world champion now.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.560
 And you had Jayden Cox in the bracket, who had not made any teams yet, but is now, what,

16:02.560 --> 16:05.120
 a four time world medalist, two time world champion.

16:05.120 --> 16:08.520
 So, and then obviously Jayden came out on top of that, won his first Olympic medal,

16:08.520 --> 16:10.720
 Olympic bronze medal.

16:10.720 --> 16:18.440
 So Kyle didn't wrestle Jordan in 16, and Jordan, Kyle's contention the whole time,

16:18.440 --> 16:19.440
 and they argued about this.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.440
 So I actually did a little bit of backstabbing, but it was not, it's not backstabbing.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.440
 And both of them were just one.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.440
 I didn't tell any of them.

16:24.440 --> 16:25.440
 Okay.

16:25.440 --> 16:26.440
 So Jordan got mad.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.360
 So we were talking about this fake match during Corona, right?

16:28.360 --> 16:29.360
 Yeah.

16:29.360 --> 16:30.360
 We had to make, we had to make up something to talk about.

16:30.360 --> 16:31.360
 Yeah, of course.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.520
 This is obviously no matches.

16:32.520 --> 16:34.080
 So we talked about this fake match.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.280
 And do you stand behind that statement, by the way?

16:36.280 --> 16:37.600
 Listen, here's what I said.

16:37.600 --> 16:39.720
 Kyle, Kyle Dake is four time NCAA champion.

16:39.720 --> 16:40.720
 Yes.

16:40.720 --> 16:42.240
 I said, you got to pick a, you got to pick a winner.

16:42.240 --> 16:46.680
 I said, Kyle Dake wins two, one on a minute and six ride time, which I mean, is literally,

16:46.680 --> 16:51.280
 we're talking as close as it gets, as close as it gets for Kyle Dake who's a four time

16:51.280 --> 16:52.280
 NCAA champion.

16:52.280 --> 16:56.520
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry, we were talking over Jordan Barrow's, over Jordan Barrow's, in

16:56.520 --> 16:57.520
 a Folk Style match.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.520
 In a Folk Style match.

16:58.520 --> 16:59.520
 The Hypothetical.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.520
 The Hypothetical.

17:00.520 --> 17:01.520
 Completely Hypothetical.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.520
 Now or in college?

17:02.520 --> 17:03.520
 In college.

17:03.520 --> 17:04.520
 In college.

17:04.520 --> 17:05.520
 Both of them at their peaks at 165 pounds.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.520
 Right.

17:06.520 --> 17:07.520
 So completely Hypothetical.

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
 And so Jordan called in.

17:08.520 --> 17:11.880
 He was all pissed at me for picking Kyle Dake.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.760
 He wants to come on the next day and argue his point.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.760
 So I said, that's that, that's dumb.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.760
 We had to pick a winner.

17:17.760 --> 17:19.200
 We had to do something hypothetical.

17:19.200 --> 17:22.120
 So then I called Kyle Dake and I said, Kyle, Jordan's going to come on and argue his case

17:22.120 --> 17:23.120
 in the morning.

17:23.120 --> 17:26.400
 If he's going to do that, why don't you come in and argue your case?

17:26.400 --> 17:29.480
 So no one else knew Kyle was coming on the podcast.

17:29.480 --> 17:32.520
 So they both show up and they went at it.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.800
 But one of the contensions Kyle had for years, and there's still this rule, if you win a

17:36.800 --> 17:43.440
 world level medal, the following year, you sit out until the very end of the American

17:43.440 --> 17:46.680
 trials and they do, they do a best two or three.

17:46.680 --> 17:51.360
 So every time previously that Kyle had wrestled Jordan, he had to come through a tournament

17:51.360 --> 17:52.360
 on Saturday.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.360
 Yeah.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.360
 Okay.

17:54.360 --> 17:55.360
 Probably three matches.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.840
 And then on Sunday, he would wrestle Jordan in the best two out of three.

17:57.840 --> 17:58.840
 Right.

17:58.840 --> 18:01.880
 So his contention was, I'm only wrestling Jordan at a disadvantage because I have to compete

18:01.880 --> 18:04.840
 on Saturday and then competing on, which it's a fair argument.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.840
 It really is.

18:05.840 --> 18:10.280
 But I also see USA wrestling's point is like, if someone wins a world medal, we're going

18:10.280 --> 18:13.200
 to reward them because we want that person on the team again.

18:13.200 --> 18:17.800
 So it's crazy though that you're like Kyle Dake had to wrestle because he's not wrestling

18:17.800 --> 18:22.240
 bums in that position and then, yeah, I don't know.

18:22.240 --> 18:28.800
 I don't know how wrestlers do it because you have to go to war like three matches and then

18:28.800 --> 18:29.800
 face Jordan Boroughs.

18:29.800 --> 18:30.800
 Yeah.

18:30.800 --> 18:35.200
 Especially a few of those years with, you know, Daked, the name Andrew Howell, but there's

18:35.200 --> 18:36.920
 a really competitive matches.

18:36.920 --> 18:38.720
 David Taylor had really competitive matches with him.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.400
 Isaiah Martinez even got in there at the Erringer.

18:40.400 --> 18:44.800
 So he had some really competitive matches before he ever got to Jordan Boroughs.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.960
 So I never answered your initial question was, how did I feel?

18:47.960 --> 18:52.920
 So the Jordan Boroughs match, I was not in wrestling shape at all, meaning wrestling

18:52.920 --> 18:55.600
 is heavily dependent, especially in neutral positions, heavily dependent on timing and

18:55.600 --> 18:56.600
 other things.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.800
 I was wrestling very, very minimally because I was, I started fighting again.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.920
 So like my athletic shape was great, but it was mainly for fighting.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.280
 I wasn't wrestling.

19:06.280 --> 19:12.080
 So I think they were actually trying to do Boroughs, Daked, beat the streets.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.880
 It's the biggest fundraiser in wrestling every single year in New York, in New York

19:15.880 --> 19:16.880
 City.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.200
 They usually raised like a million dollars.

19:18.200 --> 19:22.000
 They started all these programs in New York City to get, which I really wonder what they're

19:22.000 --> 19:24.320
 doing with the money now because they probably can't have the kids wrestling because New

19:24.320 --> 19:25.320
 York's crazy.

19:25.320 --> 19:29.040
 Anyway, I think New York figures out a way what to do with the money.

19:29.040 --> 19:32.720
 Hence Michael Malus complaining that they're corrupt and all that, but it goes to the

19:32.720 --> 19:35.640
 beat the streets organization who then starts the clubs in New York.

19:35.640 --> 19:40.680
 So I don't know what to do with my, anyway, so I was called like, I don't know, two weeks

19:40.680 --> 19:44.880
 before the event and said, Hey, you know, someone was supposed to wrestle Jordan Burroughs.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.880
 It fell out.

19:46.880 --> 19:47.880
 Would you wrestle him?

19:47.880 --> 19:48.880
 I said, Yeah, sure.

19:48.880 --> 19:49.880
 Why not?

19:49.880 --> 19:55.520
 You know, and it's like, listen, I trained with them for four days the year before.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.480
 I had a pretty good idea how the match was going to go.

19:57.480 --> 20:01.000
 It wasn't going to go so well for me, but it's like, okay, you're missing a main event.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.600
 I can bring, because of where I'm at right now in my life, I can bring a lot of attention

20:04.600 --> 20:05.600
 to wrestling.

20:05.600 --> 20:08.560
 I can help you guys raise a bunch of money for beat the streets.

20:08.560 --> 20:12.720
 My goal is I think I thought I could get one takedown or turn on him was kind of my goal

20:12.720 --> 20:13.720
 for the match.

20:13.720 --> 20:14.720
 I didn't get there.

20:14.720 --> 20:15.720
 It wasn't kind of hard.

20:15.720 --> 20:16.720
 He went hard.

20:16.720 --> 20:17.720
 Yeah.

20:17.720 --> 20:18.720
 That asshole wouldn't give me a point.

20:18.720 --> 20:19.720
 Yeah.

20:19.720 --> 20:20.720
 I said, this is bullshit.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.720
 Jordan, I told him through the match, like this is bullshit.

20:23.720 --> 20:25.400
 You're fucking going too hard right now.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.400
 I'm not a wrestler.

20:26.400 --> 20:27.400
 I'm not a wrestler.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.400
 I'm a fighter.

20:28.400 --> 20:29.400
 I'm coming in here.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.400
 So yeah.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.400
 So I had a really good idea.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.400
 I mean, we wrestled together.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.560
 I think in, he had probably been mad because I think in the live go, we did like the 12

20:36.560 --> 20:37.560
 or 15 minutes.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.760
 Did you score a takedown in that?

20:38.760 --> 20:43.040
 I believe maybe or maybe it was a turn, he'll probably say, no, I didn't, but whatever.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.040
 Yeah.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.800
 So I knew what was going to happen.

20:45.800 --> 20:47.800
 I knew what the outcome was going to be.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.720
 I knew I could probably hope I could stay competitive and maybe lose like 10 to or something

20:51.720 --> 20:52.720
 like.

20:52.720 --> 20:53.720
 Yeah.

20:53.720 --> 20:59.120
 Well, let's walk back because I think I originally brought it up in terms of how prepared were

20:59.120 --> 21:03.600
 you against Jake Paul versus Jordan and Barrow's.

21:03.600 --> 21:07.800
 So did you prepare for Jake, cardio wise?

21:07.800 --> 21:08.800
 Yeah.

21:08.800 --> 21:15.800
 I did, but it was, I told you, I started training for my, I mean, once I had my hip surgery,

21:15.800 --> 21:19.760
 they said, you know, for the first six weeks, you can't even walk.

21:19.760 --> 21:23.880
 And it was hard for me to listen to them because by week four and a half, five, I was feeling

21:23.880 --> 21:24.880
 pretty good.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.880
 I want to get rid of my crutches, but I'm like, you know what, this is for the rest of

21:27.880 --> 21:28.880
 my life.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.120
 And if you get the, so if you get the real hip replacement, there's no wrestling.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.120
 There's no nothing.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.120
 All right.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.120
 So that's the next step.

21:35.120 --> 21:36.120
 So, okay, I'm going to take this year.

21:36.120 --> 21:37.680
 So I do my crutches for six weeks.

21:37.680 --> 21:43.120
 The next six weeks, it's still like really low weight bearing, can't do anything, you

21:43.120 --> 21:44.120
 know?

21:44.120 --> 21:48.280
 So then I get done with the three months, which is like January and I'm like, okay, I should

21:48.280 --> 21:49.280
 start working out.

21:49.280 --> 21:52.680
 So I started riding a bike a little bit and then, okay, I'm now, I'm fat.

21:52.680 --> 21:53.680
 I'm fucking fat.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.160
 I'm going to get in better shape because I don't do anything.

21:55.160 --> 21:59.480
 So I'm actually start working out and, uh, and then that happened, right?

21:59.480 --> 22:03.360
 So I'm like, okay, well now I got three months and it gives me a good reason to get back

22:03.360 --> 22:04.360
 in shape.

22:04.360 --> 22:08.840
 And, um, you know, I knew I wasn't going to do, be a full time boxer.

22:08.840 --> 22:11.520
 So it's like, how do I put a boxing camp together?

22:11.520 --> 22:14.440
 So I found, you know, I had, I had my old teammate, Mike Rhodes.

22:14.440 --> 22:19.080
 He came up and kind of lived with me ish kind of thing for three months.

22:19.080 --> 22:23.240
 Uh, I found a couple of this guy canine out of Michigan.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.560
 He came over three weeks.

22:24.560 --> 22:25.560
 He was great.

22:25.560 --> 22:27.000
 I went to Freddie Roach for a week.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.160
 So I kind of like, you know, try to get as many good as ideas as I could.

22:31.160 --> 22:35.480
 And then my thought was like, okay, well, if this dude sucks, I can just be tough and

22:35.480 --> 22:38.320
 you know, block of you punches, get him tired and then beat him up.

22:38.320 --> 22:41.560
 If he's good, that's probably not much of my do about in the next three months.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.360
 Cause I'm, I was never going to boxing in the first place.

22:44.360 --> 22:48.640
 All of my standup in mixed martial arts was predicated on how do I get through the two

22:48.640 --> 22:52.400
 or three punches that are going to come at me in the time I need to get a hold of them.

22:52.400 --> 22:55.480
 You know, it's only, you only have to make two or three of them miss and then boom, you're

22:55.480 --> 22:59.360
 on top of them, at least for me, um, that was all my striking was predicated on.

22:59.360 --> 23:02.280
 It wasn't about, Hey, I'm going to do damage on the feet in order to make something else

23:02.280 --> 23:03.280
 happen.

23:03.280 --> 23:06.800
 It was like, how do I clear this barrier, get a hold of you?

23:06.800 --> 23:11.760
 And if you, I actually did the math one time, I think I got to take down, if you include

23:11.760 --> 23:16.200
 the knockout round against Mazvid all, I got to take down every round except two.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.640
 So it was like, it was like 53 out of 55 rounds in MMA.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.400
 I got to take down somewhere, somewhere in there.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.400
 Okay.

23:22.400 --> 23:25.040
 So you're hunting the takedown once you, once right away.

23:25.040 --> 23:29.000
 Once you get a, your hands on them, you get to take down.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.000
 Yeah.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
 Okay.

23:31.000 --> 23:36.320
 But the incredible thing about you, I just recently talked, uh, spent a couple of days

23:36.320 --> 23:43.680
 with Jimmy Pedro and, uh, he talked about his guys and just champions in general, hating

23:43.680 --> 23:46.920
 to lose more than they love winning.

23:46.920 --> 23:51.240
 And the way you talked about losing, you lost very few times in your career.

23:51.240 --> 23:57.080
 Like later, you, you were dominating both the wrestling and MMA, but the way you took

23:57.080 --> 24:03.160
 these losses against people that are, I don't know, below elite level.

24:03.160 --> 24:04.160
 It's fair.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.880
 I was also going to get pissy, but, but I, it's completely fair.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.080
 I thought he was a bum too.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.360
 No, that's not what I meant.

24:10.360 --> 24:11.360
 Oh, I'm in trouble.

24:11.360 --> 24:12.360
 It's okay.

24:12.360 --> 24:13.360
 No, it's good.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.360
 No, no, no, no.

24:14.360 --> 24:17.240
 But like, what can you explain the psychology behind that?

24:17.240 --> 24:22.600
 Like the, what, is there a system behind this, is there a philosophy behind this?

24:22.600 --> 24:27.280
 Well, I, so I, I wasn't very good in the beginning and I think, I think that's where

24:27.280 --> 24:28.280
 it all starts from.

24:28.280 --> 24:31.000
 So I didn't start getting good until the age of like 13.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.000
 I started at five.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.960
 I probably started competing more at age 10, 11.

24:34.960 --> 24:38.240
 I didn't really get good till 13 and still at 13.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.240
 I'm, I'm, it's not going to be great.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.240
 I'm getting better.

24:41.240 --> 24:42.240
 Right.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.240
 I'm pretty good.

24:43.240 --> 24:47.400
 I've actually, I've actually, I have writing this book on sports psych, but this, it's,

24:47.400 --> 24:49.400
 I got, well, I got someone ready for me kind of thing.

24:49.400 --> 24:53.320
 Cause I've had this philosophy for years that there's, there has to be this balance between

24:53.320 --> 24:54.320
 two things.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.320
 Right.

24:55.320 --> 24:59.480
 So on the one hand, in this category, on the one hand, you have hating to lose a great

24:59.480 --> 25:02.200
 champion has to hate to lose, like you said, right?

25:02.200 --> 25:07.040
 But on this other hand, you have to have someone who seeks out challenges, right?

25:07.040 --> 25:10.240
 Cause if you don't have that, you're never going to reach your full potential either.

25:10.240 --> 25:14.600
 And so you have to balance these two balls at the same time, right?

25:14.600 --> 25:18.800
 And so like for me, I always, and this is maybe cause I wasn't good, but I was always

25:18.800 --> 25:21.640
 like, let me go find the best people to wrestle all the time.

25:21.640 --> 25:25.440
 Let me go find, I would like literally, uh, like seven days a grade when I was starting

25:25.440 --> 25:26.440
 to get better.

25:26.440 --> 25:29.720
 It was like, and there's, there's an internet, well, there's no one was using the internet.

25:29.720 --> 25:32.920
 It was like a wrestling magazine and like, Hey dad, there's a tournament here.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.360
 I think that other kids can be there.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.840
 Can you take me two hours across the state today?

25:36.840 --> 25:37.840
 Please.

25:37.840 --> 25:38.840
 Sure.

25:38.840 --> 25:40.400
 I'm like in competition against them.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.400
 In competition.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.400
 Yeah.

25:42.400 --> 25:43.400
 Yeah.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.400
 In competition.

25:44.400 --> 25:45.400
 Hey, I heard there's this tournament.

25:45.400 --> 25:46.400
 Here's the magazine and says this tournament.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.400
 Hey dad, will you take me over there tomorrow?

25:47.400 --> 25:50.240
 You, you weren't trying to win, you were trying to get the experience.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.120
 I was trying to wrestle the best guys.

25:52.120 --> 25:53.120
 Maybe I win, maybe I lose.

25:53.120 --> 25:57.280
 There's no, when you used to do a competition, there's no guarantee of a winner or a loss.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.840
 You're just doing competition, right?

25:58.840 --> 26:03.960
 So I wanted to go, I wanted to challenge myself against the best guys of which I thought maybe

26:03.960 --> 26:05.160
 I could come out on top, right?

26:05.160 --> 26:09.880
 So like eighth grade year, I won way, way, you know, I probably lost a handful of times

26:09.880 --> 26:10.880
 in the state of Wisconsin.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.360
 The state of Wisconsin was probably really, really minimal the amount of times I lost,

26:13.360 --> 26:14.360
 you know?

26:14.360 --> 26:15.360
 But it was just about getting the challenge.

26:15.360 --> 26:20.320
 And it's like some, some kids and not kids in my club, cause I'll push them very hard

26:20.320 --> 26:22.880
 on this, are scared of challenging themselves.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.480
 They like being the big fish in the small pond.

26:25.480 --> 26:29.200
 They're not willing to go say, I want to go get that guy and I want to get that guy and

26:29.200 --> 26:30.280
 I want to get that guy.

26:30.280 --> 26:33.960
 And so that's like, so I think that's part of it for me is like, I always just love

26:33.960 --> 26:34.960
 the challenge.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.200
 I enjoy competing thoroughly, right?

26:37.200 --> 26:40.640
 And I understood from a young age because it wasn't very good, losing is part of it.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.080
 You're not always going to win.

26:42.080 --> 26:43.080
 And that was kind of it.

26:43.080 --> 26:48.960
 It's like, Hey, sometimes, you know, and for my MMA career, I never planned it to go

26:48.960 --> 26:49.960
 that way.

26:49.960 --> 26:50.960
 But yeah, I didn't lose for nine years.

26:50.960 --> 26:52.600
 And like that's, that's pretty rare.

26:52.600 --> 26:54.400
 I didn't plan for that to happen.

26:54.400 --> 26:55.600
 That was just what happened.

26:55.600 --> 26:56.600
 Okay.

26:56.600 --> 27:00.680
 But you also didn't lose like the second part of your college career.

27:00.680 --> 27:03.680
 My 87, I lost, I won my last 87 matches.

27:03.680 --> 27:04.680
 Yeah.

27:04.680 --> 27:08.240
 So that didn't come along with a hatred of losing.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.240
 You just, I don't like losing.

27:09.240 --> 27:10.640
 I still don't like it.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.640
 Yeah.

27:11.640 --> 27:12.640
 Yeah.

27:12.640 --> 27:13.640
 But you seem to, okay.

27:13.640 --> 27:18.140
 But you don't, you don't seem to, you seem to kind of shrug it off a little bit.

27:18.140 --> 27:19.140
 Okay.

27:19.140 --> 27:21.480
 So like with, specifically with these two instances that you're bringing up with the

27:21.480 --> 27:25.600
 Mazvedal, it feels definitely so, okay, let's go.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.600
 Let's go deep.

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
 Let's go deep.

27:27.600 --> 27:32.240
 So the Mazvedal one, it feels different cause, so wait, wait, wait, wait, let's, for

27:32.240 --> 27:36.480
 people who don't know, Mazvedal loss was your first loss.

27:36.480 --> 27:37.480
 First loss.

27:37.480 --> 27:38.480
 In MMA.

27:38.480 --> 27:39.480
 Yes.

27:39.480 --> 27:40.480
 Yeah.

27:40.480 --> 27:41.480
 Yeah.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.480
 And I mean, it was a dramatic loss.

27:42.480 --> 27:43.480
 Very dramatic.

27:43.480 --> 27:47.960
 And there was this kind of buildup as you were potentially one of the greats of all time

27:47.960 --> 27:51.000
 coming into this fight.

27:51.000 --> 27:53.840
 And so there's pressure, all of that.

27:53.840 --> 27:58.320
 So the, no, I mean, I was thoroughly enjoying it, I didn't feel the pressure.

27:58.320 --> 28:02.840
 So the Mazvedal fight is, he got one fucking move on me.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.640
 It's not like he beat me.

28:04.640 --> 28:08.040
 And if we do that again, I think I win at that point in my life.

28:08.040 --> 28:09.040
 For sure.

28:09.040 --> 28:12.760
 I think I win way, way, way more times than I lose.

28:12.760 --> 28:13.760
 He knew that too.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.600
 That's why he didn't want, he didn't want to sound the, sound the bad agreement.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.000
 That's why I had to taunt him and why he got so mad cause I had to continue to taunt

28:18.000 --> 28:21.200
 him in order to get him to sign, right?

28:21.200 --> 28:24.760
 So that one hurt because, as for people who don't know my MMA career, I'll just go through

28:24.760 --> 28:25.760
 it fast.

28:25.760 --> 28:27.280
 I did three fights in like smaller leagues.

28:27.280 --> 28:28.560
 I got signed by Bellator.

28:28.560 --> 28:30.480
 I was undefeated for three and a half years.

28:30.480 --> 28:39.480
 I was nine and oh, when I got done with that in 2012, 2013, I, at that point in my head,

28:39.480 --> 28:42.320
 I was just going to transition to the UFC cause that's where you go.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.120
 I was ranked like six in the world.

28:44.120 --> 28:49.080
 I hadn't really had a competitive match at the end of the Bellator thing.

28:49.080 --> 28:52.760
 And Dana White, for a reason still unknown to me, we still haven't had this conversation.

28:52.760 --> 28:53.760
 I wish I could ask him.

28:53.760 --> 28:55.880
 I should ask him sometime.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.560
 He was to refuse me any entry into the UFC.

28:58.560 --> 29:03.800
 He just said, I went to his office and he really said, we're not interested.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.480
 We're not going to make you an offer.

29:05.480 --> 29:09.200
 Did you, did you mention something to, uh, about him, about the UFC?

29:09.200 --> 29:10.600
 That was a year before that.

29:10.600 --> 29:12.240
 That was a year before that.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.000
 That might play a role in it, I think.

29:14.000 --> 29:19.800
 So, uh, yes, what happened a year before that was, uh, I called him a liar, which, but listen,

29:19.800 --> 29:24.480
 I'm writing this one cause he said you can't test for drugs cause I'm, I'm all natural,

29:24.480 --> 29:26.320
 which you could help by my physique.

29:26.320 --> 29:31.920
 Um, and I was always put off by the fact that so many people cheated and I, I was very vocal

29:31.920 --> 29:33.120
 about that.

29:33.120 --> 29:36.080
 And so he had made some statement like, Oh, well, there's no way you could test.

29:36.080 --> 29:37.080
 I said, bullshit.

29:37.080 --> 29:42.120
 You, you so very specifically, I said, you saw it does it for all of their sports worldwide.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
 You can do it.

29:43.120 --> 29:45.440
 And then it was funny cause I hired you saw it a couple of years later.

29:45.440 --> 29:49.360
 So I think he took some offense to that, but that was like a year and almost a year and

29:49.360 --> 29:50.360
 a half.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.360
 I think somewhere later.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.680
 Um, it's not like he holds a grudge or anything.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.680
 Yeah.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.560
 So I, so I literally go to Vegas.

29:58.560 --> 30:00.840
 Um, it's a long story.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.000
 You can read about it other places.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.680
 I, so I got released from a belt.

30:03.680 --> 30:04.880
 It's not like this is a negotiation.

30:04.880 --> 30:06.280
 I got released from my belt or contract.

30:06.280 --> 30:07.280
 I said, I'm out of here.

30:07.280 --> 30:09.240
 I'm going, I'm going to go to the UFC.

30:09.240 --> 30:14.360
 I go to Vegas and then I was told, Hey, there's no offer for you.

30:14.360 --> 30:15.360
 Tough shit.

30:15.360 --> 30:16.360
 You know?

30:16.360 --> 30:19.360
 So then I ended up signing with one championship.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.640
 I spent what three and a half years there.

30:21.640 --> 30:26.080
 I won the belt in my second fight and retained the title the entire time.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.960
 And then I just, I think dominating people.

30:27.960 --> 30:28.960
 Yeah.

30:28.960 --> 30:29.960
 I didn't have a competitive fight.

30:29.960 --> 30:34.840
 And so, um, I retired 18 and O never, never again for someone who loves a challenge, never

30:34.840 --> 30:38.120
 getting to really challenge myself was incredibly frustrating.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.280
 And I left the door open.

30:39.280 --> 30:43.000
 I said, if I ever get the chance to prove him in this world, I'd love to come back.

30:43.000 --> 30:46.880
 So somehow a year later, I get traded trades have never happened.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.520
 I'm the one and only trade ever.

30:49.520 --> 30:50.800
 I would have been retired for a year.

30:50.800 --> 30:51.800
 I got traded.

30:51.800 --> 30:52.800
 I get to come back.

30:52.800 --> 30:53.800
 I fight Robbie Lawler.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.600
 The first fight I win.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.720
 And then essentially they're saying, okay, if you fight, uh, you know, if you beat George,

30:59.720 --> 31:02.240
 you're going to get the title shake against Marty.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.400
 And, um, it's like this, this is what I've been working for the entire, I've been trying

31:06.400 --> 31:09.120
 to prove I was the best part of the world for the last 10 years and I have, I've not

31:09.120 --> 31:11.240
 been afforded this opportunity.

31:11.240 --> 31:15.800
 Um, so when I lost to George, that was, that was hard because I, it was, it's something

31:15.800 --> 31:20.000
 that I had waited for for a really, really long time.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.000
 It was something that I, you know, I thought I could compete for and I never got the opportunity

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
 to do.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.000
 So that one was hard.

31:25.000 --> 31:28.920
 Um, at the same time from like just a competitive logistic and it's like, he got me with one

31:28.920 --> 31:29.920
 move.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.480
 It wasn't like he beat my ass for 15 minutes and I got beat a bunch of different ways.

31:33.480 --> 31:37.560
 So that was like, fuck, like if I get it again, I could have done it, but I'm not, I'm not,

31:37.560 --> 31:38.560
 they're not going to let me have it again.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.960
 It's not like wrestling where you could go the next year or the next week or whatever,

31:41.960 --> 31:45.040
 you know, you lose a big 10s, you were a nationalist two weeks later.

31:45.040 --> 31:47.520
 Does that loss change you in any way?

31:47.520 --> 31:48.520
 Your psychology?

31:48.520 --> 31:50.040
 I don't, I don't think so.

31:50.040 --> 31:51.360
 It's the first loss.

31:51.360 --> 31:57.120
 I mean, had I, had I had a longer MMA career post that there definitely would have been

31:57.120 --> 32:01.960
 a lot of time spent getting better at the entry point to the take down, right?

32:01.960 --> 32:03.400
 Which I already spent time there.

32:03.400 --> 32:07.600
 Um, I don't, I, and I, I hate making excuses, but yeah, the, the hip, the hinging of my

32:07.600 --> 32:11.480
 hip where I couldn't do was preventing me from doing some things.

32:11.480 --> 32:15.200
 That's why if you look at the fight, I'm like bent over as they go for the double leg.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.200
 Yeah.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.560
 So what happened for people who don't know, you went in for a double leg and he went flying

32:19.560 --> 32:20.560
 knee.

32:20.560 --> 32:21.560
 He did a flying knee.

32:21.560 --> 32:22.560
 And then caught you.

32:22.560 --> 32:26.120
 Well, specifically the way he did that knee was kind of different than the way anyone

32:26.120 --> 32:28.600
 had thrown flying knees before.

32:28.600 --> 32:32.440
 Most people go more just from a stand straight vertical, whereas he took a few like running

32:32.440 --> 32:36.880
 steps and went more, you know, the trajectory of the angle was different.

32:36.880 --> 32:41.120
 Um, so I think that's kind of probably why it caught, you know, the, I think a lot of

32:41.120 --> 32:45.960
 things in combat will probably everything, but I focus specifically come to happen subconsciously.

32:45.960 --> 32:50.480
 Like our brain is reading what's coming at us and, and lost times is stuff we've seen

32:50.480 --> 32:51.480
 before.

32:51.480 --> 32:55.560
 So we can judge how to move correctly misread because it's something you haven't seen before

32:55.560 --> 32:57.800
 had not seen him come at that specific angle.

32:57.800 --> 32:58.800
 Yeah.

32:58.800 --> 33:03.340
 So that was also really hard with the burrows one, I told you, I knew I was going to lose.

33:03.340 --> 33:08.080
 So it was like, whatever, you know, I'm, I'm taking this because I want to put the sport

33:08.080 --> 33:09.520
 wrestling out there in a big way.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.040
 I want to help them raise a lot of money.

33:11.040 --> 33:14.560
 We sold at Madison Square Garden who theater and we raised a whole bunch of money.

33:14.560 --> 33:16.280
 So my goals were accomplished.

33:16.280 --> 33:17.280
 Jake Paul fight.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.880
 I took it because they paid me a bunch of money and I thought it was going to be fun.

33:19.880 --> 33:21.040
 Did I have any illusion?

33:21.040 --> 33:22.240
 I was a great boxer.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.920
 No illusions whatsoever.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.600
 Would I have preferred to win?

33:25.600 --> 33:26.600
 Absolutely.

33:26.600 --> 33:29.480
 But, you know, like I told everyone, whether I win or lose on Saturday night, I'm going

33:29.480 --> 33:32.440
 to be back coaching wrestling on Monday because that's what I enjoy doing.

33:32.440 --> 33:34.600
 And I was back coaching wrestling on Monday.

33:34.600 --> 33:37.280
 And once I'm out these middle school kids, give me a little bit of shit about it.

33:37.280 --> 33:38.280
 And that's it.

33:38.280 --> 33:39.480
 But that's about it.

33:39.480 --> 33:45.040
 Where were you in terms of your shape and how you felt in the Mazvedal fight?

33:45.040 --> 33:50.160
 Would you say you're on the, I mean, it's a difficult question to ask of, of a world

33:50.160 --> 33:54.440
 class athlete, but like, were you past peak?

33:54.440 --> 33:55.440
 Oh yeah.

33:55.440 --> 33:56.440
 So I don't know.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.000
 I don't know why guys like to lie about that.

33:58.000 --> 34:03.280
 I mean, the peak for me was really evidently in my late 20s.

34:03.280 --> 34:06.760
 And maybe they are all fueled by extra supplements.

34:06.760 --> 34:07.760
 I don't know.

34:07.760 --> 34:13.680
 But for me, that was evident, but you get this, so you get this crosshair where you're,

34:13.680 --> 34:17.440
 if you're smart, like, you know, like I mentioned, Joan Brose was, you're still gaining wisdom,

34:17.440 --> 34:19.960
 you're gaining strategy, gaining a lot of things, right?

34:19.960 --> 34:24.640
 And so while your physicality may go down, your overall skill level still may be rising,

34:24.640 --> 34:30.040
 especially in MMA because people usually start later because they're gaining wisdom, strategy,

34:30.040 --> 34:33.040
 all of the, maybe more tools in the toolbox, right, they're getting all these things.

34:33.040 --> 34:37.560
 So their actual competitive peak, despite their athletic peak going down, might still

34:37.560 --> 34:40.000
 be a few years past that, right?

34:40.000 --> 34:41.320
 Because these things are crossing.

34:41.320 --> 34:43.360
 No, so I felt, I felt, I was great.

34:43.360 --> 34:47.480
 Obviously the hip was an issue.

34:47.480 --> 34:52.160
 It's funny because so that I knew I had a lot of pain here and I knew it was because

34:52.160 --> 34:53.160
 of this.

34:53.160 --> 34:56.640
 And it was like, okay, whenever I'm done, I'll just get it taken care of, whatever.

34:56.640 --> 35:00.760
 But I, every time I train, I'll have pain kind of like all up my back and the day after

35:00.760 --> 35:05.760
 the surgery, I woke up and there was no pain on the right side of my, the surgery is on

35:05.760 --> 35:06.760
 the left side.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.760
 There was no pain on the right side of my back.

35:07.760 --> 35:08.760
 I'm like, that's fucking weird.

35:08.760 --> 35:13.520
 Like every, every morning I wake up, there's a lot of pain there, you know, I'm like, okay,

35:13.520 --> 35:14.680
 I'm on pain pills.

35:14.680 --> 35:16.240
 Maybe it'll, maybe it'll come back tomorrow.

35:16.240 --> 35:21.160
 And this, that's never, never been back since my, so it was weird because it was like this.

35:21.160 --> 35:26.560
 I thought this was affecting this, but it was affecting all the way across my whole back.

35:26.560 --> 35:31.160
 So you know, if I get to get a new hip, honestly, if I, if I, I don't know if this is going

35:31.160 --> 35:35.400
 to change the competitive outcome whatsoever, if I had known how good the hip replacement

35:35.400 --> 35:39.880
 was going to be, I would have done it the second I retired from one championship in

35:39.880 --> 35:44.960
 November of 2017, I would have had my hip surgery scheduled for December one.

35:44.960 --> 35:48.600
 Just from a lifestyle standpoint, I could only sleep in one position.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.600
 There's a lot of things I couldn't do.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.600
 I was in a lot of pain.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.880
 Um, so I would have done that a lot earlier.

35:52.880 --> 35:58.520
 But no, from my athletic point, it was, I was ready to just check those wrongs sometimes.

35:58.520 --> 36:05.360
 I don't know how to ask this, but you know, Joe Rogan, me had a, had a sense about you

36:05.360 --> 36:11.280
 similar to like, uh, Fedor, that you are potentially one of the greatest ever.

36:11.280 --> 36:12.600
 Yeah.

36:12.600 --> 36:19.480
 Does it hurt that you're not in the discussion now of being in the top 10, uh, of all time?

36:19.480 --> 36:20.480
 I didn't prove it.

36:20.480 --> 36:21.480
 I don't deserve it.

36:21.480 --> 36:24.480
 But I didn't, I didn't prove it.

36:24.480 --> 36:30.280
 I mean, and so it's like, uh, had I, had I somehow gotten to convince Dana White, we

36:30.280 --> 36:35.040
 go and convince him in 2013 to make me an offer and I didn't even need a good offer.

36:35.040 --> 36:36.040
 I needed any offer.

36:36.040 --> 36:40.000
 Had I gotten the offer then, maybe the outcome is different, right?

36:40.000 --> 36:43.160
 But given, I would never expect anyone to think of me that way.

36:43.160 --> 36:44.160
 I didn't prove it.

36:44.160 --> 36:47.560
 I know, I know what I was and I'm good with that.

36:47.560 --> 36:49.160
 And yeah, other people never got to see that.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.120
 Do you think, well, you don't know, you can't know fully, right?

36:52.120 --> 36:56.840
 Do you think if you, uh, went to the UFC at that time instead of one championship?

36:56.840 --> 36:58.520
 I think it would have a lot of success.

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
 Yeah.

36:59.520 --> 37:03.480
 I mean, there's obviously certain guys, there's a lot of guys I've trained with that I had

37:03.480 --> 37:10.200
 a lot of really good results against and, um, obviously, Walter weight at that time

37:10.200 --> 37:12.280
 was a champion for a long time there.

37:12.280 --> 37:15.080
 So I was around tire was a champion, Anthony was a champion at lightweight.

37:15.080 --> 37:18.840
 I was, you know, same gym as him and we had a lot of people coming through.

37:18.840 --> 37:19.840
 Yeah.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.840
 Would you face time?

37:21.840 --> 37:22.840
 Would I have fought him?

37:22.840 --> 37:23.840
 I don't think so.

37:23.840 --> 37:27.360
 I mean, so he was still the champion when I came into the UFC and we said, no, we're

37:27.360 --> 37:29.360
 not going to fight.

37:29.360 --> 37:30.360
 All right.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.520
 Hey, so he can't change history, right?

37:32.520 --> 37:37.120
 So once something happens, you got to accept it for what it is and move forward and, and

37:37.120 --> 37:41.120
 obviously hope you can continue to keep accomplishing great things, which for me, obviously my athletic

37:41.120 --> 37:42.520
 career is over.

37:42.520 --> 37:46.720
 So now it's going to be through my wrestling academies and, you know, who knows what else

37:46.720 --> 37:48.240
 I get to get into.

37:48.240 --> 37:52.800
 You might do exhibition matches and all that kind of stuff, right?

37:52.800 --> 37:53.800
 That's who?

37:53.800 --> 37:54.800
 Wrestling and stuff.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.800
 No.

37:55.800 --> 37:56.800
 Uh, I don't think so.

37:56.800 --> 38:00.280
 So here's my thing with the wrestling matches is like just for fun.

38:00.280 --> 38:03.560
 If you said, Hey, Ben, just for fun, would you love to go wrestle someone?

38:03.560 --> 38:04.560
 Yeah, I would.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.560
 I would.

38:05.560 --> 38:06.560
 Right.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.560
 I love, I love wrestling and get in there.

38:07.560 --> 38:11.440
 I love, you know, I love like, so one of my guys has gotten to be pretty good.

38:11.440 --> 38:12.440
 He's in college.

38:12.440 --> 38:13.440
 He got into a tool.

38:13.440 --> 38:16.280
 He just won a junior world title this year.

38:16.280 --> 38:20.440
 And so when, when I'm doing private lessons, I have such a thing about the development

38:20.440 --> 38:21.440
 of the athlete.

38:21.440 --> 38:24.360
 Sometimes I can wrestle hard, but most of the time it's like, I'm just going to help

38:24.360 --> 38:27.480
 them with whatever they need help with and it's still wrestling and it's fun, but it's

38:27.480 --> 38:28.480
 helping them.

38:28.480 --> 38:31.000
 You know, for like, for Keaton goes back this summer and he's trained for the general

38:31.000 --> 38:32.000
 title.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.200
 So to be able to shake hands sometimes and say, like, how am I going to try to kick

38:34.200 --> 38:35.200
 your ass?

38:35.200 --> 38:38.560
 So you try to kick my ass, you know, like just to go, like, yeah, it's a good feel.

38:38.560 --> 38:39.800
 It's so much fun.

38:39.800 --> 38:40.800
 And I don't get to do that very much.

38:40.800 --> 38:43.720
 So if you said, Ben, would you love to do some matches in the answers?

38:43.720 --> 38:44.720
 Yeah.

38:44.720 --> 38:49.440
 The problem, unfortunately for me, and maybe you can talk me off a ledge here is like because

38:49.440 --> 38:50.800
 of where I've gotten to my career.

38:50.800 --> 38:53.560
 If I choose to do wrestling matches, it's going to, people are going to be really excited

38:53.560 --> 38:54.560
 about it.

38:54.560 --> 38:55.560
 It's going to blow up.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.440
 And it's like, I just want to wrestle just to wrestle.

38:57.440 --> 39:01.680
 I'd rather just like go in a room where no one can watch and just wrestle and just enjoy

39:01.680 --> 39:02.680
 it.

39:02.680 --> 39:03.680
 Well, you could also wrestle.

39:03.680 --> 39:05.480
 So there's different kinds of wrestling.

39:05.480 --> 39:10.440
 There's wrestling where there's an event and like, you know, there's a buildup and an

39:10.440 --> 39:11.440
 announcement.

39:11.440 --> 39:12.440
 Yeah.

39:12.440 --> 39:17.440
 And you can also do like a Khabib style, like in the room, there's cameras and you're kind

39:17.440 --> 39:18.440
 of going.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.440
 It's like.

39:19.440 --> 39:20.440
 Like Khabib does that?

39:20.440 --> 39:21.440
 No.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.440
 Marcel did that.

39:22.440 --> 39:23.440
 He whipped my ass a few times.

39:23.440 --> 39:24.440
 Yeah.

39:24.440 --> 39:25.440
 Exactly.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.440
 I mean, I've seen Khabib with some videos.

39:26.440 --> 39:27.440
 It's not like set up.

39:27.440 --> 39:30.440
 It's just people going hard and then it's more fun.

39:30.440 --> 39:31.440
 Yeah.

39:31.440 --> 39:32.440
 You know?

39:32.440 --> 39:38.440
 And it's, it's also more like presenting the beauty of the sport, you know?

39:38.440 --> 39:39.440
 For sure.

39:39.440 --> 39:42.720
 And like, and there's no winning or losing really in that context.

39:42.720 --> 39:43.720
 Yeah.

39:43.720 --> 39:46.800
 Like you're just, you're always joking around a little bit, even when you're going super

39:46.800 --> 39:47.800
 hard.

39:47.800 --> 39:51.320
 So I feel like, especially in the modern day with the, with the internet, that's a compelling

39:51.320 --> 39:52.320
 way to do.

39:52.320 --> 39:53.320
 Yeah.

39:53.320 --> 39:58.080
 This is the one thing I've thought about doing because I told you about my buddy who is the

39:58.080 --> 39:59.080
 content thing.

39:59.080 --> 40:00.080
 It's called Rockfin.

40:00.080 --> 40:02.840
 I thought about doing, you know, the old, really famous Gracie challenge.

40:02.840 --> 40:03.840
 Yeah.

40:03.840 --> 40:04.840
 Okay.

40:04.840 --> 40:05.840
 So I thought about doing the Ask When Challenge.

40:05.840 --> 40:06.840
 You want to hear my rule set?

40:06.840 --> 40:07.840
 Yeah.

40:07.840 --> 40:08.840
 Let's go.

40:08.840 --> 40:09.840
 I'm not sure I'm going to do this.

40:09.840 --> 40:10.840
 People are going to show up to your, like in Wisconsin.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.840
 I just select you.

40:11.840 --> 40:13.320
 I'll start with a thousand bucks, right?

40:13.320 --> 40:14.320
 All right.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.320
 Okay.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.320
 30 minutes.

40:16.320 --> 40:17.320
 You pin me or I pin you.

40:17.320 --> 40:18.320
 That's it.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.320
 No points, no nothing.

40:19.320 --> 40:20.320
 We just wrestle.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.320
 Camera.

40:21.320 --> 40:22.320
 That's it, right?

40:22.320 --> 40:24.520
 We don't want it to be content you over the pin.

40:24.520 --> 40:25.520
 So one pin.

40:25.520 --> 40:26.520
 Just one pin.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.520
 30 minutes.

40:27.520 --> 40:28.520
 30 minutes.

40:28.520 --> 40:29.520
 Okay.

40:29.520 --> 40:30.520
 If I pin you, you don't get shit.

40:30.520 --> 40:31.520
 You go home.

40:31.520 --> 40:32.520
 Right?

40:32.520 --> 40:35.620
 Every person I pin, it goes up by a thousand dollars, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000, and so

40:35.620 --> 40:36.720
 on.

40:36.720 --> 40:39.880
 If you make it the distance and I don't pin you and you don't pin me, I'll pay for your

40:39.880 --> 40:41.320
 travel and give you 500 bucks.

40:41.320 --> 40:42.320
 Right?

40:42.320 --> 40:44.720
 This is the kind of consolation prize for showing up.

40:44.720 --> 40:47.320
 If you pin me, you get whatever the jackpot is.

40:47.320 --> 40:50.720
 Wait, who's adding to the jackpot?

40:50.720 --> 40:51.720
 I am.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.720
 Money.

40:52.720 --> 40:53.720
 Money.

40:53.720 --> 40:55.320
 But then, what's the incentive to keep winning for you?

40:55.320 --> 40:56.320
 Because the jackpot is...

40:56.320 --> 40:59.120
 Well, because obviously, I would put the content somewhere and people would watch it.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.120
 Oh, so you're going to make money?

41:00.120 --> 41:01.120
 Yeah.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.120
 So you'd make money that way.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.120
 But it's not exponentially growing, right?

41:03.120 --> 41:04.120
 It's just going up by, like...

41:04.120 --> 41:05.120
 Yeah.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.920
 I really think there's probably only a couple of people that could pin me.

41:06.920 --> 41:11.520
 So I would either just not choose those people or wait till I get a really large audience

41:11.520 --> 41:12.520
 and people get really excited.

41:12.520 --> 41:14.240
 In that case, I'm making a lot of money.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.240
 So...

41:15.240 --> 41:16.240
 What do you think?

41:16.240 --> 41:17.760
 How many matches would go with you?

41:17.760 --> 41:19.440
 Like, call date shows up.

41:19.440 --> 41:20.920
 I don't think he could pin me.

41:20.920 --> 41:21.920
 Yeah.

41:21.920 --> 41:22.920
 I mean, like...

41:22.920 --> 41:23.920
 How would that match go?

41:23.920 --> 41:25.200
 Jordan Burrows could beat me, but he can't pin me.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.200
 He was never a pinner.

41:26.200 --> 41:27.200
 Yeah.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.200
 He ain't going to pin me.

41:28.200 --> 41:31.280
 There's only a few people who have the skill level to do so, right?

41:31.280 --> 41:32.280
 It takes a lot.

41:32.280 --> 41:33.280
 Because that was...

41:33.280 --> 41:34.280
 So pinning was one of my specialties.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.320
 I had the fourth most of all time and I won the pinning award the last two years.

41:37.320 --> 41:41.320
 So you could even be done on points and just pin them.

41:41.320 --> 41:46.040
 This is actually one of the issues I have with Jiu Jitsu and the point system and the

41:46.040 --> 41:47.040
 Eddie Bravo thing.

41:47.040 --> 41:48.440
 I actually think Eddie Bravo thing is kind of...

41:48.440 --> 41:49.440
 People get so mad at me.

41:49.440 --> 41:50.440
 Sorry, Jiu Jitsu.

41:50.440 --> 41:51.440
 I think it's bullshit.

41:51.440 --> 41:52.800
 And you want me to tell you why it's bullshit?

41:52.800 --> 41:53.800
 Yeah.

41:53.800 --> 41:57.800
 So like, if Jordan Burrows whooped my ass and the score is 16 to 2, but he can't pin

41:57.800 --> 42:00.840
 me, then I get to go to overtime and get a cradle on him.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.880
 I'm probably going to pin him.

42:02.880 --> 42:04.560
 So I'm better than Jordan Burrows?

42:04.560 --> 42:06.040
 Nah, that ain't right.

42:06.040 --> 42:07.040
 He just whooped my ass.

42:07.040 --> 42:08.040
 Do you know what I'm saying?

42:08.040 --> 42:09.400
 Like, if we can go the whole...

42:09.400 --> 42:11.720
 Because they do submission only.

42:11.720 --> 42:16.200
 So if Jordan Burrows beats me up for like, it's eight minutes, 10 minutes, I don't know,

42:16.200 --> 42:18.000
 what's the length of an Eddie Bravo match?

42:18.000 --> 42:19.000
 Yeah, I don't know.

42:19.000 --> 42:21.160
 That's something like that, yeah, yeah.

42:21.160 --> 42:24.480
 So we go 10 minutes, Jordan Burrows, he's going to outscore me significantly, but he

42:24.480 --> 42:25.480
 will not pin me.

42:25.480 --> 42:26.480
 I promise you that.

42:26.480 --> 42:27.480
 Okay?

42:27.480 --> 42:29.360
 So now we go to the overtime.

42:29.360 --> 42:30.440
 Strong words, but yeah.

42:30.440 --> 42:31.440
 He won't...

42:31.440 --> 42:32.440
 Jordan Burrows is not going to...

42:32.440 --> 42:33.440
 He's going to beat me.

42:33.440 --> 42:34.440
 I will give you that.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.440
 God, they won't pin you either.

42:35.440 --> 42:36.440
 No.

42:36.440 --> 42:37.440
 Okay.

42:37.440 --> 42:38.640
 They will both beat me on points very badly.

42:38.640 --> 42:42.720
 Now David Taylor, he might pin me because he's a very good pinner also.

42:42.720 --> 42:43.720
 They'll beat me very badly.

42:43.720 --> 42:45.220
 They will not pin me.

42:45.220 --> 42:47.560
 But now we get to overtime and we get to pick like, right?

42:47.560 --> 42:51.040
 So in Eddie Bravo, you get a rear naked choke or an arm bar.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.040
 Okay.

42:52.040 --> 42:53.520
 Give me a cradle, I'll probably pin them.

42:53.520 --> 42:54.520
 Okay.

42:54.520 --> 42:55.520
 A good cradle.

42:55.520 --> 42:56.680
 You can say cradle or maybe give them...

42:56.680 --> 42:58.400
 They're not going to probably not going to pin me, right?

42:58.400 --> 43:01.320
 Maybe there's a chance, but probably not because it's not their specialty.

43:01.320 --> 43:07.880
 So for people who don't know, the Eddie Bravo thing is when it goes into overtime, you get

43:07.880 --> 43:10.680
 a dominant position on a person and you get to...

43:10.680 --> 43:11.680
 Yeah.

43:11.680 --> 43:12.680
 Yeah.

43:12.680 --> 43:13.680
 Basically put them in a cradle.

43:13.680 --> 43:14.680
 This is the wrestling equivalent.

43:14.680 --> 43:15.680
 Yeah.

43:15.680 --> 43:16.680
 But you take their back.

43:16.680 --> 43:17.680
 Yeah.

43:17.680 --> 43:20.200
 So then I don't think that's very fair because if someone whoops your ass, they whoops your

43:20.200 --> 43:21.200
 ass and then...

43:21.200 --> 43:26.600
 And so I think the reason why Jiu Jitsu people accept that rule set is that I don't think...

43:26.600 --> 43:27.920
 I think they know this, but wouldn't admit it.

43:27.920 --> 43:33.960
 I don't think their point scoring system adequately rewards what people value.

43:33.960 --> 43:39.400
 So like in wrestling, we value takedowns because it gets closer to the pin and the most valuable

43:39.400 --> 43:44.800
 scoring is a near fall, near to the pin because that's the ultimate goal of the sport.

43:44.800 --> 43:49.800
 Because in Jiu Jitsu, for example, if I were to get a takedown, so like if I went to Gordon

43:49.800 --> 43:54.160
 Ryan and he just didn't pull guard, I would probably get the takedown.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.240
 Now if somehow he didn't submit me, which he probably would, right?

43:57.240 --> 44:01.760
 But say he got close to like 12 submissions, but somehow I slipped out of all of them.

44:01.760 --> 44:05.400
 Now I went to zero, like that's ridiculous, like he should very clearly win because he

44:05.400 --> 44:06.400
 almost submitted.

44:06.400 --> 44:07.400
 You know what I'm saying?

44:07.400 --> 44:09.800
 And I realized the difficulty.

44:09.800 --> 44:14.760
 I realized the difficulty in rewarding near submissions, but that is the most valuable

44:14.760 --> 44:17.240
 thing is getting close to finishing the match.

44:17.240 --> 44:20.360
 And in most competitions, they don't actually reward that.

44:20.360 --> 44:22.520
 But okay, so this isn't about the sport.

44:22.520 --> 44:27.360
 This is about the Ben Askren challenge that we're talking about.

44:27.360 --> 44:28.360
 Why 30 minutes?

44:28.360 --> 44:31.560
 Why not unlimited time?

44:31.560 --> 44:33.040
 Why go until whenever?

44:33.040 --> 44:34.960
 Well, because then it's just a cardio thing.

44:34.960 --> 44:39.400
 Because at some point, then someone would just have to fall over dead, right?

44:39.400 --> 44:40.840
 There's no more skill level involved.

44:40.840 --> 44:43.000
 It's just who can stand up the longest.

44:43.000 --> 44:47.640
 You honestly don't think 30 minutes is a cardio thing too.

44:47.640 --> 44:49.440
 How do you think that's actually going to look?

44:49.440 --> 44:51.480
 Kyle Day going against you for 30 minutes.

44:51.480 --> 44:56.560
 So it's going to be kind of boring for the most part.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.920
 What position are you going to be stuck in?

44:58.920 --> 45:02.240
 But you can't, you just can't have a gigantic amount of action for 30 minutes.

45:02.240 --> 45:07.280
 So I related, because some of my kids, when I'm teaching them wrestling, they're like,

45:07.280 --> 45:10.640
 well, but I can't do that for seven minutes.

45:10.640 --> 45:15.480
 And I'm like, well, you know, like, say, say if I had you do, uh, hanging cleans at a relatively

45:15.480 --> 45:18.480
 heavy weight as hard as you could, you're not going to last seven minutes.

45:18.480 --> 45:20.720
 You're going to, your pace will slow down, right?

45:20.720 --> 45:23.520
 So my thing is like, well, you're pasting the step, step here, because in wrestling,

45:23.520 --> 45:25.000
 you're competing at someone.

45:25.000 --> 45:29.200
 So if you're here at 100 and you go to 80, but they go to 70, that's great.

45:29.200 --> 45:33.040
 And then you go to 60, but they go to 40, this is even better, right?

45:33.040 --> 45:34.580
 Because the gap is growing.

45:34.580 --> 45:36.920
 So we don't necessarily, if we get tired, that's fine.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.800
 If they get more tired, that's better.

45:38.800 --> 45:40.480
 So I think both people would know that.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.840
 So they would kind of slow it down.

45:43.840 --> 45:48.040
 Um, but yeah, I think a third, a third, I mean, I've, I've wrestled 30 minute goes.

45:48.040 --> 45:49.040
 I've wrestled 60 minutes.

45:49.040 --> 45:50.840
 I've wrestled hour long goes.

45:50.840 --> 45:54.080
 Um, you're not going to get so tired, you're going to fall over in that time period.

45:54.080 --> 45:58.320
 But at some point, if we, if it's unlimited, some will get so tired that are dehydrated

45:58.320 --> 46:00.520
 that they're just going to freaking fall over.

46:00.520 --> 46:01.520
 Yeah.

46:01.520 --> 46:06.400
 So you think, what about making it exciting and dynamic?

46:06.400 --> 46:10.760
 You think the other person is always going to be going for the pin and thereby make it

46:10.760 --> 46:11.760
 dynamic?

46:11.760 --> 46:15.640
 Well, if they're working that hard, then they might exhaust themselves, right?

46:15.640 --> 46:19.960
 And obviously then if you're, if you're being that dynamic, then you're adding risk to yourself

46:19.960 --> 46:23.600
 too, because you are, you know, doing that, go, I love this.

46:23.600 --> 46:24.600
 This is a great idea.

46:24.600 --> 46:29.960
 Well, I figured I'd rack up like 20 pins against bums, you know, or not, not as great

46:29.960 --> 46:33.240
 people in the beginning, and then I would start bringing in better people because they

46:33.240 --> 46:36.680
 would be enticed by, you know, $20,000, the possibility to win.

46:36.680 --> 46:41.120
 And not, not much fanfare, just a camera and just, that's it in my wrestling room.

46:41.120 --> 46:42.120
 Yeah.

46:42.120 --> 46:43.120
 Yeah.

46:43.120 --> 46:44.120
 Like the Gracie challenge.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.120
 Yes.

46:45.120 --> 46:46.120
 Yeah.

46:46.120 --> 46:50.040
 And so then maybe you have like, um, you know, for most people, you have someone edit

46:50.040 --> 46:52.840
 like the 90 seconds of the most fun things that happen.

46:52.840 --> 46:55.320
 And then you can watch the entire 30 minutes if you want to.

46:55.320 --> 46:56.320
 Yeah.

46:56.320 --> 46:59.680
 I mean, I think most people, if they're not really, really elite, um, I'm probably going

46:59.680 --> 47:00.680
 to pin them.

47:00.680 --> 47:01.680
 Yeah.

47:01.680 --> 47:04.760
 If they're not really elite.

47:04.760 --> 47:05.760
 So yeah.

47:05.760 --> 47:06.760
 But I don't know.

47:06.760 --> 47:07.760
 I, I, that's something I've been thinking about.

47:07.760 --> 47:12.480
 This has been like fun for me to think about, um, obviously a place in my skill sets because

47:12.480 --> 47:16.120
 my cardio is good and my pinning is good also.

47:16.120 --> 47:17.280
 So yeah.

47:17.280 --> 47:23.560
 So like you said, you weren't very good in your early days until 13, 14.

47:23.560 --> 47:24.560
 What was the switch?

47:24.560 --> 47:31.080
 You became, you started to dominate people in your college career, dominated and, uh,

47:31.080 --> 47:33.720
 obviously you stopped losing at some point.

47:33.720 --> 47:34.720
 Yeah.

47:34.720 --> 47:38.640
 So, uh, well I would say, so even when I didn't lose in collegiate competition, I would go

47:38.640 --> 47:40.400
 in the summers and try to make the world team.

47:40.400 --> 47:43.320
 So I would lose some, not a lot, right?

47:43.320 --> 47:44.320
 Minimally.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.320
 Um, okay.

47:45.320 --> 47:50.120
 So when I'm five, I start playing all sports like, I know you moved to America at what

47:50.120 --> 47:51.120
 age?

47:51.120 --> 47:52.120
 13.

47:52.120 --> 47:53.120
 Okay.

47:53.120 --> 47:57.920
 Um, at least I don't know what it was for you, but in America at my age, you usually

47:57.920 --> 47:59.720
 play like a sport every season, right?

47:59.720 --> 48:01.800
 So that's what I did in the beginning.

48:01.800 --> 48:06.360
 Um, I had minimal success in wrestling and I was kind of chunky.

48:06.360 --> 48:08.400
 And then I'm in fifth grade.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.200
 I don't, and I can't, I can't tell you, I want to be better.

48:11.200 --> 48:14.480
 And I told my parents that it is funny because now I look at other 11 year olds and very

48:14.480 --> 48:16.000
 few of them are this mature.

48:16.000 --> 48:19.080
 And I actually think emotional maturity is kind of one of the key indicators of how long

48:19.080 --> 48:21.280
 term successful someone's going to be.

48:21.280 --> 48:24.000
 And at age 11, I said, I don't want to play baseball and I like baseball, but I don't

48:24.000 --> 48:26.920
 want to play baseball because I want to wrestle more because I want to get better at wrestling.

48:26.920 --> 48:31.040
 So age 11, I quit baseball so I could wrestle in a club for March, April and May because

48:31.040 --> 48:33.360
 that was, that was all that existed at that point in time.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.120
 You couldn't wrestle in June, July or August, any of those other months.

48:36.120 --> 48:38.880
 Um, what was that desire to get better?

48:38.880 --> 48:39.880
 What is it?

48:39.880 --> 48:41.200
 So it's not about, I don't know where it came from.

48:41.200 --> 48:43.200
 I just wanted to get better.

48:43.200 --> 48:44.200
 I want to get better.

48:44.200 --> 48:45.200
 I want to be good at this.

48:45.200 --> 48:46.200
 I want to be really good at this.

48:46.200 --> 48:49.080
 So when you're looking at kids now as a coach, you're looking for that.

48:49.080 --> 48:52.600
 Somebody who says, you know what, I kind of suck, I want to get better.

48:52.600 --> 48:54.360
 And I want to try to also inspire that.

48:54.360 --> 49:01.080
 I mean, honestly, I think, I think as a coach, that's probably my, my biggest job is to get

49:01.080 --> 49:03.800
 a kid and get them to believe I can do this.

49:03.800 --> 49:07.360
 Cause if I can do this, what can I, I can do that.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.360
 I can do that too.

49:08.360 --> 49:09.360
 Right.

49:09.360 --> 49:14.200
 And there's so many kids who unfortunately have like shitty parents or bad teachers that

49:14.200 --> 49:15.360
 tell them, you suck.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.360
 You can't be anything.

49:16.360 --> 49:17.360
 Right.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.240
 So my biggest goal as a coach is to get someone to believe they can do it.

49:20.240 --> 49:23.440
 So actually some of the ones that believe they can do it, they're the most fun, but

49:23.440 --> 49:25.400
 they're not the ones who need it the most, right?

49:25.400 --> 49:29.040
 The ones who think they can are the ones that need me the most because they need someone

49:29.040 --> 49:31.440
 to let's go.

49:31.440 --> 49:33.400
 So I don't, I don't know what inspired me.

49:33.400 --> 49:34.400
 I'm not sure.

49:34.400 --> 49:37.480
 So age, at age 11, fifth grade, I quit.

49:37.480 --> 49:41.640
 I started, so then I started having more success, you know, where I'm like, say placing up the

49:41.640 --> 49:44.960
 state tournament in high school.

49:44.960 --> 49:45.960
 So you, right?

49:45.960 --> 49:49.760
 And so sixth grade, I placed it like the state local youth state tournament, you know, so

49:49.760 --> 49:51.240
 I'm like having more success.

49:51.240 --> 49:55.240
 Seventh grade was the first year I won the youth state tournament.

49:55.240 --> 49:56.240
 So I'm getting better.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.680
 Eighth grade, I actually feel like I got pretty good, but like when I went to the national

49:59.680 --> 50:03.280
 tournaments, I was still having really minimal success.

50:03.280 --> 50:05.040
 My freshman year, I decided to quit football.

50:05.040 --> 50:06.040
 Same reason.

50:06.040 --> 50:07.040
 It's like, well, I need to put more time into this.

50:07.040 --> 50:10.080
 My parents, we got, my dad luckily got a mat in my basement.

50:10.080 --> 50:14.240
 So, you know, there's no, so we have a year on club and our impetus was that we didn't

50:14.240 --> 50:16.920
 have this opportunity to go to a club year round.

50:16.920 --> 50:17.920
 So we had a mat in my basement.

50:17.920 --> 50:20.920
 I had to go find, hey, you want to, you want to come wrestle?

50:20.920 --> 50:22.920
 Oh yeah, to find partners for myself.

50:22.920 --> 50:23.920
 What'd you do?

50:23.920 --> 50:24.920
 Did you drill?

50:24.920 --> 50:25.920
 Did you live wrestle?

50:25.920 --> 50:26.920
 What'd you do in that basement?

50:26.920 --> 50:28.520
 So actually, I think you'll enjoy this.

50:28.520 --> 50:34.520
 I think the start of my scrambling was, was kind of based around that.

50:34.520 --> 50:39.200
 So I got kind of, I think it's probably my freshman, sophomore, I'm kind of, the years

50:39.200 --> 50:45.640
 are a little fuzzy right now, but probably my freshman, sophomore, junior year, I found

50:45.640 --> 50:49.360
 two kids who were really consistent, who would come out like you'd come out on, he'd come

50:49.360 --> 50:51.760
 out on Tuesday and this dude come out on a Wednesday, right?

50:51.760 --> 50:55.320
 And they would come every week and they were really consistent partners for me to have in

50:55.320 --> 50:57.960
 the summer, but they weren't nearly as good as me.

50:57.960 --> 50:58.960
 They were way worse.

50:58.960 --> 51:05.080
 So it's like, okay, how do I, how do I make this kind of like fun and compelling for them

51:05.080 --> 51:06.080
 to come back?

51:06.080 --> 51:08.960
 If I swoop their ass, they're not going to come back, you know?

51:08.960 --> 51:12.160
 So it was like, I would let them get as close as they could, as I thought they could do

51:12.160 --> 51:17.000
 a takedown before not getting it and then try to like escape or get out.

51:17.000 --> 51:20.320
 So obviously if I let them get really close, sometimes they get it, you know, so they're,

51:20.320 --> 51:21.320
 they're enjoying it.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.560
 I don't know if they ever knew I was doing this, right?

51:23.560 --> 51:25.440
 I have no idea.

51:25.440 --> 51:28.740
 And that was kind of like the start cause I had to figure my way out of bad positions

51:28.740 --> 51:33.200
 because I had to try to make it entertaining for them where they still got something out

51:33.200 --> 51:35.080
 of it and they want to come back the next week.

51:35.080 --> 51:36.480
 And I also got something out of it.

51:36.480 --> 51:37.480
 Yeah.

51:37.480 --> 51:38.480
 I love this.

51:38.480 --> 51:44.680
 The relationship is so important with that, like that I've, I've had a few drilling partners,

51:44.680 --> 51:47.960
 training partners that were really important to my life.

51:47.960 --> 51:52.560
 And I always wonder why it's difficult, why it's so difficult to find them.

51:52.560 --> 51:53.560
 Yeah.

51:53.560 --> 51:57.840
 Like I, if anyone's listening to this, I'm looking for a judo person in the Austin area

51:57.840 --> 52:01.160
 actually, getting the reps with people is hard.

52:01.160 --> 52:06.560
 Even in Jiu Jitsu, that it's just like people want to do the fun stuff.

52:06.560 --> 52:10.560
 They don't want to really put in the work and it takes a certain kind of personality.

52:10.560 --> 52:15.000
 And then you also have to make it fun for the other person, just like you said, if there's

52:15.000 --> 52:21.320
 a skill mismatch, but also if you have an interest mismatch in terms of the, the amount

52:21.320 --> 52:24.080
 of drilling you want to do, all that kind of stuff, you have to figure out ways to make

52:24.080 --> 52:25.080
 it fun.

52:25.080 --> 52:26.080
 Yeah.

52:26.080 --> 52:27.080
 It's tricky.

52:27.080 --> 52:28.080
 So you did.

52:28.080 --> 52:29.080
 So yeah, I think I did that.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.080
 And no one told me.

52:30.080 --> 52:34.040
 So I get some, I get frustrated cause now we have, you know, just at my academy, we probably

52:34.040 --> 52:38.040
 have 50, 60 high school kids only that are year round, that they're year round.

52:38.040 --> 52:40.800
 You know, maybe they're not consistent in the summer or whatever, but they're there.

52:40.800 --> 52:43.920
 So when they don't have a great partner, they start whining and it's like, you little

52:43.920 --> 52:44.920
 bitches.

52:44.920 --> 52:47.720
 Like, you know, I, I, I, I, some days I get really mad about it cause it's like, I had

52:47.720 --> 52:48.720
 no partner.

52:48.720 --> 52:50.760
 I had to find freaking two partners come twice a week.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.960
 You guys, there's still 22 people in the room.

52:52.960 --> 52:53.960
 I'm sorry.

52:53.960 --> 52:57.240
 There's not the perfect partner for you, but like go work out with that dude.

52:57.240 --> 52:58.240
 Yeah.

52:58.240 --> 52:59.240
 You know?

52:59.240 --> 53:00.240
 Yeah.

53:00.240 --> 53:01.240
 So what was the switch to change?

53:01.240 --> 53:02.240
 Was, was it gradual or gradual?

53:02.240 --> 53:03.240
 Okay.

53:03.240 --> 53:06.240
 So, uh, it was, it was the ninth grade I quit football cause I want to get really serious.

53:06.240 --> 53:07.240
 Um,

53:07.240 --> 53:08.240
 What position?

53:08.240 --> 53:09.240
 Football.

53:09.240 --> 53:10.240
 It was actually a nose tackle.

53:10.240 --> 53:12.920
 And I was, but at that point, so I, okay, so I was also the other thing I kind of left

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
 up here.

53:13.920 --> 53:17.040
 I was really fat growing up in a sixth grade.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.800
 I also decided, okay, I'm really fat and if I want to be competitive wrestling, I shouldn't

53:20.800 --> 53:21.960
 be fat cause weight matters.

53:21.960 --> 53:24.600
 I went from 130 pounds to a hundred pounds in sixth grade.

53:24.600 --> 53:28.560
 Um, so by the time I was a freshman, I was 119.

53:28.560 --> 53:30.920
 So I had, I still wasn't as heavy as I was on sixth grade.

53:30.920 --> 53:34.000
 So I was pretty small too, but I was also slow unfortunately.

53:34.000 --> 53:35.640
 So they put me a nose tackle.

53:35.640 --> 53:38.680
 I, you know, I like the combativeness so I was decent at it.

53:38.680 --> 53:41.320
 Um, so that's where you wrestled 119?

53:41.320 --> 53:42.320
 My freshman year.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.320
 Yeah.

53:43.320 --> 53:44.320
 So yeah.

53:44.320 --> 53:49.080
 So then I still, I would start having a lot of success statewide, but not nationally.

53:49.080 --> 53:53.040
 It's my national success didn't come to like my junior year in high school.

53:53.040 --> 53:55.800
 But yeah, I was like grinding and getting better the whole time and then senior year

53:55.800 --> 53:59.960
 I started having a lot of success nationally and I recruited and then, but then even when

53:59.960 --> 54:03.320
 my freshman year of college, I, uh, this is where I love competing.

54:03.320 --> 54:09.080
 I would go every weekend cause I knew if you, if you take the emotions out of competition,

54:09.080 --> 54:13.400
 all it is is seeing your failures, acknowledging them and then figuring out what you need to

54:13.400 --> 54:14.400
 work on.

54:14.400 --> 54:15.400
 Right.

54:15.400 --> 54:16.840
 If we take all the emotion out of it, that's what it is.

54:16.840 --> 54:20.280
 So I wrestled 50 matches as a red shirt freshman, which is incredibly rare.

54:20.280 --> 54:21.880
 I had 10 losses.

54:21.880 --> 54:25.080
 So it's not like to not, not so great guys, you know?

54:25.080 --> 54:28.040
 So like my, my skill level still at that point was not that great.

54:28.040 --> 54:30.280
 And then the next year I came out and I made it into your finals.

54:30.280 --> 54:35.680
 So my, my, I made a gigantic jump in that red shirt year to the, to the real freshman

54:35.680 --> 54:36.680
 year.

54:36.680 --> 54:37.680
 So a few questions.

54:37.680 --> 54:38.680
 Yeah.

54:38.680 --> 54:44.560
 Where did the funk style of wrestling, the, the creative style get developed at which stage?

54:44.560 --> 54:48.640
 So I, so I think like looking retroactively, there was no, there was no intention to start

54:48.640 --> 54:52.520
 when I was in high school with those kids, but I think that's kind of like, well, what

54:52.520 --> 54:54.800
 was happening, right?

54:54.800 --> 54:59.040
 So what I would really say is I had, I had one influential coach, my retro year of college

54:59.040 --> 55:01.880
 named Mike Ironman, a great guy.

55:01.880 --> 55:04.200
 But then the second thing was, it was just out of necessity.

55:04.200 --> 55:06.800
 I had this burning desire to be the best.

55:06.800 --> 55:10.120
 And when I was getting my ass kicked every day in the room, cause we, you know, the retirement

55:10.120 --> 55:11.120
 was there.

55:11.120 --> 55:12.120
 We had all American 157.

55:12.120 --> 55:13.120
 We had all American 184.

55:13.120 --> 55:16.400
 So I wasn't having a ton of success.

55:16.400 --> 55:21.680
 And very quickly I realized from like a more traditional athletic perspective, strength

55:21.680 --> 55:22.680
 and speed.

55:22.680 --> 55:23.680
 I couldn't keep up with anyone.

55:23.680 --> 55:25.200
 It was way worse.

55:25.200 --> 55:27.300
 So it's like, okay, fuck, how do I, how do I do this?

55:27.300 --> 55:28.300
 You know, I want to do this.

55:28.300 --> 55:29.800
 How do I do this?

55:29.800 --> 55:31.440
 There's gotta be a way, you know?

55:31.440 --> 55:36.360
 So Mike Ironman showed me a couple of things, but then it was just like this creative expansion

55:36.360 --> 55:40.320
 for the next, you know, through, say three to five years.

55:40.320 --> 55:42.720
 And then even now it's like, I don't know.

55:42.720 --> 55:46.040
 There's something, and maybe you feel this way about judo or there's something that's

55:46.040 --> 55:51.920
 like fun about the way the body moves and works and, and, and exploring something new

55:51.920 --> 55:55.680
 and thinking about, hey, wrestling's been happening at a relative high level for, we'll

55:55.680 --> 55:59.240
 say 80 to 90 years in America.

55:59.240 --> 56:01.440
 And there's still new things being developed.

56:01.440 --> 56:03.800
 And so when you see something new, you're like, oh, damn, like that's great.

56:03.800 --> 56:05.640
 Or like Jason Nolfe may have to win Dixie.

56:05.640 --> 56:07.200
 I'm like, why did I think of that shit?

56:07.200 --> 56:08.200
 Like, why did I think of that?

56:08.200 --> 56:09.200
 It's so easy.

56:09.200 --> 56:11.280
 I should, I should have thought of that, you know?

56:11.280 --> 56:16.680
 So there's this like obsession with the sport or wrestling and, you know, positions where

56:16.680 --> 56:21.160
 I actually think sometimes think I wouldn't have smartphones because I may have been

56:21.160 --> 56:23.520
 distracted by my smartphone.

56:23.520 --> 56:27.560
 Maybe I wouldn't have been so obsessed, but maybe, but you know, some days I had, I couldn't

56:27.560 --> 56:31.360
 finish the single leg on this specific person or, or they, maybe they were finishing on

56:31.360 --> 56:35.920
 me and it was like, go home and I was just fucking obsessed about that one position.

56:35.920 --> 56:39.080
 Like, okay, how do, what, what am I missing here?

56:39.080 --> 56:43.080
 And not just accepting like that, whatever the coach has to the answer, but like, what

56:43.080 --> 56:44.080
 am I missing?

56:44.080 --> 56:48.640
 What ways can my body move that no one's told me it can move yet?

56:48.640 --> 56:49.640
 Where can my arms go?

56:49.640 --> 56:50.640
 Right?

56:50.640 --> 56:51.640
 And I do all these things.

56:51.640 --> 56:53.960
 And so I would just obsess about these things.

56:53.960 --> 56:56.880
 And then, you know, sometimes you come in the next day and you say, oh, well, maybe this,

56:56.880 --> 56:58.920
 you know, and maybe it works.

56:58.920 --> 56:59.920
 Maybe it doesn't.

56:59.920 --> 57:00.920
 Maybe it works twice and it doesn't work the next time.

57:00.920 --> 57:04.600
 And so you kind of like have this creative process and like, you know, there's a lot

57:04.600 --> 57:08.160
 of things that are on the cutting room floor that never made it to the light because you

57:08.160 --> 57:10.500
 thought they'd be good and they failed and they sucked.

57:10.500 --> 57:15.680
 And then, you know, to the point where I like my senior year, I got to this point where

57:15.680 --> 57:20.480
 the people, then they were just figures, figures would wrestle in my head about positions

57:20.480 --> 57:21.480
 I was thinking about.

57:21.480 --> 57:22.480
 I wouldn't tell them what to do.

57:22.480 --> 57:29.160
 They would just, they'd just go in my head and then like some of that just happened.

57:29.160 --> 57:30.160
 That's the move.

57:30.160 --> 57:31.160
 And then I'd go try to practice it.

57:31.160 --> 57:32.160
 Sure enough.

57:32.160 --> 57:33.160
 Boom.

57:33.160 --> 57:34.160
 That's the move.

57:34.160 --> 57:35.480
 That's exactly what we have alpha zero playing learning chess.

57:35.480 --> 57:36.480
 Yeah.

57:36.480 --> 57:37.480
 Oh, no.

57:37.480 --> 57:38.480
 It's called self plays.

57:38.480 --> 57:44.080
 You have, what did the figures have like a clear, no faces.

57:44.080 --> 57:48.480
 They were just like, did they have a human form or is it just like stick figures, essentially?

57:48.480 --> 57:51.920
 Yeah, it was not like humans, it was more like stick figures.

57:51.920 --> 57:54.080
 It wouldn't stick figures exactly like they were.

57:54.080 --> 57:55.080
 Sorry.

57:55.080 --> 57:56.080
 They had some volume.

57:56.080 --> 57:57.080
 Yeah.

57:57.080 --> 58:00.440
 It was like, it was like a great person and they had, you know, three dimensions essentially

58:00.440 --> 58:05.840
 because I had to see how the things moved and yeah.

58:05.840 --> 58:11.480
 I mean, this is exactly what open AI and deep mind at Google are, I don't know if you've

58:11.480 --> 58:16.280
 seen, but there's something called reinforcement learning and artificial intelligence where

58:16.280 --> 58:19.160
 you have like, they've done it for like sumo wrestling.

58:19.160 --> 58:24.520
 You have, you have like, you have these two stick figures that don't even know how to

58:24.520 --> 58:29.600
 get up at first and they figure out how to stand their two feet and then they figure

58:29.600 --> 58:33.480
 out how to push the other person off of the pedestal.

58:33.480 --> 58:38.040
 Wait, so, but what about like, when you look at the, the Boston dynamics or sometimes they

58:38.040 --> 58:41.640
 have trouble with like jumping and balancing and the other stuff.

58:41.640 --> 58:43.800
 So are they, are they doing that same program or no?

58:43.800 --> 58:44.800
 No, no, no.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.800
 It's different.

58:46.800 --> 58:50.480
 Everything Boston Dynamics is doing is hard coded.

58:50.480 --> 58:57.280
 So it's not, it's not learning the, all of the sophisticated movements and strategies

58:57.280 --> 58:59.040
 like high level strategies and movement.

58:59.040 --> 59:02.120
 That's all something that Boston Dynamics is not doing.

59:02.120 --> 59:06.600
 If it does it, like the parkour stuff, that's all hard coded.

59:06.600 --> 59:13.800
 People like project and think like these robots have like discovered like how to move in sophisticated

59:13.800 --> 59:14.800
 ways they haven't.

59:14.800 --> 59:20.840
 Well, that's why when you and John were talking about the grappling robot, I mean, the one

59:20.840 --> 59:27.360
 thing I was, I was obsessing about in my head is that with the chest, right, if a chest

59:27.360 --> 59:31.440
 piece moves, right, the horse can move like an L, right?

59:31.440 --> 59:35.680
 It can only move like an L. It doesn't matter if it moves at two meters per second or seven

59:35.680 --> 59:36.680
 meters per second.

59:36.680 --> 59:38.880
 It can only move, it can only move there, right?

59:38.880 --> 59:43.520
 Whereas like a single leg, I can shoot a single leg with many different velocities.

59:43.520 --> 59:45.200
 I can shoot at different angles.

59:45.200 --> 59:48.080
 I can shoot with different amounts of force, right?

59:48.080 --> 59:50.720
 I can shoot with my head up versus my head, I mean, right?

59:50.720 --> 59:51.720
 All these things are going to matter.

59:51.720 --> 59:56.440
 If we're talking about a human being defending the single leg, all of those things are going

59:56.440 --> 59:57.440
 to matter.

59:57.440 --> 1:00:01.560
 And that's where human beings are who wrestle are calculating those things subconsciously.

1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:05.920
 They're obviously not consciously calculating in their head, oh, the, the force is coming

1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:06.920
 at me at this.

1:00:06.920 --> 1:00:07.920
 So I need to do that, right?

1:00:07.920 --> 1:00:08.920
 They're just doing it.

1:00:08.920 --> 1:00:14.160
 But yeah, the thing is, so you would absolutely, if you're doing a robot that you're wrestling,

1:00:14.160 --> 1:00:17.480
 you're going to have to constrain the speed at which it moves and the power that it's

1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:19.200
 able to deliver.

1:00:19.200 --> 1:00:22.440
 So that presumably, there'll be the limitation.

1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:24.960
 So then it'll be just the same exact, whether it's a human.

1:00:24.960 --> 1:00:29.400
 But then, but it's, even with, so if we go human max force or Jordan Rose double max

1:00:29.400 --> 1:00:30.400
 force, right?

1:00:30.400 --> 1:00:31.880
 That's the highest, that's the highest we get.

1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:35.200
 Then we go down from there.

1:00:35.200 --> 1:00:39.880
 Even with, even within that, it's like, sometimes I can shoot single leg with a maximum force

1:00:39.880 --> 1:00:43.200
 of, I don't know, we'll just say, we'll say 20 is the number, right?

1:00:43.200 --> 1:00:47.040
 I don't know, I'll shoot at 20 because I feel sometimes I shoot at 15, sometimes I

1:00:47.040 --> 1:00:48.680
 shoot at 12, right?

1:00:48.680 --> 1:00:52.400
 Because you feel something in your opponent that makes you do it differently.

1:00:52.400 --> 1:00:55.640
 So they would have to learn how, and then, you know, all of these different things.

1:00:55.640 --> 1:00:58.040
 And sometimes maybe I clamp a little harder.

1:00:58.040 --> 1:01:03.320
 So the, the robot would have to learn all of these different incoming inputs to the system

1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:05.320
 and then create this reaction.

1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:06.320
 Oh, no, no, no, 100%.

1:01:06.320 --> 1:01:07.560
 So this would be all continuous.

1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:08.560
 Like, yeah.

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:10.920
 So unlike chess, it would not be just chess is discreet.

1:01:10.920 --> 1:01:16.080
 There's, it's one and you move, it's a, it's a very specific set of moves.

1:01:16.080 --> 1:01:20.480
 Now here you would, those are all variables you control and they're continuous variables.

1:01:20.480 --> 1:01:23.480
 So the speed, the force, there's actuators.

1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:25.040
 So there's all these joints, right?

1:01:25.040 --> 1:01:26.040
 Yeah.

1:01:26.040 --> 1:01:27.040
 You can move.

1:01:27.040 --> 1:01:28.680
 I mean, it's just an optimization problem.

1:01:28.680 --> 1:01:29.680
 It's kind of fast.

1:01:29.680 --> 1:01:30.680
 And it's, it's fascinating.

1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:33.280
 So I've been fascinated thinking about it since you guys talked about it with, I, it's

1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:34.280
 it was a long time ago.

1:01:34.280 --> 1:01:37.960
 I listened to it probably three to four weeks ago and I've kind of been like obsessing about

1:01:37.960 --> 1:01:38.960
 it ever since.

1:01:38.960 --> 1:01:39.960
 Yeah.

1:01:39.960 --> 1:01:47.120
 It just changes when, so unlike boxing, for example, or striking, it, you know, once

1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:51.480
 you grab a hold of somebody, it, it changed, you're now one body.

1:01:51.480 --> 1:01:52.480
 Right?

1:01:52.480 --> 1:01:53.760
 So it's very complicated.

1:01:53.760 --> 1:01:59.840
 It's not just shooting a, a double leg without like maybe doing like, like faking a double

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:05.080
 leg and then shooting the double leg, that's very doable with robotics, but then like doing

1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:13.280
 a clinch and from there doing like a Russian tie, like that, that's, I think it's way harder

1:02:13.280 --> 1:02:19.160
 than people realize in terms of how many things are involved, like the force of the grip,

1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:22.960
 the leverage you're providing with all the different parts of the shoulder and the arm

1:02:22.960 --> 1:02:27.480
 and the torso, the twist, how much of your weight are you allocating, like leaning on

1:02:27.480 --> 1:02:31.880
 the other person, like taking weight off of one of your legs and the other leg, all of

1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:32.880
 that.

1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:36.840
 I think that's the really interesting thing about humans is we're able to do all of this

1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:37.840
 calculation.

1:02:37.840 --> 1:02:38.840
 Subconsciously.

1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:39.840
 Yeah.

1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:40.840
 Subconsciously.

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:41.840
 Yeah.

1:02:41.840 --> 1:02:44.520
 And that's what I've been thinking about since we, it's like, how many things even these

1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:49.800
 high school athletes who are like getting medium good are subconsciously thinking about

1:02:49.800 --> 1:02:54.920
 all the time or not even, not even thinking about, sorry, reacting to, but then even like

1:02:54.920 --> 1:02:58.600
 for me, I'm, you know, I'm a few, or is it Meg do better than somebody's kid that player?

1:02:58.600 --> 1:03:02.680
 And so when I, when I go like super hard, it's like, I can feel their weight moving the

1:03:02.680 --> 1:03:03.680
 wrong direction.

1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:07.120
 And so for me to off balance them or trip them or whatever, it's kind of easy sometimes,

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:11.560
 you know, because they're not feeling it the right way, right?

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:15.440
 Or their timing is just a little bit off or the way they're grabbing the hip, maybe they

1:03:15.440 --> 1:03:16.800
 should be up a little higher, right?

1:03:16.800 --> 1:03:18.600
 These really small things.

1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:19.600
 Yeah.

1:03:19.600 --> 1:03:24.680
 I think that's all easy to take advantage of for a robot is just, there's so many things

1:03:24.680 --> 1:03:30.520
 that the big problem is ethically, I don't know how many people are willing to train

1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:33.480
 with a robot because you're going to get hurt.

1:03:33.480 --> 1:03:36.240
 Well, couldn't you make a robot change the robot or no?

1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:42.040
 Yes, but then it's expensive because they're going to put the padding on that thing.

1:03:42.040 --> 1:03:51.480
 I know, but then it's not, you know, then you're not capturing the full, why can't you

1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:54.960
 put like some rubber coating on them, right, you know, something for that effect?

1:03:54.960 --> 1:03:55.960
 You could.

1:03:55.960 --> 1:03:56.960
 I mean, you could.

1:03:56.960 --> 1:03:57.960
 Yeah.

1:03:57.960 --> 1:03:58.960
 You could.

1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:02.880
 I mean, you're talking about robots that are, these are humanoid robots.

1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:07.480
 So we're talking about $500,000 million robots.

1:04:07.480 --> 1:04:14.600
 So you would have to be motivated to spend a lot of money because you have to have them

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:19.400
 wrestle for like a lot.

1:04:19.400 --> 1:04:20.400
 To get better.

1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:21.400
 Yeah.

1:04:21.400 --> 1:04:31.880
 And then the open question is how long does it take to get good enough to be a human?

1:04:31.880 --> 1:04:37.040
 I don't think we understand, I don't know, I don't think you understand how hard wrestling

1:04:37.040 --> 1:04:38.040
 is.

1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:39.040
 Yeah.

1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:40.040
 Like, is it a really hard problem?

1:04:40.040 --> 1:04:41.040
 Like, what's harder?

1:04:41.040 --> 1:04:42.040
 Chest or wrestling?

1:04:42.040 --> 1:04:43.040
 Wrestling by far.

1:04:43.040 --> 1:04:44.040
 Not even close.

1:04:44.040 --> 1:04:45.040
 That's, yeah.

1:04:45.040 --> 1:04:46.040
 That's the sense.

1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:49.600
 So because there's an infinite amount of moves, right, and possibilities.

1:04:49.600 --> 1:04:53.080
 So once I shoot the single leg, now you have X amount of choices.

1:04:53.080 --> 1:04:54.080
 Once you make your choice.

1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:55.080
 Now I have a choice.

1:04:55.080 --> 1:04:56.080
 X amount of choices.

1:04:56.080 --> 1:04:59.240
 Now, now you have X amount of choices on the defense and we can just keep going back and

1:04:59.240 --> 1:05:00.240
 forth, right?

1:05:00.240 --> 1:05:01.240
 And this number becomes.

1:05:01.240 --> 1:05:02.240
 Yeah.

1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:03.240
 But the same happens with chess.

1:05:03.240 --> 1:05:04.240
 Correct.

1:05:04.240 --> 1:05:08.240
 But then in wrestling, you have to make these movements in very instantaneously, right?

1:05:08.240 --> 1:05:10.920
 Cause I should have seen like, I'm not going to wait and say, what's your defense?

1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:11.920
 Yeah.

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:12.920
 Right?

1:05:12.920 --> 1:05:13.920
 It's going to be instantaneously.

1:05:13.920 --> 1:05:17.600
 And then also again, based on the force and the vectors and the angles, you have to

1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:19.760
 calculate that and adjust.

1:05:19.760 --> 1:05:22.960
 So really, you know, if you're saying, why can't you sing like it's not like moving

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:24.840
 chess, it's not one move, right?

1:05:24.840 --> 1:05:28.520
 If you want to talk about different forces and stuff, it could be hundreds or thousands

1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:32.160
 of different moves based on how hard I shoot it, the angle, the direction, all of those

1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:33.160
 things.

1:05:33.160 --> 1:05:34.160
 Yeah.

1:05:34.160 --> 1:05:35.160
 But wait a minute.

1:05:35.160 --> 1:05:36.160
 So robots can do this kind of stuff really fast.

1:05:36.160 --> 1:05:41.320
 You would, I, people probably know the physiology of this, but it's the, the reaction speed for

1:05:41.320 --> 1:05:43.600
 a human is maybe a hundred milliseconds up like that.

1:05:43.600 --> 1:05:44.600
 I don't know.

1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:50.160
 It's the sensation to, to, to like from the, the signal traveling up your, to your brain

1:05:50.160 --> 1:05:51.160
 and down.

1:05:51.160 --> 1:05:55.960
 I don't know what that number is, but a robot certainly could do way faster.

1:05:55.960 --> 1:05:59.320
 It, you would actually have to like constrain the speed.

1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:02.920
 Well, so the robots are already killing the chess people, right?

1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:03.920
 Yes.

1:06:03.920 --> 1:06:07.080
 So, yeah, theoretically they could eventually beat wrestlers, but you asked what was hard

1:06:07.080 --> 1:06:08.080
 wrestling a chess.

1:06:08.080 --> 1:06:09.080
 Yeah.

1:06:09.080 --> 1:06:14.360
 And I think wrestling is because of the time component in it and then the, and the physicality

1:06:14.360 --> 1:06:17.560
 of, you know, is it this force or that force?

1:06:17.560 --> 1:06:20.960
 You know, cause if, if I'm going to say, say we're in a seatbelt side by side, right?

1:06:20.960 --> 1:06:24.640
 A wrestling seatbelt, not what you just do.

1:06:24.640 --> 1:06:27.600
 Based on the pressure you're giving me, I might do a bunch of different things, right?

1:06:27.600 --> 1:06:33.040
 And so like to an untrained eye, they might both look like the same thing from you to

1:06:33.040 --> 1:06:34.760
 a trained feel.

1:06:34.760 --> 1:06:37.040
 It's like, well, in one case it's really evident I should go this one.

1:06:37.040 --> 1:06:39.320
 In another case, it's really evident I should go that way.

1:06:39.320 --> 1:06:47.240
 So the other thing to consider just like with chess, the AI systems, so human versus human

1:06:47.240 --> 1:06:49.040
 plays a certain way together.

1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:53.840
 They actually haven't considered a really large number of strategies that AI systems

1:06:53.840 --> 1:06:54.840
 discover.

1:06:54.840 --> 1:06:58.600
 So one possibility with a robot, they'll discover certain ties and certain takedowns.

1:06:58.600 --> 1:07:00.160
 That's what I'm saying.

1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:03.160
 That like will dominate no matter what the human does.

1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.760
 You think that, so you think there's that, so this, I mean, this is what I'm talking

1:07:05.760 --> 1:07:10.040
 about, the wrestling's so fun is there's even after 80, 90 years, there's this continuous

1:07:10.040 --> 1:07:11.040
 evolution.

1:07:11.040 --> 1:07:15.280
 There'll be some like low single type thing, like John Smith type of situation.

1:07:15.280 --> 1:07:19.200
 Well, like a down block go behind is something that has really, I would say really in the

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:21.800
 last five ish years has really been evolved.

1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:22.800
 What's a go behind?

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:23.800
 Down block go behind.

1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:28.480
 So when you, they just head inside or head outside matters, but there's one for both.

1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:31.240
 You shoot at me essentially, I take my leg, boom.

1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:34.280
 And then so that was kind of in existence when I was in college, right?

1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:38.200
 You down block them and you stop, but usually you hit on this side of their head, right?

1:07:38.200 --> 1:07:41.160
 And now immediately as you shoot an eye attack that shoulder, and then I start hitting a

1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:43.280
 go behind on you, right?

1:07:43.280 --> 1:07:49.000
 And so like that in its current incarnation, it absolutely was around, I was in college,

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:53.080
 I would say it probably became popular five to seven years ago.

1:07:53.080 --> 1:07:56.360
 So yeah, there's these big things that are happening.

1:07:56.360 --> 1:07:58.480
 Now I really want a robot because I want to be a head of the game.

1:07:58.480 --> 1:08:00.240
 I want to know what I'm missing.

1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:07.400
 I mean, one interesting thing you have with Alpha zero that plays chess is it sacrifices

1:08:07.400 --> 1:08:09.600
 pieces much more than humans do.

1:08:09.600 --> 1:08:15.200
 So give you a piece and not only does it give you a piece, it will wait a bunch of moves

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:18.520
 before it makes you pay.

1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:21.280
 So because it knows that that's better for the long term.

1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:22.280
 Long term.

1:08:22.280 --> 1:08:28.200
 So like humans rarely sacrifice without getting the piece back like two or three moves after

1:08:28.200 --> 1:08:31.400
 Alpha zero can wait like five moves.

1:08:31.400 --> 1:08:37.600
 So so basically you have, you potentially with wrestling, you might have a robot that

1:08:37.600 --> 1:08:42.600
 like puts itself in bad positions, but in a certain kind of way, then that will actually

1:08:42.600 --> 1:08:48.560
 lures the opponent in to trap exactly what my style is based on.

1:08:48.560 --> 1:08:52.520
 You basically narrow one thing to do is you narrow the set of choices.

1:08:52.520 --> 1:08:55.640
 You put yourself in a bad position, but it narrows a set of choices for them because

1:08:55.640 --> 1:08:56.640
 they're not used to it.

1:08:56.640 --> 1:08:58.240
 They're not used to it.

1:08:58.240 --> 1:09:02.480
 And then you drag them into your, yeah.

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:07.640
 So but there's also the problem is there's mechanical issues like it's actually just

1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:13.120
 difficult to build robots that are able to sense because we have sensation throughout

1:09:13.120 --> 1:09:14.120
 our body.

1:09:14.120 --> 1:09:15.120
 Yeah.

1:09:15.120 --> 1:09:16.120
 It's just difficult to build that kind of robot.

1:09:16.120 --> 1:09:17.120
 It's expensive.

1:09:17.120 --> 1:09:21.920
 You start talking about multi, multi million dollars and then people start asking you questions.

1:09:21.920 --> 1:09:23.760
 Why did you invest all of this money?

1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:26.760
 Let's see what moves they do.

1:09:26.760 --> 1:09:27.760
 Hello.

1:09:27.760 --> 1:09:28.760
 It could be better investment.

1:09:28.760 --> 1:09:29.760
 Okay.

1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:32.160
 So I mentioned John Smith.

1:09:32.160 --> 1:09:36.480
 He is, if people don't know, one of the great wrestlers, wrestling coaches ever.

1:09:36.480 --> 1:09:38.040
 He's also creative like you.

1:09:38.040 --> 1:09:39.800
 He spoke really highly of you.

1:09:39.800 --> 1:09:40.800
 What do you think about that guy?

1:09:40.800 --> 1:09:42.360
 Do you guys ever work together?

1:09:42.360 --> 1:09:43.360
 Not really.

1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:44.360
 So, so you know what?

1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:49.080
 When I was a senior and I had the people wrestling in my head, I was lucky enough to

1:09:49.080 --> 1:09:51.760
 be doing, I was pretty much graduated.

1:09:51.760 --> 1:09:55.400
 So I did an independent study with the sports I call, I was potentially going to go to grad

1:09:55.400 --> 1:09:56.400
 school for sports.

1:09:56.400 --> 1:10:00.400
 Well, I actually had nine credits and then I decided I didn't want to do it anymore.

1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:05.480
 I continue learning on my own, but I had an independent study with the guy who's the head

1:10:05.480 --> 1:10:07.880
 of USA track and field sports site.

1:10:07.880 --> 1:10:11.840
 So the class was, I got to go sit down and talk with him for an hour and he was like

1:10:11.840 --> 1:10:13.440
 fascinated by me.

1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:14.760
 So he didn't let me do a homework.

1:10:14.760 --> 1:10:16.280
 It was like the greatest three credits ever.

1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:17.280
 We just talked.

1:10:17.280 --> 1:10:18.280
 I learned so much.

1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:20.480
 It was so awesome.

1:10:20.480 --> 1:10:24.920
 But so I started, so one time it came up that had these robot people wrestling in my head,

1:10:24.920 --> 1:10:27.840
 you know, and he said, well, who else do you think that John Smith happened?

1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:31.120
 So I went and got John Smith's number and called him and say, you ever had these people

1:10:31.120 --> 1:10:32.120
 wrestling in your head?

1:10:32.120 --> 1:10:36.040
 And he said, yeah, but as soon as it stopped coaching, they went away.

1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:37.040
 Same thing happened to me.

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:38.720
 So they started coaching, they went away.

1:10:38.720 --> 1:10:43.560
 So if I really forced myself now and I'm like, you know, I see some in practice, and it's

1:10:43.560 --> 1:10:46.720
 really high level because high school wrestling, I don't want to, maybe I feel bad, but it's

1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:48.400
 like, it's a little bit lower level, right?

1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:51.920
 So if like Keegan, for example, who won the tournament, if he's struggling with a problem

1:10:51.920 --> 1:10:58.160
 or asked me a question, and I can force myself to like see the bodies moving and think about

1:10:58.160 --> 1:11:01.720
 it again, you know, kind of like I was in the earlys, but it won't just, it won't just

1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:02.880
 flow there anymore.

1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:03.880
 So he said it went away.

1:11:03.880 --> 1:11:11.600
 And for me, it went away also, by the way, if you can pause on the, on the bodies in

1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:16.120
 your head, what, like, how are they generating new ideas?

1:11:16.120 --> 1:11:18.360
 Are they just kind of, I don't know.

1:11:18.360 --> 1:11:20.320
 You tell me.

1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:23.960
 So it's just, they're just like, scrambling in your head.

1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:29.560
 It would be specifically based on a problem I was struggling with or a specific position,

1:11:29.560 --> 1:11:30.560
 you know?

1:11:30.560 --> 1:11:32.880
 Kind of, it goes in for a single and then, and then go from there.

1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:33.880
 Yeah.

1:11:33.880 --> 1:11:36.720
 So like I'm sitting in geography class and, you know, I don't have to work that hard

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:38.440
 because it's easy, right?

1:11:38.440 --> 1:11:41.760
 And yeah, I'm just sitting there like kind of acting like I'm looking at the board and

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:44.040
 these guys are wrestling and I'm watching them wrestle.

1:11:44.040 --> 1:11:48.000
 And yeah, sometimes they come up with a really good solution.

1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:55.000
 Is there somebody you, you, uh, looked up to, style wise, Gable, John Smith, yeah, all

1:11:55.000 --> 1:12:00.440
 these like, like legend status people, probably Gable or to Gable, um, John Smith, but after

1:12:00.440 --> 1:12:01.440
 the fact.

1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:04.800
 So the problem with wrestling in my era was you couldn't watch it.

1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:06.200
 There was no, there was no access, right?

1:12:06.200 --> 1:12:07.760
 It wasn't, it wasn't really available.

1:12:07.760 --> 1:12:11.480
 Even if you want to say go find a bunch of John Smith, Matt, they're kind of hard to

1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:12.480
 find, right?

1:12:12.480 --> 1:12:15.160
 There's a couple of them on YouTube, but I've obviously seen all of those.

1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:18.120
 But in, in my era, there was, there really wasn't any of it.

1:12:18.120 --> 1:12:19.600
 So it was hard to be a fan of something.

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:24.320
 And that's why wrestling, wrestling has his, the fans are going like this because now,

1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:27.840
 you know, you flip on the flow app and you can watch, uh, you know, something that's

1:12:27.840 --> 1:12:29.360
 happening in Europe, right?

1:12:29.360 --> 1:12:32.160
 We can do this easily so we can be a fan of people.

1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:37.640
 Um, so now I'm more a fan of wrestling than I was then because there just was no access.

1:12:37.640 --> 1:12:40.880
 So now I can watch them when I like and say, Oh shit, like that guy's wrestling.

1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:44.400
 Oh, boom, I put my phone on, I watched them wrestle, you know, that type of thing.

1:12:44.400 --> 1:12:50.160
 You know, and a quick rant, it's really frustrating that you can't watch the Olympics.

1:12:50.160 --> 1:12:51.760
 Oh my God.

1:12:51.760 --> 1:12:52.760
 So fresh.

1:12:52.760 --> 1:12:56.160
 I, I've been, I, I'm, I think I'm going to go to war on this one.

1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:57.160
 Go to NBC's headquarters.

1:12:57.160 --> 1:12:58.160
 I'll go with you.

1:12:58.160 --> 1:12:59.640
 You got, you got a soldier here.

1:12:59.640 --> 1:13:02.560
 I was talking to Jimmy, uh, Jimmy Pedro.

1:13:02.560 --> 1:13:04.360
 He was surprised by this too.

1:13:04.360 --> 1:13:10.480
 Most matches you can't see even you talk about like, uh, come back, uh, Gable steals

1:13:10.480 --> 1:13:13.800
 and you can't see the full match.

1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:15.960
 You get like a crappy highlight.

1:13:15.960 --> 1:13:21.240
 So the two, the two biggest things in, in really the three, the NC championship, the

1:13:21.240 --> 1:13:25.240
 ASPN, the world will be trials are on NBC and the Olympics are NBC.

1:13:25.240 --> 1:13:28.800
 And these things, these, these companies are so big, they don't have a department dedicated

1:13:28.800 --> 1:13:32.080
 to selling the rights to that footage, right?

1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:35.480
 So the, the, the rights to wrestling footage, which no one really cares all that much about

1:13:35.480 --> 1:13:40.960
 except a niche are the exact same as track and field or basketball, the Olympics.

1:13:40.960 --> 1:13:44.680
 So yes, all of this stuff is completely inaccessible to us.

1:13:44.680 --> 1:13:48.640
 The, the NCA's, the Olympic trials and the Olympics, you can't go watch old film on it.

1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:49.640
 It sucks.

1:13:49.640 --> 1:13:50.640
 Yeah.

1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:51.640
 Old, the current film.

1:13:51.640 --> 1:13:52.640
 Yeah.

1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.640
 Uh, so you can't even watch the Gable match?

1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:59.160
 The Gable, no, they did a, you know, they do something that annoys the fuck out of me.

1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:00.160
 What?

1:14:00.160 --> 1:14:01.160
 Okay.

1:14:01.160 --> 1:14:05.440
 They, they, they, they do like a three or two minute highlight.

1:14:05.440 --> 1:14:09.440
 So it's like, they capture the most important thing.

1:14:09.440 --> 1:14:11.840
 But like, it's all about the buildup.

1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:12.840
 Yeah.

1:14:12.840 --> 1:14:13.840
 Yeah.

1:14:13.840 --> 1:14:18.040
 It's like that very beginning when you step on the mat and the nerves and you walk out

1:14:18.040 --> 1:14:19.040
 and like that.

1:14:19.040 --> 1:14:25.240
 I mean, I don't know, uh, you miss then, then when the, the triumph happens or the heart

1:14:25.240 --> 1:14:28.440
 break happens, it has that much more power.

1:14:28.440 --> 1:14:29.440
 Yeah.

1:14:29.440 --> 1:14:32.240
 If you want to go to war with NBC or ASPN, I'm, I'm happy to join that.

1:14:32.240 --> 1:14:33.720
 I think it's just the IOC.

1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:37.560
 Well, I mean, does the IOC own it or is it?

1:14:37.560 --> 1:14:41.800
 IOC is selling the, for the Olympics is the one that's making.

1:14:41.800 --> 1:14:45.600
 Well, so NBC broadcasts, so they obviously have the live rights.

1:14:45.600 --> 1:14:48.640
 You would think they would have recorded if they, I mean, they're the ones recording

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:49.640
 it.

1:14:49.640 --> 1:14:50.640
 You would think they keep the rights when you think.

1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:51.640
 No, no, no.

1:14:51.640 --> 1:14:53.680
 I, they're getting a license of it.

1:14:53.680 --> 1:14:58.840
 They're getting exclusive like license, but like the, you know, for example, uh, I've

1:14:58.840 --> 1:15:06.200
 had this talk to Travis Stevens, the Gido player, and there's a really sort of famous

1:15:06.200 --> 1:15:12.360
 match, it's a heartbreak in his career from, uh, 2012 Olympics, where he goes against

1:15:12.360 --> 1:15:16.720
 the German, Oli Bischoff, whatever, it's a 20 minute match to go to war.

1:15:16.720 --> 1:15:22.800
 And that's not available anywhere, but it's uploaded on YouTube and set to private.

1:15:22.800 --> 1:15:27.920
 The reason I know this is because on the IOC channel, so they've uploaded all of these

1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:28.920
 matches.

1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:29.920
 They haven't even put it up.

1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:36.440
 So actually, so my Olympic match, the, the one I won got put public and that's, I don't

1:15:36.440 --> 1:15:37.440
 know if it was private.

1:15:37.440 --> 1:15:38.440
 It's got put up on YouTube.

1:15:38.440 --> 1:15:41.840
 Uh, I was learning to it the week of my Jake Paul fight.

1:15:41.840 --> 1:15:42.840
 It was so dumb.

1:15:42.840 --> 1:15:46.440
 I'm like, why the, this is every 13 years later, this is bullshit.

1:15:46.440 --> 1:15:47.840
 Like this should have been up.

1:15:47.840 --> 1:15:49.080
 So, uh, I mean, what, okay.

1:15:49.080 --> 1:15:54.400
 So what about Olympic trials footage that has to be the USOC then or NBC?

1:15:54.400 --> 1:15:56.400
 Uh, so I know like, okay.

1:15:56.400 --> 1:15:57.400
 So I know flow, right?

1:15:57.400 --> 1:15:58.400
 Cause I work for them.

1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:01.880
 I know if flow buys your event or whatever, right?

1:16:01.880 --> 1:16:06.320
 They buy the rights generally in the contract, they'll have rights to both live stream it

1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:09.480
 and then use that footage at any point moving forward.

1:16:09.480 --> 1:16:12.880
 So those matches live on Flo's website.

1:16:12.880 --> 1:16:17.040
 That's why I would be surprised that if NBC didn't have something similar.

1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:21.520
 Flo does a pretty good job of providing like, uh, a place where you can watch all these

1:16:21.520 --> 1:16:22.520
 matches.

1:16:22.520 --> 1:16:23.520
 Yeah.

1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:24.520
 NBC does not.

1:16:24.520 --> 1:16:25.520
 Does not.

1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:26.520
 Yeah.

1:16:26.520 --> 1:16:30.760
 Flo as well, but certainly with Olympics, there's a difference between what Flo does

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:32.280
 and what the Olympics represent.

1:16:32.280 --> 1:16:33.880
 What do you mean by that?

1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:40.160
 Like it feels like the Olympics, which is what the charter says should be as accessible

1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:41.160
 as possible.

1:16:41.160 --> 1:16:42.160
 Yes.

1:16:42.160 --> 1:16:43.160
 That's true.

1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:45.840
 Like you should really lower the barrier for entry for the Olympics.

1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:49.120
 You know, that's what the charter says, but those people in the IOC, they're the worst

1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:50.120
 people ever.

1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:51.120
 Yeah.

1:16:51.120 --> 1:16:52.120
 They're very bad.

1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:53.120
 Well, they're not, they're not bad.

1:16:53.120 --> 1:16:56.800
 They've lost touch of the dream they once had when they joined the IOC.

1:16:56.800 --> 1:17:00.800
 Well, I would argue, I would argue all the way back that these are rich fat cats who,

1:17:00.800 --> 1:17:07.200
 like, I get so mad about the NCA, which finally now got rid of this term, bullshit term amateurism.

1:17:07.200 --> 1:17:11.280
 It's like, well, there's some holy grail where you can't make money to be an amateur athlete,

1:17:11.280 --> 1:17:15.880
 but the people who own the IOC or the people who own the institutions, college institutions

1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:17.720
 are making boatloads of money off of you.

1:17:17.720 --> 1:17:18.720
 That's crap.

1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:25.600
 So you competed, and like you said, at the 2008 Olympics, did you believe you can win

1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:26.600
 gold?

1:17:26.600 --> 1:17:27.960
 Yeah, absolutely.

1:17:27.960 --> 1:17:30.200
 So your mental game was on point.

1:17:30.200 --> 1:17:31.480
 Yeah, I was ready.

1:17:31.480 --> 1:17:33.520
 So what went wrong?

1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:34.520
 This wasn't good enough.

1:17:34.520 --> 1:17:35.520
 That was what I said.

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:36.520
 Yeah.

1:17:36.520 --> 1:17:41.880
 Yeah, I mean, so at that point in time, it was my first year of international competition.

1:17:41.880 --> 1:17:45.880
 So when I came out in 2007, my first time making 74 kilograms, which is pretty small

1:17:45.880 --> 1:17:47.480
 for me.

1:17:47.480 --> 1:17:53.320
 I had some failures, but then quickly I turned that around, and I was having success in America.

1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:54.320
 I was beating everyone.

1:17:54.320 --> 1:18:00.320
 I don't want to say easy, but yeah, I was doing really well.

1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:06.160
 I went international one time, and there was one match I got cheated on, the Russians,

1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:07.160
 they're cheaters.

1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:10.600
 I think she was Ukraine, not Russia.

1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:16.200
 I lost one real match where I actually lost, and it was to Dennis Sargoush, who had gone

1:18:16.200 --> 1:18:20.200
 to win three world titles, but he was behind the tee of that year, and it was competitive.

1:18:20.200 --> 1:18:23.680
 So I knew, okay, I'm going with the best guys in the world.

1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:29.680
 I beat a bunch of other guys who were good and had passed decent results.

1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:32.080
 So I knew I was right there.

1:18:32.080 --> 1:18:38.240
 Unfortunately, I ran this guy, Ivan Fondora, and I had someone do scouting reports for me.

1:18:38.240 --> 1:18:41.680
 Actually, my high school coach, he's now coached for our academy, John Messamrick.

1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:43.480
 And Fondora was the worst stylistic matchup.

1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:47.000
 I got him, and I lost him second round.

1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:49.600
 So I wasn't good enough.

1:18:49.600 --> 1:18:52.480
 Had I decided to keep wrestling, I probably would have gotten better, but at that point

1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:54.000
 Dennis wasn't in the cards.

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:59.840
 So in your division was, like you said, the tee of, and vice versa, the tee of, that guy

1:18:59.840 --> 1:19:00.840
 is special.

1:19:00.840 --> 1:19:01.840
 He's very special.

1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:05.960
 So that would be my other guy that you asked earlier who I'd enjoyed watching, and that

1:19:05.960 --> 1:19:10.600
 was a guy, again, it was kind of after the fact because it was hard to access footage,

1:19:10.600 --> 1:19:12.320
 but he was a lot of fun to watch.

1:19:12.320 --> 1:19:15.480
 What do you think made him great?

1:19:15.480 --> 1:19:20.240
 A lot of people talk about him as potentially one of the greatest ever.

1:19:20.240 --> 1:19:21.240
 Oh yeah, absolutely.

1:19:21.240 --> 1:19:26.800
 I mean, so he won six and three, six worlds, nine, six worlds, three Olympics, nine total,

1:19:26.800 --> 1:19:30.240
 which there's only one or two people above that.

1:19:30.240 --> 1:19:34.640
 So again, it was hard to watch any live footage of him, but from what I've seen, his feel

1:19:34.640 --> 1:19:35.640
 is different.

1:19:35.640 --> 1:19:39.400
 He was just ahead of his time and the feel and the touch he had for certain moves and

1:19:39.400 --> 1:19:43.360
 different things because obviously, physically, he's kind of unimposing.

1:19:43.360 --> 1:19:50.840
 He's taller and skinnier, which is, it can work in wrestling, but it is by less represented.

1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:53.320
 Yeah, he was special.

1:19:53.320 --> 1:19:54.560
 So good.

1:19:54.560 --> 1:20:00.880
 Do you take any inspiration from, let's talk about Dagestan in general, what do you think

1:20:00.880 --> 1:20:02.400
 makes those wrestlers great?

1:20:02.400 --> 1:20:03.400
 Yeah, it's fascinating.

1:20:03.400 --> 1:20:05.720
 Have you read the book, The Talent Code?

1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:06.720
 Yeah.

1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:07.720
 It's great.

1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:09.880
 It talks about these talent hotspots all around the world.

1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:14.480
 So now, obviously, with our wrestling academies, we try to take some lessons from that and

1:20:14.480 --> 1:20:15.480
 apply it.

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:20.480
 I got to assume they didn't cover Dagestan in that book specifically, but I got to assume

1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:26.360
 a lot of the same principles that are in that book apply to Dagestan in wrestling, right?

1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:31.400
 They did South Korea and women's golf, they did Curacao and baseball, right?

1:20:31.400 --> 1:20:33.880
 They picked a lot of these other places that were really elite.

1:20:33.880 --> 1:20:41.440
 I think maybe Moscow and women's tennis also, so I think all these things that make any

1:20:41.440 --> 1:20:45.520
 group great organization is probably the same things that's happening there.

1:20:45.520 --> 1:20:51.640
 The hardship, I mean, what, is there something specific about wrestling that can create so

1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:54.560
 many great champions?

1:20:54.560 --> 1:21:00.040
 From that area, so obviously, they all love, it's a big deal that wrestling specifically

1:21:00.040 --> 1:21:01.040
 is a big deal there.

1:21:01.040 --> 1:21:05.120
 You know, they do Sambo also, obviously, so that's part of it is a lot of the kids are

1:21:05.120 --> 1:21:06.120
 doing it.

1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:08.640
 They obviously are a rough tumble, tough life.

1:21:08.640 --> 1:21:09.920
 A lot of fights.

1:21:09.920 --> 1:21:15.600
 And then I think that also that a lot of them, it is a way out right there, the elite level

1:21:15.600 --> 1:21:18.560
 athletes in that part of the world from my understanding are really well compensated

1:21:18.560 --> 1:21:22.280
 compared to what the average person makes, and they're treated really well.

1:21:22.280 --> 1:21:27.840
 So people see it as a way out, where it's like, and then honestly, if America's getting better,

1:21:27.840 --> 1:21:32.480
 in 2008, the reason I went to MMA was because I didn't want to be poor with my whole life.

1:21:32.480 --> 1:21:33.480
 You know what I'm saying?

1:21:33.480 --> 1:21:34.480
 It sucks.

1:21:34.480 --> 1:21:37.240
 It's like, well, I don't want to make $20,000 for the next 48 years.

1:21:37.240 --> 1:21:39.120
 So I'm going to go do something else.

1:21:39.120 --> 1:21:40.960
 If I could have made, even I need to be rich, right?

1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:46.280
 If I could have made $100,000 or $70,000 wrestling, I probably would have kept wrestling.

1:21:46.280 --> 1:21:51.880
 So I think there's factors, and obviously now they have a really like a bunch of really

1:21:51.880 --> 1:21:55.480
 good people in one area, so it's probably, and it's been going on for a long time, so

1:21:55.480 --> 1:21:58.680
 there's probably been a bunch of like adults and coaches that are coming back and helping

1:21:58.680 --> 1:21:59.680
 that progress.

1:21:59.680 --> 1:22:01.720
 So yeah, a lot of those things that happen.

1:22:01.720 --> 1:22:05.280
 So I'm definitely going to travel there to talk to him, because I can speak Russian.

1:22:05.280 --> 1:22:15.400
 It makes it very, it makes me uniquely qualified to, I really can speak a little bit of Russian.

1:22:15.400 --> 1:22:16.400
 Your brother can?

1:22:16.400 --> 1:22:17.400
 Yeah.

1:22:17.400 --> 1:22:18.400
 Okay.

1:22:18.400 --> 1:22:23.280
 Like a little bit like squares and no, no, no, no, like he would, oh man, don't, don't

1:22:23.280 --> 1:22:26.280
 move me over so, I think he would be able to have a conversation with you, I think.

1:22:26.280 --> 1:22:27.280
 Okay.

1:22:27.280 --> 1:22:28.280
 Okay.

1:22:28.280 --> 1:22:29.280
 Probably not like you.

1:22:29.280 --> 1:22:31.120
 What's the, what's the reason you know, Zora?

1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:35.560
 I don't know why he got obsessed with languages, and so his college degree is actually, what

1:22:35.560 --> 1:22:40.200
 do they call it, interdisks, where you have three minors, so he had a minor in Russian,

1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:45.280
 a minor in Spanish, and maybe Japanese.

1:22:45.280 --> 1:22:46.280
 I'm messing up.

1:22:46.280 --> 1:22:48.280
 It's definitely, it's Russian and Spanish for sure.

1:22:48.280 --> 1:22:49.600
 I don't know what the third one is.

1:22:49.600 --> 1:22:50.600
 No, but yeah.

1:22:50.600 --> 1:22:55.880
 I understand it's, it's really fascinating, but the, the emphasis on technique, the lighter

1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:58.960
 drilling, like they don't really go super hard.

1:22:58.960 --> 1:22:59.960
 Yeah.

1:22:59.960 --> 1:23:03.560
 And I only spent a couple of, so I was there, I was in Vladikavka's in 2008, that was where

1:23:03.560 --> 1:23:04.560
 the world cup was.

1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:11.960
 We had to train there for like two days afterwards, so I didn't get to dig deep, did dig deep

1:23:11.960 --> 1:23:18.440
 into what was going on or anything, but yeah, I mean, I think sparring has, sparring is

1:23:18.440 --> 1:23:24.800
 very beneficial for wrestling, not like sparring MMA is what we fight, right?

1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:30.200
 Sparring in wrestling is, so I always just describe to be really simple, if we're drilling,

1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:33.960
 it's relatively 0% resistance, if we're going as hard as we can, that's 100%.

1:23:33.960 --> 1:23:36.920
 There's all this gray area in the middle, that's sparring, right?

1:23:36.920 --> 1:23:41.920
 And so, you know, if you have a good relationship, like, you know, it's supposed to be in college

1:23:41.920 --> 1:23:44.680
 with me and my brother, we can just go and we, we know where each other's at.

1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:46.560
 We don't even have to talk about it, right?

1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:51.440
 I feel like in my residence, I'll say, okay, hey, I want you guys to go 50% in this position

1:23:51.440 --> 1:23:55.440
 or I want the high crotch guy, I want him to shoot and this is for him, so I want him

1:23:55.440 --> 1:23:59.360
 to go 70, and defensive guy, I want you to go 40, so you're not supposed to be trying

1:23:59.360 --> 1:24:03.520
 to win here, you're going to go a little later, I want you to give him some looks, you know?

1:24:03.520 --> 1:24:06.000
 So I think, I think it has really taken hold of America, I think it's really beneficial

1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:10.000
 for success, and I think that's, I mean, America's doing better than we've ever done

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:11.000
 in the store.

1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:15.480
 Well, that's 70 and 40, that's like an art form to find that right place, because like

1:24:15.480 --> 1:24:23.080
 what the really good people I've trained with, they go much closer to 100% speed wise, or

1:24:23.080 --> 1:24:29.200
 like, but without like forcing things to where you would when you're going, it's some weird

1:24:29.200 --> 1:24:36.760
 combination of things that, like if you truly earn a technique, then you're given that technique,

1:24:36.760 --> 1:24:42.560
 but like if you don't, you don't, and then it becomes much less injury prone, it becomes

1:24:42.560 --> 1:24:47.560
 somehow more fun, more dynamic, you don't get stuck in positions, it's just a lot of

1:24:47.560 --> 1:24:48.560
 movement.

1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:52.840
 Yeah, the one thing, so you and John talked about, you know, like different ways to learn

1:24:52.840 --> 1:24:59.160
 and get better, and so I think John obviously innovated within the sport of Jiu Jitsu, and

1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:04.200
 so for us, and maybe there's just a differentiator for us, I think about it like.

1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:07.720
 So sorry to interrupt, you have this academy, you sent me this plan that you have like a

1:25:07.720 --> 1:25:12.280
 really well thought through plan for how to develop a good rest.

1:25:12.280 --> 1:25:17.120
 So I think it's, for me, there's four categories, right?

1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:21.400
 There's the teaching, which is like, you don't know shit, you're coming in and I'm showing

1:25:21.400 --> 1:25:24.680
 you the move, and you're literally going out there and you're trying.

1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:29.520
 To me, that's not even drilling, that's like teaching, like you're trying to learn something.

1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:34.760
 So obviously in someone's earlier periods, they're spending a lot of time in that phase

1:25:34.760 --> 1:25:38.800
 because they literally don't even know how to move their bodies the right way.

1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:42.560
 Once you learn the skill, then there's the drilling because you absolutely have to get

1:25:42.560 --> 1:25:47.120
 those reps to become really proficient in that movement, and then the sparring, and

1:25:47.120 --> 1:25:48.280
 then the live, right?

1:25:48.280 --> 1:25:53.240
 And so like I think, obviously by the time you get to the kind of, I don't want to say

1:25:53.240 --> 1:25:54.240
 end point, right?

1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:59.680
 But further on, the time you spend teaching is so, I don't want to say in, I'm sorry,

1:25:59.680 --> 1:26:03.920
 in the learning teaching phase is not insignificant, but it's so much smaller because to someone

1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:07.280
 who's really good, who I've coached for 10 years, I don't have to give this big long

1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:10.880
 drawn out explanation, I just have to say, hey, move your hand a little differently,

1:26:10.880 --> 1:26:11.880
 right?

1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:12.880
 Or just do this, right?

1:26:12.880 --> 1:26:14.400
 We don't have to spend any time there.

1:26:14.400 --> 1:26:18.720
 So I think that's like something that consumes for the younger kids, say five through 12

1:26:18.720 --> 1:26:24.920
 or 13, for consuming a massive amount of time there on that teaching learning phase.

1:26:24.920 --> 1:26:28.640
 And then as we get older, that time wanes a lot.

1:26:28.640 --> 1:26:30.520
 But that makes total sense, right?

1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:31.520
 Yeah.

1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:35.760
 It's funny because when you look at like jujitsu schools, they spend a lot of time in

1:26:35.760 --> 1:26:40.120
 the teaching learning and then the live, there's not enough drilling.

1:26:40.120 --> 1:26:45.000
 I like how you draw a distinction there because it feels, it feels like you're always starting

1:26:45.000 --> 1:26:46.000
 from scratch.

1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:52.200
 Like people have like very crappy short term memory, like they're not, like the way teaching

1:26:52.200 --> 1:26:57.160
 is done is you show a technique from scratch and it seems disjoint.

1:26:57.160 --> 1:27:00.400
 It is for sure, especially if you have a class that's been with you for a while, you don't

1:27:00.400 --> 1:27:01.400
 have to start from scratch.

1:27:01.400 --> 1:27:06.120
 You can say, Hey, let's focus on this one little thing here or let's, after we do this,

1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:07.120
 let's do that.

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:09.360
 You know, you kind of put it, start putting it all together.

1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:15.400
 And then with jujitsu, the thing that I really struggled with was a couple of things.

1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:19.960
 And this is not speaking for all the jujitsu, my personal experience through the sport.

1:27:19.960 --> 1:27:23.560
 And I actually found my, so when I unretired, I found someone really great that I loved

1:27:23.560 --> 1:27:26.080
 and I really wish it was Mark Lame and I don't know if you know him at all.

1:27:26.080 --> 1:27:31.520
 I wish I would have found him earlier because he was just tremendous.

1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:32.600
 But number one, there's no drilling.

1:27:32.600 --> 1:27:40.280
 So it's like in wrestling, I can boil down to, I can probably name you the best six moves,

1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:41.280
 right?

1:27:41.280 --> 1:27:43.680
 So we need as younger people, single leg, right?

1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:45.280
 Single leg is going to be the most proficient takedown.

1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:49.360
 It always has been, I don't know, probably always will be unless they figure out something

1:27:49.360 --> 1:27:50.360
 different.

1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:51.360
 The robot.

1:27:51.360 --> 1:27:52.360
 The robot.

1:27:52.360 --> 1:27:54.800
 We're going to shoot the last single legs.

1:27:54.800 --> 1:27:55.800
 Why?

1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:56.800
 Everyone's going to do that, right?

1:27:56.800 --> 1:27:58.480
 We're going to shoot a lot of single legs.

1:27:58.480 --> 1:28:02.160
 So just like say an arm bar or some type of sweep, right?

1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:03.720
 Why can't we go get 50 reps there?

1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:07.360
 Hey, we, I mean, by the time I've been in your jujitsu school for two years, I better

1:28:07.360 --> 1:28:08.360
 know fucking arm bar.

1:28:08.360 --> 1:28:09.560
 I better know one.

1:28:09.560 --> 1:28:11.400
 So don't, don't spend 10 minutes teaching me.

1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:13.040
 Just tell me to go hit 50 reps.

1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:17.160
 And then if when I'm hitting my reps, if there's something I'm doing wrong, then just say,

1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:21.080
 Hey, Ben, move your leg a little bit that way or raise your hips up a little more, right?

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:23.360
 Like correct as you're drilling.

1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:26.440
 So you're getting all these reps at it, so you're becoming more proficient.

1:28:26.440 --> 1:28:30.360
 And then the other thing I really struggled with was to your point during live so many

1:28:30.360 --> 1:28:33.280
 times it's just this five minute go, go, go.

1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:37.600
 And that's not the most efficient way to learn because when you have two people, especially

1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:41.240
 when they're focused on winning and you say, go, they're going to go to whatever they do

1:28:41.240 --> 1:28:42.240
 best.

1:28:42.240 --> 1:28:45.000
 Well, if I'm trying to make you good at something, I don't want you doing what you do best all

1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:46.000
 the time.

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:47.920
 I need you doing some other things, right?

1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:51.440
 If you have a great single leg, but you can't shoot to the other side of their body, we

1:28:51.440 --> 1:28:52.440
 need to work on that.

1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:53.440
 Right.

1:28:53.440 --> 1:28:54.440
 You need to start shooting the other side.

1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:59.120
 There's some sense that you, it's not like you should be told what to work on, but you

1:28:59.120 --> 1:29:03.600
 should be told to work on the thing that you want to work on, meaning, because I don't

1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:07.440
 know what, maybe you can comment on this, but you know, everybody develops a different

1:29:07.440 --> 1:29:08.960
 game as you get better and better.

1:29:08.960 --> 1:29:11.760
 There's a set of things you need to be working on.

1:29:11.760 --> 1:29:17.240
 So I actually have, like when I, especially when I'm like training very seriously, I'll

1:29:17.240 --> 1:29:25.080
 have a specific technique that I have in mind and I have a sheet of paper on the side where

1:29:25.080 --> 1:29:29.360
 I literally, my head keep counting off how many times I put myself in that position and

1:29:29.360 --> 1:29:33.040
 pulled off the technique and that's all I care about in like training.

1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:38.680
 So I'll just, whatever it is, if it's a guillotine, it's a guillotine, arm drag, arm drag, but

1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:42.200
 I want to make sure I don't, I love numbers.

1:29:42.200 --> 1:29:48.560
 So I'll say like, I'll make sure I get 50 arm drags and I'm not getting off the mat

1:29:48.560 --> 1:29:49.560
 until I do.

1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:50.960
 And that, you know, if it takes...

1:29:50.960 --> 1:29:53.200
 Drilling or live contest?

1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:57.160
 So in this, in the thing I'm describing right now is the live contest.

1:29:57.160 --> 1:30:02.200
 But drilling obviously, drilling, so I feel like I can't find a drilling part, like it's

1:30:02.200 --> 1:30:04.280
 so hard to find drilling partners.

1:30:04.280 --> 1:30:06.080
 Even so boring.

1:30:06.080 --> 1:30:10.120
 It's annoying to me that this is boring and there's nothing more annoying to me than the

1:30:10.120 --> 1:30:12.880
 look of boredom on another person's face when we're drilling.

1:30:12.880 --> 1:30:13.880
 Yeah.

1:30:13.880 --> 1:30:15.680
 It's like, do you really think drilling is that beneficial to you?

1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:16.840
 Because you said it's a job.

1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:17.840
 Yes.

1:30:17.840 --> 1:30:18.840
 Yeah.

1:30:18.840 --> 1:30:19.840
 So you think I'm an idiot, but yes.

1:30:19.840 --> 1:30:20.840
 Why?

1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:23.440
 Why am I an idiot or why am I just drilling beneficial?

1:30:23.440 --> 1:30:26.000
 Well, let's go with suture

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:30.400
 Why is it so beneficial?

1:30:30.400 --> 1:30:37.320
 I think for me it's, there's a meditative aspect to it where the more you drill, the more

1:30:37.320 --> 1:31:05.520
 you start noticing the details.

1:31:05.520 --> 1:31:34.720
 Yeah.

1:31:34.720 --> 1:32:03.920
 Yeah.

1:32:03.920 --> 1:32:33.120
 Yeah.

1:32:33.120 --> 1:33:02.320
 Yeah.

1:33:02.320 --> 1:33:31.520
 Yeah.

1:33:31.520 --> 1:34:00.720
 Yeah.

1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:29.920
 Yeah.

1:34:29.920 --> 1:34:59.120
 Yeah.

1:34:59.120 --> 1:35:28.320
 Yeah.

1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:57.520
 Yeah.

1:35:57.520 --> 1:36:26.720
 Yeah.

1:36:26.720 --> 1:36:55.920
 Yeah.

1:36:55.920 --> 1:37:25.120
 Yeah.

1:37:25.120 --> 1:37:54.320
 Yeah.

1:37:54.320 --> 1:38:23.520
 Yeah.

1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:52.720
 Yeah.

1:38:52.720 --> 1:39:21.920
 Yeah.

1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:51.120
 Yeah.

1:39:51.120 --> 1:40:20.320
 Yeah.

1:40:20.320 --> 1:40:49.520
 Yeah.

1:40:49.520 --> 1:41:18.720
 Yeah.

1:41:18.720 --> 1:41:47.920
 Yeah.

1:41:47.920 --> 1:42:17.120
 Yeah.

1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:46.320
 Yeah.

1:42:46.320 --> 1:43:15.520
 Yeah.

1:43:15.520 --> 1:43:44.720
 Yeah.

1:43:44.720 --> 1:44:13.920
 Yeah.

1:44:13.920 --> 1:44:43.120
 Yeah.

1:44:43.120 --> 1:45:12.320
 Yeah.

1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:41.520
 Yeah.

1:45:41.520 --> 1:46:10.720
 Yeah.

1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:39.920
 Yeah.

1:46:39.920 --> 1:47:09.120
 Yeah.

1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:38.320
 Yeah.

1:47:38.320 --> 1:48:07.520
 Yeah.

1:48:07.520 --> 1:48:36.720
 Yeah.

1:48:36.720 --> 1:49:05.920
 Yeah.

1:49:05.920 --> 1:49:35.120
 Yeah.

1:49:35.120 --> 1:50:04.320
 Yeah.

1:50:04.320 --> 1:50:33.520
 Yeah.

1:50:33.520 --> 1:51:02.720
 Yeah.

1:51:02.720 --> 1:51:31.920
 Yeah.

1:51:31.920 --> 1:52:01.120
 Yeah.

1:52:01.120 --> 1:52:30.320
 Yeah.

1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:49.520
 Yeah.

1:52:49.520 --> 1:53:12.720
 Yeah.

1:53:12.720 --> 1:53:29.920
 Yeah.

1:53:29.920 --> 1:53:41.920
 Yeah.

1:53:41.920 --> 1:54:09.120
 Yeah.

1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:26.320
 Yeah.

1:54:26.320 --> 1:54:28.320
 Yeah.

1:54:28.320 --> 1:54:32.320
 Yeah.

1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:36.320
 Yeah.

1:54:36.320 --> 1:54:55.520
 Yeah.

1:54:55.520 --> 1:54:57.520
 Yeah.

1:54:57.520 --> 1:54:59.520
 Yeah.

1:54:59.520 --> 1:55:03.520
 Yeah.

1:55:03.520 --> 1:55:22.720
 Yeah.

1:55:22.720 --> 1:55:24.720
 Yeah.

1:55:24.720 --> 1:55:26.720
 Yeah.

1:55:26.720 --> 1:55:28.720
 Yeah.

1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:30.720
 Yeah.

1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:32.720
 Yeah.

1:55:32.720 --> 1:55:51.920
 Yeah.

1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:53.920
 Yeah.

1:55:53.920 --> 1:55:55.920
 Yeah.

1:55:55.920 --> 1:55:57.920
 Yeah.

1:55:57.920 --> 1:55:59.920
 Yeah.

1:55:59.920 --> 1:56:01.920
 Yeah.

1:56:01.920 --> 1:56:09.120
 Yeah.

1:56:09.120 --> 1:56:17.120
 Yeah.

1:56:17.120 --> 1:56:19.120
 Yeah.

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:21.120
 Yeah.

1:56:21.120 --> 1:56:23.120
 Yeah.

1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:25.120
 Yeah.

1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:19.120
 Yeah.

1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:25.120
 Yeah.

1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:29.120
 Yeah.

1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:31.120
 Yeah.

1:56:31.120 --> 1:56:36.280
 But you would think something like a John Smith would like put on a white belt and roll around

1:56:36.360 --> 1:56:41.520
 Yeah, I think he's just too focused on you know, what is it coach? What is the coach and what he's doing?

1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:45.880
 Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think if you if you take him when he's younger, he would have a lot of fun

1:56:45.880 --> 1:56:50.680
 We actually have a really good wrestler making his MMA debut tomorrow. I don't know if you bow neck. Oh, I'm sure you've heard of him

1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:53.400
 Third half level. I think he's gonna have a lot of success. I

1:56:54.240 --> 1:56:58.800
 Mean some people might say that like Jiu Jitsu makes you a little comfortable

1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:06.960
 Comfortable being in your back and for a wrestler that could be like really bad. I hate to take. Yeah, but that's the Dan Gable take

1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:11.840
 It's so stupid. It's so stupid for God's sakes. We know the fucking rules

1:57:12.480 --> 1:57:18.520
 Wrestling, you don't go to your back and you get to you can it's like whatever. Yeah double likes a Jiu Jitsu, for example

1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:24.680
 So I coached whereas at Rufus. I coached the wrestling for a long now three four five years

1:57:25.400 --> 1:57:27.400
 So I've been taking a Jiu Jitsu guy

1:57:27.400 --> 1:57:31.980
 And teaching them a wrestling technique where you need to use your feet

1:57:32.920 --> 1:57:40.280
 To teach you Jiu Jitsu guys so easy so simple because they're they're gonna understand the concept butterfly guard etc etc etc, right to take a wrestler

1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:44.760
 Who's never done any of it and teach him how to use his feet. Oh my god, it's such a beast

1:57:44.760 --> 1:57:49.400
 It's so hard, you know, because they just that's not a weapon. They're thinking about using so it's like

1:57:50.360 --> 1:57:53.600
 We understand the rules. It's like freestyle folks are wrestling and freestyle for the man

1:57:53.600 --> 1:57:54.680
 I can lock my hands

1:57:54.680 --> 1:57:57.960
 You don't see people lock on their hands all the time of folks. I'll just because they did freestyle

1:57:57.960 --> 1:58:01.480
 It's like they they get it. There's a rule. They understand it. So the notion that

1:58:02.200 --> 1:58:05.160
 So how you come from your back? But pinning that's like a

1:58:06.280 --> 1:58:13.400
 The it has a special meaning. Yeah, I actually think so Jiu Jitsu you you don't actually want to be

1:58:14.240 --> 1:58:16.880
 Right flat flat very often, right?

1:58:16.880 --> 1:58:25.280
 I always wondered this because I did a couple catch wrestling tournaments and I did I would put myself in butterfly guard

1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:31.840
 And I wasn't going against good people. So which is why I was doing all these things, but I wondered if you could

1:58:32.640 --> 1:58:34.640
 create a system of wrestling where you're

1:58:35.840 --> 1:58:39.520
 Butterfly guard so I think there's there's a few places where I use it

1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:42.800
 But so specifically the elevator series was my main season up bottom

1:58:42.800 --> 1:58:48.560
 It is it's not butterfly guard. It's a butterfly guard like grip with your foot. So I boom I go here

1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:52.480
 I catch with my your leg with my foot boom and I elevate you over, right?

1:58:53.200 --> 1:58:55.200
 and then also sometimes like

1:58:56.080 --> 1:58:59.840
 I think Keegan does a super watching but double leg sometimes

1:59:00.560 --> 1:59:03.840
 If I'm accepting so freestyle obviously you're gonna give a point to me and folks out

1:59:04.160 --> 1:59:06.560
 Except me you've already got me and as I go down

1:59:06.880 --> 1:59:09.280
 I'm just gonna butterfly guard you off, you know

1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:12.960
 And then I'm gonna try to flip my hip back to the mat and get it up in a wizard position

1:59:13.360 --> 1:59:18.480
 Like I've used that quite a few times where it's kind of like a bailout mechanism that gives me back to

1:59:19.200 --> 1:59:22.160
 Maybe not a great position, but obviously much better than being taken down

1:59:23.360 --> 1:59:28.960
 Beautiful. Yeah, let me ask you quickly about crypto because you're also you have a you have a show

1:59:30.240 --> 1:59:32.800
 You uh, you have a lot of interest in cryptocurrency

1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:40.000
 Why are you interested in cryptocurrency? Is it just a financial investment or your philosophy that attracts you to it?

1:59:40.800 --> 1:59:42.560
 so I

1:59:42.560 --> 1:59:47.440
 My friend told me in 2017. I was actually I went to I was I was my friend met me in Shanghai

1:59:47.440 --> 1:59:49.440
 I fought in one championship

1:59:49.840 --> 1:59:51.840
 And he told me and the second he told me I'm like

1:59:52.560 --> 1:59:59.920
 I'm so in because I had read Ron Paul and the Fed I had read I you know kind of had an understanding how the Fed is

1:59:59.920 --> 2:00:06.800
 unfair um, and so when he told me about crypto this you know a decentralized system that no one has control over

2:00:07.360 --> 2:00:11.840
 It just made sense. And so like we've got you have the podcast with Michael sailor on and I love the way he says

2:00:11.840 --> 2:00:16.000
 It's like, who do you trust more with your money? You trust the politicians or do you trust engineers?

2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:20.320
 I think that's an easy choice. I don't even think I don't even think I have to think about that

2:00:20.320 --> 2:00:25.360
 I don't trust politicians no matter what country they come from china america, wherever. I don't trust them

2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:29.040
 so so what about uh, in two in uh

2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000
 2017 what was it bitcoin?

2:00:33.040 --> 2:00:35.040
 are you

2:00:35.120 --> 2:00:37.520
 What do you what do you find which ones do you find interesting?

2:00:38.160 --> 2:00:41.120
 yeah, there's all kinds of ideas. So there's the the the more

2:00:41.760 --> 2:00:42.800
 sort of

2:00:42.800 --> 2:00:48.800
 Primal mechanism of proof of work and bitcoin and then there's smart contracts ideas and

2:00:49.520 --> 2:00:51.680
 There's all kinds of innovations across the different

2:00:51.680 --> 2:00:57.680
 Uh, so I can't say I've been I've been super deep where I understand the technical components of a lot of minor

2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:01.680
 I understand what bitcoin can do for people and so that's probably the one I focused the most on

2:01:02.240 --> 2:01:04.240
 um, and I actually I

2:01:04.480 --> 2:01:08.480
 I think I was talking about I was trying to convince Michael to talk about bitcoin because he hates it also

2:01:08.720 --> 2:01:13.280
 We didn't last night and I think most of the main problems bitcoin solves

2:01:13.840 --> 2:01:18.080
 People in america are so american centric. They don't understand it. So like high levels of inflation

2:01:18.080 --> 2:01:21.600
 That hasn't happened. It was started to happen. It hasn't happened in america in a long time, right?

2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:24.400
 But someone in venezuela is like, oh, I get that

2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:26.400
 you know or

2:01:26.400 --> 2:01:29.120
 remittance payments right remittance payments to

2:01:29.760 --> 2:01:33.440
 You see it. So I saw this in when I was spent all the time in singapore

2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:36.000
 Singapore is obviously a really wealthy country

2:01:36.400 --> 2:01:40.480
 And so you'd have indonesian workers or philippine where and they would all go on sundays

2:01:40.720 --> 2:01:46.640
 They would go to these places to ship stuff back to their families and through western union western union gouges the shit out of these people

2:01:46.640 --> 2:01:50.080
 I mean, they're taking eight ten twelve percent of whatever they're sending

2:01:50.400 --> 2:01:56.320
 Then it takes five days and the person's gonna pick it up. Whereas bitcoin. I could send you bitcoin person to person

2:01:56.400 --> 2:02:01.120
 Right. So like american people don't understand that american people don't really understand the unbanked, right?

2:02:01.280 --> 2:02:06.960
 A decent portion of the world is unbanked. They don't have access to it and a much much much smaller portion of the world

2:02:07.360 --> 2:02:08.560
 Doesn't have access to the internet

2:02:08.560 --> 2:02:13.760
 So if I can put a mobile wallet on your phone and we can send money person to person

2:02:13.760 --> 2:02:18.640
 So there's a whole bunch of those problems where americans don't really think about that are really obvious that this solves

2:02:19.280 --> 2:02:22.560
 Um, so I think that's the key one obviously the fact that i'm

2:02:23.360 --> 2:02:27.200
 The value goes up is really outstanding also, but I but if you look at it

2:02:27.920 --> 2:02:31.600
 Yeah, I got in in 2017. So I got to watch it go up

2:02:31.680 --> 2:02:36.960
 I didn't sell shit at the top really stupid and then the majority of my time was spent through the bear market

2:02:37.360 --> 2:02:40.560
 And so I had to love it for the principles that it provided not the fact that

2:02:40.560 --> 2:02:44.000
 I actually I actually lost money in the beginning and now now I'm way up, but

2:02:44.560 --> 2:02:50.080
 Um, yeah, so I'm just holding you just holding. I think at the top of this bull market

2:02:50.080 --> 2:02:55.600
 I'll probably sell a very small portion. Um, just so you mean like right now. There's a bull market

2:02:56.000 --> 2:03:00.080
 Yeah, most most people thinks in the next 36 months will be at the top of the market

2:03:00.560 --> 2:03:03.520
 And so probably when that happens, uh, I'll probably sell a little bit

2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:08.480
 You got a hot 11 you got a hot. Well, yeah, so I well, I don't here's I

2:03:08.480 --> 2:03:13.360
 I am so my pot one of my podcast co host. He's he's like super rich like super rich

2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:18.080
 So he has lost touch with the everyman. Yeah, so here's my argument to him. It's really simple

2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:21.040
 Um, and listen, I'm doing well for myself in life, but

2:03:21.680 --> 2:03:26.800
 If say someone buys a bitcoin right one bitcoin of five thousand dollars, which it was last year

2:03:27.840 --> 2:03:31.600
 And this bitcoin goes from five thousand dollars to two hundred thousand dollars

2:03:31.760 --> 2:03:35.040
 Which is you know right around what a lot of people think the peak is going to be

2:03:35.040 --> 2:03:39.040
 Okay, but one bitcoin and they're living in a two hundred thousand dollar house

2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:45.280
 So to take half of that right you started the five thousand dollars of bitcoin to sell half a bitcoin

2:03:45.840 --> 2:03:49.280
 For a hundred thousand dollars and pay off your house your remaining house payment

2:03:49.520 --> 2:03:53.600
 That's life changing to someone it really is and so you still have a bitcoin

2:03:53.600 --> 2:03:58.960
 So if bitcoin goes to a million you're still gonna have half a million and you're gonna feel really really rich with a half a million dollars

2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:01.920
 Because you bought it for for f of twenty five hundred dollars, you know

2:04:01.920 --> 2:04:05.520
 Yeah, so yeah, so I would encourage anyone who's not uber rich

2:04:06.080 --> 2:04:10.240
 To if you have huge profits take a little bit of them because it could change your life

2:04:11.760 --> 2:04:16.000
 And if you hold it and it goes down you're going to feel the pain of that

2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:19.120
 Like sometimes if you're more constrained financially

2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:22.800
 It's much more psychologically difficult to ride the wood the ups and downs

2:04:22.800 --> 2:04:23.680
 Yeah, it is for sure

2:04:23.680 --> 2:04:29.360
 So they have these really fascinating things and bitcoin as we said the guy one of the main guys on our podcast

2:04:29.360 --> 2:04:34.640
 So it's called on chain metrics. So all all wallet transactions are visible, you know

2:04:34.720 --> 2:04:36.720
 And so they have these all these fun categories

2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:42.400
 So I actually I think you say you don't like numbers but I like numbers. I love numbers. I love numbers also

2:04:42.640 --> 2:04:47.280
 So they have all these different categories like you can see how long a wallet has held

2:04:48.160 --> 2:04:51.120
 A bitcoin right or how many bitcoins are in a certain wallet?

2:04:51.520 --> 2:04:55.760
 And so what they've seen during this the downturn right so april it kind of peaked and went down is

2:04:55.760 --> 2:05:01.200
 That the whales are still buys the whales people of a thousand more are still buying

2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:05.680
 They've said the main group of sellers is the ones who held it from zero to three months

2:05:06.160 --> 2:05:10.000
 So like they don't have money. They bought it because they thought it was going up and I was like, oh, shit

2:05:10.080 --> 2:05:14.800
 I got to sell it right whereas anyone's head out for a long time is generally still holding on

2:05:15.200 --> 2:05:18.560
 That's interesting. That's a good indicator right for the whole space

2:05:19.040 --> 2:05:23.440
 Yeah, well, let me ask you for some advice. You've been through one heck of a career

2:05:23.440 --> 2:05:27.840
 One heck of a life. What advice would you give to a young person today?

2:05:28.400 --> 2:05:29.840
 Well in wrestling

2:05:29.840 --> 2:05:34.560
 I I think wrestling is really a microcosm of what your life's going to be and that's why one of the things that

2:05:34.720 --> 2:05:36.320
 I stress the kids is like

2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:39.920
 If we can go through this now and you figure I have a couple kids who are struggling certain things are not

2:05:39.920 --> 2:05:41.920
 If you can figure out this now in wrestling

2:05:42.560 --> 2:05:45.680
 It's gonna be a lot better figure out now and get over this mental hump

2:05:46.000 --> 2:05:50.560
 Then when you're 32 and you have two kids and right and your job's not going well

2:05:50.560 --> 2:05:54.160
 It's gonna be a lot worse. It could be a lot more painful then let's let's fucking figure it out now

2:05:54.640 --> 2:05:56.160
 So a lot of these things a lot of these lessons

2:05:56.160 --> 2:06:00.880
 We can learn from wrestling whether it's persistence or perseverance or work ethic or you know

2:06:00.880 --> 2:06:05.680
 I said wrestlers show up on time and they work hard right these things if we can learn these things at an early age

2:06:05.760 --> 2:06:09.200
 Those are generally those characteristics characteristics will generally carry on

2:06:09.680 --> 2:06:12.720
 Throughout our life and those are the things they're going to make us really successful. So

2:06:13.120 --> 2:06:17.920
 Um, you know, I would say find a great coach someone who's going to spend a lot of time and put a lot of time into you

2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000
 and make sure they have a lot of wisdom and

2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.800
 steal all the wisdom that you can from them and then

2:06:23.360 --> 2:06:25.360
 If you can be successful at one thing

2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:30.800
 Generally, whatever that recipe was that took you to be successful at that apply it to everything else

2:06:31.360 --> 2:06:34.960
 Right apply it to the rest of your life apply it to getting a wife that you enjoy

2:06:35.840 --> 2:06:37.200
 Apply it to

2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:40.240
 Living at a place you want to live doing a job you want to do right there

2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:42.320
 There's so many possibilities

2:06:42.560 --> 2:06:44.960
 And you just have to be bold enough to go take those chances

2:06:45.280 --> 2:06:49.360
 It's interesting because like early on in life is when you have much more time

2:06:49.360 --> 2:06:52.400
 Like people don't realize it's time to learn the lessons

2:06:52.960 --> 2:06:54.960
 Like somehow later in life

2:06:55.520 --> 2:07:01.200
 You get busier responsibilities and all that kind of stuff like high school is a magical time. You know college college

2:07:01.200 --> 2:07:03.600
 Yeah, for sure. Yeah, there's so much time

2:07:04.480 --> 2:07:07.920
 Right learn. Well, you didn't have kids yet. Yeah, I don't have kids

2:07:08.560 --> 2:07:13.680
 Still fills up. Well, no, I I'm purpose and I did something that many people don't seem to be able to do

2:07:13.760 --> 2:07:16.080
 I walked away from a lot of responsibilities. Just how?

2:07:16.080 --> 2:07:19.120
 Self by saying goodbye. Oh, okay

2:07:19.520 --> 2:07:23.600
 But like but you know meetings like there's everybody around me at MIT was like

2:07:24.320 --> 2:07:29.040
 Meetings fill the day and then you have more projects and you do a great job

2:07:29.120 --> 2:07:32.240
 And you become successful and then the more meetings fill the day and more

2:07:32.880 --> 2:07:37.520
 Responsibilities as opposed to like wait a minute. Do I want to be involved in all these things?

2:07:38.800 --> 2:07:44.080
 And instead do I want to find one or two things to really focus on and

2:07:44.080 --> 2:07:46.800
 That's what I choose. But like that

2:07:47.600 --> 2:07:53.440
 Becomes harder and harder and harder to get older. You know what? I mean, I'm sure and and also the more success you have

2:07:53.440 --> 2:07:57.280
 You become sought after other places. Yeah, too. I'm sure that's happening with you

2:07:57.360 --> 2:08:01.440
 And it's hard to say keep saying no. No. No is saying those hard. Yeah

2:08:02.880 --> 2:08:04.880
 You're known for roasting people with this

2:08:06.640 --> 2:08:08.640
 With a single boom roasted lines

2:08:08.640 --> 2:08:14.000
 So any ideas maybe you want to mention malice but any ideas come to mind when you look at me

2:08:14.960 --> 2:08:16.960
 Man, I did you know what?

2:08:17.200 --> 2:08:22.480
 If I was going to boom roast someone I would want to kind of like research their career and dissect them and figure out their

2:08:22.480 --> 2:08:28.400
 Biggest negatives to the core and I didn't I didn't have that notion with you. I figured I got a general sense of okay

2:08:28.400 --> 2:08:32.400
 He's really successful. He's super sharp. He's really interested in some really interesting things

2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:37.440
 I bet we'll have a great conversation, but I had no intention to roast you. Yeah, there you go

2:08:37.440 --> 2:08:40.560
 What about malice? You had dinner with him last night. Hmm for him

2:08:42.160 --> 2:08:44.160
 Oh, man, um

2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:47.440
 How'd you get to know him by the way? How'd you just twitter?

2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:51.920
 Where's the most magical place in the world, right? I always tell people it's a great source of information if you know how to use it

2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:53.520
 um

2:08:53.520 --> 2:08:54.640
 Hmm

2:08:54.640 --> 2:08:59.600
 He's insane on twitter. Actually, he's quite a lot. I had to unfollow him on twitter because he it was too intense

2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:03.440
 It's just too much. No, it's too much. It fills up like I want to be able to consume the content

2:09:03.440 --> 2:09:05.760
 So if I want to see something he says I can go to his page, right?

2:09:05.760 --> 2:09:10.720
 But it's just too much for my timeline. I want to be able to consume who I follow

2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:13.200
 So I try to not follow a lot of people because I want to be able to consume them

2:09:13.760 --> 2:09:20.240
 Um, and he was he was too much. He he fights the trolls, which uh, I don't know why you'd ever fight the trolls

2:09:20.240 --> 2:09:24.720
 There's just too many of them. Well, he's a troll himself. He's like the big troll fighting the little trolls

2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:27.440
 He's the king troll

2:09:28.880 --> 2:09:32.080
 If you kill a hundred thousand, there's still not a hundred thousand left. There's just you follow

2:09:32.080 --> 2:09:35.120
 He's got to ignore him. It's the like the night walker or whatever. Yeah

2:09:36.400 --> 2:09:41.760
 Well, I'll take it because you had nothing. Um, you you couldn't roast gsp out of respect too

2:09:41.840 --> 2:09:44.800
 So I'm just gonna take that as a sign of respect. What do you say bad about gsp?

2:09:45.360 --> 2:09:49.440
 I was now I try roast his hair like why are you trying to grow grow hair now after all these years

2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:53.760
 He looked good bald. Everyone loved him with his head shaved. Yeah now looks kind of strange

2:09:53.840 --> 2:09:54.960
 It's like why you got hair now

2:09:54.960 --> 2:10:01.120
 Well, it was uh, one of the more surreal moments of my life is so he was here and he wore a black suit and tie

2:10:02.080 --> 2:10:05.680
 Uh, really? Yeah, we did the podcast with him just mirror image of me

2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:08.480
 And then we also did uh, I haven't released it yet

2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:12.560
 But just the video together and I was doing a martial arts stuff in in a suit and tie

2:10:13.120 --> 2:10:15.120
 That was quick. That was quite uh

2:10:16.560 --> 2:10:20.000
 That that's like like certain moments in your life are just like

2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:24.000
 I can't believe I was part of that. Yeah from uh with gsp

2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.400
 Uh, so yeah, I don't I don't think I'm anything to roast him about

2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:28.160
 Um

2:10:28.160 --> 2:10:32.160
 I mean, maybe the matt sarah thing would be the one that you get him with you know, but uh, yeah

2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:37.440
 I would be I would be really fascinated like really dig deep uh from a sports psychology standpoint

2:10:37.760 --> 2:10:40.320
 Because he always talks about how much fear he had when he was competing

2:10:40.720 --> 2:10:45.120
 And I and I find that to be interesting because obviously so it's almost like to me

2:10:45.120 --> 2:10:50.080
 It's almost like was he successful despite that not because of that, right?

2:10:50.080 --> 2:10:56.320
 And because anxiety usually leaves it really negative performance for the majority of people and what was it about

2:10:56.880 --> 2:11:02.000
 Him that the anxiety wasn't super negative. You know I'm saying like yeah, it's it's very interesting

2:11:02.160 --> 2:11:06.960
 I wonder that too. So I have I wanted that about him, but I have a huge amount of anxiety

2:11:07.520 --> 2:11:13.200
 Especially with people just about everything. Yeah, I wonder if that's helpful or or not

2:11:13.280 --> 2:11:17.520
 It feels like it's very helpful. Well, I think so it's okay. I think in two different ways

2:11:17.520 --> 2:11:20.720
 So I think probably your everyday life, okay

2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:24.720
 It's different than like in a performance or a competition

2:11:24.800 --> 2:11:28.400
 It's you have to be like super in the moment of what you're doing

2:11:28.640 --> 2:11:33.280
 So anything that's pulling you away like, oh my gosh, you know, it's the high school kids, right that coach

2:11:33.600 --> 2:11:40.240
 Oh my gosh, my that girl's in the stands if I get beat then and they're actually they're actively thinking about this other thing

2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:46.880
 When this is going on and I need all 100 of your foot. Well, he's never I don't think he has anxiety in the ring

2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:53.040
 That's the point. I think like I have the same thing like if I have a really high performance thing

2:11:53.760 --> 2:11:58.320
 That I have to do, uh, I don't know lecture in front of a lot of people. Yeah, that'd be a great example

2:11:58.880 --> 2:12:03.360
 That there's huge amount of anxiety weeks ahead days ahead hours ahead

2:12:03.680 --> 2:12:05.680
 So you have a system to get rid of it then

2:12:05.920 --> 2:12:12.400
 As you know, I may be but it's just the body gets rid of it somehow. Yeah, there's not a system sub conscious system

2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:17.680
 So, yeah, it's so you don't actually have anxiety while you're performing. So that's like

2:12:18.240 --> 2:12:21.680
 So then then then that problem somehow that problem has solved itself, right?

2:12:21.760 --> 2:12:27.120
 The problem is when the anxiety is actually happening while the wrestling match is happening. That's the real issue

2:12:27.440 --> 2:12:33.120
 Yeah, but it's like sneaks in there too. Is that's the difference in MMA and wrestling is

2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:40.880
 There's no breaks in wrestling, right? Yeah, I guess there is you can look at the crowd a little bit like you can look

2:12:40.880 --> 2:12:45.520
 So maybe a lot of bounds maybe but like the there's other things we have to perform

2:12:46.400 --> 2:12:50.880
 Well, well, there's more breaks like a lecture you can catch yourself thinking like in this conversation, you know

2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:53.600
 Like I'll I've said a bunch of stuff where I think

2:12:54.240 --> 2:12:59.200
 Why the hell did you say that? It's dumb, right? That that's the anxiety because there's a pause

2:13:00.080 --> 2:13:04.640
 And that that that could be um, I don't know. I think it just pushes me to be better

2:13:05.120 --> 2:13:07.280
 But maybe I could be way better if I let go that

2:13:07.280 --> 2:13:11.920
 Yeah, it's scary to think that just be if you let go of that, but he thinks he didn't even better

2:13:12.240 --> 2:13:15.040
 Or did he ever did it? Did he have a route like you're saying like

2:13:15.600 --> 2:13:20.320
 You don't necessarily feel those so I think certain people that I've coached like they would describe

2:13:20.640 --> 2:13:24.000
 How they would feel literally during the wrestling match, right?

2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:27.840
 And you're saying like during the the speed of performance. It's mostly gone

2:13:28.480 --> 2:13:30.560
 and that's it would be interesting to see if like

2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:34.800
 You know, he talked a lot about that but if it was all if it was all the way somehow gone

2:13:34.800 --> 2:13:39.920
 And he it means he would have a mechanism for it. So like I had a really bad performance my freshman year of high school at nationals

2:13:40.960 --> 2:13:45.280
 Because I had I had the ability to be anxious and one of my coaches talked about like and a lot of

2:13:45.760 --> 2:13:51.360
 A type personalities are kind of that way, you know, because they're trying to consider all possibilities at the same time

2:13:51.840 --> 2:13:56.720
 And and and while we're actually performing or competing it's negative to performance, right?

2:13:57.360 --> 2:14:01.440
 So he said he would always leading up to the match within say an hour

2:14:01.440 --> 2:14:05.280
 Or he was his name was talking about fishing he would get someone talking about fishing with him because it would stop him

2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:07.520
 Think about the match and and being uber anxious

2:14:07.840 --> 2:14:12.240
 So I I kind of took that heart and really helped me as I would always like have someone to talk to

2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:15.840
 We just goof around about whatever so I'm not thinking about this thing

2:14:16.320 --> 2:14:20.320
 And then once I step in it's time to go so I didn't have this like anxious build up

2:14:20.720 --> 2:14:23.840
 Now it's how for me I took it away, but like me, you know, like you said you have

2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:27.920
 A way to get it away obviously because it's yeah, I guess so I guess there's a little little tricks

2:14:27.920 --> 2:14:31.600
 You come up with yeah, you start thinking about it's not fishing. Maybe I should try the fishing thing

2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:34.160
 But I hate fishing so poor

2:14:34.160 --> 2:14:36.160
 Well, maybe maybe it's good to think about that

2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:43.040
 All right, ben this is uh, like I told you I'm a big fan of a big fan of your wrestling. You're fighting your personality

2:14:43.760 --> 2:14:47.200
 Uh, thank you for coming down. Thank you for talking today. Appreciate huge honor

2:14:48.080 --> 2:14:50.080
 Bam, let's go wrestle

2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:54.480
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with ben ascrin to support this podcast

2:14:54.480 --> 2:15:00.400
 Please check out our sponsors in the description and now let me leave you with some words from Muhammad Ali

2:15:01.360 --> 2:15:04.960
 Only a man who knows what it is like to be defeated

2:15:05.360 --> 2:15:11.440
 Can reach down to the bottom of his soul and come up with an extra ounce of power it takes

2:15:11.840 --> 2:15:14.240
 To win when the match is even

2:15:14.240 --> 2:15:24.240
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time
