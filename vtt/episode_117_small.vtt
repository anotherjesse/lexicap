00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
 The following is a conversation with Sheldon Solomon, a social psychologist, a philosopher,

00:05.680 --> 00:12.560
 codeveloper of terror management theory, and coauthor of The Warm at the Core on the role of

00:12.560 --> 00:18.480
 death in life. He further carried the ideas of Ernest Becker that can crudely summarize as the

00:18.480 --> 00:25.040
 idea that our fear of death is at the core of the human condition and the driver of most of the

00:25.040 --> 00:32.480
 creations of human civilization. Quick summary of the sponsors, Blinkist, ExpressVPN, and CashApp.

00:43.200 --> 00:49.200
 big impact on my thinking about human cognition, consciousness, and the deep ocean currents of

00:49.200 --> 00:55.120
 our mind that are behind the surface behaviors we observe. Many people have told me that they

00:55.120 --> 01:00.960
 think about death or don't think about death, fear death or don't fear death, but I think not many

01:00.960 --> 01:08.320
 people think about this topic deeply, rigorously, in the way that Nietzsche suggested. This topic,

01:08.320 --> 01:15.360
 like many that lead to deep, personal self reflection, frankly is dangerous for the mind,

01:15.360 --> 01:21.120
 as all first principles thinking about the human condition is. If you gaze long into the abyss,

01:21.120 --> 01:27.440
 like Nietzsche said, the abyss will gaze back into you. I've been recently reading a lot about World

01:27.440 --> 01:33.760
 War II, Stalin, and Hitler. It feels to me that there's some fundamental truth there to be discovered,

01:34.400 --> 01:40.880
 in the moments of history that changed everything, the suffering, the triumphs. If I bring up Donald

01:40.880 --> 01:46.880
 Trump or Vladimir Putin in these conversations, it is never through a political lens. I'm not left

01:46.880 --> 01:54.080
 nor right. I think for myself, deeply, and often question everything, changing my mind as often

01:54.080 --> 01:59.680
 as is needed. I ask for your patience, empathy, and rigorous thinking. If you arrive to this

01:59.680 --> 02:06.000
 podcast from a place of partisanship, if you hate Trump, or love Trump, or any other political leader,

02:06.000 --> 02:12.880
 no matter what he or they do, and see everyone who disagrees with you as delusional, I ask that you

02:12.880 --> 02:19.200
 unsubscribe and don't listen to these conversations, because my hope is to go beyond that kind of

02:19.200 --> 02:24.640
 divisive thinking. I think we can only make progress toward truth through deep, empathetic

02:24.640 --> 02:31.680
 thinking and conversation, and as always, love. If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,

 Have you ever watched The Office? If you have, you probably know it's based on a UK series also

04:08.640 --> 04:13.760
 called The Office. Not to stir up trouble, but I think the British version is actually more brilliant

04:13.760 --> 04:19.200
 than the American one. But both are pretty amazing. Anyway, there are actually nine other countries

04:19.200 --> 04:24.480
 with their own version of The Office. You can get access to them with no geo restrictions when you

05:31.760 --> 05:37.520
 with Sheldon Solomon. What is the role of death and fear of death in life?

05:38.320 --> 05:48.320
 Well, from our perspective, the uniquely human awareness of death and our unwillingness to

05:48.320 --> 05:56.320
 accept that fact, we would argue is the primary motivational impetus for almost everything that

05:56.320 --> 06:02.480
 people do, whether they're aware of it or not. So that's kind of been your life, work, your

06:03.360 --> 06:07.600
 view of the human condition is that death, you've written the book, Warmth of the Core,

06:07.600 --> 06:13.120
 that death is at the core of our consciousness of everything, of how we see the world, of what drives

06:13.120 --> 06:22.880
 us. Maybe can you elaborate how you see death fitting in? What does it mean to be at the core

06:23.520 --> 06:30.880
 of our being? So I think that's a great question. And to be pedantic, I usually start

06:31.600 --> 06:39.360
 my psychology classes and I say to the students, okay, let's define our terms and the ology part,

06:39.360 --> 06:44.560
 they get right away. You know, it's the study of, and then we get to the psyche part.

06:45.520 --> 06:51.440
 And understandably, you know, the students are like, oh, that means mind. And I'm like, well,

06:51.440 --> 07:00.960
 no, that's a modern interpretation. But in an ancient Greek, it means soul, but not in the

07:00.960 --> 07:08.160
 Cartesian dualistic sense that most of us in the West think when that word comes to mind. And so

07:08.160 --> 07:15.920
 you hear the word soul, and you're like, well, all right, that's the non physical part of me,

07:15.920 --> 07:23.280
 that's potentially detachable from my corporal container when I'm no longer here. But Aristotle's,

07:23.840 --> 07:32.640
 who coined the word psyche, I think, he was not a dualist, he was a monist, he thought that the

07:32.640 --> 07:41.120
 soul was inextricably connected to the body. And he defined soul as the essence of a natural body

07:41.760 --> 07:52.480
 that is alive. And then he goes on and he says, all right, let me give you an example. If an axe

07:52.480 --> 08:00.160
 was alive, the soul of an axe would be to chop. And if you can pluck your eyeball out of your head,

08:00.160 --> 08:08.160
 and it was still functioning, then the soul of the eyeball would be to see, you know,

08:08.160 --> 08:14.560
 in any psych, all right, the soul of a grasshopper is to hop the soul of a woodpecker is to pack,

08:15.440 --> 08:23.120
 which raises the question, of course, what is the essence of what it means to be human. And here,

08:23.120 --> 08:31.440
 of course, there is no one universally accepted conception of the essence of our humanity.

08:31.440 --> 08:36.400
 All right, Aristotle, you know, gives us the idea of humans as rational animals, you know,

08:36.400 --> 08:43.840
 we're Homo sapiens. But not the only game in town got Joseph Hoisinger, an anthropologist,

08:43.840 --> 08:50.880
 in the 20th century, he called us Homo Ludens, that were basically fundamentally playful creatures.

08:50.880 --> 08:58.960
 And then I think it was Hannah Arendt, Homo Faber, were toolmaking creatures. Another woman,

08:58.960 --> 09:05.120
 Ellen Disenayake, wrote a book called Homo Aestheticus, and following Aristotle and his

09:05.120 --> 09:10.560
 poetics, she's like, well, we're not only rational animals, we're also aesthetic creatures that

09:10.560 --> 09:17.680
 appreciate beauty. There's another take on humans, I think they call us Homo Naritans,

09:17.680 --> 09:25.360
 we're all, we're storytelling creatures. And I think all of those designations of what it means

09:25.360 --> 09:31.920
 to be human are quite useful heuristically and certainly worthy of our collective cogitation.

09:31.920 --> 09:40.880
 But what garnered my attention when I was a young punk was just a single line in an essay by a Scottish

09:40.880 --> 09:50.160
 guy, it was Alexander Smith. And in a book called Dreamthorpe, I think it's written in the 1860s,

09:50.160 --> 09:55.120
 he just says right in the middle of an essay, it is our knowledge that we have to die,

09:55.120 --> 10:02.080
 that makes us human. And I remember reading that, and I'm in my gut, I was like, oh, man,

10:02.960 --> 10:09.040
 I don't like that, but I think you're on to something. And then William James, the great

10:09.040 --> 10:16.160
 Harvard philosopher and arguably the first academic psychologist, he referred to death

10:16.160 --> 10:22.720
 as the worm at the core of the human condition. So that's where the worm at the core idea comes in.

10:23.360 --> 10:30.720
 And that's just an allusion to the story of Genesis back in the proverbial old days in the

10:30.720 --> 10:39.840
 Garden of Eden. Everything was going tremendously well until the serpent tempts Eve to take a

10:39.840 --> 10:47.600
 chomp out of the apple of the tree of knowledge and Adam partakes also. And this is according to

10:47.600 --> 10:55.920
 the Bible what brings death into the world. And from our vantage point, the story of Genesis is a

10:55.920 --> 11:05.360
 remarkable allegorical recount of the origin of consciousness, where we get to the point where

11:05.360 --> 11:12.720
 by virtue of our vast intelligence, we come to realize the inevitability of death. And so,

11:13.280 --> 11:18.880
 you know, the apple is beautiful and it's tasty. But when you get right into the middle of it,

11:18.880 --> 11:26.880
 there's that ugly reality, which is our finitude. And then fast forward a bit. And I was a young

11:26.880 --> 11:34.800
 professor at Skidmore College in 1980. My PhD is in experimental social psychology. And I mainly

11:34.800 --> 11:41.520
 did studies with clinical psychologists evaluating the efficacy of nonpharmacological

11:41.520 --> 11:47.120
 interventions to reduce stress. And that was good work. And I found it interesting. But

11:47.120 --> 11:54.480
 in my first week as a professor at Skidmore, I'm just walking up and down the shelves of the library,

11:55.760 --> 12:01.600
 saw some books by a guy I had never heard of, Ernest Becker, a cultural anthropologist,

12:01.600 --> 12:12.400
 recently deceased, he died in 1974. After weeks before actually, he was posthumously

12:12.400 --> 12:19.200
 awarded the Pulitzer Prize in nonfiction for his book, The Denial of Death. And that was his last

12:19.200 --> 12:24.640
 book? It's actually his next to last book. I don't know how you pull this off, but he had one more

12:24.640 --> 12:30.640
 after he died called Escape from Evil. And evidently, it was supposed to originally,

12:30.640 --> 12:37.600
 The Denial of Death was supposed to be this giant thousand page book that was both. And they split

12:37.600 --> 12:46.480
 it up and what became Escape from Evil, his wife Marie Becker finished. Well, be that as it may,

12:47.120 --> 12:54.880
 it is in The Denial of Death, where Becker just says it in the first paragraph. I believe

12:55.680 --> 13:04.560
 that the terror of death and the way that human beings respond to it or decline to respond to it

13:04.560 --> 13:10.880
 is primarily responsible for almost everything we do, whether we're aware of it or not.

13:11.760 --> 13:19.200
 And mostly, we're not. And so I read that first paragraph, Lex. And I was like, wow,

13:19.760 --> 13:23.600
 okay, this dude. You're onto something. You're onto something. It's the same thing here. It's the

13:23.600 --> 13:33.120
 same thing. And then it reminded me, I think, not to play psychologist, but, you know, let's face it,

13:33.120 --> 13:41.600
 I believe there's a reason why we end up drifting where we ultimately come to. So I'm in my mid 20s.

13:42.320 --> 13:47.360
 I got Ernest Becker's book in my hand. And the next thing I know, I'm remembering

13:48.000 --> 13:54.160
 when I'm eight years old, the day that my grandmother died. And, you know, the day before

13:54.160 --> 14:03.200
 my mom said, oh, say goodbye to grandma. She's not well. And okay, so I was like, okay, grandma.

14:03.200 --> 14:08.560
 And I knew she wasn't well, but I didn't really appreciate the magnitude of her illness. Well,

14:08.560 --> 14:15.680
 she dies the next day. And it's in the evening. And I'm just sitting there looking at my stamp

14:15.680 --> 14:21.680
 collection. And I'm like, wow, I'm gonna miss my grandmother. And then I'm like, no, wait a minute.

14:21.680 --> 14:28.320
 That means my mother's gonna die after she gets old. And that's even worse. After all,

14:28.320 --> 14:34.160
 who's gonna make me dinner? And that bothered me for a while. But then I'm looking at the stamps,

14:34.160 --> 14:38.880
 all the dead American presidents. And I'm like, there's George Washington. He's dead. There's

14:38.880 --> 14:47.920
 Thomas Jefferson. He's dead. My mom's gonna be dead. Oh, I'm gonna get old and be dead someday.

14:47.920 --> 14:54.480
 And at eight years old, that was my first explicit existential crisis. I remember it being, you know,

14:54.480 --> 15:03.520
 one of these blood curdling realizations that I tried my best to ignore for the most of the time

15:03.520 --> 15:10.400
 I was subsequently growing up. But fast forward back to Skidmore College, mid 20s, you know,

15:10.400 --> 15:19.120
 reading Becker's book in the 1980s, thinking to myself, wow, one of the reasons why I'm finding

15:19.120 --> 15:25.840
 this so compelling is that it squares with my own personal experience. And then to make a short

15:25.840 --> 15:32.320
 story long, and I'll shut up Lex, but what what grabbed me about Becker, and this is in part,

15:33.040 --> 15:38.560
 because I read a lot of his other books, there's another book, The Birth and Death of Meaning,

15:38.560 --> 15:48.000
 which is framed from an evolutionary perspective. And then The Denial of Death is really more framed

15:48.000 --> 16:00.000
 from an existential psychodynamic vantage point. And as a young academic, I was really taken by

16:00.000 --> 16:08.400
 what I found to be a very potent juxtaposition, that you really don't see that often, yet usually

16:08.400 --> 16:16.800
 evolutionary types are eager to dismiss the psychodynamic types and vice versa. And maybe

16:16.800 --> 16:22.960
 only John Bowlby, you know, there's part there's other folks, but the attachment theorist, John

16:22.960 --> 16:30.640
 Bowlby, was really one of the first serious academics to say these these ways of thinking

16:30.640 --> 16:37.840
 about things are quite compatible. And can you comment on what's what a psychodynamic

16:37.840 --> 16:41.280
 view of the world is versus an evolutionary view of the world, just in case people are not.

16:41.280 --> 16:46.000
 Yeah, yeah, absolutely. That's that's a fine question. Well, for the evolutionary types

16:46.000 --> 17:01.120
 in general, are interested in how it is and why it is that we have adapted to our surroundings

17:01.120 --> 17:07.600
 in the service of persisting over time, and being represented in the gene pool thereafter.

17:08.400 --> 17:14.160
 Used to be a fish. Yes. We used to be a fish and else. Yeah. And I'll end up talking on a

17:14.160 --> 17:20.640
 podcast. Yeah, how we came to be that way, how we came to be that way. And so whereas the existential

17:20.640 --> 17:27.200
 psychodynamic types, I would say are more interested in development across a single lifespan.

17:27.920 --> 17:35.760
 And but but all the evolutionary types dismiss the psychodynamic types as overly speculative and

17:35.760 --> 17:43.520
 devoid of empirical support for their views. They, you know, they'll just say these guys are

17:43.520 --> 17:49.600
 talking shit, if you'll pardon the expression. And of course, you can turn right around and say

17:49.600 --> 17:55.760
 the same about the evolutionary types that they are often and rightfully criticized evolutionary

17:55.760 --> 18:03.760
 psychologists for what are called the just so stories that where it's like, oh, this is probably

18:03.760 --> 18:15.280
 why fill in the blank is potentially adaptive. And my thought again, early on was, I didn't see any

18:16.480 --> 18:24.080
 intrinsic antithesis between these viewpoints, I just found them dialectically compatible,

18:24.080 --> 18:29.680
 and very powerful when combined. So one question I would ask here is

18:29.680 --> 18:36.080
 about a science being speculative. You know, we understand it's a little about the human mind.

18:36.080 --> 18:40.560
 You said you picked up Becker's book and, you know, it felt like he was onto something. That's

18:40.560 --> 18:48.080
 the same thing I felt when I picked up Becker's book, probably also in my early 20s. You know,

18:48.080 --> 18:52.160
 I read a lot of philosophy, but it felt like the question of the meaning of life kind of,

18:52.160 --> 19:01.040
 you know, this seemed to be the most the closest to the truth somehow, it was onto something. So I

19:01.040 --> 19:08.320
 guess the question that I want to ask also is like, how speculative is psychology? How like all of

19:08.320 --> 19:17.120
 your life's work? How do you feel? How confident do you feel about the whole thing? About understanding

19:17.120 --> 19:26.640
 our mind? I feel confidently, I'm confident to have it both ways. Like, what do we make of

19:26.640 --> 19:34.160
 psychology? What do we make starting with Freud's, you know, starting just our even just philosophy,

19:35.200 --> 19:42.160
 even the aspects of the sciences, like, you know, my field of artificial intelligence,

19:42.160 --> 19:49.280
 but also physics, you know, it often feels like, man, we don't really understand most of what's

19:49.280 --> 19:55.920
 going on here. And certainly that's true with the human mind. Yeah. Well, to me, that's the proper

19:55.920 --> 20:03.600
 epistemological stance. I don't know anything. Well, it's the Socratic, I know that I don't know,

20:03.600 --> 20:13.840
 which is the first step on the path to wisdom. I would argue forcefully that we know a lot more

20:15.200 --> 20:24.080
 than we used to. I would argue equally forcefully, not that I have a PhD in the philosophy of science,

20:24.080 --> 20:32.240
 but I believe that the Thomas Coons of the world are right when they point out that change is not

20:32.240 --> 20:41.360
 necessarily progress. And so on the one hand, I do think we know a lot more than we did back in

20:41.360 --> 20:47.440
 the day when if you wanted to fly, you put on some wax wings and jumped off a mountain. Yeah. On the

20:47.440 --> 20:56.080
 other hand, I think it's quite arrogant when scientists, I'll just speak about psychological

20:56.080 --> 21:08.720
 scientists. When they have the audacity to mistake statistical precision for knowledge and insight,

21:09.280 --> 21:17.920
 and when they make the mistake in my estimation, that Einstein bemoaned, and that's this idea that

21:17.920 --> 21:27.600
 the mere accumulation of data will necessarily result in conceptual breakthroughs. And so I like

21:28.560 --> 21:34.320
 what we're all, I hope, appreciative of the people who trained us. But I remember my first day in

21:34.320 --> 21:39.440
 graduate school at the University of Kansas, they brought us into a room and on one side of the board

21:39.440 --> 21:48.000
 was a quote by Kurt Lewin, or Levine, famous German social psychologist, and the quote is,

21:48.000 --> 21:53.280
 there's nothing more useful than a good theory. And then on the other side was another quote by

21:53.280 --> 22:01.200
 German physicist, his name eludes me, and it was all theories are wrong. And I'm like, which is it?

22:01.200 --> 22:10.640
 And of course, the point is that it's both our theories are, I believe, powerful ways to direct

22:10.640 --> 22:21.760
 our attention to aspects of human affairs that might render us better able to understand ourselves

22:21.760 --> 22:30.880
 in the world around us. Now, I also, as an experimental psychologist, I adhere to the view

22:31.680 --> 22:40.160
 that theories are essentially hypothesis generating devices. And that, at its best, science is a

22:40.160 --> 22:47.360
 dialectical interplay where you have theoretical assertions that yield testable hypotheses, and

22:47.360 --> 22:55.760
 that either results in the corroboration of the theory, the rejection of it, or the modification

22:56.320 --> 23:03.040
 thereafter. If we look at the existentialists, or even like modern

23:04.160 --> 23:07.920
 philosopher psychology types like Jordan Peterson, I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.

23:07.920 --> 23:14.400
 I know Jordan pretty well. We go way back, actually, if he were here with us today, we would,

23:14.400 --> 23:22.480
 he would be jumping in and, I believe, very interesting and important ways. But yeah, we go

23:22.480 --> 23:30.080
 back 30 years ago, he was basically saying our work is nonsense. Let's get into this.

23:30.080 --> 23:34.880
 Charles talked to Jordan, eventually, on this thing, going through some rough times right now.

23:34.880 --> 23:42.640
 Oh, absolutely. And I wish him well. Jordan was working on his maps of meaning. And we were

23:42.640 --> 23:54.000
 publishing our work. And I think Jordan, at the time, was concerned about our vague claims

23:54.000 --> 24:03.920
 to the effect that all meaning is arbitrary. He takes a more Jungian, as well as evolutionary

24:03.920 --> 24:12.880
 view that I don't think is wrong, by the way, which is that there are certain kinds of meanings

24:13.680 --> 24:22.880
 that are more important, let's say religious types, and that we didn't pay sufficient attention to

24:22.880 --> 24:30.480
 that in our early days. So can you try to lose the day like what his worldview is? Because he's

24:30.480 --> 24:36.640
 also a religious man. So what was the, what was some of the interesting aspects of the

24:36.640 --> 24:41.360
 disagreements that then? Yeah, well, back in the day, I just said, you know, Jordan was a young

24:41.360 --> 24:47.360
 punk. We were young punks. He was just kind of flailing in an animated way at some conferences

24:47.360 --> 24:53.120
 saying that we... You're still both kind of punks. Yeah, we are both kind of punks. So I saw him

24:53.120 --> 24:58.960
 three or four years ago. We spoke on a, it was an awesome day. We're in Canada at the Ontario

24:58.960 --> 25:05.840
 Shakespeare Festival where we were asked to be on a Canadian broadcast system program. I think we

25:05.840 --> 25:13.920
 were talking about Macbeth from a psychodynamic perspective. And I hadn't seen him in a ton of

25:13.920 --> 25:19.840
 years and we spent two days together, had a great time. You know, we had just written our book,

25:19.840 --> 25:25.760
 The Worm at the Core, and he's like, you know, you're missing a big opportunity every time you

25:25.760 --> 25:31.360
 say something. You have to have your phone and you have to film yourself and then you have to

25:31.360 --> 25:37.280
 put it on YouTube. Yeah, he was onto something that, you know, that just as a small tangent.

25:37.280 --> 25:44.160
 Yeah. It's almost sad to look at Jordan Peterson and somebody like yourself. After having done

25:44.160 --> 25:50.080
 this podcast, I've realized that there is really brilliant people in this world. And oftentimes,

25:50.080 --> 25:57.200
 especially like when they're, I mean, it would love, are a little bit like punks. That's right.

25:57.200 --> 26:03.040
 They kind of do their own thing. And like the world doesn't know they exist as much as they

26:03.040 --> 26:10.400
 should. And it's so interesting because most people are kind of boring. Yes. And then the

26:10.400 --> 26:15.280
 interesting ones kind of go on their own and there's not a smartphone. No, that's, that's so

26:15.280 --> 26:20.720
 interesting. He was onto something that, I mean, it's interesting that he, I don't think he was

26:20.720 --> 26:25.760
 thinking from a money perspective, but he was probably thinking of like connecting with people

26:25.760 --> 26:31.840
 or sharing his knowledge. But people don't often think that way. That's right. So maybe we can try

26:31.840 --> 26:38.080
 to get back to, you're both brilliant people. And I would love to get some interesting disagreements

26:38.080 --> 26:45.200
 earlier and later about in your psychological work, in your worldviews. Well, our disagreements

26:45.200 --> 26:57.280
 today would be along two dimensions. One is he is, and again, I wish he was here to correct me.

26:57.280 --> 27:07.920
 Yes. When I say that he is more committed to the virtues of the Judeo Christian tradition,

27:08.720 --> 27:16.560
 particularly Christianity, and in a sense is a contemporary Kierkegaard of sorts when he's

27:16.560 --> 27:25.280
 saying there's only one way to leap into faith. And I would take ardent issue with that claim

27:25.280 --> 27:35.600
 on the grounds that that is one, but by no means not the only way to find meaning and value in life.

27:35.600 --> 27:42.960
 And so, and I see his... What's his warm at the core? What is, like, so we're talking about a

27:42.960 --> 27:48.880
 little bit of a higher level of discovering meaning. Yeah. What's his, what does he make of death?

27:48.880 --> 27:56.640
 Oh, I don't know. And this is where it would be nice to have him here. He has, you know, from a

27:56.640 --> 28:04.080
 distance criticized our work as misguided. Having said that, though, when we were together,

28:04.960 --> 28:13.520
 he said something along the lines that there is no theoretical body of work in academic psychology

28:13.520 --> 28:20.160
 right now for which there is more empirical evidence. And so I appreciated that. He's a

28:20.160 --> 28:26.720
 great researcher. He's a good clinician. The other thing that we will agree to disagree about

28:27.680 --> 28:39.040
 rather vociferously is ultimately political slash economic. So I remember being at dinner with him

28:39.040 --> 28:44.480
 telling him that the next book that I wanted to write was going to be called Why Left and Right

28:44.480 --> 28:50.960
 or Both Beside the Point. And my argument was going to be, and it is going to be, that both

28:50.960 --> 28:58.880
 liberal and political, no, liberal and conservative political philosophy are each intellectually

28:58.880 --> 29:04.960
 and morally bankrupt because they're both framed in terms of assumptions about human nature that

29:04.960 --> 29:14.000
 are demonstrably false. And Jordan didn't mind me knocking liberal political philosophy on those

29:14.000 --> 29:21.120
 grounds. That would basically be like Stephen Pinker's blank slate. But he took issue when

29:22.080 --> 29:29.200
 I pointed out that actually it's conservative political philosophy, which starts with John

29:29.200 --> 29:35.200
 Locke's assumption that in a state of nature there are no societies, just autonomous individuals

29:36.080 --> 29:45.760
 who are striving for survival. That's one of the most obviously patently wrong assertions in the

29:45.760 --> 29:55.040
 history of intellectual thought. And Locke uses that to justify his claims about the individual

29:55.040 --> 30:04.480
 right to acquire unlimited amounts of property, which is ultimately the justification for neoliberal

30:04.480 --> 30:12.320
 economics. Can you look at it a little bit? Can you describe his philosophy again as

30:12.320 --> 30:19.840
 view of the world and what neoliberal economics is? Yeah, let me translate it in English. So

30:19.840 --> 30:29.040
 basically, on all these days, anybody who says I'm a conservative free market type,

30:30.400 --> 30:36.240
 you're following John Locke and Adam Smith, whether you're aware of it or not. So here's John Locke,

30:36.800 --> 30:42.720
 who by the way, all of these guys are great. So for me to appear to criticize any of these folks,

30:42.720 --> 30:50.240
 it is with the highest regard. And also, we need to understand in my estimation, how important

30:50.240 --> 30:58.640
 their ideas are. Locke is working in a time where all rule was top down by divine right. And he's

30:58.640 --> 31:08.560
 trying desperately to come up with a philosophical justification to shift power and autonomy to

31:08.560 --> 31:17.280
 individuals. And he starts in his second treatise on government, 1690 or so. He says, okay,

31:17.840 --> 31:23.840
 let's start with a state of nature. And he's like, in a state of nature, there's no societies,

31:24.400 --> 31:32.000
 there's just individuals. And in a perfect universe, there wouldn't be any societies.

31:32.000 --> 31:42.000
 There would just be individuals who by the law of nature have a right to survive. And in the

31:42.000 --> 31:50.560
 service of survival, they have the right to acquire and preserve the fruits of their own labor.

31:52.320 --> 31:57.040
 But his point is, and it's actually a good one, you know, he's following Hobbes here. He's like,

31:57.040 --> 32:03.760
 well, the problem with that is that people are assholes. And if they would let each other alone,

32:04.320 --> 32:10.320
 then we would still be living in a state of nature, everybody just doing what they did to get by each

32:10.320 --> 32:18.800
 day. But it's a whole lot easier, you know, if I see like an apple tree a mile away, well, I can go

32:18.800 --> 32:24.800
 over and pick an apple. But if you're 10 meters away with an apple in your hand, it's a lot easier

32:24.800 --> 32:33.920
 if I pick up a rock and crack your head and take the apple. And his point was that the problem is

32:33.920 --> 32:41.920
 that people can't be counted on to behave. They will take each other's property. Moreover,

32:43.360 --> 32:53.200
 he argued, if someone takes your property, you have the right to retribution in proportion to

32:53.200 --> 33:00.080
 the degree of the magnitude of the transgression. English translation, if I take your apple,

33:00.080 --> 33:05.440
 you have the right to take an apple back, you don't have the right to kill my firstborn.

33:06.080 --> 33:14.160
 But people being people, they're apt to escalate retaliatory behavior, thus creating what law

33:14.160 --> 33:20.640
 called a state of war. So he said, in order to avoid a state of war, people reluctantly give up

33:20.640 --> 33:29.040
 their freedom in exchange for security. They agree to obey the law and that the sole function of

33:29.040 --> 33:35.520
 government is to keep domestic tranquility and to ward off foreign evasion in order to protect

33:36.160 --> 33:41.600
 our right to property. All right, so now here's the property thing. All right, so

33:41.600 --> 33:53.040
 Locke says, if you look in the Bible and in nature, there is no private property. But Locke says, well,

33:54.000 --> 34:02.880
 surely, if there's anything that you own, it's your body. And surely, you have a right by nature

34:02.880 --> 34:11.920
 to stay alive. And then by extension, anything that you do where you exert effort or labor,

34:12.560 --> 34:18.720
 that becomes your private property. So back to the apple tree. If I walk over to an apple tree,

34:19.520 --> 34:26.320
 that's everybody's apples until I pick one. And the minute I do that is my apple.

34:26.320 --> 34:33.760
 All right, and then he says, you can have as many apples as you want, as long as you don't waste them,

34:34.400 --> 34:42.960
 and as long as you don't impinge on somebody else's right to get apples. All right, so far so good.

34:42.960 --> 34:59.200
 Yep. And then he says, well, okay, in the early days, you could only eat so many apples. Or you

34:59.200 --> 35:06.080
 could only trade so many apples with somebody else. So he was like, well, if you put a fence around

35:06.080 --> 35:12.800
 a bunch of apple trees, those become your apples. That's your property. If somebody else wants to

35:12.800 --> 35:21.760
 put a fence around Nebraska, that's their property. And everybody can have as much property as they

35:21.760 --> 35:33.120
 want, because the world is so big that there is no limit to what you can have if you pursue it by

35:33.120 --> 35:39.440
 virtue of your own effort. But then he says money came into the picture. And this is important,

35:39.440 --> 35:47.440
 because he noticed long before anybody, before the Freud's of the world, that money is funky,

35:47.440 --> 35:54.640
 because it has no intrinsic value. He's like, ooh, look at that shiny piece of metal that actually

35:54.640 --> 36:00.320
 has, if you're hungry, and you have a choice between a carrot and a lump of gold in the desert,

36:00.320 --> 36:06.800
 most people are going to go for the carrot. But his point is, is that the allure of money

36:07.680 --> 36:15.520
 is that it's basically a concentrated symbol of wealth. But because it doesn't spoil,

36:16.160 --> 36:24.240
 Locke said, you're entitled to have as much money as you're able to garner, right? Then he says,

36:24.240 --> 36:32.560
 well, the reality is, is that some people are more, the word that he used was industrious.

36:32.560 --> 36:39.920
 He said, some people more industrious than others. All right, today we would say smarter, less lazy,

36:39.920 --> 36:48.480
 more ambitious. He just said, that's natural. It's also true. Therefore, he argued, over time,

36:48.480 --> 36:56.160
 over time, some people are going to have a whole lot of property and other people not much at all.

36:56.960 --> 37:06.720
 Inequality for Locke is natural and beneficial for everyone. His argument was that, you know,

37:06.720 --> 37:14.880
 the rising tide lifts all boats and that the truly creative and innovative are entitled to

37:14.880 --> 37:22.640
 relatively unlimited worth because we're all better off as a result. So the point, very simply,

37:22.640 --> 37:29.360
 is that, well, that's based, and then you have Adam Smith, you know, in the next century with

37:29.360 --> 37:36.400
 the invisible hand where Adam Smith says, everyone pursuing their own selfish, that's not necessarily

37:36.400 --> 37:44.720
 pejorative. If everyone pursues their own selfish interests, we will all be better off as a result.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.040
 And what do you think is the flaw in that way of thinking?

37:47.040 --> 37:56.960
 Well, there's two flaws. One is that, well, one flaw is, first of all, that it is based on an

37:56.960 --> 38:01.840
 erroneous assumption to begin with, which is that there never was a time in human history when we

38:01.840 --> 38:09.760
 were an asocial species. In a sense, you don't feel like there's this emphasis of individual

38:09.760 --> 38:17.920
 autonomy is a flawed premise. Like, there's something fundamentally deeply interconnected

38:17.920 --> 38:25.600
 between us. I do. I think that Plato and Socrates, you know, and the Crito were closer to the truth

38:25.600 --> 38:32.000
 when they started with the assumption that we were interdependent, then they derived individual

38:32.000 --> 38:36.320
 autonomy as a manifestation of a functional social system.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.280
 That's fascinating.

38:37.280 --> 38:43.600
 So when Margaret Thatcher, you're too young, you know, in the 1980s, she said, societies,

38:43.600 --> 38:50.480
 there's no such thing as societies. There's just individuals pursuing their self interest.

38:50.480 --> 38:56.640
 So that's one point where I would take issue, respectfully, with John Locke. Point number

38:56.640 --> 39:06.480
 two is when Locke says in 1690, well, England's filled up. So if you want some land, just go to

39:06.480 --> 39:14.480
 America, it's empty, or maybe there's a few savages there, just kill them. So Melville does the same

39:14.480 --> 39:21.200
 thing in Moby Dick, where he thinks about, well, there ever come a time where we run out of Wales.

39:22.320 --> 39:31.520
 And he says, no, but we have run out of Wales. And so Locke was right, maybe in 1690, that the world

39:31.520 --> 39:42.560
 was large and had infinite resources. He's certainly wrong today, in my opinion. Also wrong

39:42.560 --> 39:50.560
 is the claim that the unlimited pursuit of personal wealth does not harm those around us.

39:50.560 --> 39:58.560
 There is no doubt that radical inequality is tragic psychologically and physically.

39:58.560 --> 40:04.560
 Poverty is not that terrible. It's easy for me to say because I have a place to stay and something

40:04.560 --> 40:13.520
 to eat. But as long as you're not starving and have a place to be, poverty is not as challenging

40:13.520 --> 40:20.560
 as being having the impoverished and close proximity to those who are obscenely wealthy.

40:20.560 --> 40:26.560
 So it's not the absolute measure of your well being is the inequality of that well being.

40:26.560 --> 40:26.560
 That's quite right.

40:26.560 --> 40:35.680
 So maybe just to link on the Jordan Peterson thing, in terms of your disagreement on his

40:35.680 --> 40:44.560
 world view, so he went through quite a bit, there's been quite a bit of fire in his defense

40:44.560 --> 40:51.280
 or maybe his opposition of the idea of equality of outcomes. So looking at the inequality that's

40:51.280 --> 40:59.280
 in our world, looking at certain groups, measurably having an outcome that's different

40:59.280 --> 41:07.280
 than other groups, and then drawing conclusions about fundamental unfairness, injustice, inequality

41:07.280 --> 41:14.320
 in the system. So systematic racism, systematic sexism, systematic anything else that creates

41:14.320 --> 41:24.320
 inequality. And he's been saying pretty simple things to say that the system for the most

41:24.320 --> 41:34.320
 part is not broken or flawed, that the inequality of outcomes is part of our world. What we

41:34.320 --> 41:38.320
 should strive for is the equality of opportunity.

41:38.320 --> 41:46.320
 Yeah. And I do not dispute that as an abstraction. But again, to back up for a second, I do take

41:46.320 --> 41:56.320
 issue with Jordan's fervent devotion to the free market and his cavalier dismissal of Marxist ideas,

41:56.320 --> 42:05.320
 which he has, in my estimation, mischaracterized in his public depictions.

42:05.320 --> 42:13.320
 Let's get into it. So he seems to really not like socialism, Marxism, communism.

42:13.320 --> 42:19.320
 Yeah. Historically speaking, sort of, I mean, how would I characterize it? I'm not exactly

42:19.320 --> 42:24.320
 sure. I don't want to, again, he'll eventually be here to defend himself. John Locke, unfortunately

42:24.320 --> 42:34.320
 not here to defend himself. Exactly. But what's your sense about Marxism and the way Jordan

42:34.320 --> 42:38.320
 talks about it, the way you think about it, from the economics, from the philosophical

42:38.320 --> 42:44.320
 perspective? Yeah. Well, if we were all here together, I'd say we need to start with Marx's

42:44.320 --> 42:52.320
 economic and philosophical manuscripts of 1844 before Marx became more of a polemicist.

42:52.320 --> 43:00.320
 And I would argue that Marx's political philosophy, he's a crappy economist, I don't dispute that.

43:00.320 --> 43:09.320
 But his arguments about human nature, his arguments about the inevitably catastrophic psychological

43:09.320 --> 43:16.320
 and environmental and economic effects of capitalism, I would argue every one of those

43:16.320 --> 43:28.320
 has proven quite right. Marx maybe did not have the answer, but he saw in the 18, whenever he was

43:28.320 --> 43:41.320
 writing that inevitably capitalism would lead to massive inequity, that it was ultimately based

43:41.320 --> 43:49.320
 on the need to denigrate and dehumanize labor, to render them in his language a fleshy cog

43:49.320 --> 43:59.320
 in a giant machine. And it would create tension and conflict between those who own things and

43:59.320 --> 44:06.320
 those who made things that over time would always, you know, the Thomas Piketty guy who

44:06.320 --> 44:14.320
 writes about capital and just makes the point that return on investment will always be greater

44:14.320 --> 44:20.320
 than wages. That means the people with money are going to have a lot more.

44:20.320 --> 44:26.320
 That means there's going to come a point where the economic house of cards falls apart.

44:26.320 --> 44:31.320
 Now, the Joseph Schumpter's of the world, they're like, that's creative destruction, bring it.

44:31.320 --> 44:37.320
 That's great. So I think it's Niles Ferguson. He's a historian. He may be at Stanford now.

44:37.320 --> 44:42.320
 He was at Harvard. You know, he writes about the history of money and he's like, yeah, there's been

44:42.320 --> 44:50.320
 20 or whatever depressions and big recessions in the last several hundred years. And when that

44:50.320 --> 44:58.320
 happens, half of the population or whatever is catastrophically inconvenienced. But that's

44:58.320 --> 45:09.320
 the price that we pay for progress. Other people would argue and I would agree with them that I

45:09.320 --> 45:20.320
 will happily sacrifice the rate of progress in order to flatten the curve of economic destruction.

45:20.320 --> 45:31.320
 To put that in plainer English, I would direct our attention to the social democracies that

45:31.320 --> 45:38.320
 forgetting for the moment of whether it's possible to do this on a scale in a country as big as ours,

45:38.320 --> 45:45.320
 on all of the things that really matter, you know, gross domestic GDP or whatever,

45:45.320 --> 45:51.320
 that's just an abstraction. But when you look at whatever the United Nations says how we measure

45:51.320 --> 45:58.320
 quality of life, you know, life expectancy, education, you know, rates of alcoholism,

45:58.320 --> 46:06.320
 suicide, and so on, the countries that do better are the mixed economies, their market economies

46:06.320 --> 46:17.320
 that have high tax rates in exchange for the provision of services that come as a right for citizens.

46:17.320 --> 46:25.320
 Yeah, so I mean, I guess the question is, you've kind of mentioned that, you know, as Marx described,

46:25.320 --> 46:31.320
 capitalism with a slippery slope, eventually things go awry in some kind of way. So that's,

46:31.320 --> 46:36.320
 the question is, when you have, when you implement a system, how does it go wrong eventually?

46:36.320 --> 46:39.320
 You know, eventually we'll all be dead.

46:39.320 --> 46:40.320
 That's exactly right.

46:40.320 --> 46:43.320
 No, no, that's right.

46:43.320 --> 46:50.320
 So, and then the criticism, I mean, I think these days, unfortunately, Marxism as like, is a dirty word.

46:50.320 --> 46:56.320
 I say unfortunately, because even if you disagree with a philosophy, you should,

46:56.320 --> 47:04.320
 like calling somebody a Marxist should not be a thing that shuts down all conversation.

47:04.320 --> 47:12.320
 No, that's right. And the fact is, is I'm sympathetic with Jordan's dismissal of the folks in popular,

47:12.320 --> 47:18.320
 the talking heads these days who spew Marxist words.

47:18.320 --> 47:23.320
 To me, it's like fashionable nonsense. Do you know that book that the physicist wrote,

47:23.320 --> 47:27.320
 mocking, you're too young. So in the 20 or so years ago.

47:27.320 --> 47:29.320
 We're all pretty young, really.

47:29.320 --> 47:33.320
 Yeah, that's right. But I think there were these NYU physicists, they wrote a paper,

47:33.320 --> 47:39.320
 just mocking the kind of literary, postmodern types.

47:39.320 --> 47:41.320
 Oh, yeah. Oh, those kinds, yes.

47:41.320 --> 47:45.320
 Yeah. And it was just nonsense. And of course, it was made the lead article.

47:45.320 --> 47:51.320
 And, you know, my point is Marx wouldn't be a Marxist.

47:51.320 --> 47:55.320
 I've read and listened to some of the work of Richard Wolff.

47:55.320 --> 47:59.320
 He speaks pretty eloquently about Marxism. I like him.

47:59.320 --> 48:05.320
 He's one of the only, you know, one of the only people speaking about a lot about Marxism

48:05.320 --> 48:11.320
 in the way we are now in a serious way, in a sort of saying, you know,

48:11.320 --> 48:17.320
 what are the flaws of capitalism? Not saying like, yeah, basically sounding very different.

48:17.320 --> 48:21.320
 People should check out his work because all this kind of work,

48:21.320 --> 48:29.320
 this kind of outrage mob culture of sort of demanding equality of outcome.

48:29.320 --> 48:31.320
 That's not Marxism. It is not Marxism.

48:31.320 --> 48:37.320
 But he didn't say that. You know, he literally said each, what was it like,

48:37.320 --> 48:42.320
 each according to their needs and each according to their abilities or something like that.

48:42.320 --> 48:46.320
 So the question is the implementation like, humans are messy.

48:46.320 --> 48:49.320
 So how does it go wrong? Like, there you go.

48:49.320 --> 48:50.320
 It's messy.

48:50.320 --> 48:56.320
 Brilliant. It's messy. And this gets back to my rant about the book that I want to try

48:56.320 --> 49:01.320
 if I don't stroke out why left and right are both beside the point.

49:01.320 --> 49:09.320
 You know, the people, the conservatives are right when they condemn liberals

49:09.320 --> 49:17.320
 for being simple minded by assuming that a modification of external conditions

49:17.320 --> 49:20.320
 will yield changes in human nature.

49:20.320 --> 49:26.320
 You know, again, that's where Marx and Skinner are odd bedfellows.

49:26.320 --> 49:30.320
 You know, here they are just saying, oh, let's change the surroundings

49:30.320 --> 49:33.320
 and things will inevitably get better.

49:33.320 --> 49:43.320
 On the other hand, when conservatives say that people are innately selfish

49:43.320 --> 49:50.320
 and they use that as the justification for glorifying the unbridled pursuit of wealth,

49:50.320 --> 49:57.320
 well, they're only half right because it turns out that we can be innately selfish,

49:57.320 --> 50:03.320
 but we are also innately generous and reciprocating creatures.

50:03.320 --> 50:05.320
 There's remarkable studies.

50:05.320 --> 50:11.320
 I think they've been done at Yale of, you know, babies, 14 month old babies.

50:11.320 --> 50:19.320
 If someone hands them a toy and then wants something in return,

50:19.320 --> 50:22.320
 babies before they can walk and talk will reciprocate.

50:22.320 --> 50:30.320
 All right, fine. If someone, if they want a toy, let's say, or a bottle of water,

50:30.320 --> 50:37.320
 baby wants a bottle of water and I look like I'm trying to give it to the baby,

50:37.320 --> 50:43.320
 but I dropped the bottle so the baby doesn't get what she or he wanted.

50:43.320 --> 50:50.320
 When given a chance to reciprocate, little babies will reciprocate

50:50.320 --> 50:54.320
 because they're aware of and are responding to intention.

50:54.320 --> 51:02.320
 Similarly, if they see somebody behaving unfairly to someone,

51:02.320 --> 51:05.320
 they will not help that person in return.

51:05.320 --> 51:12.320
 So my point is, yeah, we are selfish creatures at times,

51:12.320 --> 51:20.320
 but we are also simultaneously uber social creatures who are eager to reciprocate

51:20.320 --> 51:25.320
 and in fact, we're congenitally prepared to be reciprocators to the point

51:25.320 --> 51:32.320
 where we will reciprocate on the basis of intentions above and beyond what actually happens.

51:32.320 --> 51:42.320
 Also, I mean, your work is on the fundamental role of the fear of mortality in ourselves.

51:42.320 --> 51:47.320
 How fundamental is this reciprocation, this human connection to other humans?

51:47.320 --> 51:49.320
 I think it's really innate.

51:49.320 --> 51:54.320
 Yeah, I think it's because bats reciprocate not by intention,

51:54.320 --> 52:01.320
 but this I'm going here from Richard Dawkins, the selfish gene.

52:01.320 --> 52:03.320
 I love the early Dawkins.

52:03.320 --> 52:06.320
 I'm less enamored with the early Beatles.

52:06.320 --> 52:10.320
 Yeah, again, I say this with great respect,

52:10.320 --> 52:17.320
 but Dawkins just points out that reciprocation is just fundamental.

52:17.320 --> 52:21.320
 Cooperation is fundamental.

52:21.320 --> 52:28.320
 It's a one sided view of evolutionary takes on things

52:28.320 --> 52:32.320
 and we see it solely in terms of individual competition.

52:32.320 --> 52:35.320
 It's almost stuff from a game theoretic perspective too.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.320
 It's just easier to see the world that way.

52:37.320 --> 52:42.320
 It's easier to, I don't know, I mean, you see this in physics.

52:42.320 --> 52:46.320
 There's a whole field of folks like complexity

52:46.320 --> 52:50.320
 that kind of embrace the fact that it's all an intricately connected mess

52:50.320 --> 52:55.320
 and it's just very difficult to do anything with that kind of science,

52:55.320 --> 52:59.320
 but it seems to be much closer to actually representing what the world is like.

52:59.320 --> 53:03.320
 So like you put it earlier, Lex, it's messy.

53:03.320 --> 53:04.320
 Left and right.

53:04.320 --> 53:07.320
 You mentioned you're thinking of maybe actually putting it down on paper or something?

53:07.320 --> 53:09.320
 Yeah, I would like to because of you, Greg.

53:09.320 --> 53:13.320
 What I would like to point out, again,

53:13.320 --> 53:18.320
 and in admiration of all of the people that I will then try and have the gall to criticize this.

53:18.320 --> 53:21.320
 Look, these are all geniuses.

53:21.320 --> 53:29.320
 Adam Smith genius when he uses the notion that we're bartering creatures.

53:29.320 --> 53:35.320
 So he uses that reciprocation idea as the basis of his way of thinking about things.

53:35.320 --> 53:36.320
 But that's not at the core.

53:36.320 --> 53:39.320
 The bartering is not at the core of human nature.

53:39.320 --> 53:41.320
 Well, he says it is.

53:41.320 --> 53:43.320
 He says we're fundamentally bartering creatures.

53:43.320 --> 53:50.320
 Well, that doesn't even make sense then because then how can we then be autonomous individuals?

53:50.320 --> 53:55.320
 Well, because we're going to barter with an eye on ourselves for ourselves.

53:55.320 --> 53:56.320
 Yeah.

53:56.320 --> 53:57.320
 But all right.

53:57.320 --> 54:00.320
 So but back to Adam Smith for a second, Lex.

54:00.320 --> 54:05.320
 He's like, Adam Smith, here's he's got the invisible hand and my conservative friends.

54:05.320 --> 54:12.320
 I'm like, you need to read his books because he is a big fan of the free market.

54:12.320 --> 54:20.320
 This is my other gripe with the folks who support just unbridled markets.

54:20.320 --> 54:26.320
 Adam Smith understood that there was a role for government for two reasons.

54:26.320 --> 54:32.320
 One is, is that just like law, people are not going to behave with integrity.

54:32.320 --> 54:41.320
 And he understood that one role of government is to maintain a proverbial, you know, even playing field.

54:41.320 --> 54:47.320
 And then the other thing Smith said was that there's some things that can't be done well for a profit.

54:47.320 --> 54:59.320
 And I believe he talked about education and public health and infrastructure as things that are best done by governments.

54:59.320 --> 55:07.320
 Because you can't, you can make a profit, but that doesn't mean that the institutions themselves will be maximally beneficial.

55:07.320 --> 55:29.320
 Yeah, so I would, I'm just eager to engage people by saying, let's start with our most contemporary understanding of human nature, which is that we are both selfish and tend to cooperate.

55:29.320 --> 55:39.320
 And we also can be heroically helpful to folks in our own tribe.

55:39.320 --> 55:47.320
 And of course, how you define one's tribe becomes critically important.

55:47.320 --> 56:03.320
 But what some people say is, look, what would then be, what kind of political institutions and what kind of economic organization can we think about to kind of hit that sweet spot?

56:03.320 --> 56:20.320
 And that that would be, in my opinion, how do we maximize individual autonomy in a way that fosters creativity and innovation and the self regard that comes from creative expression.

56:20.320 --> 56:38.320
 While engaging our more cooperative and reciprocal tendencies in order to come up with a system that is potentially stable over time, because the other thing about all capital based systems.

56:38.320 --> 56:41.320
 The stability is fundamentally unstable.

56:41.320 --> 56:43.320
 Yeah, because it's based on infinite growth.

56:43.320 --> 56:52.320
 And, you know, it's a positive feedback loop to be silly infinite growth is only good for malignant cancer cells and compound interest.

56:52.320 --> 56:57.320
 Otherwise, you know, we want to seek a steady state.

56:57.320 --> 57:09.320
 And that would be, you know, so when Stephen Pinker writes, for example, again, great scholar, but I'm going to disagree when he says the world has never been better.

57:09.320 --> 57:14.320
 And all we need to do is keep making stuff and buying stuff.

57:14.320 --> 57:28.320
 So your sense is the world is sort of in disagreement with Stephen Pinker that the world is like facing a potential catastrophic collapse in multiple directions.

57:28.320 --> 57:29.320
 Yes.

57:29.320 --> 57:42.320
 And the fact that there are certain like the rate of violence and aggregate is decreasing the death, you know, the quality of life, all those kinds of measures that you can plot across centuries that it's improving.

57:42.320 --> 57:51.320
 That doesn't capture the fact that our world might be this we might destroy ourselves in very painful ways in the in the in the next century.

57:51.320 --> 58:06.320
 So I'm with Jared Diamond, you know, in the book collapse, where he points out studying the collapse of major civilizations that it often happens right after things appear to never have been better.

58:06.320 --> 58:22.320
 And in that regard, I mean, there are more known voices that have taken issue with Dr. Pinker. I'm thinking of John Gray, who's a British philosopher and here in the States.

58:22.320 --> 58:33.320
 I don't know where he is these days, but Robert J. Lyft and the psycho historian, yeah, they're both of my view and which I hope is, by the way, wrong.

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
 Me too.

58:34.320 --> 58:52.320
 Yeah, no, but, you know, between, you know, ongoing ethnic tensions, environmental degradation, economic instability, and the fact that, you know, the world has become a petri dish of psychopathology.

58:52.320 --> 59:07.320
 Like what really worries me is the quiet economic pain that people are going through the businesses that are closed dreams that are broken because you can no longer do the thing that you've wanted to do and how I mentioned to you off camera that I've been reading

59:07.320 --> 59:25.320
 the rise and fall of the Third Reich and I mean the amount of anger and hatred and on the flip side of that sort of a nationalist pride that can arise from deep economic pain.

59:25.320 --> 59:29.320
 Like what happens with that economic pain is you become bitter.

59:29.320 --> 59:30.320
 Yeah.

59:30.320 --> 59:40.320
 You start to find the other, whether it's other European nations that mistreated you, whether it's other groups that mistreated you, it always ends up being the Jews.

59:40.320 --> 59:43.320
 Somehow or fault here.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.320
 Yep.

59:44.320 --> 59:55.320
 That's what worries me is where this quiet anger and pain goes in 2021, 2022, 2030.

59:55.320 --> 1:00:07.320
 If you look, sorry to see the parallels, rise and fall of the Third Reich, but, you know, what happens 10, 15 years from now from what's because of the COVID pandemic that's happening now.

1:00:07.320 --> 1:00:24.320
 And Lex, you make a, I think a really profoundly important point, you know, back to our work for a bit or Ernest Becker, rather, you know, his point is, is that the way that we manage existential terror is to embrace culturally constructed

1:00:24.320 --> 1:00:31.320
 belief systems that give us a sense that life has meaning that we have value.

1:00:31.320 --> 1:00:44.320
 And in the form of self esteem, which we get from perceiving that we meet or exceed the expectations associated with the role that we play in society.

1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:50.320
 Well, here we are right now in a, in a world where first of all, if you have nothing, you are nothing.

1:00:50.320 --> 1:01:00.320
 And secondly, as you were saying before we got started today, a lot of jobs are gone and they're not coming back.

1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:02.320
 And that's where the self esteem.

1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:05.320
 That's where the self esteem and identity come in with people.

1:01:05.320 --> 1:01:08.320
 It's not only that you don't have anything to eat.

1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:17.320
 You don't even have a self anymore to speak of because we typically define ourselves, you know, as Marx put it, you are what you do.

1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:26.320
 And now who are you when your way of life as well as your way of earning a living is no longer available?

1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:27.320
 Yeah.

1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:30.320
 And it feels like that yearning for self esteem.

1:01:30.320 --> 1:01:36.320
 We could talk a little bit more because you about defining self esteem is quite interesting.

1:01:36.320 --> 1:01:46.320
 The more I've read the warm of the core and just in general, you're thinking it made me realize I haven't thought enough about the idea of self esteem.

1:01:46.320 --> 1:02:04.320
 And the thing I want to say is it feels like when you lose your job, then it's easy to find, it's tempting to find that self esteem in a tribe that's not somehow often positive.

1:02:04.320 --> 1:02:05.320
 That's exactly.

1:02:05.320 --> 1:02:09.320
 It's like a tribe that defines itself on the hatred of somebody else.

1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:10.320
 So that's brilliant.

1:02:10.320 --> 1:02:15.320
 And this is what John Gray, the philosopher in the 1990s.

1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:17.320
 He predicted what's happening today.

1:02:17.320 --> 1:02:27.320
 He wrote a book about globalism and actually Hannah Arendt in the 1950s said the same thing in her book about totalitarianism.

1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:39.320
 When she said that, you know, that economics has reached the point where most money is made not by actually making stuff.

1:02:39.320 --> 1:02:42.320
 You know, you use money to make money.

1:02:42.320 --> 1:02:51.320
 And therefore, what happens is money chases money across national boundaries.

1:02:51.320 --> 1:03:03.320
 Ultimately, governments become subordinate to the corporate entities whose sole function is to generate money.

1:03:03.320 --> 1:03:19.320
 And what John Gray said is that that will inevitably produce economic upheaval in local areas, which will not be attributed to the economic order.

1:03:19.320 --> 1:03:41.320
 It will be misattributed to whoever the scapegoat du jour is and the anger and the distress associated with that uncertainty will be picked up on by ideological demagogues who will transform that into rage.

1:03:41.320 --> 1:03:48.320
 So both Hannah Arendt as well as John Gray, they just said, watch out.

1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:57.320
 We're going to have right wingish populist movements where demagogues who are the alchemists of hate.

1:03:57.320 --> 1:04:16.320
 What makes them brilliant is they don't, they don't, the hate's already there, but they take the fears and they expertly redirect them to who it is that I need to hate and kill in order to feel good about myself.

1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:19.320
 So back to your point, Lex, that's right.

1:04:19.320 --> 1:04:26.320
 So the self regard that used to come from having a job and doing it well.

1:04:26.320 --> 1:04:33.320
 And as a result of that, having adequate resources to provide a decent life for your family.

1:04:33.320 --> 1:04:37.320
 Well, those opportunities are gone.

1:04:37.320 --> 1:04:39.320
 And yeah, what's left?

1:04:39.320 --> 1:04:44.320
 So Max Weber, German sociologist at the beginning of the 20th century.

1:04:44.320 --> 1:04:50.320
 He said in times of historical upheaval, we are apt to embrace.

1:04:50.320 --> 1:05:04.320
 He was the one who coined the term charismatic leader, seemingly larger than life individuals who often believe or their followers believe are divinely ordained to rid the world of evil.

1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:14.320
 Yeah. All right, now, Ernest Becker, he used Weber's ideas in order to account for the rise of Hitler.

1:05:14.320 --> 1:05:23.320
 Hitler was elected and he was elected when Germans were an extraordinary state of existential distress.

1:05:23.320 --> 1:05:27.320
 And he said, I'm going to make Germany great again.

1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:42.320
 All right, now, what Becker adds to the equation is his claim that what underlies our affection for charismatic populist leaders, good and bad, is death anxiety.

1:05:42.320 --> 1:05:45.320
 All right, now here's where we come in.

1:05:45.320 --> 1:05:49.320
 We're egghead experimental researchers.

1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:53.320
 You know, Becker wrote this book, The Denial of Death, and he couldn't get a job.

1:05:53.320 --> 1:06:01.320
 People just dismiss these ideas as fanciful speculation for which there's no evidence.

1:06:01.320 --> 1:06:04.320
 And you've done some good experiments.

1:06:04.320 --> 1:06:21.320
 Yeah, and here's where I can be more cavalier and where what I would urge people, like what you said, Lex, is ignore my histrionic and polemic language, if possible, and step back if you can, myself included.

1:06:21.320 --> 1:06:44.320
 And let's just consider the research findings because in September 11, 2001, people that are old enough to remember that horrible day, two days before George W. Bush had the lowest approval rating in the history of presidential polling.

1:06:44.320 --> 1:07:02.320
 All right, three weeks later, after he said, we will rid the world of the evildoers, and then a week or two after that, he said in a cover story on Time magazine that he believed that God had chosen him to lead the world during this, to lead the country, rather, during this perilous time.

1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:05.320
 He had the highest approval rating.

1:07:05.320 --> 1:07:16.320
 And so we're like, well, what happened? You know, what happened to Americans that their approval of President Bush got so high so fast?

1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:23.320
 Well, our view following Becker is that 2001 was like a giant death reminder.

1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:24.320
 Yeah.

1:07:24.320 --> 1:07:36.320
 The people dying plus the symbols of American greatness, World Trade Center, and the Pentagon. So we did a bunch of experiments. And most of our experiments are disarmingly simple.

1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:44.320
 We have one group of people, and we just remind them that they're going to die. We say, hey, write your thoughts and feelings about dying.

1:07:44.320 --> 1:07:58.320
 Or in other cases, we stop them outside, either in front of a funeral home, or 100 meters to either side, our thought being that if we stop you in front of a funeral home, then death is on your mind, even if you don't know it.

1:07:58.320 --> 1:08:06.320
 And then there's other studies, they're even more subtle, where we bring people into the lab, and they read stuff on a computer.

1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:14.320
 And while they're doing that, we flash the word death for 28 milliseconds. It's so fast, you don't see anything.

1:08:14.320 --> 1:08:20.320
 And then we just measure people's reactions or behavior thereafter.

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:36.320
 And what we found in 2003, leading up to the election of 2004 was that Americans did not care for President Bush or his policies in Iraq in control conditions.

1:08:36.320 --> 1:08:42.320
 But if we reminded them of their mortality first, they like Bush a lot more.

1:08:42.320 --> 1:08:50.320
 And every study that we did, Americans like John Kerry, who was running against Bush, they like Kerry more than Bush.

1:08:50.320 --> 1:08:54.320
 Policy wise, in a control condition.

1:08:54.320 --> 1:09:02.320
 But if they were reminded of death first, then they like Bush a lot more.

1:09:02.320 --> 1:09:12.320
 And the other way, just a small pause, you said, they're dissimilarly simple experiments. I think that's, and people should read Warm at the Core for some other descriptions.

1:09:12.320 --> 1:09:26.320
 You have a lot of different experiences of this nature. I think it's a brilliant experiment connected to the Stoics, perhaps, of how your world view on anything and how delicious that water tastes.

1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:38.320
 After you're reminded of your own mortality, it's such a fascinating experiment that you could probably keep doing like millions of them to draw insight about the way we see the world.

1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:54.320
 No, that's right, Lex. And I appreciate the compliment, not because we did anything, but because what these studies, many of which are now done by other people around the world in labs that we're not connected with.

1:09:54.320 --> 1:10:08.320
 What I'm most proud about our work, I am proud of the experiments that we've done, but it's not science until somebody else can replicate your findings and independent researchers are interested in pursuing them.

1:10:08.320 --> 1:10:20.320
 It's such a fascinating idea. I don't have to think about a lot about the experiments you've done and that you've inspired, about the fact that death changes the way you see a bunch of different things.

1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:40.320
 I think the Stoics talked about, I mean, in general, just memento mori, just thinking about death and meditating on death is a really positive, not a positive, it's an enlightening way to live life.

1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:52.320
 So what do you think about that at the individual level? What is the role about bringing that terror of death, fear of death to the surface and being cognizant of it?

1:10:52.320 --> 1:11:21.320
 For us, that's the ballgame. So what we write in our book, and here we're just paying homage to the philosophers and theologians that come before us, is to point out that literally since antiquity, there has been a consensus that to lead a full,

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:31.320
 lead a full life requires Albert Camus had come to terms with death thereafter, anything is possible.

1:11:31.320 --> 1:11:52.320
 And so you've got the Stoics, and you've got the Epicureans, and then you've got the Tibetan Book of the Dead, and then you've got like the medieval monks that worked with like a skull on their desk, and the whole idea, I should back up a bit because

1:11:52.320 --> 1:12:13.320
 and just remind folks that our studies, you know, when we remind people that they're going to die, and we find that, yeah, they drink more water if a famous person is, you know, advertising it, they eat more cookies, they want more fancy clothes,

1:12:13.320 --> 1:12:25.320
 they sit closer to people that look like them, it changes who they vote for. But all of those things, those are very subtle death reminders, you don't even know that death is on your mind.

1:12:25.320 --> 1:12:44.320
 And so our point is that, and this is kind of counterintuitive, and that is that the most problematic and unsavory human reactions to death anxiety are malignant manifestations of repressed death anxiety.

1:12:44.320 --> 1:13:02.320
 You know, we try and bury it under the psychological bushes, and then it comes back to bear bitter fruit. But what the theologians and the philosophers of the world are saying is it behooves each of us to spend considerable time.

1:13:02.320 --> 1:13:26.320
 You don't have to be a goth death rocker, you know, wallowing in death imagery to spend enough time entertaining the reality of the human condition, which is that you too will pass to get to the point where there is,

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:35.320
 to lapse into a cliche, the capacity for personal transformation and growth.

1:13:35.320 --> 1:13:42.320
 Let's go personal for a second. Are you yourself afraid of death?

1:13:42.320 --> 1:13:59.320
 Yeah. I mean, and how much do you meditate on that thought? Like, maybe your own study of it is a kind of escape from your own talent. Absolutely. So you got it. And like, if you figure out death, somehow you won't die.

1:13:59.320 --> 1:14:20.320
 No, no. So my colleagues and good friends, Jeff Greenberg and Tom Pazinski, you know, we met in graduate school in the 1970s. We've been doing this work for 40 years. And we cheerfully admit, even though it doesn't reflect well on us as humans, that I should just speak for myself.

1:14:20.320 --> 1:14:40.320
 But I feel like there's a real sense in which doing these studies and writing books and lecturing has been my way of avoiding directly confronting my anxieties by turning it into an intellectual exercise.

1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:54.320
 And every once in a while, therefore, when I think that I'm making some progress as a human, I have to remind myself that that is probably not the case.

1:14:54.320 --> 1:15:10.320
 And that I have at times, like all humans, been more preoccupied with the implications of these ideas for my self esteem. It's like, oh, we're going to write a book and maybe we'll get to go on TV or something.

1:15:10.320 --> 1:15:22.320
 Well, no, that's not the same as to actually think about it in a way that you feel it rather than just think it.

1:15:22.320 --> 1:15:24.320
 Yeah, like you did when you were eight.

1:15:24.320 --> 1:15:26.320
 That's exactly right.

1:15:26.320 --> 1:15:41.320
 So when I first read The Denial of Death, I was so literally flabbergasted by it that I took a leave of absence for a year and just like did what would be considered menial jobs.

1:15:41.320 --> 1:16:06.320
 I did construction work. I worked in a restaurant. And I was just like, wait a minute. If I understand what this guy is saying, then I'm just a culturally constructed meat puppet doing things for reasons that I know not in order to assuage death anxiety.

1:16:06.320 --> 1:16:11.320
 And I was like, that's not acceptable.

1:16:11.320 --> 1:16:15.320
 Maybe another interesting person to talk about is Ernest Becker himself.

1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:16.320
 Sure.

1:16:16.320 --> 1:16:24.320
 So how did he face his death? Is there something interesting personal?

1:16:24.320 --> 1:16:25.320
 I think so.

1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:43.320
 So interesting to me is Becker also from a Jewish family, claimed to be atheistic, did not identify ultimately as Jewish.

1:16:43.320 --> 1:16:55.320
 I believe he converted to Christianity, but was himself a religious person and he said he became religious when his first child was born.

1:16:55.320 --> 1:17:04.320
 Not religious. What does that mean? Does he have a faith? Well, let's talk more. Most importantly, he's the afterlife.

1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:06.320
 What's his view on the afterlife?

1:17:06.320 --> 1:17:31.320
 He was agnostic on that. But he did. Now, the denial of death is there's a chapter devoted to Kierkegaard. And he talks about, for Kierkegaard, if you want to become a mature individual, you know, if you want to learn something, you go to the university.

1:17:31.320 --> 1:17:40.320
 If you want to become a more mature individual, according to Kierkegaard, you got to go to the school of anxiety.

1:17:40.320 --> 1:17:50.320
 What Kierkegaard said is that we have to let this vague dis ease, put a hyphen between dis and ease, about death.

1:17:50.320 --> 1:18:18.320
 Kierkegaard's point is you have to really think about that. You have to think about it and feel it. You got to let it seek in or seep into your mind, at which point, according to Kierkegaard, basically, you realize that your present identity is fundamentally a cultural construction.

1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:36.320
 You didn't choose the time and place of your birth. You didn't choose your name. You know, you didn't choose necessarily even the social role that you occupy. You might have chosen from what's available in your culture, but not from the full palette of human opportunities.

1:18:36.320 --> 1:18:54.320
 And so what Kierkegaard said is that we need to realize that we've been living a lie of sorts. Becker calls it a necessary lie, and we have to momentarily dispose of that.

1:18:54.320 --> 1:19:08.320
 And so now Kierkegaard says, well, here I am. I have shrugged off all of the cultural accoutrements that I have used to define myself.

1:19:08.320 --> 1:19:19.320
 And now what am I or who am I? This is like the ancient Greek tragedy where the worst thing was to be no one or no thing.

1:19:19.320 --> 1:19:31.320
 At this point, Kierkegaard said, you're really dangling on the precipice of oblivion. And some people tumble into that abyss and never come out.

1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:45.320
 On the other hand, Kierkegaard said that what you can now do metaphorically and literally is to rebuild yourself from the ground up. And in the New Testament, there's something you have to die in order to be reborn.

1:19:45.320 --> 1:19:53.320
 And Kierkegaard's view, though, is that there's only one way to do that. This is his proverbial leap into faith.

1:19:53.320 --> 1:20:04.320
 And in Kierkegaard's case, it was faith and Christianity that you can't have unbridled faith in cultural constructions.

1:20:04.320 --> 1:20:12.320
 The only thing that you can have unequivocal faith in is some kind of transcendent power.

1:20:12.320 --> 1:20:21.320
 But of course, this raises the question of, well, is that just another death denying belief system?

1:20:21.320 --> 1:20:35.320
 And at the end of the denial of death, Becker admits that there's no way to tell while still advocating for what is ultimately a religious stance.

1:20:35.320 --> 1:20:51.320
 Now, one of the things that I don't understand, and Becker has been the most singularly potent influence in my academic and personal life, but a year or two ago, I started reading Martin Heidegger.

1:20:51.320 --> 1:21:07.320
 I'm reading Being in Time. And what I now wonder is why Becker, who refers to Heidegger from time to time in his work, why he didn't take Heidegger more seriously?

1:21:07.320 --> 1:21:16.320
 Because Heidegger is like a secular Kierkegaard. He has the same thing, which is death anxiety.

1:21:16.320 --> 1:21:24.320
 Oh, and I should have pointed out that what Kierkegaard says is that death anxiety, most people don't go to the school of anxiety.

1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:32.320
 They flee from death anxiety by embracing their cultural beliefs.

1:21:32.320 --> 1:21:38.320
 Kierkegaard says they then tranquilize themselves with the trivial. And I love that phrase.

1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:49.320
 It's a beautiful phrase because at the end of the denial of death, Becker's like, look, the average American is either drinking or shopping or watching television, and they're all the same thing.

1:21:49.320 --> 1:22:07.320
 Heidegger says the same thing. He says, look, and he acknowledges Kierkegaard. He says, what makes us feel unsettled, and evidently that's an English translation of angst, that we don't feel at home in the world.

1:22:07.320 --> 1:22:17.320
 Heidegger says that's death anxiety. And one direction is the Kierkegaard one. He, Heidegger calls it a flight from death.

1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:28.320
 You just unselfreflexively cling to your cultural constructions. And Heidegger borrows the term tranquilized.

1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:50.320
 But he points out that he doesn't care for that term because tranquilized sounds like you're subdued, when in fact what most culturally constructed meat puppets do is to be frenetically engaged with their surroundings to ensure that they never sit still long enough to actually think about anything consequential.

1:22:50.320 --> 1:23:01.320
 Heidegger says there's another way though. He's like, yo, what you can do is to come to terms with that death anxiety in the following way.

1:23:01.320 --> 1:23:14.320
 Thing number one is to realize that not only are you going to die, but your death can happen at any given moment.

1:23:14.320 --> 1:23:26.320
 So for Heidegger, if you say, I know I'm going to die in some vaguely unspecified future moment, that's still death denial because you're saying, yeah, not me, not now.

1:23:26.320 --> 1:23:46.320
 Heidegger's point is you need to get to the point where you need to realize that, you know, I need to realize that I can walk outside and get smote by a comet or I can stop for gas on the way home and catch the virus and be dead in two days.

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:56.320
 Or any number of potentially unanticipated and uncontrollable fatal outcomes.

1:23:56.320 --> 1:23:58.320
 To bring it into the now.

1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:07.320
 Yeah, it is brilliant. I agree, Lex, and that's just why I'm wondering why Heidegger noticed this because that's the being and time thing.

1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:17.320
 It's got to be now. And then he says, okay, so now I've dealt somewhat with the death part.

1:24:17.320 --> 1:24:23.320
 And now he says, now you've got to deal with what he calls existential guilt.

1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:34.320
 And he says, well, all right, you have to realize that like it or not, you have to make choices.

1:24:34.320 --> 1:24:40.320
 You know, this is Jean Paul Sartre. We are condemned by virtue of consciousness to choosing.

1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:58.320
 But Heidegger is a little bit more precise. He's like, look, as I was saying earlier, you're in reality, you're an insignificant speck of respiring carbon based dust born into a time and place, not of your choosing.

1:24:58.320 --> 1:25:05.320
 When you're here for a microscopic amount of time after which you are not.

1:25:05.320 --> 1:25:23.320
 And for Heidegger, you have to realize that, like I said, I didn't choose to be born a male or Jewish or in America, the offspring of working class people.

1:25:23.320 --> 1:25:41.320
 And Heidegger, what he says is, yeah, but you still have to make choices and accept responsibility for those choices, even though you didn't choose any of the parameters that ultimately limit what's available to you.

1:25:41.320 --> 1:25:54.320
 And moreover, you're going to not always make good choices. So now you're guilty for your choices.

1:25:54.320 --> 1:26:06.320
 And then he uses the poet Rilke. He has a phrase, Becker uses it in the denial of death, the guilt of unlived life.

1:26:06.320 --> 1:26:27.320
 I just love that you have to accept that you have already diminished and in many ways amputated your own possibilities by virtue of choices that you've made or just as often have declined to make.

1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:44.320
 Because you are reluctant to accept responsibility for the opportunities that you are now able to create by virtue of seeing the possibilities that lay before you.

1:26:44.320 --> 1:26:54.320
 So anyway, Heidegger then says, look, okay, so, you know, I'm a professor and I live in America in the 21st century.

1:26:54.320 --> 1:27:04.320
 Well, if I was in the third century living in a year in Mongolia, I'm not going to have an opportunity to be a professor.

1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:18.320
 But what he submits is that there is some aspects of whatever I am that are independent of my cultural and historical circumstances.

1:27:18.320 --> 1:27:26.320
 In other words, there is a me of sorts. Heidegger would take vigorous issue and so would Heidegger scholars because I'm not claiming to understand him.

1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:42.320
 This is my classic comic book rendering. But Heidegger's point is that you get to the point where you're able to say, okay, I am a contingent historical and cultural artifact.

1:27:42.320 --> 1:27:53.320
 But so what, you know, if I was, you know, now if I was transported a thousand years in the past in Asia, I'd be in the same situation.

1:27:53.320 --> 1:28:06.320
 I would still be conditioned by time and place. I would still have choices that I could make within the confines of what opportunities are afforded to me.

1:28:06.320 --> 1:28:16.320
 And then Heidegger says, if I can get that far, and this is his language, he says that there is a transformation.

1:28:16.320 --> 1:28:22.320
 And he literally, he calls it a turning. You're turning away from a flight from death.

1:28:22.320 --> 1:28:50.320
 And you are allowed, you therefore, you see a horizon as his word of opportunity that makes you in a state of anticipatory resoluteness with solicitous regard for others that makes your life seem like an adventure perfused with unshakable joy.

1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:58.320
 All right, let me unpack those things. It is beautiful. It is. I love Lex that you're resonating to the time thing. So he's like, okay, we already talked about now.

1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:17.320
 Anticipatory is already hopeful because it's looking forward to be resolute. It means to be steadfast and to just have confidence in what you're doing moving forward.

1:29:17.320 --> 1:29:27.320
 All right, solicitous, I had to look up all these words, by the way, is it just means that you are concerned about your fellow human beings.

1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:45.320
 And but I love the idea, even if it seems allegorical, I don't mind that at all. This idea you said love earlier, and I think that when Heidegger is talking about being solicitous, that's as close as he can get.

1:29:45.320 --> 1:29:47.320
 There's an Italian.

1:29:47.320 --> 1:29:53.320
 Yes, Sajjintrab. So what was that line again with the solicitous of the whole thing of turning away from death?

1:29:53.320 --> 1:29:56.320
 Yeah, all the words you said are just beautiful.

1:29:56.320 --> 1:29:57.320
 I love those words, yeah.

1:29:57.320 --> 1:30:15.320
 Anticipatory resoluteness that is accompanied with solicitous regard to our fellow humans, which makes life appear to us to be an ongoing adventure that is permeated by unshakable joy.

1:30:15.320 --> 1:30:27.320
 Now, again, Heidegger is not Mary Poppins. I just got a tattoo. No, this is great. I just love that.

1:30:27.320 --> 1:30:36.320
 No, I'm piecing together. These are his exact words that, and I spent the last two years reading almost everything that I can find because I want to.

1:30:36.320 --> 1:30:46.320
 I'm sick of death. You said it, so I want to second what you say, Lex. So it's not about death. It's the Sherwood Anderson guy.

1:30:46.320 --> 1:30:56.320
 He's a novelist that I like about. He wrote a book called Winesburg, Ohio, and now I'm going to forget what he said on his tombstone.

1:30:56.320 --> 1:31:14.320
 But, you know, it was something to the effect. Oh, he said, life, not death is the great adventure. The point being is that, you know, to consider that we must die and the existential implications of that.

1:31:14.320 --> 1:31:32.320
 Really, the goal, the way I see it, is getting from hate to love. And I feel like Heidegger has a way of thinking about things that moves us more in that direction.

1:31:32.320 --> 1:31:46.320
 And so that's kind of my current preoccupation, is to take what I just said to you and to talk about it with my colleagues and other academic psychologists.

1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:54.320
 Because the way we started with Ernest Becker, remember I said earlier, I wasn't trained in any of these things.

1:31:54.320 --> 1:32:10.320
 I'm an egghead researcher that was doing experiments about biofeedback. And, you know, then we read these Becker books and I thought they were so interesting that for the first few years we didn't have any studies.

1:32:10.320 --> 1:32:21.320
 I just would travel around and I'd be like, here's what this Becker guy says. I think this is cool. Well, my present view is I'm like, here's what this Heidegger guy says.

1:32:21.320 --> 1:32:32.320
 I think these ideas are consistent with what Becker is saying because they are anchored in death anxiety.

1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:55.320
 But I like that direction as an alternative to the Kierkegaardian insistence that the only psychologically tenable way to extricate ourselves from maladaptive reactions to death anxiety is through faith in the traditional sense.

1:32:55.320 --> 1:33:07.320
 Yeah, I always kind of saw Kierkegaard unfairly. Like you said, in a comic book sense of the word faith is a non traditional sense. I kind of like the idea of leap of faith.

1:33:07.320 --> 1:33:22.320
 Oh, I love that idea. And so what I've been babbling about with, you know, Kierkegaard or Heidegger, I'm like, yeah, Kierkegaard is a leap of faith in God. Heidegger is a leap of faith in life.

1:33:22.320 --> 1:33:39.320
 And I just, yeah, I like it. I found the leap of faith really interesting in the technological space. So I've talked to on this thing with Elon Musk, but I think he's also just in general for our culture, a really important figure.

1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:40.320
 Oh, absolutely.

1:33:40.320 --> 1:33:57.320
 And that takes, I mean, he's sometimes a little bit insane on social media and just in life. When I met him, it was kind of interesting that, of course, there's a, I mean, he's a legit engineer, so he's fond to talk to about the technical things.

1:33:57.320 --> 1:33:58.320
 Yeah.

1:33:58.320 --> 1:34:07.320
 But he also just, just the way the humor and the way he sees life, it just like refuses to be conventional.

1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:23.320
 Yeah. So it's a constant leap into the unknown. And one of the things that he does, and this isn't even, this isn't even like fake. A lot of people say, because he's a CEO, there's a business owner, so he's trying to make money.

1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:39.320
 No, I think this is, I looked him in his eyes, I mean, this is real, is a lot of the things he believes that are going to be accomplished that a lot of others are saying are impossible, like autonomous vehicles, he truly believes it.

1:34:39.320 --> 1:34:54.320
 To me, that is the leap of faith of, I'm almost going like, we're like, the entirety of our experience is shrouded in mystery. We don't know what the hell's going to happen. You don't know what we're actually capable of as human beings. And he just takes the leap.

1:34:54.320 --> 1:35:12.320
 He fully believes that we can, we can colonize Mars. I mean, how crazy is it to just believe and dream and actually be taking steps towards it. To colonize the Mars when most people are like, that's the stupidest idea ever.

1:35:12.320 --> 1:35:15.320
 Yeah. Well, I'm in agreement with you on that.

1:35:15.320 --> 1:35:32.320
 You know, two things, you know, one is it reminds me of Ben Franklin, who in his autobiography, you know, has a similarly childish in the best sense of the word, unbridled imagination for what might become.

1:35:32.320 --> 1:35:44.320
 You know, Ben Franklin's like, yeah, I got electricity, that's cool, but we'll be levitating soon. And we can't even begin to imagine what we are capable of.

1:35:44.320 --> 1:36:10.320
 And of course, people are like, dude, that's crazy. And there's a guy with, it's FCS Schiller, some humanistic guy at the beginning of the 20th century. He's like, you know, lots of things that people think about may appear to be absurd to the point of obscene.

1:36:10.320 --> 1:36:34.320
 But the reality is historically, every fantastic innovation has generally been initiated by someone who was condemned for being a lunatic. And it's not that anything is possible, but surely things that we don't try will never manifest as possibilities.

1:36:34.320 --> 1:36:53.320
 Yeah. And that's, that's, that there's something beautiful to that. That's the embracing the abyss. And again, it's like the, it's the embracing the fear of death, the reality of death, and then turning into look at all the opportunities.

1:36:53.320 --> 1:37:14.320
 Oh, yeah, that's right. Let me ask you, whenever I bring up Ernest Becker's work, which I do and yours quite a bit, I find it surprising how that it's not a lot more popular in a sense that no, I don't mean just your book.

1:37:14.320 --> 1:37:25.320
 That's well written, people should read it, should buy it, whatever. I think it has the same kind of qualities that are useful to think about as like Jordan Peterson's work and stuff like that.

1:37:25.320 --> 1:37:41.320
 But I just mean like, why people are not, don't think of that as a compelling description of the core of the human condition.

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:51.320
 I think what you mentioned about Heidegger is quite, connects with me quite well. So I ask on this podcast, I often ask people if they're afraid of death.

1:37:51.320 --> 1:38:04.320
 That's like, almost every single person almost always get criticized for asking world class people, scientists and technologies and about the fear of death, and the meaning of life.

1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:17.320
 And on the fear of death, they often don't say anything interesting. What I mean by that is, they haven't thought deeply about it.

1:38:17.320 --> 1:38:29.320
 You kind of brought this up a few times of really letting it sink in. They kind of say this thing about exactly what you said, which is like, it's something that happens, not today.

1:38:29.320 --> 1:38:39.320
 They're not aware that it's something that happens. And I'm not, the thing they usually say is, I'm not afraid of death. I just want to live a good life kind of thing.

1:38:39.320 --> 1:38:52.320
 And what I'm trying to express is like when I look in their eyes and the kind of the core of the conversation, it looks like they haven't really become, like they haven't really meditated on death.

1:38:52.320 --> 1:39:07.320
 And just the question is, what do I say to people that there's something to really think about here? Like, there's some demons, some realities that need to be faced by more people.

1:39:07.320 --> 1:39:31.320
 Well, that's a tough one. I could tell you what not to do. So when we are young and annoying, a lot of famous people, mostly psychologists, because that's who we intersected with, we would lay out these ideas and they would be, well, I don't think about death like that.

1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:46.320
 So these ideas must be wrong. And we would say, well, you don't think about death because you're lucky enough to be comfortably ensconced in a cultural worldview from which you derive self esteem.

1:39:46.320 --> 1:40:04.320
 And that has spared you the existential excruciations that would otherwise arise. But that's like Freud, you know, you're repressing, so you either agree with me in which case I'm right, or you disagree with me in which case you're repressing and I'm right.

1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:22.320
 Well, so that's the Nietzsche thing. What I felt when I've, there've been moments in my life where I really thought about death. I mean, there's not too many, like really, really thought about it and feel the thing when you felt that eight, maybe I'm dramatizing or romanticizing it.

1:40:22.320 --> 1:40:41.320
 I feel like it's, the conservatives call it popularly, or the movie Matrix call it the red pill moment. I feel like it's a dangerous thought because I feel like I'm taking a step out of society.

1:40:41.320 --> 1:40:56.320
 There's a nice narrative that we've all constructed. And I'm taking a step out. And it feels, there's this feeling like you're basically drowning. I mean, it's not a good feeling.

1:40:56.320 --> 1:41:14.320
 It's not. But this gets back to the Heidegger Kierkegaard School of Anxiety. You are stepping out. And you are momentarily shrugging off, again, the culturally constructed psychological accoutrements that allow you to stand up in the morning.

1:41:14.320 --> 1:41:39.320
 So I mean, in that sense, it feels like, I mean, how do you have that conversation? Because I guess I'm dancing around a set of questions, which is like, I guess I'm disappointed that people don't, are not as willing to step outside.

1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:59.320
 Like, even just, even any kind of thought experiment, let's forget denial of death. Like, there's not a community of people, let's take an easy one that I think is scientifically ridiculous, which is, there's a community of people that believe that the earth is flat.

1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:19.320
 Or actually, even better, the space is fake. Yeah. Like, what I find surprising is that a lot of people I talk to are not willing to be like, imagine if it is like, imagine the earth is flat, like, think about it.

1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:38.320
 And a lot of people just like, no, the earth is round. They're like, like scientists, too. They're like, yes. Well, actually, wait, have you actually, like thought about it? Like, imagine, like a thought experiment, that like basically step outside the little narrative that we are comfortable with.

1:42:38.320 --> 1:43:04.320
 Now, that one in particular is, has really strong evidence and scientific validation. So it's a pretty simple thing to show that it at least is not flat. But just the willingness to take a step outside of the stories that bring us comfort is been disappointing that people are not willing to do that.

1:43:04.320 --> 1:43:15.320
 And I think the philosophy that you've constructed and the earnest back is constructed and you've tested, I think is really compelling in the fact that people aren't often willing to take that step.

1:43:15.320 --> 1:43:16.320
 Yeah.

1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:17.320
 Disappointing.

1:43:17.320 --> 1:43:38.320
 Yes. But perhaps understandable. I mean, one of the, this is an anecdote, of course, but when we were trying to get a publisher for our book, I had, we had a meeting with a publisher who published some Malcolm Gladwell books.

1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:53.320
 And she said, I'm very interested in your book, but can you write it without mentioning death? Because people don't like death. And we're like, no, it's really kind of central.

1:43:53.320 --> 1:44:22.320
 And I think that's part of it. I think, again, if these ideas have merit, and I actually like the way that you put it, Lex, it's that to step away is to momentarily expose yourself to all of the anxiety that our identity and our beliefs typically enable us to

1:44:22.320 --> 1:44:24.320
 manage. I think it's as simple as that.

1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:43.320
 Yeah. I had this experience in college with my best friend who got really high. And he forgot it was in the winter. It was really freezing. It was memorable to me. I think it's an analogy. It's very useful.

1:44:43.320 --> 1:45:02.320
 So he went to get some pizza and he left me outside and said, I'll be back in five minutes. And he forgot that he left me outside. And I remember it was, I was in like shorts. It was freezing winter.

1:45:02.320 --> 1:45:03.320
 Wow.

1:45:03.320 --> 1:45:21.320
 I remember standing outside is a dorm. And I'm looking from the outside in, it's a light and it's warm. And I'm just standing there frozen. I think for an hour or more. And that's how I think about it. Like, I just, I don't give a damn about the stupid winter or anything.

1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:26.320
 I just want to, like, it's like a, I'm drawn to be back to the warm.

1:45:26.320 --> 1:45:36.320
 And that's how I feel about thinking about like death. It's like, at a certain point, it's like, it's too much. It's like that cold. I want to be back into the warm.

1:45:36.320 --> 1:45:53.320
 I want to be back. And getting back to Heidegger for a moment. I like the, yeah, he uses a lot the idea of feeling at home, not as like in your house, but just feeling like you're comfortably situated.

1:45:53.320 --> 1:46:03.320
 Maybe we can talk about, like, I had a conversation about this with my dad a little bit. How does religion relate to this?

1:46:03.320 --> 1:46:25.320
 I see it as the disease and the cure. In a sense, a few things. One is that I think a case could be made that humans are innately religious.

1:46:25.320 --> 1:46:33.320
 So now we're going to get into territory where there's going to be a lot of disputes.

1:46:33.320 --> 1:46:35.320
 And by, what do you mean by religious?

1:46:35.320 --> 1:46:38.320
 Religion is an evolutionary adaptation.

1:46:38.320 --> 1:46:44.320
 And religion is like a belief in something outside of yourself kind of thing.

1:46:44.320 --> 1:46:58.320
 Not necessarily. So here we got to be a little bit more careful. And again, I'm not a scholar. How about I'm a well intentioned dilettante in this regard?

1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:16.320
 Because what I have read is that religion evolved very early on, long before our ancestors were conscious. And the issue of death arose.

1:47:16.320 --> 1:47:32.320
 And the word religion evidently is from a Latin word, we can look it up, and it means to bind. And Emile Durkheim, the dead French sociologist, he said, you know,

1:47:32.320 --> 1:47:53.320
 originally religion is a Darcella saying who's a dead novelist. She calls it the substance of we feeling that it's literally that it arose because we're uber social creatures who from time to time took comfort

1:47:53.320 --> 1:48:09.320
 in just being in physical proximity with our fellow humans. And that there is this kind of sense of transcendent exuberance.

1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:24.320
 Just back to the unshakable joy that Heidegger alludes to. And that the original function of religion was to foster social cohesion and coordination.

1:48:24.320 --> 1:48:46.320
 And that it was only subsequently some claim that a burgeoning level of consciousness made it such that religious belief systems that included the hope of some kind of immortality were just naturally selected thereafter.

1:48:46.320 --> 1:49:03.320
 So there are some people so it's David Sloan Wilson wrote a book called Darwin's Cathedral. And he said religion has nothing to do with death. It evolved to make groups viable.

1:49:03.320 --> 1:49:05.320
 He's actually a group selection guy.

1:49:05.320 --> 1:49:07.320
 What's group selection?

1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:12.320
 The idea that it's the group that is selected for rather than individuals.

1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:13.320
 The individual.

1:49:13.320 --> 1:49:28.320
 Yeah. So people have vigorous disagreements about that. But I guess our point would be we see religion as being inextricably inextricably connected ultimately to assuaging concerns about death.

1:49:28.320 --> 1:49:48.320
 Well, I guess another question to ask around this, like, what does the world look like without religion? Will we, if it's inextricably inextricably connected to our fears of death, do you think it always returns in some kind of shape?

1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:52.320
 Maybe it's not called religion, but whatever it just keeps returning.

1:49:52.320 --> 1:50:08.320
 Yeah, who knows. So that's a great question, Lex. So there's a woman named Karen Armstrong. She was a nun turned historian. And she's, I can't remember the name of the book, but no matter.

1:50:08.320 --> 1:50:10.320
 She, we could look that up.

1:50:10.320 --> 1:50:14.320
 If you want, I can look it up, but I can also, I'll just add it in post.

1:50:14.320 --> 1:50:29.320
 Yeah, her point, it says has gotten the title, of course, but, you know, she's like, look, all religions are generally fairly right minded in that they advocate the golden rule.

1:50:29.320 --> 1:50:46.320
 And all religions at their best do seem to foster pro social behavior towards the in group. And that confers both psychological as well as physical benefits.

1:50:46.320 --> 1:51:10.320
 That's the good news. And the bad news is historically all religions are subject to being hijacked by a lunatic French who declares that, you know, they're the ones in soul possession of the liturgical practices or whatever they call them.

1:51:10.320 --> 1:51:20.320
 And they're the ones that turn, you know, religion at its best into your crusades and holocausts.

1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:39.320
 My view, not that it should matter for much, but I grew up just skeptical of religion, because I'm like, as a kid, I'm like, well, if we didn't have these beliefs,

1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:51.320
 we wouldn't be killing each other because of them. And I'd be like to my parents, well, you're telling me that all people should be judged on the merits of their character.

1:51:51.320 --> 1:52:00.320
 But don't come home if you don't marry a Jewish woman, which is implying that if you're not Jewish, you're an inferior form of life.

1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:02.320
 Yeah, that's what tribes always do.

1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:19.320
 And there's the tribal thing. And so there's a guy named Amin Malouf, a Lebanese guy who writes in French in the 1990s, I think, wrote a book called In the Name of Identity, Violence and the Need to Belong.

1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:37.320
 And that was his point is, unless we can overcome this tribal mentality, this will not end well. But you said earlier something, Lex, that I think is profound and profoundly important.

1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:47.320
 And that is you did not recoil in horror when I mentioned Kierkegaard's use of the term faith.

1:52:47.320 --> 1:52:54.320
 And so I'm a big fan of faith. And I'm not sure what that implies.

1:52:54.320 --> 1:53:05.320
 I have, and by the way, this is just a peripheral comment, but I find less resistance to Becker's ideas in our work.

1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:18.320
 When I'm in like Jesuit schools, you know, it's the Americans that, you know, the secular humanists who are most disinclined to accept these ideas.

1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:34.320
 It's an important side comment, because I think it's mostly because they don't think philosophically. I mean, I speak with a lot of scientists, and I think that's my main criticism is, you know, I mean, that's the problem with science.

1:53:34.320 --> 1:53:35.320
 Exactly.

1:53:35.320 --> 1:53:47.320
 It's so comforting to focus in on the details that you can escape thinking about the mystery of it all, the big picture things, the philosophical, like the fact that you don't actually know shit at all.

1:53:47.320 --> 1:54:04.320
 Like that, yeah, so in terms of Jesuit, like that's the beauty of the experience of faith and so on is like, wherever that journey takes you is you actually explore the biggest questions of our world.

1:54:04.320 --> 1:54:05.320
 Yeah.

1:54:05.320 --> 1:54:18.320
 So I don't see religion going away because I don't see humans as capable of surviving without faith and hope.

1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:31.320
 And everyone from the Pope to Elon Musk will acknowledge that it is a world that is unfathomably mysterious.

1:54:31.320 --> 1:54:42.320
 And like it or not, in the absence of beliefs here on Charles Perce, the pragmatic philosopher, he just said beliefs are the basis of action.

1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:49.320
 If you don't have any beliefs, you're paralyzed within decision, whether we're aware of it or not, whether we like it or not.

1:54:49.320 --> 1:55:01.320
 In order to stand up in the morning, you have to subscribe to beliefs that can never be unequivocally proven right or wrong.

1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:04.320
 Well, then why do you maintain them?

1:55:04.320 --> 1:55:08.320
 Well, ultimately, it's because of some form of faith.

1:55:08.320 --> 1:55:16.320
 But also, also faith shouldn't be a dogmatic thing that you should always be leaping.

1:55:16.320 --> 1:55:17.320
 Yes.

1:55:17.320 --> 1:55:30.320
 I guess the problem with science or with religion is you could sort of all of a sudden take a step into a place where you're super confident that you know the absolute truth of things.

1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:31.320
 There you go.

1:55:31.320 --> 1:55:41.320
 And again, back to Socrates, Plato, back in the cave at Skidmore where I work, that's what I have the students read in their first week.

1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:47.320
 You know, and Plato's like, oh, look at all those poor bastards, you know, they're in the cave, but they don't know it.

1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:52.320
 You know, and then they are freed from their chains.

1:55:52.320 --> 1:55:56.320
 And they have to be dragged out of the cave, by the way, which is another interesting point.

1:55:56.320 --> 1:56:03.320
 They don't run out, but that gets back to why people don't like to be divested of their comfortable illusions.

1:56:03.320 --> 1:56:10.320
 But anyway, they get dragged out of the cave into the sunlight, which he claims is a representation of truth and beauty.

1:56:10.320 --> 1:56:15.320
 And I say to the students, well, what's wrong with that?

1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:17.320
 And they're like, nothing.

1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:19.320
 That's like, awesome.

1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:27.320
 And then I'm like, yo, dudes, you out of the cave, but how do you know that you're not in another cave?

1:56:27.320 --> 1:56:30.320
 The illumination may be better.

1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:50.320
 But the minute you think you're at the end of the proverbial intellectual slash epistemological trail, then you have already succumbed to either laziness or dogmatism or both.

1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:52.320
 That's really well put.

1:56:52.320 --> 1:57:01.320
 That's both terrifying and exciting that there's always a bigger cave, a little bit of an outdoor question.

1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:10.320
 But I think some of the interesting qualities of the human mind is the ideas of intelligence and consciousness.

1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:13.320
 So what do you make of consciousness?

1:57:13.320 --> 1:57:21.320
 So do you think death creates consciousness, like the fear of death, the terror of death creates consciousness?

1:57:21.320 --> 1:57:29.320
 And consciousness, in turn, magnifies the terror of death.

1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:30.320
 I do.

1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:33.320
 Like what is consciousness to you?

1:57:33.320 --> 1:57:34.320
 Don't ask me that.

1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:40.320
 So now, if I could answer that, I'd be chugging rum out of a coconut with my Nobel Prize.

1:57:40.320 --> 1:58:01.320
 You know, Stephen Pinker, I do agree with his claim, and I think how the mind works, that it is the key question for the psychological sciences broadly defined in the 21st century.

1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:02.320
 What is consciousness?

1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:03.320
 Yeah, what is consciousness.

1:58:03.320 --> 1:58:09.320
 And I don't think it's an epiphenomenological afterthought.

1:58:09.320 --> 1:58:33.320
 So a lot of people, I think Dan Wagner at Harvard, a lot of folks consider it just the ass end of a process that by the time we are aware of what it is, it's just basically an integrated rendering of something that's already happened.

1:58:33.320 --> 1:58:42.320
 You know, evidently, there's a half second delay between when something happens, you know, those studies and our awareness of it.

1:58:42.320 --> 1:58:48.320
 And then that's where ideas of free will step in so you can explain away a lot of stuff.

1:58:48.320 --> 1:58:52.320
 And I think those are all important and interesting questions.

1:58:52.320 --> 1:59:05.320
 I'm of the persuasion, I mean, even, not even, but the Dawkins in the selfish gene is very thoughtful.

1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:10.320
 Actually, in a lot of, it's actually more in notes than in the text of the book.

1:59:10.320 --> 1:59:24.320
 But he's just like, it's hard for me to imagine that consciousness doesn't have some sort of important and highly adaptive function.

1:59:24.320 --> 1:59:51.320
 And what Dawkins says is he thought about it in terms of just that we can do mental simulations that one possibly extraordinary product of consciousness is to rather than find out often by adverse consequences through trying something would be to run mental simulations.

1:59:51.320 --> 1:59:56.320
 And so one possibility is that consciousness is highly adaptive.

1:59:56.320 --> 2:00:05.320
 Another possibility is Nicholas Humphrey, a British dude who wrote a book about, I think it's called Regaining Consciousness.

2:00:05.320 --> 2:00:19.320
 And he hypothesized, I think this is 1980s, maybe even earlier, that consciousness arose as a way to better predict the behavior of others in social settings.

2:00:19.320 --> 2:00:27.320
 That by knowing how I feel makes me better able to know how you may be feeling.

2:00:27.320 --> 2:00:30.320
 This is like the rudiments of a theory of mind.

2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:39.320
 And it really may not have had anything to do with intelligence so much as social intelligence.

2:00:39.320 --> 2:00:49.320
 So in that sense, consciousness is a social construct, it's just a useful thing for interacting with other humans.

2:00:49.320 --> 2:01:00.320
 I don't know, but there seems to be something about realising your own mortality that somehow intricately connected to the idea of consciousness.

2:01:00.320 --> 2:01:01.320
 Well, I think so also.

2:01:01.320 --> 2:01:11.320
 So this is where, and Nietzsche, he said a solitary creature would not need consciousness.

2:01:11.320 --> 2:01:12.320
 What do you think?

2:01:12.320 --> 2:01:15.320
 Well, I don't know what I think about that.

2:01:15.320 --> 2:01:22.320
 But what I do, and then he goes on to say that consciousness is the most calamitous stupidity by which we shall someday perish.

2:01:22.320 --> 2:01:25.320
 And wow, I was like, dude, I was all right.

2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:26.320
 Relax.

2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:28.320
 Relax.

2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:40.320
 But so say you were on an island alone and you saw a reflection of yourself in the water, like if you were alone your whole life.

2:01:40.320 --> 2:01:42.320
 Yeah, great question.

2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:49.320
 His view, Nietzsche's view would be that your thoughts of yourself would never come to mind.

2:01:49.320 --> 2:01:52.320
 I don't know how I feel about that though.

2:01:52.320 --> 2:02:01.320
 In a sense, this sounds weird, but in a sense, I feel like my mental conversation has always been with death.

2:02:01.320 --> 2:02:12.320
 It's almost like another, you know, another notion, like, you know, there's these visualisations of a death and a cloak.

2:02:12.320 --> 2:02:22.320
 Like, I always felt like I am a living thing and then there's an other thing that is the end of me.

2:02:22.320 --> 2:02:24.320
 And I'm having like a conversation with that.

2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:39.320
 So in a sense, that's the way I construct my, the fact that I am a thing is because there's somebody else that tells me, well, you won't be a thing eventually.

2:02:39.320 --> 2:02:40.320
 Wow.

2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:51.320
 It feels like a conversation, perhaps, but that's, that might be kind of this mental simulation kind of idea that you're, you're kind of, it's not really, it's a conversation with yourself essentially.

2:02:51.320 --> 2:02:52.320
 Sure.

2:02:52.320 --> 2:02:53.320
 Yeah.

2:02:53.320 --> 2:03:02.320
 But yeah, I don't know how I feel about that, but I tend to be in agreement with you when we're talking about economics more.

2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:12.320
 So that, that we're deeply social beings, like everything, the way it just feels like we're humans.

2:03:12.320 --> 2:03:16.320
 I'm with the Harari, with the Syrians.

2:03:16.320 --> 2:03:17.320
 Yeah.

2:03:17.320 --> 2:03:23.320
 We're kind of, we seem to construct ideas on top of each other and that's a fundamentally a social process.

2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:24.320
 Absolutely.

2:03:24.320 --> 2:03:26.320
 I think that's a fine book.

2:03:26.320 --> 2:03:38.320
 It overlaps considerably with our take on these matters and the fact that we get to these points, drawing on different sources, I think, makes me more confident.

2:03:38.320 --> 2:03:40.320
 It's so, it's so fascinating.

2:03:40.320 --> 2:03:51.320
 Just like reading your book, I'm sorry, on a small tangent, that Sapiens is like one of the most popular books in the world.

2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:52.320
 Like.

2:03:52.320 --> 2:03:53.320
 Yeah.

2:03:53.320 --> 2:04:02.320
 And it's reading your book is like, well, this sounds, I mean, like, I don't know, I don't know what makes a popular book.

2:04:02.320 --> 2:04:03.320
 Yeah.

2:04:03.320 --> 2:04:19.320
 Well, if you want me to be petty and stupid, I will tell you that from time to time, we also wonder why our book, you know, like all books, people can take issue with it.

2:04:19.320 --> 2:04:24.320
 But we thought it would be a bigger hit that we'd be more widely read on that.

2:04:24.320 --> 2:04:34.320
 It's funny because I have, I don't know if I have good examples that I forgot already, but I'm often saddened by like Franz Kafka.

2:04:34.320 --> 2:04:36.320
 I think he wasn't known in his life.

2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:37.320
 Yeah.

2:04:37.320 --> 2:04:47.320
 But I always wonder like these great, like some of the greatest books ever written are completely unknown during the other's lifetime.

2:04:47.320 --> 2:04:53.320
 And it's like, man, for some reason that it's again, it's that identity thing.

2:04:53.320 --> 2:04:55.320
 I think, man, that sucks.

2:04:55.320 --> 2:04:57.320
 Well, I'm comforted by that.

2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:12.320
 So Van Gogh sold one painting in his life and evidently Thoreau sold like 75 copies of Walden Nietzsche's books did not sell well.

2:05:12.320 --> 2:05:14.320
 And how did Ernest Becker sell?

2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:25.320
 He is the, his books are published by the Free Press and have sold more than any other books that they have published.

2:05:25.320 --> 2:05:26.320
 So what does that mean?

2:05:26.320 --> 2:05:27.320
 That's a lot.

2:05:27.320 --> 2:05:32.320
 I don't know if it's like Jordan Peterson Millions, but it's hundreds of thousands.

2:05:32.320 --> 2:05:33.320
 Was he respected?

2:05:33.320 --> 2:05:36.320
 I just don't see him.

2:05:36.320 --> 2:05:37.320
 Okay.

2:05:37.320 --> 2:05:38.320
 Yeah.

2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:44.320
 I don't see him brought up as like in the top 10 philosophers of.

2:05:44.320 --> 2:05:45.320
 No, not at all.

2:05:45.320 --> 2:05:50.320
 So how far away is he in the top 100 for people?

2:05:50.320 --> 2:05:51.320
 I don't think so.

2:05:51.320 --> 2:05:53.320
 Like he doesn't, he's not brought up that often.

2:05:53.320 --> 2:05:54.320
 Because again.

2:05:54.320 --> 2:05:56.320
 Like your work is brought up more often.

2:05:56.320 --> 2:05:57.320
 Yeah.

2:05:57.320 --> 2:06:03.320
 Like because I think he got, yeah, I mean, I think he's one of the great philosophers of the 20th century.

2:06:03.320 --> 2:06:21.320
 So what we say, Lex, is that our goal, certainly when we first started and now just as much actually, but what I say at all my talks is, look, if these ideas have interest you enough to go read Ernest Becker, then this has been good.

2:06:21.320 --> 2:06:32.320
 I consider him to be one of the most important voices of the 20th century who does not get the attention that he deserves.

2:06:32.320 --> 2:06:33.320
 All right.

2:06:33.320 --> 2:06:45.320
 Similarly, our work, I believe to be important, because point by point, we provide empirical corroboration for all of the claims.

2:06:45.320 --> 2:07:00.320
 If, you know, when that, so that's literally the students that read the denial of death and then escape from evil, they're like, yeah, wow, every chapter of the book, you have studies.

2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:06.320
 And I'm like, yeah, because for 40 years, if a Skidmore student said, oh, that's gotta be bullshit.

2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:09.320
 I'm like, well, let's do a study.

2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:10.320
 Let's do a study.

2:07:10.320 --> 2:07:18.320
 In my own dreams are in creating robots and artificial intelligence systems that a human can love.

2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:28.320
 And I think there's something about mortality and fear mortality that is essential for implementing in our AI systems.

2:07:28.320 --> 2:07:29.320
 Yeah.

2:07:29.320 --> 2:07:32.320
 And so maybe can you comment on that?

2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:33.320
 Well.

2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:39.320
 So this is a different perspective on your work.

2:07:39.320 --> 2:07:40.320
 Sure.

2:07:40.320 --> 2:07:42.320
 Which is like, how do we engineer a human?

2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:43.320
 Yeah.

2:07:43.320 --> 2:07:44.320
 So, no, this is awesome, Lex.

2:07:44.320 --> 2:07:46.320
 I'm delighted that you said that.

2:07:46.320 --> 2:07:58.320
 First of all, and I may mention this to you, and I don't, I can't remember because I'm seeing how, when you first contacted me, I had just been told I have to learn more about your work.

2:07:58.320 --> 2:08:05.320
 Because I'm working with some very talented people in New York.

2:08:05.320 --> 2:08:15.320
 And they're, they're writing a screenplay for a movie about an artificial intelligence.

2:08:15.320 --> 2:08:21.320
 It's a female AI and sat in like 30 years in the future.

2:08:21.320 --> 2:08:28.320
 And basically the little twist, this is how I had to read Heidegger.

2:08:28.320 --> 2:08:32.320
 So these people call me and they're like, we're making a movie.

2:08:32.320 --> 2:08:41.320
 It's based on Becker and your work and Heidegger and this other philosopher, Levinas.

2:08:41.320 --> 2:08:46.320
 And then another philosopher, Sylvia Benzo, who's an Italian philosopher.

2:08:46.320 --> 2:09:03.320
 And the long short story is the movie is about supposedly the most advanced artificial intelligence entity, an embodied one, and who?

2:09:03.320 --> 2:09:04.320
 Human form?

2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:15.320
 Human form, who finds out, who is having, having essentially existential anxieties.

2:09:15.320 --> 2:09:20.320
 And the, I think the project is called a dinner with her or something.

2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:32.320
 And it doesn't really matter, but the punchline is that she finds out that her creator has made her mortal.

2:09:32.320 --> 2:09:50.320
 And so the question is what happens phenomenologically and behaviorally to an, an artificial intelligence who now knows that it's mortal.

2:09:50.320 --> 2:09:54.320
 And it's actually the same question that you're posing.

2:09:54.320 --> 2:09:55.320
 Yeah.

2:09:55.320 --> 2:10:05.320
 And that is, is that necessary in order for an AI to approximate humanity?

2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:06.320
 Yeah, I think, yeah.

2:10:06.320 --> 2:10:16.320
 So the intuition again, it's, it's unknown, but I think it's absolutely, I think it's absolutely necessary.

2:10:16.320 --> 2:10:28.320
 And a lot of people, the same kind of shallow thinking that people have about our own end of life, our own death is the same way people think of, I think about artificial intelligence.

2:10:28.320 --> 2:10:29.320
 It's like, well, okay.

2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:38.320
 So yeah, so within the system, there's a, there's a terminal position where like, there's, there's a, there's a point which it ends.

2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:40.320
 You just, the program ends.

2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:41.320
 There's a goal state.

2:10:41.320 --> 2:10:43.320
 There's a, you reach the end point.

2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:52.320
 But the thing is making that end a thing that's also within the program.

2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:53.320
 Exactly.

2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:58.320
 Like, like the making the thing, like, and then it's also the mystery of it.

2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:02.320
 So the thing is, we don't know what the hell this death thing is.

2:11:02.320 --> 2:11:11.320
 I mean, it's not like, it's not like we, I mean, the program doesn't give us information about the meaning of it all.

2:11:11.320 --> 2:11:12.320
 Exactly.

2:11:12.320 --> 2:11:14.320
 That's where the terror is.

2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:27.320
 And it feels like, I mean, in the language that you would think about is, is the terror of this death or like anticipation of it or thinking about it is the creative force that builds everything.

2:11:27.320 --> 2:11:28.320
 Right.

2:11:28.320 --> 2:11:34.320
 And that feels like, you know, that feels really important to implement.

2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:50.320
 Again, very difficult to know how to do technically currently, but it's important to think about what I find is mentioned like screenplays and so on is sci fi folks and philosophers are the only ones thinking about it currently.

2:11:50.320 --> 2:11:53.320
 And that's what these folks have convinced me.

2:11:53.320 --> 2:11:54.320
 Yeah.

2:11:54.320 --> 2:11:55.320
 And engineers aren't.

2:11:55.320 --> 2:12:06.320
 Which is, I get, yeah, most of the most, most of the things I talk about, I get kind of people roll their eyes from the engineer.

2:12:06.320 --> 2:12:12.320
 Not these folks that they're like, because like, again, I saw your name and they're like, wait a minute, I've just seen that.

2:12:12.320 --> 2:12:16.320
 They're like, here's someone you should check out.

2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:17.320
 Yeah.

2:12:17.320 --> 2:12:20.320
 So this was a delightful conflict.

2:12:20.320 --> 2:12:31.320
 Yeah, I was a huge fan of your work and Ernest Becker and it's funny that not enough people are talking about it.

2:12:31.320 --> 2:12:33.320
 Yeah, I don't know what to do with that.

2:12:33.320 --> 2:12:40.320
 I think that there's a possibility to create real deep meaningful connections between AI systems and humans.

2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:41.320
 Absolutely.

2:12:41.320 --> 2:12:49.320
 And I think some of these things of fear of mortality are essential for the element of human experience.

2:12:49.320 --> 2:13:01.320
 I don't think it might be essential to create general intelligence, like very intelligent machines, but to create a machine that connects to a human in some deep way.

2:13:01.320 --> 2:13:19.320
 What's your view, not to make me the interviewer, but what's your view about machine ethics? Can you imagine an ethical AI without some semblance of finitude, let's say?

2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:30.320
 Well, I think ethics is, you know, there's a trolley problem that's often used in the work that I've done at MIT.

2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:33.320
 Yeah, with the Thomas vehicles in particular.

2:13:33.320 --> 2:13:34.320
 Oh, yeah, yeah.

2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:47.320
 That people, I think they all flow, they ask, like, how would a machine deal with an ethical situation that they themselves, humans don't know how to deal with?

2:13:47.320 --> 2:13:48.320
 Exactly.

2:13:48.320 --> 2:14:01.320
 So I don't know if a machine is able to do a better job on that on difficult ethical questions, but I certainly think to behave properly and effectively in this world.

2:14:01.320 --> 2:14:10.320
 It needs to be have a fear of mortality and like be able to even dance because I don't think you can solve ethical problems.

2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:18.320
 But you have to, I think like ethics is like a dance for, you have to just, you have to dance properly with the rest of the humans.

2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:21.320
 Like if people dance in tango, you have to dance in the same kind of way.

2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:25.320
 And for that, you have to have a fear of mortality.

2:14:25.320 --> 2:14:37.320
 Like I think of more practically speaking, as I said, autonomous vehicles, like the way you interact with pedestrians fundamentally has to have a sense of mortality.

2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:49.320
 So when pedestrians cross the road, now I've watched most certainly 100 plus hours of pedestrian videos.

2:14:49.320 --> 2:15:00.320
 There's a kind of social contract where you walk in front of a car and you're putting your life in the hands of another human being.

2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:01.320
 Yes, that's right.

2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:08.320
 And like death is in the car, in the game that's being played, death is right there.

2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:14.320
 It's part of the calculus, it's not, but it's not like a simple calculus, not a simple equation.

2:15:14.320 --> 2:15:24.320
 I mean, I don't know what it is, but it's in there and it has to be part of the optimization problem.

2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:38.320
 Like it's not as simple as, so from the computer vision, from the artificial intelligence perspective, it's detecting there's a human estimating, estimating the trajectory, like treating everything like it's a billiard balls.

2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:52.320
 As opposed to like being able to construct an effective model, the world model of what the person is thinking, what they're going to do, what are the different possibilities of how the scene might evolve.

2:15:52.320 --> 2:16:00.320
 I think requires having some sense of, yeah, fear of mortality, of mortality.

2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:13.320
 I don't, see the thing is, I think it's really important to think about, I can be honest enough to say that it's, I haven't been able to figure out how to engineer any of these things.

2:16:13.320 --> 2:16:14.320
 Right.

2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:16.320
 But I do think it's really, really important.

2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:27.320
 Like I have, so I have a bunch of Roombas here, I can show it to you after, that Roombas is a robot that does vacuums, the floor.

2:16:27.320 --> 2:16:33.320
 And I've had them make different sounds, like I had them scream in pain.

2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:40.320
 And it, it, it, you amelie anthropomorphize.

2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:41.320
 Absolutely.

2:16:41.320 --> 2:16:47.320
 And it creates a, I don't know, knowing that they can feel pain.

2:16:47.320 --> 2:16:56.320
 See, I'm speaking like knowing that I immediately imagine that they can feel pain and it immediately draws me closer to them.

2:16:56.320 --> 2:16:57.320
 Yes.

2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:05.320
 At the human experience and that there's, there's something in that that should be engineered in our, in our systems, it feels like.

2:17:05.320 --> 2:17:14.320
 I, I believe personally, I don't know what you think, but I believe it's possible for a robot and a human to fall in love, for example, in the, in the future.

2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:17.320
 Oh, I think it's, yeah, it's already there.

2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:21.320
 Well, there's a certain kind of deep connection with technology.

2:17:21.320 --> 2:17:22.320
 Yeah.

2:17:22.320 --> 2:17:25.320
 I mean, a real, like you would choose to marry.

2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:41.320
 I mean, again, it sounds, I'll find a book title and I'll send it to you and it's a serious consideration of people who started out with these sex dolls.

2:17:41.320 --> 2:17:52.320
 But it turned into a relationship of enduring significance that the woman who wrote the book is not willing to dismiss as a perversion.

2:17:52.320 --> 2:17:53.320
 Yeah.

2:17:53.320 --> 2:17:57.320
 You know, people kind of joke about sex robots, which is funny.

2:17:57.320 --> 2:18:01.320
 Like, it's a, it's a funny, I mean, there's a lot of stuff about robots.

2:18:01.320 --> 2:18:06.320
 It's just kind of fun to talk about that is not necessarily connected to reality.

2:18:06.320 --> 2:18:08.320
 People joke about sex robots.

2:18:08.320 --> 2:18:17.320
 But if you actually look how sex robots, which are pretty rare these days are used, they're not used by people who want sex.

2:18:17.320 --> 2:18:18.320
 Precisely.

2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:19.320
 They're actually.

2:18:19.320 --> 2:18:20.320
 They're companions.

2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:21.320
 They're companions.

2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:22.320
 They become companions.

2:18:22.320 --> 2:18:23.320
 Yeah.

2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:26.320
 Maybe it's, yeah, it's fascinating.

2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:29.320
 And they're just, we're not even talking about any kind of intelligence.

2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:33.320
 We're talking about just, I mean, human beings seek companionships.

2:18:33.320 --> 2:18:34.320
 We're deeply lonely.

2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:38.320
 I mean, that was the other sense I have that I don't know if I can articulate clearly.

2:18:38.320 --> 2:18:44.320
 You can probably do a better job, but I have a sense that there's a deep loneliness within all of us.

2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:45.320
 Absolutely.

2:18:45.320 --> 2:18:48.320
 In the face of death, it feels like we're alone.

2:18:48.320 --> 2:19:01.320
 So, you know, the, what drew me to the existential take on things, Lex, was the, who is it?

2:19:01.320 --> 2:19:13.320
 Ralo May and Erwin Yalam write about existentialism and they're like, look, what, there's different flavors of existentialism,

2:19:13.320 --> 2:19:15.320
 but they all have in common.

2:19:15.320 --> 2:19:18.320
 What is it for universal concerns?

2:19:18.320 --> 2:19:28.320
 The overriding one is about death and that next is choice and responsibility.

2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:31.320
 The next one is existential isolation.

2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:39.320
 And they're like, that's one of the things about consciousness that, and the last one is meaninglessness.

2:19:39.320 --> 2:19:59.320
 But the existential isolation point is, you know, we are by virtue of consciousness able to apprehend the, unless you're a Siamese twin, you are fundamentally alone.

2:19:59.320 --> 2:20:07.320
 And because it is claimed, it's Eric from, in a book called Escape from Freedom.

2:20:07.320 --> 2:20:17.320
 He's like, look, you, you're smart enough to know that the most direct way that we typically communicate with our fellow human beings is through language.

2:20:17.320 --> 2:20:29.320
 But you also know that language is a pale shadow of the totality of our interior phenomenological existence.

2:20:29.320 --> 2:20:41.320
 Therefore, there's always going to be times in our lives where even under the best of circumstances, you could be trying desperately to convey your thoughts and feelings.

2:20:41.320 --> 2:20:46.320
 And somebody listening could be like, yeah, I get it, I get it, I get it.

2:20:46.320 --> 2:20:50.320
 And you're like, you have no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

2:20:50.320 --> 2:21:02.320
 So you can be desperately lonely in a house where you live with 10 people in the middle of Tokyo where there's millions.

2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:04.320
 Yeah, yeah, it's the great Gaspi.

2:21:04.320 --> 2:21:05.320
 Yeah, precisely.

2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:06.320
 It could be alone in a big party, yeah.

2:21:06.320 --> 2:21:07.320
 Exactly.

2:21:07.320 --> 2:21:17.320
 Maybe this is a small tangent, but let me ask you, on the topic of academia, you're kind of a, we talked about Jordan Peterson.

2:21:17.320 --> 2:21:27.320
 There's a lot of sort of renegade type of thinkers, certainly in psychology, but it applies in all disciplines.

2:21:27.320 --> 2:21:36.320
 What are your thoughts about academia being a place to harbor people like yourself?

2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:48.320
 That, you know, people who think deeply about things who are not constrained by sort of the, I don't think you're quite controversial.

2:21:48.320 --> 2:21:49.320
 No, not really.

2:21:49.320 --> 2:21:53.320
 But you are a person who thinks deeply about things.

2:21:53.320 --> 2:21:58.320
 And it feels like academia can sometimes stifle that.

2:21:58.320 --> 2:21:59.320
 I think so.

2:21:59.320 --> 2:22:27.320
 So my concern right now, Lex, for young scholars is that the restrictions and expectations are such that it's highly unlikely that anybody will do anything of great value or innovation except for, and this is not a bad thing,

2:22:27.320 --> 2:22:32.320
 but stepwise improvement of existing paradigms.

2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:42.320
 So the, you know, in simple English, you know, I went to Princeton for a job interview 40 years ago and they're like, what are you going to do if we give you a job?

2:22:42.320 --> 2:22:43.320
 And I'm like, I don't know.

2:22:43.320 --> 2:22:46.320
 I want to think about it and read.

2:22:46.320 --> 2:23:00.320
 And I saw that that interview was over, the window of opportunity shut in my face and they actually called my mentors and they're like, what are you doing?

2:23:00.320 --> 2:23:02.320
 Tell this guy to buy some pants.

2:23:02.320 --> 2:23:03.320
 I had hair down in my waist also.

2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:06.320
 He's like, this guy looks like Charles Manson and Jesus.

2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:19.320
 The expectation is that you come to a post, you know, you start publishing so that you can get grants.

2:23:19.320 --> 2:23:21.320
 That's certainly true.

2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:24.320
 But there's also kind of a behavioral thing you said, like long hair.

2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:28.320
 There's a certain style of the way you're supposed to behave.

2:23:28.320 --> 2:23:31.320
 For example, like I'm wearing a suit.

2:23:31.320 --> 2:23:35.320
 It sounds weird, but I feel comfortable in this.

2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:38.320
 You know, I wore it like when I was teaching at MIT.

2:23:38.320 --> 2:23:44.320
 I wore it to meetings and so on at different, sometimes a blue and red tie.

2:23:44.320 --> 2:23:49.320
 But like that was an outsider thing to do at MIT.

2:23:49.320 --> 2:23:52.320
 So like there was a strong pressure to not wear a suit.

2:23:52.320 --> 2:23:53.320
 No, that's right.

2:23:53.320 --> 2:23:56.320
 And there's a pressure to behave, to have a hair thing.

2:23:56.320 --> 2:23:57.320
 No, that's right.

2:23:57.320 --> 2:24:02.320
 The way you wear your hair, the way you, this isn't like a liberal or left.

2:24:02.320 --> 2:24:12.320
 It's just the tribes and academia to me or a place, any place that dreams of having like renegade free thinkers,

2:24:12.320 --> 2:24:19.320
 like really deep thinkers should in fact like glorify the outsider, right?

2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:20.320
 Yeah.

2:24:20.320 --> 2:24:25.320
 Should welcome just, should welcome, you know, people that don't fit in.

2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:26.320
 Yeah.

2:24:26.320 --> 2:24:28.320
 No, that sounds weird, but I don't know.

2:24:28.320 --> 2:24:40.320
 I can just imagine an interview with Princeton, you know, I can imagine why aren't people, why aren't you at Harvard, for example, or MIT?

2:24:40.320 --> 2:24:41.320
 Yeah.

2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:49.320
 Well, so that, look, I would love to, you know, I, I haven't lectured at MIT, but I've lectured at Harvard.

2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:55.320
 I've gotten to lecture at almost every place that wouldn't consider me for a job.

2:24:55.320 --> 2:24:56.320
 Yeah.

2:24:56.320 --> 2:25:01.320
 I, well, a few things.

2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:05.320
 I'm lucky because I, you know, I go to Princeton and I'm like, I don't know what I want to do.

2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:09.320
 And then two days later, I go to Skidmore and I'm like, I don't know what I want to do.

2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:23.320
 And they offer me a job later that day, which I declined for months because of the extraordinary pressure of my mentors who right mindedly felt that I wouldn't get much done there.

2:25:23.320 --> 2:25:32.320
 And, but what they told me at Skidmore was take your time, you know, show up for your classes and don't molest barnyard animals.

2:25:32.320 --> 2:25:34.320
 And you'll probably get tenure.

2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:36.320
 And I'm like, I'll show up for my classes.

2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:37.320
 We'll talk about it.

2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:39.320
 That was, that was the negotiation.

2:25:39.320 --> 2:25:40.320
 Yeah, I negotiated.

2:25:40.320 --> 2:25:42.320
 I drove a hard bargain.

2:25:42.320 --> 2:25:52.320
 But, but honestly, Lex, that's, I feel I'm very committed to Skidmore because I was given tenure.

2:25:52.320 --> 2:25:59.320
 When our first terror management paper wasn't published, it took eight years to publish.

2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:01.320
 It was rejected at every journal.

2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:05.320
 And I submitted it as like a purple ditto sheet thing.

2:26:05.320 --> 2:26:07.320
 I'm like, here's what I've been doing.

2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:09.320
 Here's the reviews.

2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:12.320
 Here's why I think this is still a pretty good idea.

2:26:12.320 --> 2:26:21.320
 And I don't know that this would happen even at Skidmore anymore, but I was very lucky to be given the latitude and to be encouraged.

2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:23.320
 I took classes at Skidmore.

2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:25.320
 That's how I learned all this stuff.

2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:26.320
 I graduated.

2:26:26.320 --> 2:26:29.320
 I got a PhD unscathed by knowledge.

2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:38.320
 We were great statisticians and methodologists, but we didn't have any substance.

2:26:38.320 --> 2:26:44.320
 You know, and I don't mean this cynically, but we were trained in a method in search of a question.

2:26:44.320 --> 2:26:51.320
 So I appreciate having five years at Skidmore basically to read books.

2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:57.320
 And I also appreciate that I look like this 40 years ago.

2:26:57.320 --> 2:27:07.320
 And my view is that this is how I comported myself.

2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:15.320
 Other people, the guy I learned the most from at Skidmore is now dead, a history professor, Ted Carota.

2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:17.320
 He wore a bow tie.

2:27:17.320 --> 2:27:21.320
 And there's another guy, Darnell Rocker, who taught me about philosophy.

2:27:21.320 --> 2:27:30.320
 And he was very proper and he had like his jacket with like the leather patches.

2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:33.320
 But these guys weren't pompous at all.

2:27:33.320 --> 2:27:37.320
 They were, this is the way I am.

2:27:37.320 --> 2:27:46.320
 And I always felt that that's important that somebody who looks at you and says, oh, what a stiff.

2:27:46.320 --> 2:27:48.320
 He's probably an MBA.

2:27:48.320 --> 2:27:49.320
 Well, they're wrong.

2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:59.320
 And someone who looks at me, when I first got to Skidmore, other professors would ask when I'd be coming to their office to empty the garbage.

2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:04.320
 They just assumed, you know, as in my 20s, they assumed I was housekeeping.

2:28:04.320 --> 2:28:14.320
 I always felt that was important that the students learn not to judge an idea by the appearance of the person who pervades it.

2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:25.320
 Yeah, I mean, that's, I guess this is such a high concern now because I personally still have faith that academia is where the great geniuses will come from.

2:28:25.320 --> 2:28:26.320
 I do too.

2:28:26.320 --> 2:28:27.320
 And great ideas.

2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:29.320
 I love hearing you say that.

2:28:29.320 --> 2:28:41.320
 I still, and it's one of the reasons why I'm really apprehensive about the future of education right now in the context of the pandemic.

2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:51.320
 Is that a lot of folks, and a lot of these are Google type people who I don't, you know, they're geniuses also.

2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:58.320
 But I don't like this idea that all learning can be virtual and that much could happen.

2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:03.320
 I'm big on embodied environments with actual humans interacting.

2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:16.320
 There's so much to the university education, but I think the key part is the mentorship that occurs somehow at the human level.

2:29:16.320 --> 2:29:21.320
 Like I've gotten a lot of flack, like this conversation, we're in person now.

2:29:21.320 --> 2:29:32.320
 And I've, even with Edward Snowden, who done all interviews remote, I'm a stickler to in person.

2:29:32.320 --> 2:29:34.320
 It has to be in person.

2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:36.320
 And a lot of people just don't get it.

2:29:36.320 --> 2:29:39.320
 They're like, well, why can't this is so much easier?

2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:41.320
 Why go through the pain?

2:29:41.320 --> 2:29:51.320
 I've traveled, I'm traveling in the next month to Paris for a single stupid conversation nobody cares about just to be in person.

2:29:51.320 --> 2:29:53.320
 Well, it's important to me.

2:29:53.320 --> 2:29:58.320
 Honestly, I was like this.

2:29:58.320 --> 2:30:00.320
 And thank you for coming down today.

2:30:00.320 --> 2:30:01.320
 Oh, it's my pleasure.

2:30:01.320 --> 2:30:03.320
 But again, it's very self serving.

2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:04.320
 I've enjoyed this.

2:30:04.320 --> 2:30:09.320
 I knew I was going to, but it's not about our enjoyment per se.

2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:25.320
 Again, at the risk of sounding cavalier, there are a host of factors beyond verbal that I don't believe can be adequately captured.

2:30:25.320 --> 2:30:30.320
 I don't care how much the acuity is decent on a Zoom conversation.

2:30:30.320 --> 2:30:45.320
 I feel again, I felt within five minutes that this was going to be for me easy in the sense that I could speak freely.

2:30:45.320 --> 2:30:50.320
 I just don't see that happening so easily from a distance.

2:30:50.320 --> 2:31:01.320
 Yeah, I tend to, well, I'm hopeful, I agree with you on the current technology, but I am hopeful unlike some others on the technology eventually being able to create that kind of experience.

2:31:01.320 --> 2:31:04.320
 Oh, I think it's or quite far away from that.

2:31:04.320 --> 2:31:05.320
 But yeah, it might be.

2:31:05.320 --> 2:31:09.320
 My hope is, you know, I'm hopeful.

2:31:09.320 --> 2:31:14.320
 I was at Microsoft in Seattle and I can't remember why.

2:31:14.320 --> 2:31:33.320
 And no, I can't, that's how I'm in my early Mr. McGoo phase and somebody there was showing us like a virtual wall where the entire wall, you know, when you're talking to somebody.

2:31:33.320 --> 2:31:41.320
 So it's life size and they were beginning to get the appearance of motion and stuff.

2:31:41.320 --> 2:31:42.320
 It looked pretty.

2:31:42.320 --> 2:31:44.320
 Yeah, with virtual reality.

2:31:44.320 --> 2:31:46.320
 I don't know if you've ever been inside a virtual world.

2:31:46.320 --> 2:31:47.320
 Yeah.

2:31:47.320 --> 2:31:51.320
 It's, to me, it's, I can just, I can see the future.

2:31:51.320 --> 2:31:54.320
 It's, it's, it's quite real.

2:31:54.320 --> 2:31:55.320
 Yeah.

2:31:55.320 --> 2:31:58.320
 In terms of like a terror of death, I'm afraid of heights.

2:31:58.320 --> 2:31:59.320
 Me too.

2:31:59.320 --> 2:32:06.320
 And there's, I don't know if you've ever tried, you should if you haven't, there's a virtual reality experience where you can walk a plank.

2:32:06.320 --> 2:32:07.320
 Yeah.

2:32:07.320 --> 2:32:14.320
 And you can look down and man, I was on the ground like, I was like, I was afraid.

2:32:14.320 --> 2:32:15.320
 I was deeply afraid.

2:32:15.320 --> 2:32:21.320
 I was, it was, it was as real as, as anything else could be.

2:32:21.320 --> 2:32:25.320
 And I mean, these are very early days of that technology, relatively speaking.

2:32:25.320 --> 2:32:30.320
 So yeah, I mean, I don't know what to do with that.

2:32:30.320 --> 2:32:36.320
 Same with like crossing the street, we did these experiments across the street in front of a car.

2:32:36.320 --> 2:32:40.320
 And, you know, it's being run over by a car.

2:32:40.320 --> 2:32:42.320
 It's terrifying.

2:32:42.320 --> 2:32:43.320
 Yeah.

2:32:43.320 --> 2:32:44.320
 It's just that.

2:32:44.320 --> 2:32:45.320
 Yeah.

2:32:45.320 --> 2:32:48.320
 So there is a rich experience to be created there.

2:32:48.320 --> 2:32:52.320
 We're not there yet, but yeah.

2:32:52.320 --> 2:33:00.320
 And I've seen a lot of people try, like you said, the Google folks, Silicon Valley folks try to create a virtual online education.

2:33:00.320 --> 2:33:01.320
 I don't know.

2:33:01.320 --> 2:33:03.320
 I think they've raised really important questions.

2:33:03.320 --> 2:33:04.320
 Absolutely.

2:33:04.320 --> 2:33:10.320
 Like what makes the education experience fulfilling?

2:33:10.320 --> 2:33:12.320
 What makes it effective?

2:33:12.320 --> 2:33:13.320
 Yeah.

2:33:13.320 --> 2:33:14.320
 These are important questions.

2:33:14.320 --> 2:33:18.320
 And I think what they highlight is we have no clue.

2:33:18.320 --> 2:33:30.320
 Like there's a Thomas Sowell wrote a book about recent book on charter schools.

2:33:30.320 --> 2:33:31.320
 Yeah.

2:33:31.320 --> 2:33:32.320
 I would like to talk to him.

2:33:32.320 --> 2:33:34.320
 Yeah, he's an interesting guy.

2:33:34.320 --> 2:33:37.320
 We will disagree about a lot, but respectfully.

2:33:37.320 --> 2:33:38.320
 Yeah.

2:33:38.320 --> 2:33:39.320
 Such a powerful mind.

2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:40.320
 Yeah.

2:33:40.320 --> 2:33:42.320
 But I need to read.

2:33:42.320 --> 2:33:55.320
 I've only heard him talk about the book, but he argues quite seemingly effectively that the public education system is broken.

2:33:55.320 --> 2:34:11.320
 That we blame, they basically says that we kind of blame like the conditions or the environment, but the upbringing of people like parents and blah, blah, blah, like the set of opportunities.

2:34:11.320 --> 2:34:22.320
 But okay, putting that aside, it seems like charter schools, no matter who it is that attends them, does much better than in public schools.

2:34:22.320 --> 2:34:25.320
 And he puts a bunch of data behind it.

2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:31.320
 And in his usual way, as you know, just is very eloquent in arguing his points.

2:34:31.320 --> 2:34:32.320
 Yeah.

2:34:32.320 --> 2:34:40.320
 So that to me just highlights, man, we don't, education is like one of the most important, the, it's probably the most important thing in our civilization.

2:34:40.320 --> 2:34:42.320
 And we're doing a shitty job of it.

2:34:42.320 --> 2:34:43.320
 Yeah.

2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:53.320
 In academia, in, in university education and, you know, younger education, the whole thing.

2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:54.320
 The whole thing.

2:34:54.320 --> 2:35:05.320
 And yet we value just about anyone or anything more than educators.

2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:15.320
 You know, part of it is just the relatively low regard that Americans have for teachers for teachers.

2:35:15.320 --> 2:35:26.320
 Also similarly, like just people, people of service, I think great teachers are the greatest thing in our society.

2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:35.320
 And I would say now in a controversial note, like Black Lives Matter, you know, great police officers is the greatest thing in our society.

2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:44.320
 Also, like all people that do service, we undervalue cops, severe, like this whole defund the police is missing the point.

2:35:44.320 --> 2:35:46.320
 And it's a stupid word.

2:35:46.320 --> 2:35:48.320
 I'm with you on that.

2:35:48.320 --> 2:35:59.320
 Our neighbors to one side of our house or three generations of police or neighbors across the street are police.

2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:07.320
 They know my, you know, political predilections.

2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:16.320
 And we've gotten along fine for 30 years and I go out and tell them every day, you know, when you go in today.

2:36:16.320 --> 2:36:24.320
 You tell the people on the force that I appreciate what they're doing.

2:36:24.320 --> 2:36:33.320
 I think it's really important to not tribalize those concerns.

2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:47.320
 I mean, we mentioned so many brilliant books and philosophers, but it'd be nice to sort of in a focused way try to see if we can get some recommendations from you.

2:36:47.320 --> 2:36:59.320
 So what three books, technical or fiction or philosophical, had a big impact in your life and you would recommend.

2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:03.320
 Four hours driving here, perseverating about that.

2:37:03.320 --> 2:37:05.320
 Everything else you sent me.

2:37:05.320 --> 2:37:06.320
 That's fine.

2:37:06.320 --> 2:37:12.320
 And I actually skimmed it and I'm like, I don't want to look at it because I want us to talk.

2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:15.320
 The ones in blue, I'm like, all right.

2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:26.320
 And, you know, I've already said that I've found Becker's work and I put the denial of death out there.

2:37:26.320 --> 2:37:29.320
 Is that his best? Sorry to run a small tangent.

2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:31.320
 Is there other books of his?

2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:46.320
 Yes, if I could have this count as one, that the birth and death of meaning, the denial of death and escape from evil are three books of Ernest Becker's that I believe to all be profound.

2:37:46.320 --> 2:37:52.320
 In a little sort of brief dance around topics.

2:37:52.320 --> 2:37:54.320
 I've only read Denial of Death.

2:37:54.320 --> 2:37:56.320
 Do those books connect in your?

2:37:56.320 --> 2:37:57.320
 Yeah, nice.

2:37:57.320 --> 2:38:06.320
 So the birth and death of meaning is where Becker situates his thinking in more of an evolutionary foundation.

2:38:06.320 --> 2:38:09.320
 So I like that for that reason.

2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:30.320
 Escape from evil is where he applies the ideas in the denial of death more directly to economic matters and to inequality and also to our inability to peacefully coexist with other folks who don't share our beliefs.

2:38:30.320 --> 2:38:36.320
 So I would put Ernest Becker out there as one.

2:38:36.320 --> 2:38:39.320
 I also like novels a lot.

2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:45.320
 And here I was like, God damn it, no matter what I say, I'm going to be like, yes.

2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:50.320
 But the existentialist, do you like all those folks, Camus?

2:38:50.320 --> 2:38:52.320
 Do you like that literary existentialism?

2:38:52.320 --> 2:38:58.320
 I do, but I mean, you know, I've read all those books.

2:38:58.320 --> 2:39:06.320
 I will tell you the last line of the plague we learn in times of pestilence that there's more to admire in men than to despise.

2:39:06.320 --> 2:39:07.320
 And I love that.

2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:12.320
 Plagues, I don't know, I find the plague is a brilliant book.

2:39:12.320 --> 2:39:13.320
 Me too.

2:39:13.320 --> 2:39:21.320
 Before the plague has come to us in 2020, it was just a book about love.

2:39:21.320 --> 2:39:33.320
 But I'll toss a one that may be less known to folks. I'm enamored with a novel by a woman named Carson McCullers, written in 1953 called Clock Without Hands.

2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:41.320
 And I find it a brilliant literary depiction of many of the ideas that we have spoken about.

2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:42.320
 Fiction?

2:39:42.320 --> 2:39:43.320
 Fiction, yeah.

2:39:43.320 --> 2:39:46.320
 What kind of ideas are we talking about?

2:39:46.320 --> 2:39:58.320
 All of the existential ideas that we have encountered today, but in the context of a story of someone who finds out that he is terminally ill.

2:39:58.320 --> 2:40:04.320
 It's set in the south in the heyday of like segregation.

2:40:04.320 --> 2:40:08.320
 So there's a lot of social issues, a lot of existential issues.

2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:33.320
 But it's basically a fictional account of someone who finds out that they're terminally ill and who reacts originally as you might expect anyone becomes more hostile to people who are different like petty and stupid denies that anything's happening.

2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:45.320
 But as the book goes on and he comes more to terms with his own mortality, it ends lovingly.

2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:53.320
 And back to your idea about love being incredibly potent.

2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:59.320
 That's the nice thing, as you mentioned before with Heidegger.

2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:11.320
 I really like that idea and I've seen that in people who are terminally ill is they bring, you know, the idea of death becomes current.

2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:12.320
 Yes.

2:41:12.320 --> 2:41:15.320
 It becomes like a thing, you know, I could die.

2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:17.320
 I really like that idea.

2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:20.320
 I can die not just tomorrow, but like now.

2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:21.320
 Now?

2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:22.320
 Now.

2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:23.320
 Yeah.

2:41:23.320 --> 2:41:27.320
 That's a really useful, I don't even know.

2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:29.320
 I think I've been too afraid to even think about that.

2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:30.320
 I have.

2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:38.320
 Like sit here and think like in five minutes, it's over.

2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:39.320
 Yeah.

2:41:39.320 --> 2:41:40.320
 This is it.

2:41:40.320 --> 2:41:42.320
 In five minutes, it's over.

2:41:42.320 --> 2:41:43.320
 Yeah.

2:41:43.320 --> 2:41:49.320
 So that would be my most recent addition as I really am struck by Heidegger.

2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:51.320
 Oh, would you recommend that?

2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:52.320
 Well, okay.

2:41:52.320 --> 2:41:53.320
 If you have a few years.

2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:57.320
 I remember I tuned out being in time and I was like, I try to read it and I was like, that's it.

2:41:57.320 --> 2:42:01.320
 So look, it took me 40 years to read Ulysses.

2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:08.320
 It could not get past the first five pages and it took me 40 years to read Being in Time.

2:42:08.320 --> 2:42:09.320
 It's a slog.

2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:10.320
 Yeah.

2:42:10.320 --> 2:42:11.320
 And.

2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:13.320
 I took a James Joyce course in college.

2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:19.320
 So I've, I even, I guess read parts of Finnegan's Wake.

2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:20.320
 No way.

2:42:20.320 --> 2:42:27.320
 But like there's a difference between reading and like, I don't think I understood anything.

2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:29.320
 I like his short stories.

2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:30.320
 Me too.

2:42:30.320 --> 2:42:31.320
 The Dead, The Dead.

2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:32.320
 Yeah.

2:42:32.320 --> 2:42:37.320
 And I like Faulkner, Absalom, Absalom is a fine book.

2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:43.320
 But would you, is there something Heidegger connected in a book you would recommend or

2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:44.320
 no?

2:42:44.320 --> 2:42:45.320
 No.

2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:46.320
 So maybe I got to abandon him.

2:42:46.320 --> 2:42:51.320
 I mean, Being in Time is awesome.

2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:55.820
 But here's an interesting thing and not to get all academicy, but you know, it's, there's

2:42:55.820 --> 2:43:02.320
 two parts to it and most of the, most philosophers are preoccupied with the first part.

2:43:02.320 --> 2:43:09.320
 It's in the second part where he gets into all the flight from death stuff and this idea

2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:14.320
 of, you know, a turning and philosophers don't like that.

2:43:14.320 --> 2:43:19.320
 And I'm like, this is where he's starting to really shine for me.

2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:20.320
 So yeah.

2:43:20.320 --> 2:43:21.320
 Yeah.

2:43:21.320 --> 2:43:22.320
 All right.

2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:23.320
 That's a beautiful set of books.

2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:34.560
 So what advice would you give to a young person today about their career, about life, about

2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:37.320
 how to survive in this world full of suffering?

2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:38.320
 Yeah.

2:43:38.320 --> 2:43:39.320
 Great.

2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:40.320
 Yeah.

2:43:40.320 --> 2:43:45.320
 My advice is to get competent advice.

2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:46.320
 That's what I tell my students.

2:43:46.320 --> 2:43:47.320
 Don't listen to me.

2:43:47.320 --> 2:43:48.320
 Yeah.

2:43:48.320 --> 2:43:49.320
 Don't listen to me.

2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:59.600
 Well, you know, I think my, my big piece of advice these days is, you know, again, it's

2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:08.440
 at the risk of sounding like a simpleton, but it's to emphasize a few things.

2:44:08.440 --> 2:44:16.320
 One is, you know, one of your questions, I think, was, you know, what's the meaning

2:44:16.320 --> 2:44:17.320
 of life?

2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:22.720
 And of course, the existentialists say life has no meaning, but it doesn't follow from

2:44:22.720 --> 2:44:26.360
 that, that it's intrinsic, that it's meaningless.

2:44:26.360 --> 2:44:32.720
 You know what, the existential point is not that life is meaningless so much as it doesn't

2:44:32.720 --> 2:44:42.240
 have one inevitable and intrinsic meaning, you know, which then opens up, you know, I

2:44:42.240 --> 2:44:48.200
 think it was Kierkegaard who said consciousness gives us the possibility of possibilities.

2:44:48.200 --> 2:44:55.600
 And but there's another lunatic, Oswald Spangler, who wrote a book called Decline of the West.

2:44:55.600 --> 2:45:01.400
 And he says that the philosopher, the German philosopher, Gerta, he says the purpose of

2:45:01.400 --> 2:45:04.280
 life is to live.

2:45:04.280 --> 2:45:07.320
 And I, that's, so that's one of my pieces of advice.

2:45:07.320 --> 2:45:11.200
 So the possibility of possibilities, it's interesting.

2:45:11.200 --> 2:45:14.440
 So what do you do with this kind of sea of possibilities?

2:45:14.440 --> 2:45:23.080
 Like, well, this is one of the, when, when young folks talk to me, especially these days,

2:45:23.080 --> 2:45:25.200
 is there swimming in the sea of possibilities?

2:45:25.200 --> 2:45:26.200
 Yeah.

2:45:26.200 --> 2:45:27.480
 Well, so this, it's great.

2:45:27.480 --> 2:45:33.440
 And so that's another existential point, which is that we yearn for freedom.

2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:40.480
 We react vigorously when we perceive that our choices have been curtailed.

2:45:40.480 --> 2:45:46.520
 And then we're paralyzed by indecision in the wake of seemingly unlimited possibilities

2:45:46.520 --> 2:45:49.760
 because we're not choking on choice.

2:45:49.760 --> 2:45:54.240
 And, and I'm not sure if this is helpful advice or not.

2:45:54.240 --> 2:46:02.640
 But what I say to folks is that the fact of the matter is, is the, you know, for most

2:46:02.640 --> 2:46:06.520
 people, choice is a first world problem.

2:46:06.520 --> 2:46:17.080
 And sometimes the best option is to do something as silly as it sounds.

2:46:17.080 --> 2:46:22.040
 And then if that doesn't work, do something else, which just sounds like my mom torturing

2:46:22.040 --> 2:46:24.280
 me when I was young.

2:46:24.280 --> 2:46:32.920
 But you know, part of the thing that I find myself singularly ill equipped is that we're

2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:40.280
 at the, I may be at the tail end of the last generation of Americans where you like picked

2:46:40.280 --> 2:46:45.920
 something and that's what you did, like I've been at a job for 40 years, where you can

2:46:45.920 --> 2:46:51.320
 expect to do better than your parents because those days are gone.

2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:59.160
 And where you can make a comfortable inference that the world in a decade or two will have

2:46:59.160 --> 2:47:05.300
 any remote similarity to the one that we now inhabit.

2:47:05.300 --> 2:47:10.120
 And so, but still, you recommend just do, yeah.

2:47:10.120 --> 2:47:19.000
 And to do so, again, I'm, this is, I'm so back to the Heidegger guy because all right,

2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:24.680
 I may, you know, I consider myself a professor, but what happens if most of the schools go

2:47:24.680 --> 2:47:26.400
 out of business?

2:47:26.400 --> 2:47:34.480
 Somebody else may consider themselves a restaurateur, but what happens if there's no more restaurants?

2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:42.880
 So what I, this is negative advice, but I tell folks, don't define yourself as a social

2:47:42.880 --> 2:47:43.880
 caricature.

2:47:43.880 --> 2:47:58.880
 Yeah, don't limit how you feel about yourself by, through identification with a host of

2:47:58.880 --> 2:48:03.440
 variables that may be uncertain.

2:48:03.440 --> 2:48:04.440
 Maybe temporary.

2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:05.440
 And temporary.

2:48:05.440 --> 2:48:10.680
 What, no, but of course, that gets back to your point earlier, Lex, where you're like,

2:48:10.680 --> 2:48:17.960
 yeah, but when you step out of that, it's extraordinarily discombobulating.

2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:27.640
 So what, I think you talked about an ax of chopping wood and soul from Socrates.

2:48:27.640 --> 2:48:30.960
 What is your soul?

2:48:30.960 --> 2:48:35.680
 What is the essence of Sheldon?

2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:36.680
 Wow.

2:48:36.680 --> 2:48:39.600
 That was like awesome.

2:48:39.600 --> 2:48:44.600
 Like when God, when you show up at the end of this thing and he kind of looks at you,

2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:46.080
 he's like, oh yeah.

2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:47.080
 Yeah.

2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:48.320
 I remember you.

2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:49.320
 Yeah.

2:48:49.320 --> 2:49:05.080
 Well, you know, to be honest, what I muse about is to me, when people are, I told you

2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:17.400
 we have two kids, late 20s, early 30s, and over the years, when we meet people that know

2:49:17.400 --> 2:49:23.960
 our kids and they're like, oh, your kids are kind and decent.

2:49:23.960 --> 2:49:31.320
 And I'd be like, that's what I would like to be because I think intelligence is vastly

2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:32.320
 overrated.

2:49:32.320 --> 2:49:34.920
 You know, the unabomber was a smart guy.

2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:38.920
 And I do admire intelligence and I do venerate education.

2:49:38.920 --> 2:49:46.000
 And I find that to be tremendously important.

2:49:46.000 --> 2:49:53.840
 But if I had to pay the ultimate homage to myself, it would be to be known as somebody

2:49:53.840 --> 2:49:58.440
 who takes himself too seriously to take myself too seriously.

2:49:58.440 --> 2:50:06.920
 Again, as corny as it sounds, I'd like to leave the world a tad better than I found

2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:10.960
 it or at least do no harm.

2:50:10.960 --> 2:50:17.080
 And I think you did all right on that in that regard.

2:50:17.080 --> 2:50:18.600
 I love that question, Alex.

2:50:18.600 --> 2:50:19.600
 That's a good one.

2:50:19.600 --> 2:50:21.720
 I think everyone should be asked that.

2:50:21.720 --> 2:50:24.080
 What is your soul?

2:50:24.080 --> 2:50:31.840
 Do you have maybe just a few lingering questions around it?

2:50:31.840 --> 2:50:38.320
 So I mean, on the point of the soul, you've talked about the meaning of life.

2:50:38.320 --> 2:50:50.960
 Do you have on a personal level, do you have an answer to the meaning of your life of something

2:50:50.960 --> 2:51:05.800
 that brought you meaning, happiness, some sense of sense?

2:51:05.800 --> 2:51:19.920
 Yeah, no, I mean, yes, no, I mean, I, you know, I'm 66, so I'm in the kind of not ready

2:51:19.920 --> 2:51:28.600
 to wrap it up literally or metaphorically, but you look, I look back and just really

2:51:28.600 --> 2:51:35.280
 with a sense of awe and wonder, gratitude.

2:51:35.280 --> 2:51:41.360
 Is there memories that stand out to you from childhood from earlier that like, it's like,

2:51:41.360 --> 2:51:49.080
 you know, stand out as something you're really proud of or just happy to have been on this

2:51:49.080 --> 2:51:50.240
 earth?

2:51:50.240 --> 2:51:51.240
 Mainly that stuff happened.

2:51:51.240 --> 2:51:52.240
 Yeah, that.

2:51:52.240 --> 2:51:59.800
 I mean, you know, my family, also a chunk were my folks, so my grandparents are from

2:51:59.800 --> 2:52:04.960
 Eastern Europe, you know, Russia, Austria.

2:52:04.960 --> 2:52:08.200
 As far as we know, some of them never made it out.

2:52:08.200 --> 2:52:22.000
 I consider myself very fortunate to have been a so called product of the American dream,

2:52:22.000 --> 2:52:29.480
 you know, my grandparents or were basically peasants, my parents, my dad worked two full

2:52:29.480 --> 2:52:35.280
 time jobs when I was growing up and I would see him on the weekends, I'd be like, why

2:52:35.280 --> 2:52:36.880
 are you working all the time?

2:52:36.880 --> 2:52:40.080
 He'd be like, so you won't have to.

2:52:40.080 --> 2:52:44.880
 And he said, look, the world does not owe you a living.

2:52:44.880 --> 2:52:50.400
 And so your first responsibility is to take care of yourself.

2:52:50.400 --> 2:52:57.120
 And then your next responsibility is to take care of other people.

2:52:57.120 --> 2:53:00.120
 And I think you did a pretty good job of that.

2:53:00.120 --> 2:53:01.120
 I don't know.

2:53:01.120 --> 2:53:08.920
 So those are the things that I'm proud of.

2:53:08.920 --> 2:53:17.400
 It's funny, you've talked about just yourself as a human being, but you've also contributed

2:53:17.400 --> 2:53:28.200
 some really important ideas for your ideas and also kind of integrating and maybe even

2:53:28.200 --> 2:53:34.440
 popularizing the work of Ernest Becker of connecting it, of making it legitimate scientifically.

2:53:34.440 --> 2:53:42.520
 I mean, you know, as a human, of course, you want to be, you want your ripple to be one

2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:44.320
 that makes the world a better place.

2:53:44.320 --> 2:53:51.320
 But also I think in the span of time, I think it's of great value.

2:53:51.320 --> 2:53:56.880
 You've contributed in terms of how we think about the human condition, how we think about

2:53:56.880 --> 2:54:01.560
 ourselves as finite beings in this world.

2:54:01.560 --> 2:54:08.720
 And I hope also in our technology of engineering intelligence, I think at least for me, and

2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:14.520
 I'm sure there's a lot of other people like me that your work has been a gift for.

2:54:14.520 --> 2:54:15.520
 Oh, well, thank you.

2:54:15.520 --> 2:54:17.440
 Oh, no, I like that.

2:54:17.440 --> 2:54:21.520
 And we have described ourselves as giant interneurons.

2:54:21.520 --> 2:54:28.760
 I'm like, we have had no original ideas and maybe that's the only thing that's original

2:54:28.760 --> 2:54:31.400
 about our work is we don't claim to be original.

2:54:31.400 --> 2:54:42.040
 What we claim to have done is to integrate, to connect these disparate and superficially

2:54:42.040 --> 2:54:49.160
 unconnected discourses, you know, so existentialists, they'd be like, evidence, what's that?

2:54:49.160 --> 2:54:54.440
 And yeah, there's now a branch of psychology, experimental existential psychology that I

2:54:54.440 --> 2:55:02.920
 think we could take credit for having encouraged the formation of.

2:55:02.920 --> 2:55:09.960
 And that in turn has gotten these ideas in circulation in academic communities where

2:55:09.960 --> 2:55:13.840
 they may not have otherwise gotten.

2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:14.840
 So I think that's good.

2:55:14.840 --> 2:55:19.800
 Well, Sheldon is a huge honor, I can't believe you came down here.

2:55:19.800 --> 2:55:22.800
 I've been a fan of your work.

2:55:22.800 --> 2:55:24.360
 I hope we get to talk again.

2:55:24.360 --> 2:55:25.800
 Huge honor to talk to you.

2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:26.800
 Thank you so much for talking today.

2:55:26.800 --> 2:55:27.800
 Thanks, Lex.

2:55:27.800 --> 2:55:28.800
 We'll do it again soon.

2:55:28.800 --> 2:55:29.800
 I hope.

2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:32.360

 And now let me leave you with some words from Vladimir Nabokov that Sheldon uses in his

2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:00.560
 book, Warm at the Core.

2:56:00.560 --> 2:56:05.960
 The cradle rocks above an abyss, and common sense tells us that our existence is but a

2:56:05.960 --> 2:56:11.560
 brief crack of light between two eternities of darkness.

2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:14.360
 Thanks for listening, and hope to see you next time.
