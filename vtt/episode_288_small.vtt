WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.640
 he made me think that everything was going to be reversed and okay and anybody that

00:05.360 --> 00:10.640
 money was borrowed from, they would get it back, maybe tenfold. And so it was this weird situation

00:10.640 --> 00:19.600
 of having one foot in his reality and potentially believing the things he was saying or even over

00:19.600 --> 00:26.400
 time wanting to believe them more and more because the alternative was so, the alternative was worse,

00:26.400 --> 00:31.120
 the alternative was like, was increasingly a bigger and bigger nightmare.

00:33.280 --> 00:39.280
 The following is a conversation with Sarma Melangales, a chef and restaurateur who was the

00:39.280 --> 00:46.640
 subject of the Netflix documentary Bad Vegan, Fame, Fraud and Fugitives, that documents the rise and

00:46.640 --> 00:52.960
 fall of her vegan raw food restaurants in New York City that ended in what she called a road

00:52.960 --> 00:58.240
 trip from hell, being arrested in Tennessee, her pleading guilty for stealing over two million

00:58.240 --> 01:06.560
 dollars and serving four months at Rikers Island Jail. Sarma disputes the veracity of the documentary

01:06.560 --> 01:13.280
 and its conclusions, saying that she was misrepresented. So I wanted to talk to her to get

01:13.280 --> 01:19.280
 the full story, to seek understanding of who she is as a human being, the good and the bad.

01:19.280 --> 01:24.880
 This is the Lex Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description

01:24.880 --> 01:32.080
 and now, dear friends, here's Sarma Melangales. You said that you did a lot of reading when you're

01:32.080 --> 01:39.040
 growing up and you mentioned Fear and Loading in Las Vegas by Hunter S. Thompson. So from the

01:39.040 --> 01:45.040
 reading you've done in those early days, how did you see the world? Was it to you a beautiful

01:45.040 --> 01:51.920
 place or a cruel place? I don't think I thought about the world. You were focused on family,

01:51.920 --> 01:57.520
 just basic day to day life? I think I was focused on day to day. I had an awareness of not fitting

01:57.520 --> 02:04.800
 in, but I think back then it felt like something was wrong versus some people are just that way.

02:05.760 --> 02:13.040
 And speaking of books, I read a book called Party of One by a woman named Anali Rufus that somebody

02:13.040 --> 02:18.640
 gave me and suggested I read, and that helped a lot. That was one book that made me feel like

02:20.000 --> 02:26.160
 it made me understand things from the past that I hadn't understood before, specifically kind of

02:26.160 --> 02:30.640
 feeling out of place, even among my family, which is where you're not supposed to feel out of place.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.280
 Yeah, I'm not sure where I saw it, but I think you mentioned that you were a bit of a loner,

02:35.280 --> 02:45.920
 and I also think I saw somewhere pictures of you with green hair in high school and a wild

02:45.920 --> 02:51.040
 haircut. What was that about? Was that real? Am I just imagining? No, you're not imagining it.

02:51.040 --> 02:58.640
 It's strange because I was kind of a loner, so it'd be strange to do something that calls so

02:58.640 --> 03:04.320
 much attention to yourself, because back then, I mean, I grew up in a suburb of Boston in Newton,

03:04.320 --> 03:11.920
 and anybody that was there around that time, probably if you said that girl with green hair

03:11.920 --> 03:16.240
 or blue hair was blue most of the time, they would remember seeing me walking down the street,

03:16.240 --> 03:20.080
 because it stood out like crazy, especially back then. Now, it wouldn't stand out so much,

03:20.080 --> 03:29.600
 but back then, it really stood out. So, I was trying to think about why I did that when I was

03:29.600 --> 03:36.720
 kind of shy, and on the one hand, wouldn't want to bring attention to myself, but I did something

03:36.720 --> 03:46.240
 that did, and it wasn't my family to their credit. They were fine with it, so it wasn't a rebellion

03:46.240 --> 03:50.320
 against them or anything like that. They were fine with it. I don't think they loved it, but...

03:50.320 --> 03:59.280
 Yeah, dad was a physicist at MIT. Yes. So, he was cool with your green hair when you're a rebellion.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.480
 That's just the way of life. He was fine with the green hair, but I think

04:02.480 --> 04:07.840
 in some ways, maybe they had to be fine with it, because I didn't cause problems otherwise,

04:07.840 --> 04:14.960
 and I got good grades in school. I was a very low maintenance child, I think.

04:16.320 --> 04:21.760
 Even with the green hair. So, Hunter S. Thompson wrote a lot of good stuff.

04:23.520 --> 04:27.600
 He has a lot of just brilliant quotes, a lot of brilliant lines. So,

04:27.600 --> 04:33.040
 one of the ones I love is, life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving

04:33.040 --> 04:39.120
 safely in a pretty and well preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside in a cloud of smoke,

04:39.120 --> 04:47.520
 thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, wow, what a ride. What do you think

04:47.520 --> 04:56.800
 about that? Is that good life advice from Hunter S. Thompson? I think so. I think he followed

04:56.800 --> 05:05.440
 it, right? Somewhere, I heard recently what he consumed in a day, and it was kind of astonishing.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
 It's funny, when I was in college, there were always really interesting people coming through

05:10.000 --> 05:15.120
 speakers and whatnot, and I tended to not go to events and whatnot, but in the four years I was

05:15.120 --> 05:21.280
 there, I mean, really interesting people came through and gave talks. I don't know, just a lot

05:21.280 --> 05:27.360
 of famous people, but then one day Hunter S. Thompson came to speak, and that was the only

05:27.360 --> 05:32.240
 one I attended. Oh, wow. That was the only interesting person who came to speak on the

05:32.240 --> 05:38.640
 campus that I attended was Hunter S. Thompson, and he had a glass of whatever it was, whiskey,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.600
 and I don't remember a whole lot about it, but it was entertaining.

05:44.400 --> 05:48.720
 And yeah, I mean, later in his life, he started making less and less sense,

05:48.720 --> 05:54.160
 but he was still somehow embodying the crazy that he represented throughout his life,

05:54.160 --> 05:58.000
 the boldness, the fearlessness, the wildness, all that kind of stuff. And we'll talk about

05:58.000 --> 06:04.320
 Johnny Depp a little bit too. Funny enough, there's an echo. Obviously, Johnny Depp played him,

06:05.280 --> 06:10.000
 or he starred in Field Unloading, and they hung out together, and it just seemed to somehow,

06:10.560 --> 06:15.680
 like, the universe rhymes in these two individuals. They're both mad men in different

06:15.680 --> 06:21.360
 kind of ways. So you also told me that Leon the professional is one of your favorite films.

06:22.400 --> 06:28.560
 It's also the reason you named your dog Leon. So what do you find beautiful and powerful about

06:28.560 --> 06:32.480
 this film? I've watched it a bunch of times, but it's been a while since I've watched it.

06:33.280 --> 06:38.240
 So for people who haven't watched it, there's a guy named Leon played by John Arnaud.

06:38.240 --> 06:47.520
 You know, there's a young girl, I don't know, 13, 14, Matilda played by Natalie Portman,

06:48.480 --> 06:54.320
 and she's abused. She has a really hard life. Her parents are spoiler alert,

06:55.920 --> 07:07.600
 murdered, and then she finds protection under this fellow Leon, who also happens to be a

07:07.600 --> 07:15.120
 professional assassin. And he is also kind of a force comp type character, like he's a really

07:15.120 --> 07:23.200
 simple human. He almost, he seems to be like the immature one, or like rather the one who's young,

07:23.200 --> 07:29.120
 and she seems to have a wisdom far beyond her age because of the hard life she had to live through,

07:29.120 --> 07:35.040
 and then they're here huddling together from the cruelty of the world

07:35.040 --> 07:40.560
 and finding connection. Yeah, I think it's one of those films where

07:40.560 --> 07:45.440
 there's so many interesting things about it, but I'm sure one of them is just the contradiction

07:45.440 --> 07:52.560
 of him being a caring person and reluctant to get attached to her. He tries to, I think he

07:52.560 --> 07:59.840
 knows, he's very reluctant to get attached to her in the beginning. And so you see all of his

07:59.840 --> 08:06.000
 humanity, but yet he's also an assassin that kills people. So that's interesting. And I think

08:07.440 --> 08:11.120
 probably a psychoanalyst would have a field day with why I like that money so much.

08:11.920 --> 08:17.280
 And I haven't gone there myself, but there's something I think about. She,

08:18.560 --> 08:24.320
 even in the brief part that depicts her in the beginning, it seems clear that she's sort of

08:24.320 --> 08:33.600
 out of place in her family. And then yeah, there's all kinds of interesting things about their

08:33.600 --> 08:38.560
 relationship along the way. What I like about that movie, and I had to think about it recently

08:38.560 --> 08:44.800
 because I've read stuff about it that bothered me, or it bothered me the fact that I haven't

08:44.800 --> 08:49.680
 really thought about it before. For people who haven't watched the movie, so here's a young

08:49.680 --> 08:57.200
 underage girl who kind of comes onto him. First of all, I think she actually just doesn't know what

08:58.240 --> 09:05.440
 like familial love is. So this is the only way she knows how to express love. That's one. And

09:05.440 --> 09:11.120
 two is, you know, a lot of bad people in this world would take advantage of that.

09:11.120 --> 09:22.080
 Right. And the fact that she finally met a human being who doesn't, and is just there to protect her.

09:22.720 --> 09:29.760
 That's a real sort of, I don't know, a powerful statement of what it means to be sort of like

09:29.760 --> 09:38.640
 a father figure, I suppose, a protector. So that, to me, I love the idea of being sort of the

09:38.640 --> 09:47.600
 protector. That there's something worthwhile in this world to protect amidst all the cruelty

09:47.600 --> 09:54.720
 that's all around. So that's a beautiful kind of, you're basically saving this young human's,

09:57.280 --> 10:00.960
 or you're repairing this young human's path

10:00.960 --> 10:10.880
 to love, to real love in life. Because that idea of love was destroyed for her,

10:10.880 --> 10:19.200
 just family, everything is, everything is sort of, everything around her is broken.

10:19.200 --> 10:23.840
 And he's kind of repairing it by reestablishing what that kind of love can be. I don't know.

10:23.840 --> 10:31.280
 And the plant, they save the plant also. Well, there's also just the simple,

10:31.280 --> 10:34.800
 the simplicity of the film, just from a cinematic perspective is beautiful.

10:35.360 --> 10:40.240
 The music, the way it looks, the minimalism. Even the violence was beautiful.

10:41.040 --> 10:49.920
 Yeah, violence. It was over the top. And also the bad guy, the bad cop, played by Gary Oldman.

10:49.920 --> 10:53.760
 Yeah, he was amazing. Yeah, I think he was listening to Beethoven

10:53.760 --> 10:57.600
 or something like that. And he'd taken some sort of pills and drugs and some kind.

10:58.720 --> 11:03.200
 So there was a kind of, like it's part of the orchestra, like the violence was part

11:03.760 --> 11:11.360
 of some kind of musical creation. Yeah, it's interesting because I turn away from

11:12.560 --> 11:17.680
 violence or films usually that have violence or TV or anything that has that sort of

11:17.680 --> 11:25.840
 element to it except in certain cases where... Where the violence is beautiful.

11:26.560 --> 11:31.680
 Yeah, yeah. Or did you see the movie True Romance?

11:33.040 --> 11:37.200
 Yes, that's my second favorite movie. Okay, that's probably my favorite movie.

11:37.920 --> 11:43.680
 Oh, well, that's my second favorite movie. That's a more simple kind of love.

11:43.680 --> 11:49.040
 But also with the violence that is beautiful, I suppose you could say. Yeah. And my favorite

11:49.040 --> 11:54.560
 scene is the one with Patricia Arquette and James Gandolfini. Oh, yeah. There's a shotgun

11:54.560 --> 12:01.360
 involved. Yeah. Yeah. And then... It actually makes me cry every time I see it, for some reason.

12:01.360 --> 12:11.600
 So for people who haven't seen the film, I think he's actually, I think he's hitting her

12:12.320 --> 12:18.800
 or like there's blood and violence and so on because he's resisting being murdered.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.640
 Yeah, there's a lot of violence. And then, you know, he throws her into the glass,

12:24.080 --> 12:28.640
 the shower thing, and she's all cut up and beat up and...

12:28.640 --> 12:34.480
 Only then she laughs. Yeah, there's just so much passion in it. You know, she knows she's gonna,

12:34.480 --> 12:39.360
 or in that moment, she knows or thinks she knows that she's gonna die anyway.

12:40.240 --> 12:45.600
 Because she knows he's gonna kill her. So she kind of gives it all she has and...

12:46.800 --> 12:49.440
 But she also just has guts. She's not afraid.

12:50.000 --> 12:54.400
 Yeah. Well, and also she's, you know, she loves Clarence.

12:54.400 --> 12:59.920
 Yeah. The love comes through to that violence. Yeah. Yeah. Just like Clarence,

13:01.440 --> 13:06.800
 her fella in that film has the same kind of thing when he visits...

13:06.800 --> 13:09.920
 Well, it was Gary Oldman again. It was Gary Oldman again. That's right.

13:09.920 --> 13:11.440
 Yeah. The pimp. Looking very different.

13:11.440 --> 13:17.520
 Drexel. Drexel, yeah. Yeah. And he's also fearless in that interaction, saying she's now mine.

13:17.520 --> 13:24.320
 It's interesting. That movie is so romantic and a happy ending, spoiler alert, in a way.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.920
 That's what I like about it too, because I feel like some movies should come with...

13:28.560 --> 13:33.600
 I don't want to watch a movie if it's going to be devastating, usually unless it's worthwhile

13:33.600 --> 13:39.280
 in some other way, but I'm kind of sensitive and I don't want... I don't like movies that have a

13:39.280 --> 13:45.920
 terrible ending. You know, I mean, there's a book I read because it got so many good reviews,

13:45.920 --> 13:49.280
 and the very last scene, the woman steps in front of a train and it was like...

13:51.520 --> 14:00.640
 So, I'm partial to movies with happy endings. Leon ends with loss. Leon, the movie.

14:00.640 --> 14:05.360
 Right, but it's still inspiring. A love persists in some kind of form.

14:05.920 --> 14:09.920
 Yeah. She persists. And the plant. And the plant.

14:09.920 --> 14:16.400
 Okay, sure, sure. Drew Romans does have one of the... I mean, it's probably unhealthy.

14:16.400 --> 14:22.080
 That ending scene is just amazing. You're so cool. Is that one the one where she just kind of

14:22.800 --> 14:29.360
 looks at Clarence and her son and child or whatever and she's saying, you're so cool,

14:29.360 --> 14:34.000
 you're so cool? Yeah. That's love. That's the opposite of it.

14:34.000 --> 14:40.800
 I just thought the movie has so much in it because it's funny and there's so many good

14:40.800 --> 14:47.600
 actors in that film. Brad Pitt plays in that film, a pivotal role of Pothead on Couch.

14:47.600 --> 14:53.760
 Yeah, they're all so good and funny and Michael Rappaport and even Val Kilmer,

14:53.760 --> 14:56.640
 people don't realize he's in the movie because he doesn't look like himself.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.720
 Wait, what did Val Kilmer do? Val Kilmer's in the very end. It's...

15:00.720 --> 15:06.960
 You know, when he's... There's like the Elvis sitting there, walking to him in the end.

15:07.760 --> 15:14.960
 That's Val Kilmer. Yeah, you don't notice it unless you somehow either are very

15:14.960 --> 15:20.320
 perceptive or noticed it in the credits. Yeah. And Quentin Tarantino wrote the film,

15:20.320 --> 15:28.000
 I think, which is interesting, directed by Tony Scott. And the music is beautiful too.

15:28.000 --> 15:35.520
 And Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper. Dennis Hopper plays Clarence's

15:37.040 --> 15:46.480
 dad and they have this very racist sounding scene, but the big important aspect of that scene is

15:46.480 --> 15:53.840
 it's a father willing to die to protect his son. I mean, so much beautiful violence in that film.

15:53.840 --> 16:01.840
 There is. There is. I love that film so much. And she's a prostitute or not really part time,

16:01.840 --> 16:07.200
 short time. No, it was her first time. First time. Yeah. Okay. And he saved her.

16:12.480 --> 16:18.320
 My third favorite film has no violence whatsoever. What's your third? A room with a view.

16:18.320 --> 16:27.440
 I feel like you'd like it. It's, I forget the author. It's a book and I read the book much

16:27.440 --> 16:39.440
 later, but it's Helena Bonham Carter and Daniel Day Lewis is in it and Julian Sands.

16:40.640 --> 16:45.200
 Daniel Day Lewis is a fascinating character. He's amazing in this film because he plays,

16:45.200 --> 16:52.640
 he's very funny. He sort of plays a, he's a comical character, which is unlike most of what

16:52.640 --> 17:00.080
 he does, I think. I don't watch a ton of movies so, but yeah, he plays, his role is funny.

17:01.040 --> 17:07.680
 Well, that's a heck of a top three. You brought me some books, some bread and books.

17:08.320 --> 17:11.920
 Yeah. Some Russian bread, Russian inspired bread.

17:11.920 --> 17:18.080
 Yeah. I mean, it's Latvian, but it's similar to, close enough, similar to what's made in

17:18.080 --> 17:21.680
 Russia and it's made at a Russian bakery in Brooklyn. Where your dad is from, right?

17:21.680 --> 17:24.640
 My dad is from Latvia, yeah. So you got me some books,

17:25.760 --> 17:30.320
 beautiful ruins. Yeah. And if you never read them, who cares? That's totally fine. Yeah,

17:30.320 --> 17:34.800
 people give you books and then you feel like you just, you're, you sort of feel like.

17:34.800 --> 17:39.520
 I see this is, we'll talk about this. This is part therapy session. I don't feel the need

17:39.520 --> 17:46.560
 to, to satisfy people's happiness. That's a good thing. Okay. So, but they, it could also be a,

17:48.000 --> 17:52.320
 an opportunity to experience something I never otherwise would have. So beautiful ruins.

17:53.120 --> 17:59.120
 It's a book that made me laugh and cry and it's just a happy story. And for some reason,

17:59.120 --> 18:05.040
 I don't know exactly why, but for some reason, when you asked me to comment for, it just,

18:05.040 --> 18:11.120
 I thought, oh, I'm going to bring a copy of that book. That's, you just felt it came, the voice

18:11.120 --> 18:17.440
 told you. Yeah. There's others, darkness visible. These are more. A memoir of madness, compelling,

18:17.440 --> 18:24.000
 harrowing, a vivid portrait of a debilitating disorder that offers the solace of shared

18:24.000 --> 18:30.640
 experience in New York Times. This is, there's a little bit about this book that reminds me of

18:30.640 --> 18:40.560
 the Carl Diceroth book because he writes about his own condition in, I mean, he's an amazing writer.

18:40.560 --> 18:46.640
 So he writes about it in this beautiful way. And oddly enough, in some ways, it's kind of delightful.

18:46.640 --> 18:51.280
 So it's not at all a depressing book. At least I didn't find it depressing at all. I don't think

18:51.280 --> 18:58.480
 it is. But he writes about his own experience with depression in such a beautiful way.

18:58.480 --> 19:08.240
 My own copy is full of underlines. I would love that copy too. I would love to look into the

19:08.240 --> 19:13.520
 underlines and the, and then the books with notes, those little secrets that people leave.

19:13.520 --> 19:19.040
 That's part of why I like paper books is because I underline, I tend to underline like crazy. The

19:19.600 --> 19:24.240
 Carl Diceroth book is full of underlines too. Well, I do the same thing on Kindle, but

19:24.240 --> 19:28.800
 and then you can actually more effectively go back to the things you've underlined because

19:28.800 --> 19:36.320
 you highlight and so on. But in fact, when you underline on paper books, you sometimes never

19:36.320 --> 19:41.280
 go back, which always makes me sad. To the book? To the things you've underlined.

19:41.280 --> 19:45.680
 In the paper books? Yeah, in the paper books. Oh, I do. I go back. Yeah, I go back a lot.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.560
 Do you wonder what the heck you were thinking about when you wrote something?

19:49.440 --> 19:54.000
 No. Well, sometimes I underline things that are, well, also what I do is I have a whole file

19:54.000 --> 20:01.040
 in Evernote of transcribed quotes from books, ones that I want to save. So I might underline a lot

20:01.040 --> 20:06.960
 of things in a book and then maybe like a third of them. I want to write them down somewhere.

20:06.960 --> 20:12.560
 So I write those down. And I think even the time it takes to transcribe it is somehow worthwhile.

20:12.560 --> 20:18.880
 It's like searing it in your brain. And you're reliving the memory of having it read at the first

20:18.880 --> 20:25.040
 time. Yeah. And then sometimes I'll pick up books. I even, and sometimes I just underline

20:25.040 --> 20:29.680
 sentences that are, it's not the content of the sentence. It's more that it's just a beautifully

20:29.680 --> 20:34.640
 written sentence or like a particularly apt metaphor or something that's really nice.

20:35.680 --> 20:40.800
 And I like paper books too because I bought beautiful ruins. I would have never heard of it,

20:40.800 --> 20:47.040
 I don't think, except one of my favorite things is to go to used bookstores. Actually,

20:47.040 --> 20:53.520
 Goodwill sometimes has really good big book selections depending on the area where you go.

20:54.720 --> 21:00.080
 Sometimes you find a lot of treasures there. And what ends up happening a lot is I end up

21:00.080 --> 21:04.800
 buying books that I know sometimes also because I lost all my belongings at one point. So all very

21:04.800 --> 21:12.400
 often buy books that I've already read just to have them. But then what always ends up happening is

21:12.400 --> 21:17.120
 I'll find, there'll be a couple of books that I buy that I've never heard of the author. I don't

21:17.120 --> 21:20.880
 really know anything about, I don't know anything about the book at all, but something drew me to

21:20.880 --> 21:26.640
 it. And what I like about that is you're buying used books. So it costs a dollar or two. So if

21:26.640 --> 21:32.480
 you made a mistake, like no big deal, who cares. So, but every time I come back with a book haul,

21:32.480 --> 21:39.680
 there's usually at least one gem that I end up loving. And I'm so glad that I read it. And

21:39.680 --> 21:44.080
 Beautiful Ruins was that book for me. And I was drawn to it because of the cover art,

21:44.080 --> 21:49.680
 like I just love, I just love the cover and the colors. And then I picked it up and read the bag

21:49.680 --> 21:55.680
 and bought it. And I also feel bad sometimes buying used books when the author is still alive,

21:55.680 --> 22:00.320
 because I feel like if you write a book, you should get the royalties. So.

22:01.840 --> 22:03.600
 But you get to live with that regret.

22:04.400 --> 22:09.040
 Well, also, I mean, I'll usually end up putting a picture of Leon reading the book online and

22:09.040 --> 22:12.800
 then other people buy it and read it. And so I feel like I've made up for it.

22:12.800 --> 22:13.520
 You make up for it.

22:13.520 --> 22:17.040
 I've made up for depriving him of the royalties.

22:17.040 --> 22:20.080
 I used to live in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.680
 I know it well. I used to hang out at the pit in Harvard Square with my green and blue hair

22:25.680 --> 22:28.560
 when I was very way too young to be doing that by myself.

22:29.120 --> 22:32.640
 And there's a guy that I think has been there for a long time,

22:32.640 --> 22:39.200
 sort of between Kendall and Central that would just lay out used books and sell them.

22:39.840 --> 22:42.400
 And I always loved that guy. Whoever he was,

22:43.600 --> 22:49.360
 had a cool hat. He's an older gentleman. And you could just tell he's seen some things.

22:50.160 --> 22:54.320
 I don't know who he is. I always wanted to actually like talk to him for a long time,

22:54.320 --> 22:58.880
 but I was too afraid. Maybe because I wouldn't be able to handle what he had to tell me.

22:58.880 --> 23:03.440
 I don't, because I almost wanted to maintain the innocence of just, okay, here's this guy.

23:03.440 --> 23:08.000
 But he was so, every time you would ask him a question about a book, first of all,

23:08.000 --> 23:08.800
 he's read all of them.

23:09.440 --> 23:10.320
 Oh, that's interesting.

23:10.320 --> 23:14.800
 Which means he's traveled quite a few places inside these worlds.

23:15.920 --> 23:19.200
 And then you would tell him, I would look at a book, right?

23:20.000 --> 23:22.800
 And you just, he would catch you being curious about it.

23:22.800 --> 23:26.480
 And then he would walk up to you and then he would start talking about the book.

23:26.480 --> 23:29.440
 And he would always forget that you were there.

23:29.440 --> 23:32.240
 He's almost like, he's not trying to sell you the books.

23:32.240 --> 23:33.360
 Part talking to himself.

23:33.360 --> 23:34.960
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

23:34.960 --> 23:38.400
 Like almost like an ex girlfriend he's visiting through this book or something.

23:38.960 --> 23:40.160
 Did you buy books from him?

23:40.160 --> 23:41.680
 Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.

23:41.680 --> 23:46.800
 But the experience of just being there, because he lays them out and people actually

23:46.800 --> 23:50.320
 that watch or listen to this, probably will be able to tell me what his name is.

23:50.320 --> 23:52.800
 Because I'd love to find that guy again. I'm sure he's still there.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.400
 Maybe he'll have him on the podcast.

23:54.400 --> 23:58.480
 I would 100% will. But it's almost terrifying.

23:59.760 --> 24:03.200
 I'm not sure I can handle, because he's been through some things.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.640
 I'm not sure if he's homeless or just looks like it.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.760
 Yep. That's sometimes a thing.

24:10.960 --> 24:15.840
 And some of my favorite people either are homeless or look like it.

24:15.840 --> 24:18.240
 So. Okay. What's the third one?

24:18.960 --> 24:22.480
 The confession of a sociopath by M. E. Thomas.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.800
 A lifespan hiding in plain sight.

24:24.800 --> 24:30.320
 It's a book I recommend a lot, because I've read a lot about sociopathy.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.440
 And I've read all the books by psychologists.

24:33.440 --> 24:40.720
 And this one's written by a woman who understands herself that she is a sociopath.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.240
 And so it's beautifully written.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.840
 But I learned more from that book than from any other book.

24:45.840 --> 24:48.160
 And I think I thought about it a long time ago.

24:48.160 --> 24:53.920
 So I think a lot of conversations you've talked a lot about good and evil.

24:53.920 --> 24:58.400
 And whether everybody's really good or some people are not good.

24:59.760 --> 25:06.320
 And I think sociopathy is something that I think the world needs to understand much better.

25:06.320 --> 25:08.880
 And so that book helped me understand a lot.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.080
 And it's beautifully written.

25:10.080 --> 25:13.600
 And she tackles all the really interesting moral questions.

25:13.600 --> 25:22.160
 Like, what if we were able to definitively diagnose people in some way?

25:24.000 --> 25:28.000
 You could immediately identify who's a full blown sociopath.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.040
 And then what is a society, would you do with them?

25:31.920 --> 25:38.720
 Because in most cases, they're just going to cause destruction and pain and harm.

25:38.720 --> 25:44.720
 And or potentially rise to power and become president or something.

25:47.120 --> 25:49.280
 So I just found that book fascinating.

25:51.760 --> 25:55.440
 And we'll return to this idea because it's fascinating.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.480
 We'll return to human psychology and human nature.

25:58.480 --> 26:05.600
 But let's go through the timeline of your life.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.560
 Let's take a stroll.

26:06.560 --> 26:11.840
 So you wrote that the documentary about you called bad vegan,

26:11.840 --> 26:15.120
 fame, fraud, fugitives is not a documentary.

26:15.120 --> 26:17.840
 You got some things right, some things wrong,

26:17.840 --> 26:20.880
 and some were, quote, disturbingly misleading.

26:21.600 --> 26:24.480
 So let's go through and get things right today.

26:26.800 --> 26:30.480
 First, can I give you a whirlwind summary the way I understand it?

26:30.480 --> 26:31.920
 And also for context of people.

26:31.920 --> 26:39.600
 So 2004, you, Matthew, Kenny, and Jeffrey Chaudhuro

26:40.400 --> 26:43.040
 opened Pure Foods and Wine in New York City.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.400
 Did I say their names correctly?

26:44.400 --> 26:45.520
 Pure Food and Wine.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.000
 No, there are names.

26:46.000 --> 26:46.480
 Oh, there's.

26:47.840 --> 26:48.800
 Well, yeah.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.160
 Matthew, Kenny, and Jeffrey Chaudhuro.

26:50.160 --> 26:50.560
 Yeah.

26:50.560 --> 26:51.280
 Yeah.

26:51.280 --> 26:58.320
 So it's, and I'll ask about what it takes to launch and run a restaurant in New York City.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.400
 That's a fascinating story in itself.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.640
 So it's an upscale raw food restaurant.

27:03.600 --> 27:03.840
 All right.

27:03.840 --> 27:05.040
 That's 2004.

27:05.040 --> 27:08.480
 2007, you opened one Lucky Duck Juice and Takeaway.

27:09.120 --> 27:12.480
 And second and third locations in 2009 and 14.

27:14.000 --> 27:20.880
 All of those things close in 2016, 15 and 16.

27:20.880 --> 27:21.120
 Okay.

27:22.080 --> 27:22.640
 All right.

27:22.640 --> 27:28.640
 2009, Jeffrey lent you $2.1 million to buy the business outright,

27:28.640 --> 27:30.960
 and Matthew is out.

27:30.960 --> 27:33.200
 Matthew was out earlier than that.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.520
 And then time passed, time passed.

27:35.520 --> 27:41.120
 And I had, what was complicated is I had started the one Lucky Duck brand on my own.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.920
 It first was a dot com that was doing like delivery?

27:46.720 --> 27:52.240
 It was a dot com where people could order ingredients and things and all of the products

27:52.240 --> 27:53.360
 that we made and packaged.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.520
 So we made a bunch of cookies and snacks and things that were, I think, different.

27:57.520 --> 28:00.560
 And if I may say so myself, better than other.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.120
 Strong words.

28:03.120 --> 28:03.840
 Products out there.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.400
 Talking trash already about the cookies.

28:06.400 --> 28:12.000
 But I feel like I can brag about our food and products because I wasn't,

28:12.000 --> 28:19.440
 oh, a few recipes early on I came up with, but it was the people that worked with me

28:19.440 --> 28:22.720
 that created really good recipes and products.

28:22.720 --> 28:31.840
 And I was just kind of there curating it all or helping to get it out there.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.800
 What was your favorite thing that you've created?

28:34.800 --> 28:35.840
 Maybe yourself eat.

28:36.480 --> 28:41.360
 Not you created, but this whole, all of these efforts have created in terms of meal.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.920
 Like you said, cookies.

28:43.920 --> 28:44.640
 What are we talking about here?

28:44.640 --> 28:45.520
 That's a hard question.

28:46.320 --> 28:50.400
 Which is okay, not the favor, but like something that pops into memory that brought you joy.

28:51.040 --> 28:51.840
 The Malomar.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.840
 Everybody loved the Malomar.

28:54.720 --> 29:01.280
 So very often we made like raw vegan versions of things that people are familiar with.

29:01.840 --> 29:04.560
 So it was, I think it was pecans.

29:04.560 --> 29:08.640
 It was like a salty cookie made with nuts and then covered in chocolate.

29:08.640 --> 29:11.440
 And then there's a big blob of coconut cream.

29:12.160 --> 29:13.280
 I love coconut.

29:13.280 --> 29:15.520
 Which it didn't taste coconutty.

29:16.960 --> 29:19.760
 Our ice cream was made with the coconut also.

29:19.760 --> 29:24.320
 It's like the meat from coconut's pureed and then there's some soaked cashews in there.

29:24.320 --> 29:26.880
 But anyway, it was a blob of vanilla flavored cream.

29:26.880 --> 29:31.040
 Kind of like a healthy natural version of fluff.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.040
 I don't know if you're familiar with fluff.

29:34.080 --> 29:37.520
 Basically every single word you say I'm not familiar with, you should see my diet.

29:37.520 --> 29:37.920
 I don't.

29:38.480 --> 29:40.640
 It's like steak and vegetables.

29:40.640 --> 29:43.760
 A fluff is like a thing that I remember it from my childhood.

29:43.760 --> 29:47.360
 Like peanut butter and fluff is a ridiculously delicious combination.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.560
 Is it fluffy or is it not?

29:48.560 --> 29:49.600
 It's like a marshmallow.

29:49.600 --> 29:55.920
 It's basically like if you softened the marshmallows and made it into a luxurious,

29:55.920 --> 30:01.120
 amazing goo and then put it in a jar and then made it spreadable.

30:01.120 --> 30:03.440
 It's spreadable marshmallows kind of.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.000
 Oh, I see.

30:04.960 --> 30:06.320
 I think that's, yeah.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.000
 Spreadable marshmallows, got it.

30:08.000 --> 30:08.320
 Yeah.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.360
 So there's a big blob of that.

30:09.360 --> 30:10.400
 I didn't know that existed.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.200
 That's a thing.

30:11.200 --> 30:11.840
 Fluff.

30:11.840 --> 30:12.640
 Fluff.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.120
 I know.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.600
 Does everyone, do people know about this?

30:15.600 --> 30:17.840
 Oh yeah, everybody knows.

30:17.840 --> 30:18.400
 Okay.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.680
 People, I mean, I think so.

30:19.680 --> 30:20.960
 People know about fluff.

30:20.960 --> 30:25.280
 See, I think I went, I took the road less traveled by.

30:25.280 --> 30:30.480
 You know, I went the peanut butter and the tallow road in terms of spreadable things.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.640
 Nutella is like the chocolate version.

30:33.280 --> 30:37.680
 And then fluff is like the vanilla equivalent sort of.

30:37.680 --> 30:38.240
 Cool.

30:38.240 --> 30:42.800
 But I think commercial fluff that you buy in the store is just like sugar and whatever

30:42.800 --> 30:45.920
 else they put in there.

30:45.920 --> 30:47.680
 So it's not actually fluffy.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.080
 It's.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.200
 It's kind of fluffy, but it's wet.

30:51.200 --> 30:53.200
 Because Nutella is not fluffy.

30:54.160 --> 30:54.480
 Yeah.

30:54.480 --> 31:00.960
 It's, so it's like Nutella if you whipped it and then kind of got a little bit like,

31:00.960 --> 31:02.400
 a little bit aerated.

31:02.400 --> 31:04.800
 So it's a bit more fluffy.

31:04.800 --> 31:07.040
 So fluff was a part of the formula here.

31:07.040 --> 31:08.000
 So there's fluff.

31:08.000 --> 31:15.600
 So the, the coconut cream that we made was like a healthy version of fluff kind of,

31:16.320 --> 31:22.080
 except it would, you know, you could make a, a quenelle, like a, like a little scoop of it.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.080
 And it would stay in that form.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.400
 Malomars were refrigerated.

31:26.400 --> 31:29.920
 And then there's like chocolate drizzled over that.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.120
 So it had that like salty, sweet thing going on.

31:34.000 --> 31:35.200
 That was probably my favorite.

31:35.920 --> 31:36.800
 That's a dessert.

31:36.800 --> 31:37.760
 Yeah.

31:37.760 --> 31:40.320
 It was like a, it was like a dessert snack.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.600
 It wasn't as, you wouldn't order it on the restaurant menu, but in the takeaway,

31:43.600 --> 31:50.480
 you could get them, or sometimes some people would get them shipped on dry ice and pay a

31:50.480 --> 31:53.840
 lot of money, like a lot of money to have them shipped on dry ice.

31:54.800 --> 31:55.920
 People are funny.

31:55.920 --> 31:56.560
 I know.

31:56.560 --> 32:00.400
 I kind of want to like name drop because it was Tom Brady used to order them.

32:00.400 --> 32:01.360
 Oh, that's awesome.

32:01.360 --> 32:01.680
 Yeah.

32:01.680 --> 32:07.040
 They would order those shipped on ice to Boston.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.560
 Oh, yeah.

32:09.280 --> 32:15.200
 Continuing on, in 2011, you meet Anthony Stranges on Twitter and then in real life,

32:15.840 --> 32:22.240
 also around this time, I think before you got your rescue dog, a pit bull named Leon.

32:22.960 --> 32:23.040
 Yeah.

32:23.040 --> 32:24.560
 2011, 2010.

32:24.560 --> 32:25.120
 Do you remember?

32:25.120 --> 32:27.840
 Um, it was September, 2010.

32:27.840 --> 32:30.560
 So, because I think he was born roughly around March.

32:30.560 --> 32:34.720
 I gave him a designated birthday of March 10th, 2010.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.280
 Why is that, why March 10th?

32:37.280 --> 32:42.880
 I wrote about the story of adopting him on my website a long time ago, and then I reposted

32:42.880 --> 32:44.560
 it here on my current website.

32:44.560 --> 32:50.000
 And what happened, I got weirdly obsessed with Leon before he was Leon.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.640
 He was a dog in a shelter named Quinn.

32:53.200 --> 32:55.040
 And I couldn't stop thinking about him.

32:55.040 --> 32:55.520
 And the...

32:55.520 --> 32:56.720
 Him specifically.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.440
 Him specifically.

32:57.440 --> 33:00.480
 You saw him and there's something very special about him.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.640
 I was trying to convince somebody else to adopt a dog.

33:03.280 --> 33:04.560
 So, and I...

33:04.560 --> 33:05.520
 Alec Baldwin.

33:05.520 --> 33:06.000
 Yeah.

33:06.000 --> 33:07.760
 And it didn't occur to me that I would get...

33:07.760 --> 33:10.880
 I like how you didn't name drop him, but you named drop Tom Brady.

33:12.880 --> 33:13.360
 I like it.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.480
 So, I was trying to convince him to get a dog because I thought, you know, he should have a dog.

33:21.200 --> 33:26.240
 I saw Leon's picture and just got weirdly obsessed with it in a way that I couldn't really explain.

33:26.240 --> 33:30.720
 And I was laying in bed one night and thinking, I just couldn't stop thinking about him.

33:32.240 --> 33:35.440
 The dog and the paper were...

33:35.440 --> 33:40.720
 Or the description in the shelter bio said that he was roughly five months old.

33:40.720 --> 33:45.680
 Or however, whatever it gave us his age, I went back and it would have been March 20...

33:46.720 --> 33:49.120
 Would have been March of that year that he was born.

33:49.760 --> 33:53.600
 And I had a cat that I was particularly attached to.

33:53.600 --> 33:57.440
 I had two cats, brother and sister, but the boy cat, we had sort of like a...

33:58.160 --> 34:03.520
 Something that felt like a, you know, like we'd look at each other and like there was something there.

34:03.520 --> 34:09.920
 I don't know what it was, but and in fact, when he got sick, I knew it before he even had any symptoms.

34:09.920 --> 34:11.920
 It was like something in the way that he looked at me.

34:11.920 --> 34:13.920
 I knew something was wrong and then...

34:13.920 --> 34:15.920
 Was it friendship?

34:15.920 --> 34:20.400
 Was it like, was there a power dynamic?

34:20.400 --> 34:24.400
 Cats seem to not really...

34:24.400 --> 34:26.400
 Give a fuck?

34:26.400 --> 34:28.400
 Yeah, they seem to dismiss you.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.400
 Usually, yeah.

34:30.400 --> 34:32.400
 Your entire worth as a human being in a single look.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.400
 Was that there?

34:34.400 --> 34:36.400
 He was more dog like.

34:36.400 --> 34:40.400
 He would occasionally fetch like this little styrofoam thing I had.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.400
 He would fetch it and bring it back.

34:42.400 --> 34:48.400
 And he was friendly and, you know, if somebody came over, you would jump in their lap.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.400
 He was less standoffish than most cats.

34:50.400 --> 34:54.400
 But there was just something about the way he would look at me.

34:54.400 --> 34:56.400
 I don't know.

34:56.400 --> 35:00.400
 Maybe probably in his mind, he's just a cat.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.400
 I give him food.

35:02.400 --> 35:06.400
 Whereas in my mind, it's some kind of, you know, great soul connection.

35:06.400 --> 35:10.400
 Great, great long running romance.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.400
 Not in his kitty mind, but either way.

35:12.400 --> 35:14.400
 So he died in March and I thought...

35:14.400 --> 35:16.400
 So I sort of concocted this.

35:16.400 --> 35:22.400
 I just thought, you know, that well, if he died and he died on March 10th.

35:22.400 --> 35:26.400
 And so I thought, well, maybe Leon was born that same day.

35:26.400 --> 35:30.400
 And that's why I'm so drawn to him.

35:30.400 --> 35:32.400
 I don't know.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.400
 That makes sense.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.400
 It's one of those things that is sort of.

35:36.400 --> 35:38.400
 When you saw him, you just like, there's something.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.400
 It was his picture, yeah.

35:40.400 --> 35:42.400
 Oh, the picture.

35:42.400 --> 35:46.400
 You were drawn something about the personality in the eyes.

35:46.400 --> 35:48.400
 It was something about his picture.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.400
 I don't know what it was.

35:50.400 --> 35:55.400
 And everybody at the time was like, what are you thinking?

35:55.400 --> 35:56.400
 Why would you get a dog?

35:56.400 --> 36:00.400
 You can't, you know, can't even take care of yourself.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.400
 You're overworked and busy.

36:02.400 --> 36:05.400
 And why would you get a five month old pit bull mix?

36:05.400 --> 36:08.400
 You know, why not get an older dog that's easier to take care of?

36:08.400 --> 36:12.400
 And for me, it was like, I don't, I don't want any dog.

36:12.400 --> 36:15.400
 I don't want, my intention isn't to get a dog,

36:15.400 --> 36:18.400
 but there's something about this dog that I have to get.

36:18.400 --> 36:22.400
 And so I went to see him.

36:22.400 --> 36:26.400
 And then I had already filled out an application.

36:26.400 --> 36:31.400
 It was just, I went to see him and then I, it was the afternoon.

36:31.400 --> 36:34.400
 And I sort of decided in my head, like, all right,

36:34.400 --> 36:35.400
 I'm coming back to get him.

36:35.400 --> 36:36.400
 I have to.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.400
 And the next morning I got on the subway and went back to get him.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.400
 And I was crying on the subway.

36:41.400 --> 36:44.400
 And I remember thinking that people, I don't like crying in public.

36:44.400 --> 36:47.400
 I cry a lot, but I don't like crying in front of other people.

36:47.400 --> 36:50.400
 I love it.

36:50.400 --> 36:54.400
 I thought people on the train looking at me probably think that,

36:54.400 --> 36:56.400
 you know, I just, somebody died or.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.400
 Sorry, you're crying on the way there, on the way back.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.400
 On the way there to get him.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.400
 I don't, and I don't know why I was crying.

37:02.400 --> 37:04.400
 It was just something about it was overwhelming.

37:04.400 --> 37:05.400
 So.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.400
 So tears of happiness or tears of something.

37:08.400 --> 37:09.400
 Something.

37:09.400 --> 37:13.400
 I, yeah, I think tears are overwhelming.

37:13.400 --> 37:19.400
 And now I'm like jumping off, but there was some, I don't, now I'm trying,

37:19.400 --> 37:24.400
 was it in your conversation or the book Carl Diceruf talks about tears of joy

37:24.400 --> 37:25.400
 and trying to explain them.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.400
 And he said something about how it was like about, you know,

37:29.400 --> 37:33.400
 because tears of sadness could be understood in a,

37:33.400 --> 37:38.400
 having like a evolutionary purpose, but wide tears of joy.

37:38.400 --> 37:45.400
 And I think he said it was something about like hope that could be like lost.

37:45.400 --> 37:51.400
 So if you cried at a wedding, it might be like you're crying because their love is beautiful

37:51.400 --> 37:56.400
 and you're crying because, you know, they could get hit by a bus tomorrow or something,

37:56.400 --> 37:57.400
 you know, like it had something to do with that.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.400
 And I thought.

38:00.400 --> 38:05.400
 But I thought to me it feels like overwhelmed because then how would that explain music

38:05.400 --> 38:13.400
 because music will make me cry a lot because it's, it's anything beautiful like love.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.400
 You realize you're going to have, it's going to be over one day.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.400
 Or it's just overwhelming.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.400
 It could be overwhelming.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.400
 I think it's just overwhelming.

38:20.400 --> 38:25.400
 But over, it could be like, if you had to explain like one way to explain it,

38:25.400 --> 38:30.400
 as you're saying is it's so awesome that it breaks your heart that it's going to be over.

38:30.400 --> 38:33.400
 This feeling is going to be over.

38:33.400 --> 38:39.400
 The, either it's the song or the person, you're going to lose them one day.

38:39.400 --> 38:43.400
 But even when you're just watching something that this is completely ridiculous,

38:43.400 --> 38:47.400
 but I remember one time I probably was hormonal or something,

38:47.400 --> 38:54.400
 but it was like an episode of Family Feud years ago and the, the fam, oh no, Wheel of Fortune.

38:54.400 --> 38:58.400
 It was Wheel of Fortune and some family like won all this money and they were so happy.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.400
 Like it just, they were so happy.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.400
 They must probably needed the money or something.

39:02.400 --> 39:05.400
 And I started crying and I'm thinking, why am I crying?

39:05.400 --> 39:08.400
 But I think it's just, I think it's just like an overwhelming,

39:08.400 --> 39:13.400
 I think it's overwhelming in some way and crying because crying is a relief.

39:13.400 --> 39:17.400
 Like you feel better after you cry.

39:17.400 --> 39:19.400
 But that's not, doesn't explain the crying.

39:19.400 --> 39:23.400
 You feel better after you cry and you're saying it's overwhelming.

39:23.400 --> 39:25.400
 But that's on the surface.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.400
 The question is what's going on underneath.

39:27.400 --> 39:30.400
 That's the younging shadow.

39:30.400 --> 39:33.400
 And I don't think neither you or I can answer that question.

39:33.400 --> 39:34.400
 But there's something going on underneath.

39:34.400 --> 39:35.400
 Right.

39:35.400 --> 39:38.400
 There's probably something that touches you in some specific way.

39:38.400 --> 39:39.400
 Yeah.

39:39.400 --> 39:41.400
 And so you were crying in the subway.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.400
 So I was crying in the subway.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.400
 It's very, it's very New York thing to do.

39:45.400 --> 39:46.400
 Yeah.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.400
 Well, that's one of the things I love about New York is people,

39:48.400 --> 39:54.400
 you can be weird and do strange things and nobody's going to look at you strangely.

39:54.400 --> 40:01.400
 The fascinating thing about New York is super crowded and yet you can still feel super alone.

40:01.400 --> 40:09.400
 But also energized because a lot of other things and places will make me feel depleted.

40:09.400 --> 40:14.400
 But there's something about the energy of New York specifically that feels energizing.

40:14.400 --> 40:20.400
 I mean, everybody's going up about their day excited for a future they're building and

40:20.400 --> 40:23.400
 so on and that could be energy.

40:23.400 --> 40:25.400
 Sure.

40:25.400 --> 40:26.400
 Sure.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.400
 It could be overwhelming though.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.400
 It can be.

40:29.400 --> 40:30.400
 Yeah.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.400
 I mean, also depending on what neighborhood and what part.

40:33.400 --> 40:35.400
 Well, I'm just talking about the subway.

40:35.400 --> 40:36.400
 Right.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.400
 Yeah.

40:37.400 --> 40:38.400
 And then there's the musicians.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.400
 I love New York.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.400
 New York at its best is a special place.

40:41.400 --> 40:43.400
 I've never lived, but every time I visit,

40:43.400 --> 40:47.400
 it's so many characters, so many fascinating people.

40:47.400 --> 40:51.400
 And then there's a bunch of people always crying in the subway and you're one of those people.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.400
 I was one of those people one day.

40:53.400 --> 40:54.400
 Yeah.

40:54.400 --> 41:00.400
 I befriended some busking musicians, like the guys that just play out on the street,

41:00.400 --> 41:01.400
 these two young guys playing guitar.

41:01.400 --> 41:05.400
 And I felt like it was one of those moments where it was like handed camera because nobody

41:05.400 --> 41:06.400
 was paying attention.

41:06.400 --> 41:09.400
 And I thought it was like, it was so beautiful.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.400
 I may have cried or almost cried.

41:11.400 --> 41:16.400
 But anyway, I ended up becoming friends with them and helping them out in some ways.

41:16.400 --> 41:21.400
 And I knew I was like, well, they're going to do really well.

41:21.400 --> 41:22.400
 Yeah.

41:22.400 --> 41:28.400
 And now they're like playing large places and it's kind of fun to watch via Instagram.

41:28.400 --> 41:34.400
 You know, they're going on tour in Europe and they were these two scrappy guys.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.400
 Well, now it's just one of the guys.

41:36.400 --> 41:42.400
 But they had like no money, nowhere to live, nothing, and another.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.400
 And they didn't quit.

41:44.400 --> 41:45.400
 No.

41:45.400 --> 41:46.400
 Persisted.

41:46.400 --> 41:47.400
 That's cool.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
 Yeah, exactly.

41:48.400 --> 41:53.400
 So, but I cried on the subway and I got there and he was there and I adopted him.

41:53.400 --> 42:01.400
 But it just felt very profoundly like a force that was beyond me.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.400
 Like I couldn't not get him.

42:03.400 --> 42:06.400
 So he was the same in person as he was in the picture.

42:06.400 --> 42:13.400
 Like meaning in terms of like something like pulling you towards him, like something.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.400
 Yeah.

42:14.400 --> 42:20.400
 When I first met him the day before, he was really distracted, which I think is, you know,

42:20.400 --> 42:24.400
 he is a puppy that spends most of his day in a cage, which is not natural.

42:24.400 --> 42:29.400
 So when I, they let him, they let me take him for a walk and he was kind of, you know,

42:29.400 --> 42:34.400
 distracted in all of the place, but then when we put him back in the cage, he sort of lay down

42:34.400 --> 42:36.400
 and looked at me and I looked back at him.

42:36.400 --> 42:41.400
 And of course I imagined all kinds of, I just looked at him and I thought, all right,

42:41.400 --> 42:43.400
 don't worry, I'm coming back to get you.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.400
 Like, I'll get you.

42:45.400 --> 42:56.400
 So, yeah, it just, it felt like, it felt like something that I had no choice that I had to do.

42:56.400 --> 43:00.400
 And that was a beginning of a 12 year journey together.

43:00.400 --> 43:02.400
 An ongoing, an ongoing one.

43:02.400 --> 43:07.400
 But so I wrote about these things on my website and, and I think it was, you know,

43:07.400 --> 43:15.400
 among the many things that was later weaponized by Anthony Stranges.

43:15.400 --> 43:18.400
 Oh, the fact that there's something close to your heart.

43:18.400 --> 43:19.400
 Yeah.

43:19.400 --> 43:24.400
 And also just, it's not like I believe that he was, you know, that I was just expressing

43:24.400 --> 43:29.400
 my feelings about how I felt going to get him, that there was something about Leon

43:29.400 --> 43:33.400
 specifically that I, it was like, I felt like I had to get him.

43:33.400 --> 43:34.400
 So.

43:34.400 --> 43:38.400
 Is there words you can put to your connection with Leon?

43:38.400 --> 43:40.400
 Like, is it love?

43:40.400 --> 43:43.400
 Is it friendship?

43:43.400 --> 43:49.400
 Is it some kind of, like, what is it?

43:49.400 --> 43:52.400
 Or are we getting to the crying and being overwhelmed?

43:52.400 --> 43:55.400
 Something you just can't put words to?

43:55.400 --> 43:56.400
 Yeah.

43:56.400 --> 43:58.400
 It's probably something that's hard to put words to.

43:58.400 --> 44:07.400
 Kind of like, I sort of feel like love being something that's hard to define is part of,

44:07.400 --> 44:08.400
 is the definition.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.400
 Of love.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.400
 The fact that you can't define it.

44:11.400 --> 44:12.400
 You know that.

44:12.400 --> 44:14.400
 The moment you define it, you're no longer talking about love.

44:14.400 --> 44:15.400
 Sort of.

44:15.400 --> 44:16.400
 Something like that.

44:16.400 --> 44:17.400
 Okay.

44:17.400 --> 44:18.400
 So.

44:18.400 --> 44:22.400
 Well, my definition of love is whatever's going on in true romance.

44:22.400 --> 44:23.400
 I don't know.

44:23.400 --> 44:29.400
 Let me fly through the timeline before we get to any of the interesting details.

44:29.400 --> 44:34.400
 So in 2011, you meet Anthony Strangeas.

44:34.400 --> 44:38.400
 Then in 2012, you do get married.

44:38.400 --> 44:45.400
 2015, the staff walk out due to failure to pay from the two restaurants.

44:45.400 --> 44:51.400
 It reopens in April of 2015 and July of that year.

44:51.400 --> 44:53.400
 There's another walk out and so on.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.400
 There's all this kind of stuff.

44:55.400 --> 44:56.400
 It's confusing timeline.

44:56.400 --> 45:03.400
 Well, it's not, to me, that's not even, the point is in 2015, there's chaos happening.

45:03.400 --> 45:04.400
 Okay.

45:04.400 --> 45:09.400
 2016 in the spring, pure foods and wine closes.

45:09.400 --> 45:11.400
 Closed in 2015.

45:11.400 --> 45:12.400
 2015.

45:12.400 --> 45:13.400
 Okay.

45:13.400 --> 45:17.400
 There's some factual stuff that's not, yeah, maybe correct me on it.

45:17.400 --> 45:19.400
 To me, it's not that important to me.

45:19.400 --> 45:21.400
 The spirit of the thing is important.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.400
 Okay.

45:22.400 --> 45:30.400
 May 12, 2016, you and your then husband Anthony Strangeas were arrested after he ordered pizza

45:30.400 --> 45:32.400
 using his real name.

45:32.400 --> 45:33.400
 Okay.

45:33.400 --> 45:41.400
 In May, 2017, you plead guilty to stealing more than $2 million from investors and scheming

45:41.400 --> 45:44.400
 to defraud as well as this is from Wikipedia.

45:44.400 --> 45:45.400
 Yeah, they're wrong.

45:45.400 --> 45:49.400
 Well, let me just finish reading it and then you tell me why it's wrong.

45:49.400 --> 45:54.880
 In May, 2017, you plead guilty to stealing more than $2 million from investors and scheming

45:54.880 --> 45:58.400
 to defraud as well as criminal tax fraud charges.

45:58.400 --> 46:01.400
 Why is Wikipedia wrong and how dare you?

46:01.400 --> 46:08.080
 Well, I mean, I did plead guilty to those things, which I had to, oh, I was, I got a

46:08.080 --> 46:13.960
 jury duty summons and I had to fill out like what charges I plead guilty to and I had to

46:13.960 --> 46:18.800
 go online and look it up because I didn't really remember, which is, I thought that

46:18.800 --> 46:19.800
 was interesting.

46:19.800 --> 46:23.200
 I had to go look it up, but actually, let me finish the time because there's one more

46:23.200 --> 46:24.200
 point.

46:24.200 --> 46:25.200
 Oh yeah.

46:25.200 --> 46:33.200
 March 16, 2022, bad vegan documentary comes out where you're interviewed, does they tell

46:33.200 --> 46:39.440
 the story, some stuff is true, sometimes some is not, some is disturbing, misleading as

46:39.440 --> 46:40.440
 you said.

46:40.440 --> 46:41.440
 Okay, timeline over.

46:41.440 --> 46:48.840
 Anyway, what's wrong with the, how would you elaborate onto the you pleading guilty

46:48.840 --> 46:51.440
 for $2 million stealing?

46:51.440 --> 46:57.640
 So a lot of people plead guilty when they're, for reasons other than they're actually guilty.

46:57.640 --> 47:04.040
 So it's, even right now, if I knew that I was going to have to spend four months or

47:04.040 --> 47:11.960
 three and a half at Rikers, and I was thinking about this recently, and even if I knew that

47:11.960 --> 47:21.200
 I'd be acquitted at the end of a trial, I very likely would have just taken the four

47:21.200 --> 47:29.040
 months because the stress of going through a trial, but in particular be incredibly stressful,

47:29.040 --> 47:30.960
 not knowing the outcome.

47:30.960 --> 47:36.520
 And then money and expense I didn't have, and so people plead guilty all the time, even

47:36.520 --> 47:40.920
 if they don't think that they should.

47:40.920 --> 47:47.680
 My situation was so complicated and hard to understand that it just was the easier thing

47:47.680 --> 47:52.760
 to do, but also I just was kind of going on the advice of lawyers.

47:52.760 --> 48:00.960
 So the choice, just to understand, was to plead guilty or to go through a lengthy trial,

48:00.960 --> 48:07.560
 and that trial would stretch a long time, and it would be extremely stressful.

48:07.560 --> 48:09.200
 And extremely expensive.

48:09.200 --> 48:10.560
 Because you have to pay the lawyers.

48:10.560 --> 48:12.800
 Right, and I didn't have anything.

48:12.800 --> 48:13.800
 Right.

48:13.800 --> 48:19.680
 And so a lot of people in that situation might choose to plead guilty, and so that doesn't

48:19.680 --> 48:25.120
 necessarily mean the full heaviness of that statement of guilt.

48:25.120 --> 48:29.680
 Right, and I think people plead guilty all the time in situations where they're being

48:29.680 --> 48:36.440
 threatened with a heavy sentence, and they sort of feel like they have no choice, but

48:36.440 --> 48:41.320
 that's kind of part of a lot of things that are messed up about the system overall that

48:41.320 --> 48:44.040
 didn't necessarily apply in my case.

48:44.040 --> 48:50.120
 So we'll talk about to what degree you're guilty, and what that even means.

48:50.120 --> 48:56.280
 Yeah, yeah, because it depends on intention, I think.

48:56.280 --> 49:04.520
 Yeah, yeah, but then the word intention also means a lot of things like the word love.

49:04.520 --> 49:05.520
 That's true.

49:05.520 --> 49:07.200
 All right.

49:07.200 --> 49:19.240
 So the restaurant closed the first time when I was away and told to be off communication.

49:19.240 --> 49:20.240
 And then I...

49:20.240 --> 49:21.240
 By Anthony.

49:21.240 --> 49:22.240
 Yes.

49:22.240 --> 49:23.240
 And then...

49:23.240 --> 49:24.520
 He told you not to talk to anybody.

49:24.520 --> 49:30.160
 He told me not to open email or look at my phone or whatever.

49:30.160 --> 49:38.440
 And so when I came back and had to get it reopened, which seemed like an unbelievably

49:38.440 --> 49:45.720
 difficult task, and I was kind of shocked that I was able to pull it off, I worked incredibly

49:45.720 --> 49:54.800
 hard to get it reopened, because that placement meant everything to me, and so I just had

49:54.800 --> 49:55.800
 to get it reopened.

49:55.800 --> 49:59.200
 Were you surrounded by people that were just ingrate you?

49:59.200 --> 50:02.720
 At that time, well...

50:02.720 --> 50:03.720
 The staff and all that.

50:03.720 --> 50:06.520
 Yeah, but most of them came back, a lot of them came back.

50:06.520 --> 50:13.960
 I think what was so unbelievably painful about that whole time was like not being able to

50:13.960 --> 50:17.600
 tell anybody what was really going on, and in a sense, not really knowing what was going

50:17.600 --> 50:20.400
 on myself, but not being able to...

50:20.400 --> 50:22.920
 Having to pretend all the time was just...

50:22.920 --> 50:27.520
 So you didn't really tell anybody about Anthony?

50:27.520 --> 50:31.040
 About him and what was really going on, in part because I didn't really understand what

50:31.040 --> 50:32.360
 was going on.

50:32.360 --> 50:37.080
 So what I did was I raised money to reopen the restaurant, and I think I raised something

50:37.080 --> 50:48.080
 like eight, maybe like 900 grand, and probably 90% of that went to reopen the restaurant.

50:48.080 --> 50:53.920
 And I even made two sales tax payments right before we disappeared.

50:53.920 --> 50:57.440
 So it just sort of logically seemed...

50:57.440 --> 51:03.520
 So it's not like all of this money was taken, and then he and I ran off together with a

51:03.520 --> 51:05.000
 whole bunch of money.

51:05.000 --> 51:10.680
 It was like I raised a bunch of money to reopen the restaurant because I wanted the restaurant

51:10.680 --> 51:18.200
 to exist again, and I wanted to run it, I wanted to reopen the restaurant, and most of that

51:18.200 --> 51:23.800
 money went to reopen the restaurant, and then I disappeared.

51:23.800 --> 51:29.800
 So the timeline gets a bit wonky.

51:29.800 --> 51:35.840
 So this impression was created that we ran off with a whole bunch of money, and we didn't.

51:35.840 --> 51:41.880
 So if I wanted to be a criminal and steal a bunch of money, why would I have put it

51:41.880 --> 51:48.360
 all back into the restaurant and reopened it, and then also made two $10,000 sales tax

51:48.360 --> 51:51.080
 payments that I didn't...

51:51.080 --> 51:55.360
 And I also repaid $10,000 of another loan.

51:55.360 --> 51:59.160
 I was making repayments and stuff, and then boom, I disappeared.

51:59.160 --> 52:03.080
 So is your mind going through a roller coaster here?

52:03.080 --> 52:06.200
 So could there have been multiple use there?

52:06.200 --> 52:13.800
 So one mind is like, I love this restaurant, I'm going to reopen it, I'm this chef, business

52:13.800 --> 52:23.080
 owner, this person, and then the other is a human that's in this complicated love affair.

52:23.080 --> 52:26.560
 It was not love affair.

52:26.560 --> 52:27.800
 These are just words.

52:27.800 --> 52:28.800
 How can I...

52:28.800 --> 52:32.360
 Okay, I don't want to...

52:32.360 --> 52:39.480
 I say that lightly, but also not because love can make us do dark things, and you can say

52:39.480 --> 52:44.120
 that's not love, but okay.

52:44.120 --> 52:50.400
 The thing that traps us, the things that pulls us in to a connection with another human being,

52:50.400 --> 52:55.280
 that's love, even when it's abusive and dark and toxic and all those kinds of things.

52:55.280 --> 53:02.160
 In some cases, I think, like if it's voluntary, but in other cases, somebody pulls you in.

53:02.160 --> 53:06.600
 So it's not like you're drawn towards them, they pull you in.

53:06.600 --> 53:14.480
 So just to clarify, even when it's not physical, when the pull is with words, so it's emotional.

53:14.480 --> 53:15.480
 Yeah.

53:15.480 --> 53:26.080
 Okay, where is your mind when you raise $8,000 to $900,000 to open the restaurant, working

53:26.080 --> 53:33.800
 your ass off to open this thing, making payments, and then all of a sudden disappearing?

53:33.800 --> 53:40.480
 Where was your mind if you had a lengthy conversation with Call of Diceroth in privacy, what would

53:40.480 --> 53:43.000
 you be telling him as your therapist?

53:43.000 --> 53:45.800
 I would probably be asking him questions.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.360
 Okay, no, get the call as part of this.

53:48.360 --> 53:55.120
 Well, and actually, I have more questions for Andrew Heberman because I've had to investigate

53:55.120 --> 54:04.160
 all of these things myself, like dissociation, and even there's a psychologist who believes

54:04.160 --> 54:09.280
 that he must have used neurolinguistic programming on me, which is something that Keith Reynary

54:09.280 --> 54:14.400
 from the Nexium Cult, he was known to have used that with people.

54:14.400 --> 54:20.760
 And I think neurolinguistic programming is kind of the same as like a sort of like hypnotism.

54:20.760 --> 54:26.880
 The only reason I know what NLP is, is because in what I do, there's something called natural

54:26.880 --> 54:34.000
 language processing, artificial intelligence stuff, so it has the same like three letters.

54:34.000 --> 54:41.560
 What's the other thing that NLP, Neurolinguistic Programming, yeah, anyway, all right, well,

54:41.560 --> 54:46.080
 we talked about Andrew, my friend Andrew Heberman offline, and you definitely should do a podcast

54:46.080 --> 54:47.080
 with him.

54:47.080 --> 54:52.040
 He's a fascinating, he's such a brilliant and kind human being, definitely worth talking

54:52.040 --> 54:53.040
 to.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.920
 Yeah, I've listened to a lot of his podcast.

54:54.920 --> 55:01.240
 And you said that you listened to a lot of his instructions on getting light in the morning

55:01.240 --> 55:06.880
 or whatever during the day, it's very important for your mental, like there's all these kinds

55:06.880 --> 55:09.760
 of studies, it's good for your mind for your...

55:09.760 --> 55:14.440
 Oh, and also the other thing that he got me to do is to try to delay having coffee.

55:14.440 --> 55:16.440
 So instead of having coffee right when you wake up.

55:16.440 --> 55:18.480
 I always drink a lot of water first.

55:18.480 --> 55:22.960
 But then instead of having coffee right away, if you wait an hour or an hour and a half

55:22.960 --> 55:30.080
 or two hours, then your body is able to naturally do something that drinking coffee too soon

55:30.080 --> 55:34.000
 would sort of blunt that, so then you'll be more tired in the afternoon.

55:34.000 --> 55:39.160
 So if you wait an hour and a half or two hours or as long, before you have your first cup

55:39.160 --> 55:42.920
 of coffee, then you won't be as tired in the afternoon.

55:42.920 --> 55:43.920
 Interesting.

55:43.920 --> 55:44.920
 There's a lot of...

55:44.920 --> 55:45.920
 Does it work?

55:45.920 --> 55:46.920
 Yes.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.600
 One coffee addict talking to another coffee addict.

55:48.600 --> 55:49.800
 Yes, it works.

55:49.800 --> 55:57.920
 And so I try to get up and do other things first before I have coffee.

55:57.920 --> 56:04.160
 So and the light thing also makes a lot of sense to me getting light early in the morning.

56:04.160 --> 56:10.840
 I have one of those bright light boxes and I would love to have an apartment that had

56:10.840 --> 56:14.920
 a little deck or something where I could just step outside because when you live in an apartment,

56:14.920 --> 56:18.360
 you kind of have to like go all the way outside and then there's people everywhere.

56:18.360 --> 56:22.280
 And so to get that early morning light, isn't that hard to do when you're...

56:22.280 --> 56:24.160
 Are people good for you or bad for you?

56:24.160 --> 56:25.840
 What does Andrew Heumann say about that?

56:25.840 --> 56:26.840
 I'm just kidding.

56:26.840 --> 56:27.840
 It's a joke.

56:27.840 --> 56:28.840
 Okay.

56:28.840 --> 56:32.280
 So moving back to where was your mind that led you to disappear?

56:32.280 --> 56:35.720
 To what did you guys go to Vegas first and then Tennessee?

56:35.720 --> 56:38.600
 No, I kind of refer to it as like the road trip from hell.

56:38.600 --> 56:42.360
 It's a very Hunter S. Thompson way to describe it.

56:42.360 --> 56:44.520
 You went back to back country.

56:44.520 --> 56:51.720
 Maybe it was Hunter S. Thompsonesque except without actual drugs.

56:51.720 --> 56:54.680
 That was one of the first questions my father asked me, was it drugs?

56:54.680 --> 57:01.560
 And I wished that I could have said yes because I didn't know how to explain what had happened.

57:01.560 --> 57:09.320
 But he took me away involuntarily except of course he wasn't holding a gun to my head

57:09.320 --> 57:13.800
 but all along it was like a metaphorical gun.

57:13.800 --> 57:17.880
 Was there ever physical abuse?

57:17.880 --> 57:20.280
 No.

57:20.280 --> 57:23.560
 What would qualify as sexual abuse?

57:23.560 --> 57:24.560
 Yes.

57:24.560 --> 57:27.400
 But physically, no.

57:27.400 --> 57:35.040
 A couple of times we would get into slightly physical fights but he never, I mean he was

57:35.040 --> 57:41.480
 big and as large and blubbery as he was.

57:41.480 --> 57:43.200
 He was also really strong.

57:43.200 --> 57:47.800
 So sometimes he would like subdue me but other than that, no, there wasn't physical violence

57:47.800 --> 57:57.440
 but a lot of people will say that the psychological violence is, I don't want to diminish physical

57:57.440 --> 58:03.280
 violence but some people say that the psychological and emotional violence is more destructive.

58:03.280 --> 58:06.280
 It's just that the physical violence is easier to identify.

58:06.280 --> 58:11.640
 It's easier to identify and it seems kind of more straightforward whereas psychological

58:11.640 --> 58:16.080
 you know and you have a bruise on your face or you break a bone and those things hopefully

58:16.080 --> 58:25.560
 heal in a visible way but psychological stuff, you know, you can't easily identify or understand

58:25.560 --> 58:27.920
 or others can't easily identify it.

58:27.920 --> 58:32.720
 And then you find yourself crying for no reason at a beautiful song at some point.

58:32.720 --> 58:33.720
 Yes.

58:33.720 --> 58:38.200
 And it's that that has to do something happening in the depth of your mind.

58:38.200 --> 58:45.320
 Okay, so he took you away but where was, I mean where was your mind that was doing both

58:45.320 --> 58:53.320
 of those things was able to be taken away but also was pushing to the flourishing, the

58:53.320 --> 58:55.920
 reopening and the flourishing of the restaurant?

58:55.920 --> 59:00.320
 Well, you know, I wouldn't have reopened the restaurant with and then knowing I was going

59:00.320 --> 59:03.560
 to all of a sudden be taken away from it and it was going to get closed again.

59:03.560 --> 59:08.040
 You know, it's like why, why would I do that, why would anybody do that?

59:08.040 --> 59:13.360
 And one of the things that I tried to do towards the end was I was trying to get myself off

59:13.360 --> 59:17.520
 the bank accounts because I didn't want him to be able to get money out of me.

59:17.520 --> 59:22.000
 And so there was one time when I tried to get one of the investors we went to the bank

59:22.000 --> 59:27.520
 together to put her on as the signer and take me off and because we didn't have the operating

59:27.520 --> 59:29.360
 agreement they wouldn't let us do it.

59:29.360 --> 59:31.480
 So it was like this little snafu.

59:31.480 --> 59:38.720
 And so all of these things are sort of the opposite of criminal intent.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.680
 But that's a legal thing.

59:40.680 --> 59:43.320
 What's going on in your mind at this time?

59:43.320 --> 59:44.320
 I don't know.

59:44.320 --> 59:45.320
 I mean.

59:45.320 --> 59:50.920
 Oh, did you give yourself a chance to just think?

59:50.920 --> 59:51.920
 No.

59:51.920 --> 59:58.240
 And I think that's part of one of the things that might have saved me or anybody that's

59:58.240 --> 59:59.800
 pulled into a cult.

59:59.800 --> 1:00:08.400
 One of the things that they do is they keep you exhausted, overwhelmed, confused and afraid.

1:00:08.400 --> 1:00:10.280
 And so you don't have any time to think.

1:00:10.280 --> 1:00:14.520
 So you're just kind of constantly running and you're confused and then things are happening.

1:00:14.520 --> 1:00:15.520
 That's funny.

1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:18.440
 I have some quotes in my book draft because I listen to a lot of podcasts.

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:24.800
 I don't know what the logistics are of like crediting a quote from a podcast in a book.

1:00:24.800 --> 1:00:25.800
 But I have a couple.

1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:37.520
 That was Andrew Heberman on Joe Rogan said something about if a human or animal, I don't

1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:44.320
 know how he would know, if a human or animal is stressed, and I'm paraphrasing this horribly,

1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:54.600
 but they're much more easily prone to be not prone to, but forced into delusional thinking.

1:00:54.600 --> 1:00:59.800
 And so that quote resonated for me because he kept me in this incredibly stressed out,

1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:01.520
 afraid, confused state.

1:01:01.520 --> 1:01:05.160
 And then whatever he's sort of planting in my mind, I'm going to be that much more likely

1:01:05.160 --> 1:01:07.720
 to just kind of go along with it.

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:11.080
 Well, we'll see how this whole journey ends.

1:01:11.080 --> 1:01:14.840
 Let's actually just step back a little bit and just looking at the employees at the restaurant

1:01:14.840 --> 1:01:15.840
 and so on.

1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:20.880
 Do you have remorse for what happened, especially from the perspective of the employees and

1:01:20.880 --> 1:01:21.880
 the staff?

1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:22.880
 Yeah.

1:01:22.880 --> 1:01:28.000
 I mean, hurting them was sort of the last thing that I would ever have wanted to do.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:36.840
 And in part, I mean, there was financial harm, but I don't know whether it's more important

1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:45.040
 or not, but it was taking a place that was very much like a family to them.

1:01:45.040 --> 1:01:47.800
 And it was as if I destroyed it.

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:55.240
 And so I think that because we were so much like a family, it was almost as if mom went

1:01:55.240 --> 1:02:02.840
 off the deep end and got together with some cuckoo abusive guy and sort of abandoned them.

1:02:02.840 --> 1:02:05.120
 And they didn't know what was going on and what was happening.

1:02:05.120 --> 1:02:08.280
 So do you regret lying to them?

1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:20.800
 I regret lying to anybody in all of those circumstances, but I wasn't lying.

1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:26.280
 He made me think that everything was going to be reversed and okay and anybody that money

1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:29.280
 was borrowed from, they would get it back maybe tenfold.

1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:36.840
 And so it was this weird situation of having like one foot in his reality and potentially

1:02:36.840 --> 1:02:42.640
 believing the things he was saying or even over time wanting to believe them more and

1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:49.080
 more because the alternative was so, the alternative was worse.

1:02:49.080 --> 1:02:53.840
 The alternative was like, was increasingly a bigger and bigger nightmare.

1:02:53.840 --> 1:02:57.840
 So there's this whole situation where you're constantly giving him money, you constantly

1:02:57.840 --> 1:03:07.160
 borrowing, borrowing money with this idea that it'll be repaid like a hundred X fold.

1:03:07.160 --> 1:03:10.200
 So it's sort of like lying to somebody because you're planning their surprise party.

1:03:10.200 --> 1:03:16.720
 You think like, well, I'm lying to somebody, but it's because there's a good reason.

1:03:16.720 --> 1:03:19.200
 It's sort of, that's not a good example.

1:03:19.200 --> 1:03:24.360
 But you could have not made it a surprise party and be like pull them in onto the planning

1:03:24.360 --> 1:03:30.960
 of the party and be honest about like everything that's happening.

1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:36.400
 Not in a negative way, but like get them in on the fact that, okay, I just need to give

1:03:36.400 --> 1:03:45.960
 money to this guy, but we'll get, he is a super rich person of some kind and he'll repay.

1:03:45.960 --> 1:03:51.360
 I mean, I wish I, well, because you're holding on to this.

1:03:51.360 --> 1:03:57.480
 I mean, that, that's part of the torture is that you're isolated and unable, unable

1:03:57.480 --> 1:03:58.480
 to tell anybody.

1:03:58.480 --> 1:04:02.960
 But you're not unable or he was telling you, you're not allowed to say anything to anybody.

1:04:02.960 --> 1:04:08.640
 I mean, you're choosing not to say anything, but it's because of the sort of the weight

1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:09.640
 of it.

1:04:09.640 --> 1:04:15.000
 Cause it's embarrassing to sort of, is it embarrassing, it's something, I mean, what,

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:18.680
 why do you not tell others, you know?

1:04:18.680 --> 1:04:19.680
 What is that?

1:04:19.680 --> 1:04:22.400
 What's happening to the mind where you don't tell others?

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:27.120
 I don't know, you're part of why the story is that, you know, everything that happened

1:04:27.120 --> 1:04:35.520
 is hard to summarize and talk about in any concise way is that so much of it happens

1:04:35.520 --> 1:04:42.320
 in this very slow, slow, slow way and, you know, people always use the whole like frog

1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:50.520
 and boiling water example, so that by the time you realize you're fucked, it's too late

1:04:50.520 --> 1:04:55.760
 and it, and it seems hard to believe or understand other people because they see where you are

1:04:55.760 --> 1:04:59.160
 or where you ended up and they think, well, how did you let that happen?

1:04:59.160 --> 1:05:04.880
 Well, I don't know, I would I have willingly destroyed my life and hurt all the people

1:05:04.880 --> 1:05:10.160
 I care about and, you know, allowed my mother to get hurt and I wouldn't have ever, ever

1:05:10.160 --> 1:05:15.760
 willingly done that, so something else must have happened and that's, that's the part

1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:17.480
 that's difficult to understand.

1:05:17.480 --> 1:05:20.720
 Let me ask you about another hard question.

1:05:20.720 --> 1:05:27.700
 Do you deserve most or all of the blame for the failure of the business or are others

1:05:27.700 --> 1:05:29.200
 at fault too?

1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:39.720
 Well, the business didn't fail, it was doing well and so its closing is like it was destroyed.

1:05:39.720 --> 1:05:41.240
 Who deserves the blame for that?

1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:44.920
 I'm asking from your perspective when you think about it.

1:05:44.920 --> 1:05:52.600
 In the privacy of your mind, are you angry at Anthony or are you angry at yourself?

1:05:52.600 --> 1:05:53.920
 Both.

1:05:53.920 --> 1:06:04.760
 I think that in the privacy of my own mind and to everybody listening, it's, it's, I

1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:06.480
 feel responsible.

1:06:06.480 --> 1:06:11.600
 I feel responsible in the same way that if you kind of did something, if you were driving

1:06:11.600 --> 1:06:16.640
 and you did something stupid and caused an accident in which other people died, you would

1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:22.080
 feel, I think, horrifically responsible and you'd blame yourself because maybe you looked

1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:27.680
 away or checked your phone or something.

1:06:27.680 --> 1:06:31.520
 But you didn't intend to kill those people, of course.

1:06:31.520 --> 1:06:38.880
 So for me, it's like I didn't intend to kill, you know, sometimes I say like my own child,

1:06:38.880 --> 1:06:43.680
 I don't know if that's offensive to some people, but it's like as if I killed my own child.

1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:50.840
 It was a business, but it was special.

1:06:50.840 --> 1:06:59.840
 So I don't feel guilt, I feel responsibility and then, you know, I'm angry at him even

1:06:59.840 --> 1:07:02.720
 though that anger is pointless.

1:07:02.720 --> 1:07:04.120
 Okay.

1:07:04.120 --> 1:07:06.000
 Because this has come up.

1:07:06.000 --> 1:07:10.320
 Let's continue with the hard questions.

1:07:10.320 --> 1:07:11.320
 Are they going to get easier?

1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:12.400
 They're going to get easier.

1:07:12.400 --> 1:07:13.400
 Okay.

1:07:13.400 --> 1:07:16.160
 Most of them are easy.

1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:17.160
 This is fun.

1:07:17.160 --> 1:07:18.160
 We're having fun.

1:07:18.160 --> 1:07:25.160
 You posted on Instagram, the ending, no, I'm going to cite Instagram like it's Shakespeare.

1:07:25.160 --> 1:07:26.360
 Okay.

1:07:26.360 --> 1:07:31.600
 The ending is disturbingly misleading, but still I'm very grateful for this coverage.

1:07:31.600 --> 1:07:37.440
 Let's talk about the documentary, in quotes, documentary, I'm okay with the criticism

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:41.320
 and judgments, but would rather be based on what's true.

1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:46.640
 And then you say a couple of more sentences and then you say Leon, who has his own Instagram

1:07:46.640 --> 1:07:52.240
 account, one lucky rescue dog says, hello, he loves you all.

1:07:52.240 --> 1:07:59.040
 Even if you call me a, quote, defective, arrogant sociopath, it's all okay.

1:07:59.040 --> 1:08:04.440
 So the hard question, do you think you are in part a sociopath?

1:08:04.440 --> 1:08:05.440
 No.

1:08:05.440 --> 1:08:07.440
 Would you know it if you were?

1:08:07.440 --> 1:08:08.440
 Yes.

1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:09.440
 How does this work?

1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:10.440
 So what have you learned from reading this book?

1:08:10.440 --> 1:08:14.400
 I had all these interesting thoughts, all these sort of questions and thoughts about

1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:18.760
 it because the book I'm reading now that I'm only about a third of the way through,

1:08:18.760 --> 1:08:25.040
 he talks about some of the things in the brain structure that are particular to sociopaths.

1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:31.200
 And so then it makes you think, well, what if that could be tweaked in some way?

1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:34.040
 Like could you unsociopath a sociopath?

1:08:34.040 --> 1:08:37.040
 Is it nature or nurture, I guess, as opposed to the question?

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:39.040
 I think it's both.

1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:47.120
 I think it's genetic and then it's like genes that are turned on by things like a particularly

1:08:47.120 --> 1:08:50.280
 violent childhood or some sort of a dysfunction.

1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:57.800
 So I think somebody could have the gene, it's not turned on, and then the sociopaths have

1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:00.240
 the gene and it's turned on.

1:09:00.240 --> 1:09:06.760
 So sociopath means that you're not able to be empathetic or you're generally not empathetic

1:09:06.760 --> 1:09:10.240
 to the suffering of others or to the emotions of other?

1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:11.240
 I mean, what?

1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:18.200
 It's a hollowness, so it's like you don't have just completely lacking the capacity.

1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:27.160
 I mean, it's tragic because they wouldn't understand or feel love, but it's like a hollowness.

1:09:27.160 --> 1:09:33.280
 And then something also about the wiring, and I think also because of that hollowness,

1:09:33.280 --> 1:09:42.440
 they're able to incredibly quickly look at others and identify their insecurities and

1:09:42.440 --> 1:09:44.960
 buttons and weak spots.

1:09:44.960 --> 1:09:47.960
 So they're incredibly good at manipulation.

1:09:47.960 --> 1:09:53.320
 Is that because they're just able to objectively observe the situation?

1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:57.200
 Probably in part, but there was some other explanation related to the brain structure

1:09:57.200 --> 1:10:02.520
 that I read somewhere that made sense to me and I won't remember it because I don't usually...

1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:09.440
 You're not Andrew Cuban, who seems to reference perfectly single line from every book or paper

1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:10.440
 he's ever read.

1:10:10.440 --> 1:10:11.440
 Yes.

1:10:11.440 --> 1:10:12.440
 Right.

1:10:12.440 --> 1:10:13.440
 I don't remember things in that way.

1:10:13.440 --> 1:10:15.200
 I try to usually remember the conclusions.

1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:20.640
 So like I might remember that he might give a whole long explanation about why it's good

1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:23.360
 to do this or to take this supplement.

1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:24.640
 That's a bad habit I have.

1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:27.800
 Sometimes I'll order supplements and then by the time they arrive, I've forgotten why.

1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:28.800
 Why?

1:10:28.800 --> 1:10:29.800
 I forgot why.

1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:30.800
 Just take them all.

1:10:30.800 --> 1:10:32.800
 Awesome, but the healthy version.

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:37.520
 I hope we get to talk about food because I feel like you have a brain that should be

1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:39.400
 fed only the best food.

1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:40.400
 Oh, wow.

1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:41.880
 So we can talk about that later.

1:10:41.880 --> 1:10:47.320
 I have a lot of philosophies about that, but certainly fluff is not in the best, what

1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:48.320
 is best?

1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:54.840
 We'll definitely talk about food throughout what is best.

1:10:54.840 --> 1:10:57.560
 That makes me think of Conan.

1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:02.160
 And I just talked to Oliver Stone, who I didn't realize wrote Conan the Barbarian.

1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:06.360
 Do you know that in my head, I pictured Conan O. Bryan?

1:11:06.360 --> 1:11:07.360
 That's what...

1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:08.360
 He's also one of the funniest.

1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:10.800
 I was sitting there going, wait, why?

1:11:10.800 --> 1:11:14.320
 I love him, but when you said that, I was like, why did that make you think of Conan

1:11:14.320 --> 1:11:15.320
 O. Bryan?

1:11:15.320 --> 1:11:16.320
 Yeah.

1:11:16.320 --> 1:11:17.320
 Yeah.

1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:18.320
 I love him so much.

1:11:18.320 --> 1:11:20.320
 He's such a brilliant human.

1:11:20.320 --> 1:11:21.320
 Yeah.

1:11:21.320 --> 1:11:22.320
 Sociopathy.

1:11:22.320 --> 1:11:23.320
 Sociopathy.

1:11:23.320 --> 1:11:24.320
 Yeah.

1:11:24.320 --> 1:11:30.840
 So it's stuff about the brain, fine, but how do you know you're not a sociopath?

1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:31.840
 Would you know it?

1:11:31.840 --> 1:11:32.840
 Am I a sociopath?

1:11:32.840 --> 1:11:33.840
 No.

1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:34.840
 How would I know it?

1:11:34.840 --> 1:11:36.080
 How do you know?

1:11:36.080 --> 1:11:37.680
 Well, having listened to a lot.

1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:40.400
 Well, wouldn't I be able to be good at faking it?

1:11:40.400 --> 1:11:41.400
 Isn't that what...

1:11:41.400 --> 1:11:42.400
 Well, because you'd be out there...

1:11:42.400 --> 1:11:44.600
 There's a mask on the cover of this book with lipstick.

1:11:44.600 --> 1:11:47.080
 I don't think you would be doing the work that you're doing.

1:11:47.080 --> 1:11:52.080
 You'd probably be running for office or a trader on Wall Street or...

1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:59.080
 One of the things about sociopaths is they kind of need like the stimulation of risk

1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:01.600
 and danger.

1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:06.360
 Well, I need, okay, sure.

1:12:06.360 --> 1:12:07.360
 More than average.

1:12:07.360 --> 1:12:08.360
 I like...

1:12:08.360 --> 1:12:09.360
 Hmm.

1:12:09.360 --> 1:12:10.360
 Okay.

1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:15.680
 But Wall Street, there's a fakeness, like I don't like the fakeness of the game of it.

1:12:15.680 --> 1:12:16.680
 Yeah.

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:17.680
 That's why I left.

1:12:17.680 --> 1:12:18.680
 I didn't...

1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:19.680
 I just...

1:12:19.680 --> 1:12:21.480
 It was a strange environment.

1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:22.480
 Okay.

1:12:22.480 --> 1:12:27.280
 So, you're not a, quote, defective, arrogant sociopath.

1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:28.600
 What does defective even mean?

1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:29.600
 I know.

1:12:29.600 --> 1:12:34.600
 Well, I think that somebody had just called me that and I think that it's easy for people

1:12:34.600 --> 1:12:39.600
 to say, like, don't read the comments, but it's hard not to because then also you'd miss

1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:44.720
 the beautiful ones or sometimes like you have to go on there to check a private message

1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:54.560
 and you just stuff, it's there, people saying terrible things, so I try to...

1:12:54.560 --> 1:12:57.600
 People say, you know, don't pay attention to the comments, it's hard not to, but I try

1:12:57.600 --> 1:12:58.600
 to...

1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:07.240
 Even with the documentary, you try to still kind of see, to look for the good ones, for

1:13:07.240 --> 1:13:09.320
 the kind ones, for the supportive ones.

1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:18.400
 There were overwhelming kind comments and so that helped and felt a lot better, but sometimes

1:13:18.400 --> 1:13:23.880
 the negative comments are based on false information.

1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:28.760
 So, if somebody knew everything that happened and then wanted to judge me or say things

1:13:28.760 --> 1:13:36.320
 like that's somehow, at least that's all right, but people saying these things based

1:13:36.320 --> 1:13:41.760
 on things that are totally false is just...

1:13:41.760 --> 1:13:52.040
 It's hard to just let that go, but I know that people also say things, you know, for

1:13:52.040 --> 1:13:55.160
 their own personal reasons.

1:13:55.160 --> 1:14:02.000
 I had a fascinating exchange with somebody who direct messaged me and called me trash.

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.200
 You responded.

1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:05.200
 I responded because it was...

1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:06.200
 I...

1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:07.200
 It was amazing.

1:14:07.200 --> 1:14:08.200
 Okay.

1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:09.200
 I would do this...

1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:10.200
 It's a good opener.

1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:11.200
 It's sort of like a...

1:14:11.200 --> 1:14:13.080
 I might be procrastinating or...

1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:18.560
 But I would scroll through because the private messages were overwhelming and there's still

1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:22.480
 just this massive backlog that I'll never probably get to read.

1:14:22.480 --> 1:14:28.080
 But the one that called you trash as an opener, you were like, this is interesting.

1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:35.320
 I just was in a mood and so I responded and I wish I hadn't deleted it because I sort

1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:38.120
 of deleted a bunch and then I was like, oh, why did I delete that one?

1:14:38.120 --> 1:14:40.320
 Because I was curious what exactly I said to him.

1:14:40.320 --> 1:14:46.360
 But I responded to him in a nice way and then he responded back and then it started this

1:14:46.360 --> 1:14:49.200
 whole back and forth conversation.

1:14:49.200 --> 1:14:51.920
 So he was kind quickly or no?

1:14:51.920 --> 1:14:52.920
 Yes.

1:14:52.920 --> 1:14:56.680
 And then also wanted to get to know me and lives in Pennsylvania and was like, I'll come

1:14:56.680 --> 1:14:57.680
 to you.

1:14:57.680 --> 1:14:58.680
 I'm like...

1:14:58.680 --> 1:14:59.680
 Yeah.

1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:00.680
 Do you realize if we...

1:15:00.680 --> 1:15:03.000
 You know, if somehow this just turned into...

1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:04.600
 That would be our how did you meet story?

1:15:04.600 --> 1:15:12.280
 Well, he called me trash online, but he ended up having such an insightful comment.

1:15:12.280 --> 1:15:16.920
 I just found it interesting and I think at first he said, I never imagined you'd reply,

1:15:16.920 --> 1:15:22.400
 which is part of the whole thing with social media, although this guy wasn't anonymous.

1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:23.400
 Was not anonymous.

1:15:23.400 --> 1:15:24.400
 No.

1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:28.600
 I think he had a private account, but it's like his name and his face was there.

1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:30.960
 People forget that you're a human being when they message you.

1:15:30.960 --> 1:15:31.960
 Exactly.

1:15:31.960 --> 1:15:34.720
 When you message me, I'm a human being.

1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:42.280
 So I told him that that was hurtful and I guess I wanted to understand more why he said

1:15:42.280 --> 1:15:48.160
 it and it was surprisingly insightful, but he said something about, again, I wish I hadn't

1:15:48.160 --> 1:16:00.120
 deleted it, that he was like, I guess I was just angry because that guy...

1:16:00.120 --> 1:16:06.560
 He said something like, I guess I was just angry because that guy got you and I would...

1:16:06.560 --> 1:16:13.240
 So it made me think of the whole like sort of incel, jealousy thing that can be very

1:16:13.240 --> 1:16:19.560
 terrifying if you're female is that like, if you reject a guy, they might turn around

1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:25.600
 and be violent or angry at you and so his...

1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:29.360
 Well, to be fair, there's a dormant anger in probably all of us.

1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:34.800
 I believe there's a capacity for cruelty and anger and destruction all of us and the whole

1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:40.680
 struggle of life is to emphasize the good stuff.

1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:41.680
 Yeah.

1:16:41.680 --> 1:16:42.680
 Yeah.

1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:43.680
 So it's not just an incel thing.

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:48.480
 It's true for men and women, both capable of cruelty.

1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:49.480
 That is very true.

1:16:49.480 --> 1:16:50.720
 But this one guy...

1:16:50.720 --> 1:16:56.040
 So let me put on my therapist's hat because we started, what did we start with?

1:16:56.040 --> 1:16:59.640
 I already forgot, but the...

1:16:59.640 --> 1:17:00.640
 Oh, Leon.

1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:01.640
 He turned back to sociopath.

1:17:01.640 --> 1:17:02.640
 Leon.

1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:11.000
 No, just maybe it's not the best idea to answer the comments that start with your trash.

1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:14.880
 I don't do it all the time, it just, I happened upon that one and I was just in a certain

1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:15.880
 mood.

1:17:15.880 --> 1:17:16.880
 I was just in a certain mood.

1:17:16.880 --> 1:17:23.960
 Well, let's further offline sort of discuss this mood that you're in because it might

1:17:23.960 --> 1:17:27.080
 get you in trouble at some point in your future.

1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:31.080
 Okay.

1:17:31.080 --> 1:17:37.280
 Can we just jump back, speaking of guys that say as an opener to your trash, how did you

1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:40.560
 and Anthony Strange's meet?

1:17:40.560 --> 1:17:43.240
 Can we jump around and tell some of the details here?

1:17:43.240 --> 1:17:46.760
 Because I believe the documentary doesn't cover that well.

1:17:46.760 --> 1:17:47.760
 It's not clear.

1:17:47.760 --> 1:17:55.400
 There's some Twitter interactions and you've kind of assumed, by the way, I do think he

1:17:55.400 --> 1:18:04.360
 needs some social media coaching on this because I think, I have some books you need

1:18:04.360 --> 1:18:10.040
 to read, I think, some manuals on how to use Twitter properly, but anyway, apparently you

1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:15.320
 kind of thought that this person who turned out to be, what was his name?

1:18:15.320 --> 1:18:20.440
 He called himself Shane Fox, but he turned out to be Anthony Strange's that he was somehow

1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:24.240
 friends with Al Baldwin because of the friendly interaction on Twitter.

1:18:24.240 --> 1:18:29.720
 And so he started interacting with him and then there was, how did that escalate quickly

1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:32.280
 to the meeting?

1:18:32.280 --> 1:18:39.440
 It escalated slowly and I think, I'm sure it was intentional because had I met him right

1:18:39.440 --> 1:18:47.040
 away, I would have probably thought like, oh, he's not what I thought he was and no thanks.

1:18:47.040 --> 1:18:54.440
 But it was a long time, it was many weeks of back and forth conversation digitally one

1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:55.440
 way or another.

1:18:55.440 --> 1:19:01.920
 So it was via Twitter and then via direct message and then we both played words with

1:19:01.920 --> 1:19:07.160
 friends back then and we would message in words with friends and then eventually we exchanged

1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:08.160
 phone numbers.

1:19:08.160 --> 1:19:10.360
 How does word with friends work?

1:19:10.360 --> 1:19:11.360
 What's that?

1:19:11.360 --> 1:19:14.440
 I know that's a popular game, is that like Scrabble?

1:19:14.440 --> 1:19:19.000
 It's like Scrabble and you're playing other people and then there's like a chat function.

1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:20.000
 Yeah.

1:19:20.000 --> 1:19:21.680
 And then you can chat with them.

1:19:21.680 --> 1:19:26.960
 So you were this intellectual stimulating game and you were what, like, flirting and

1:19:26.960 --> 1:19:31.000
 that kind of stuff, like witty banter.

1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:32.000
 Yes.

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.000
 A.K.A.

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:34.000
 Flirting.

1:19:34.000 --> 1:19:35.000
 Yes.

1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:42.520
 But all of that lasted a really long time and he would give me like little tiny bits

1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:46.760
 and pieces of information about himself that made him seem kind of mysterious.

1:19:46.760 --> 1:19:52.720
 This is a dark, mysterious man who was a Navy SEAL, strong.

1:19:52.720 --> 1:19:53.720
 Yeah.

1:19:53.720 --> 1:19:56.960
 And he would always imply things versus say them outright.

1:19:56.960 --> 1:19:59.560
 So you're kind of always guessing and filling things in.

1:19:59.560 --> 1:20:00.560
 Clint Eastwood type of character.

1:20:00.560 --> 1:20:02.360
 He's not going to say it outright.

1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:03.360
 He's what?

1:20:03.360 --> 1:20:04.520
 He's a Clint Eastwood type of character.

1:20:04.520 --> 1:20:05.520
 He's not going to say it outright.

1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:06.520
 Right.

1:20:06.520 --> 1:20:07.520
 He's just going to act badass.

1:20:07.520 --> 1:20:08.520
 Yeah.

1:20:08.520 --> 1:20:09.520
 Okay.

1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:10.520
 All right.

1:20:10.520 --> 1:20:14.520
 And plus intellectual because of words with friends.

1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:16.520
 Is that still a thing, by the way?

1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:22.560
 I think it still exists, yeah, but I feel like if I started playing it again, I would get

1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:26.360
 a little addicted and stick to the coffee.

1:20:26.360 --> 1:20:31.000
 One of the interesting things is that I used to think that he like used an app to look

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:35.520
 up things, but then he would do it in front of me.

1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:38.400
 He could like look at, he was really good at it.

1:20:38.400 --> 1:20:44.800
 And he could look at the board and just like come up with, you know, a hundred point word

1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:47.800
 that I'd never even heard of.

1:20:47.800 --> 1:20:52.960
 So I think he had a little bit of that something going on in his brain that was like, I don't

1:20:52.960 --> 1:20:57.920
 know, a little rain manish or something in the way that he was able to recall.

1:20:57.920 --> 1:21:01.320
 I think his recall is incredibly.

1:21:01.320 --> 1:21:03.200
 It's important if you lie a lot.

1:21:03.200 --> 1:21:04.200
 If you lie a lot.

1:21:04.200 --> 1:21:05.200
 Yeah.

1:21:05.200 --> 1:21:06.200
 Good recall.

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:07.200
 Okay.

1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:13.920
 So when it's okay, so how did it escalate slowly from words with friends to meeting in

1:21:13.920 --> 1:21:14.920
 real life?

1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:15.920
 Like what?

1:21:15.920 --> 1:21:16.920
 You know what?

1:21:16.920 --> 1:21:17.920
 I mean, what?

1:21:17.920 --> 1:21:18.920
 Okay.

1:21:18.920 --> 1:21:21.280
 I know it's not a love affair.

1:21:21.280 --> 1:21:31.640
 That said, when did you kind of get hooked by the, oh, I wonder, you know, like fall

1:21:31.640 --> 1:21:32.640
 in love.

1:21:32.640 --> 1:21:33.640
 I think it was just a slow.

1:21:33.640 --> 1:21:34.640
 Yeah.

1:21:34.640 --> 1:21:35.640
 When did you fall in love?

1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:38.520
 It was a slow process.

1:21:38.520 --> 1:21:43.040
 And I think he found me at a time when there was sort of a perfect storm of the right conditions

1:21:43.040 --> 1:21:51.960
 for me to fall into whatever I fell into with him because that was heartbroken for the first

1:21:51.960 --> 1:21:53.680
 time in my life.

1:21:53.680 --> 1:21:55.080
 Where was the heartbreak coming from?

1:21:55.080 --> 1:21:59.760
 I had split with my boyfriend of four years.

1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:01.240
 And that broke your heart?

1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:02.240
 Yeah.

1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:07.240
 I mean, it was, I knew, it was a relationship that I knew would end even when I got into

1:22:07.240 --> 1:22:12.200
 it in the first place, because he's 15 years younger than me.

1:22:12.200 --> 1:22:17.680
 And surely they can't be the only care, the only reason it wouldn't work.

1:22:17.680 --> 1:22:21.440
 I need to also give you a book on love.

1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:22.440
 What's it called?

1:22:22.440 --> 1:22:24.240
 I'm going to write it.

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:25.240
 I don't know.

1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:26.240
 Okay.

1:22:26.240 --> 1:22:28.240
 Cause there's another book that I didn't bring.

1:22:28.240 --> 1:22:29.240
 Okay.

1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:31.560
 There's no book on Twitter and there's no book on love.

1:22:31.560 --> 1:22:35.120
 Well, cause there's actually a book on love that I really like that I think you might

1:22:35.120 --> 1:22:36.120
 like.

1:22:36.120 --> 1:22:37.120
 What is it?

1:22:37.120 --> 1:22:38.120
 Like love languages?

1:22:38.120 --> 1:22:39.120
 I still have to read that one.

1:22:39.120 --> 1:22:40.120
 No.

1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:41.120
 It's called on love.

1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:42.120
 All right.

1:22:42.120 --> 1:22:43.120
 I can't wait.

1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:44.760
 I'm going to read the cliff notes.

1:22:44.760 --> 1:22:45.760
 Bye.

1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:51.680
 It's short by this guy named Alain de Boton, French name.

1:22:51.680 --> 1:22:52.960
 I don't trust him already.

1:22:52.960 --> 1:22:58.800
 No, it's funny and it's beautiful and shocking that he wrote it when he was very young.

1:22:58.800 --> 1:23:03.200
 And I first heard him on a Krista Tippett podcast.

1:23:03.200 --> 1:23:08.600
 That's how I end up reading a lot of books is like, you hear somebody on a podcast.

1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:11.800
 So you were heartbroken.

1:23:11.800 --> 1:23:16.400
 You knew it was going to work because the age difference, what else?

1:23:16.400 --> 1:23:19.880
 That's just because the age difference also, you know, I just knew that eventually he'd

1:23:19.880 --> 1:23:27.320
 want to move on and probably he'd find somebody younger and or was young enough that he still

1:23:27.320 --> 1:23:33.480
 needed to go have a bunch of other experiences and, you know, probably wanted a family or

1:23:33.480 --> 1:23:34.920
 what not eventually.

1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:42.960
 So he was 21 and I was 34 when we first met.

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:48.680
 But then we ended up living together for four years and it was the most drama free, like

1:23:48.680 --> 1:23:50.320
 there was no drama.

1:23:50.320 --> 1:23:58.040
 And I had just come off, my prior relationship with Matthew Kenny, which was very dark in

1:23:58.040 --> 1:24:04.320
 many ways and full of all kinds of, yeah, and I just couldn't handle that.

1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:06.560
 So can I ask you a personal question?

1:24:06.560 --> 1:24:11.600
 Yes, between us and between us friends.

1:24:11.600 --> 1:24:21.760
 Is there a part of you that's attracted to the drama and the chaos now looking back?

1:24:21.760 --> 1:24:31.760
 I feel like that happens a lot and maybe there was at some point, but I don't think so because

1:24:31.760 --> 1:24:40.880
 you know, part what made that relationship work with his name was Tobin was that there

1:24:40.880 --> 1:24:43.160
 was no drama, not at all.

1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.440
 And I don't think I could have handled it.

1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:46.640
 And I feel that way now too.

1:24:46.640 --> 1:24:51.720
 Like I just couldn't, I can't like fighting or any kind of like the people being passive

1:24:51.720 --> 1:24:52.720
 aggressive.

1:24:52.720 --> 1:24:55.920
 I can't, I can't handle that.

1:24:55.920 --> 1:25:00.000
 So you've had enough storms now you want to calm.

1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:01.000
 Yes.

1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:06.040
 So you knew, you knew it wasn't work, I knew it wasn't going to be forever.

1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:10.840
 Well that that could be just insecurity and cynicism, but fair enough.

1:25:10.840 --> 1:25:22.360
 And then the heart was broken and now the heart was broken and fragile and there to be manipulated

1:25:22.360 --> 1:25:23.360
 in some sense.

1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:24.360
 Yes.

1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:29.840
 And there's another person that I heard that I quoted my book saying that when your heart

1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:36.080
 broke and you can't rely on your instincts, somehow your instincts are compromised when

1:25:36.080 --> 1:25:38.640
 you're heart broken.

1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:44.480
 And maybe I'm just like looking for excuses as to why this happened, but, but I was heart

1:25:44.480 --> 1:25:45.480
 broken.

1:25:45.480 --> 1:25:53.720
 And then I like to see people in their heart broken because it's like shows how much they

1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:56.160
 really loved somebody.

1:25:56.160 --> 1:25:57.160
 You know?

1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:58.160
 Yeah.

1:25:58.160 --> 1:25:59.160
 It's, it's sad.

1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:06.040
 But like sometimes love doesn't reveal itself as richly when you're in it versus when you

1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:07.040
 lose it.

1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:08.040
 Right.

1:26:08.040 --> 1:26:09.040
 That's probably true.

1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:12.040
 Anyway, so your judgment wasn't good.

1:26:12.040 --> 1:26:13.040
 Great.

1:26:13.040 --> 1:26:18.760
 So now you're, so you're lonely and you're super busy running the restaurant, but when

1:26:18.760 --> 1:26:22.440
 you get home you're lonely or like in between.

1:26:22.440 --> 1:26:23.440
 Yeah.

1:26:23.440 --> 1:26:28.400
 And I was kind of overwhelmed and I'm sure you were getting a lot of really positive

1:26:28.400 --> 1:26:35.600
 attention from other guys too, while New York or not, or too busy.

1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:40.440
 Well, no, because, because it was a restaurant that was constantly, you're like constantly

1:26:40.440 --> 1:26:49.720
 meeting people and really interesting people and New York is full of a lot of interesting

1:26:49.720 --> 1:26:50.800
 people.

1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:52.800
 And you're, you know, attractive.

1:26:52.800 --> 1:27:00.240
 So you, why are you connected to some mysterious distant man from somewhere else playing over

1:27:00.240 --> 1:27:01.240
 words?

1:27:01.240 --> 1:27:05.880
 Because, well, I think now looking back, I think it's because I felt like he understood

1:27:05.880 --> 1:27:06.880
 me.

1:27:06.880 --> 1:27:13.080
 And, you know, what was that feeling for coming from, you think, like, what, why did you,

1:27:13.080 --> 1:27:16.040
 why does one feel that you're understood?

1:27:16.040 --> 1:27:21.080
 One thing that made me extra easy to target is that I had written a lot of very personal

1:27:21.080 --> 1:27:28.080
 blogs and things, so in addition to him asking me questions and me probably just being insanely

1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:32.800
 open and answering whatever he asked me, I had also written and posted a bunch of personal

1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:33.800
 blogs.

1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:39.880
 Some of them I've reposted on my new website and then some of them I haven't, but in one

1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:49.440
 of them I go into detail about my frustrations professionally in growing the business and

1:27:49.440 --> 1:27:55.400
 having read that and being a very smart person, he would have known kind of precisely what

1:27:55.400 --> 1:28:01.040
 to say to get me, to get me drawn in.

1:28:01.040 --> 1:28:07.600
 So I think by waiting so long before we met in person, he'd already, he'd already gotten

1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:13.840
 me hooked in a way that was going to then make it possible for me to, you know, see

1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:14.840
 him.

1:28:14.840 --> 1:28:17.840
 And even though he doesn't look like I thought he did, I'll make excuses for it.

1:28:17.840 --> 1:28:24.440
 I mean, that's a dangerous thing about when people, and I'm not saying I fell in love

1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:25.440
 with him in this way.

1:28:25.440 --> 1:28:31.080
 I feel like there's another explanation for what felt like love.

1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:38.520
 But when people fall in love quickly, there's that danger that because that's what happens

1:28:38.520 --> 1:28:43.120
 first, that the more you learn about them, you'll sort of rationalize away things that

1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:46.280
 might be red flags or things that you don't like.

1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:58.360
 So I think it's safer to fall in love when you get to know somebody not in the context

1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:03.120
 of dating them like Jim and Pam on the office.

1:29:03.120 --> 1:29:04.920
 Did you watch The Office?

1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:09.520
 Yeah, because, yeah, of course I watched The Office, British Office is better, strong words,

1:29:09.520 --> 1:29:10.520
 but yes.

1:29:10.520 --> 1:29:11.520
 Yeah.

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:12.520
 But yes.

1:29:12.520 --> 1:29:13.520
 So, well, yeah, fine.

1:29:13.520 --> 1:29:14.520
 True.

1:29:14.520 --> 1:29:16.520
 It might be romantic.

1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:18.440
 Yeah, I like the romantic.

1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:21.480
 You can fall, but yeah, it's fine.

1:29:21.480 --> 1:29:25.960
 But just, I think the better lesson is, yes, that's one thing to say, but the other is

1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:32.600
 like when you see the red flags, notice them, be a little better about noticing them even

1:29:32.600 --> 1:29:34.000
 amidst the passion.

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:39.160
 What if like a brilliant woman kind of threw herself in your path, right?

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:45.040
 Because talking on a podcast is a little bit like having a blog where you overshare because

1:29:45.040 --> 1:29:49.560
 people learn everything about you, what you like, what you don't like, what you're wants

1:29:49.560 --> 1:29:51.680
 and dreams.

1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:58.520
 So some woman like could pretend to throw herself in your path seemingly accidentally

1:29:58.520 --> 1:29:59.520
 and then you meet.

1:29:59.520 --> 1:30:02.840
 She has a Russian accent and probably works for FSB.

1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:07.880
 No, but whatever, she is who she is.

1:30:07.880 --> 1:30:13.040
 And then she sort of slides into the conversation like a quote from the idiot, right?

1:30:13.040 --> 1:30:14.040
 Yeah.

1:30:14.040 --> 1:30:15.040
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:16.040
 And you're like boom.

1:30:16.040 --> 1:30:17.040
 It happens.

1:30:17.040 --> 1:30:18.040
 Yeah.

1:30:18.040 --> 1:30:19.040
 Right?

1:30:19.040 --> 1:30:21.840
 But she's not who she, that's all I'll pretend.

1:30:21.840 --> 1:30:28.920
 And so you very quickly could fall in love with her and she's going to turn out to like

1:30:28.920 --> 1:30:31.920
 enjoy the game of destroying your life.

1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:32.920
 Yep.

1:30:32.920 --> 1:30:36.320
 You know, that or it's the love of my life.

1:30:36.320 --> 1:30:39.320
 It could be, but not if she did all those things intentionally.

1:30:39.320 --> 1:30:45.000
 But you don't really know, but you have to then pay attention to, that's the dark aspect

1:30:45.000 --> 1:30:47.000
 here you mentioned blog.

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:52.480
 Like I love when people have like stuff about themselves online because you get to really

1:30:52.480 --> 1:30:53.480
 learn.

1:30:53.480 --> 1:30:54.480
 I mean, I'm a fan of podcasts.

1:30:54.480 --> 1:30:55.980
 I'm a fan of people.

1:30:55.980 --> 1:31:01.880
 I love learning about them, the personal stuff and so on, hopefully for good reasons.

1:31:01.880 --> 1:31:06.440
 So the person you can, people you connect with the good ones are the ones that are going

1:31:06.440 --> 1:31:11.760
 to be very sort of empathetic and the bad ones are the ones that are going to be fake

1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:12.760
 empathetic.

1:31:12.760 --> 1:31:18.360
 Like they're going to learn everything about you and use you to manipulate you as opposed

1:31:18.360 --> 1:31:23.520
 to learn everything about you to fall deeper in love with you as a friend or as a romantic

1:31:23.520 --> 1:31:24.520
 partner.

1:31:24.520 --> 1:31:25.520
 Or like genuine curiosity.

1:31:25.520 --> 1:31:26.520
 Yeah.

1:31:26.520 --> 1:31:27.520
 Genuine curiosity.

1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:28.520
 Like there's something you're drawing.

1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:34.520
 Imagine your dog Leon had a blog after, oh yeah, he does now.

1:31:34.520 --> 1:31:35.520
 Yeah, that's true.

1:31:35.520 --> 1:31:36.520
 He kind of does.

1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:37.520
 Yeah.

1:31:37.520 --> 1:31:39.880
 When you met him, right?

1:31:39.880 --> 1:31:41.880
 Then you'd be like, what is this?

1:31:41.880 --> 1:31:46.160
 What is there that's pulling me towards this creature, this entity?

1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:47.160
 Like what is there?

1:31:47.160 --> 1:31:51.520
 And it'd be fascinating to learn more and then you fall in love with the details, not

1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:54.720
 just with some kind of ethereal thing.

1:31:54.720 --> 1:31:55.720
 Yeah.

1:31:55.720 --> 1:31:56.720
 You don't know.

1:31:56.720 --> 1:31:57.720
 Yeah.

1:31:57.720 --> 1:32:03.720
 I think one of them actually is somebody who doesn't have that kind of, I mean, plenty

1:32:03.720 --> 1:32:07.240
 of people are private and they don't put stuff out about themselves online for all kinds

1:32:07.240 --> 1:32:08.640
 of very valid reasons.

1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:17.120
 But somebody who does share a lot about themselves personally is, maybe there's examples, but

1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:20.560
 it's probably not a sociopath if they're sharing all kinds of.

1:32:20.560 --> 1:32:21.560
 Sure, sure.

1:32:21.560 --> 1:32:29.600
 But on the other side, when you meet people, yeah, I still like the falling in love because

1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:32.920
 the red flags, whether you see them early or later, it doesn't matter.

1:32:32.920 --> 1:32:34.600
 I'd rather see the red flags right away.

1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:46.600
 I go in hard intensely to clarify it, but going hard, I mean, no small talk.

1:32:46.600 --> 1:32:47.920
 Just get to know a person.

1:32:47.920 --> 1:32:50.040
 Get to know quickly.

1:32:50.040 --> 1:32:51.880
 Get to know the person, challenge.

1:32:51.880 --> 1:32:52.880
 Travel with them.

1:32:52.880 --> 1:32:56.720
 Travel with them is a really powerful one, road trip from hell or not.

1:32:56.720 --> 1:33:00.520
 Go on a road trip and find out if it's a road trip from hell, yeah.

1:33:00.520 --> 1:33:01.520
 But you might.

1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:02.920
 So there was somebody I was in it.

1:33:02.920 --> 1:33:04.480
 This is also a male perspective.

1:33:04.480 --> 1:33:09.920
 Destructive relationship with where we had already fallen in love and then went for the

1:33:09.920 --> 1:33:17.680
 first trip in a situation where we had to borrow, I guess he was still sharing his car

1:33:17.680 --> 1:33:22.560
 with his ex wife, so we had to go to the garage to pick up the car to go on this little trip.

1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:26.560
 So you literally baggage the egg.

1:33:26.560 --> 1:33:27.560
 Yeah.

1:33:27.560 --> 1:33:28.560
 Wow.

1:33:28.560 --> 1:33:36.320
 But something happened where the garage attendant was like wanted more identification and it

1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:38.000
 was a pain in the ass.

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:45.960
 Anyway, this guy was so unbelievably rude to the garage attendant, like just nasty and

1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:52.840
 I was completely shocked and disturbed and we got in the car for this long car ride and

1:33:52.840 --> 1:34:00.080
 I was like not saying anything and really shocked and then he noticed that and was very

1:34:00.080 --> 1:34:06.320
 concerned and I explained, you know, like I just, I never, I would never treat somebody

1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:13.600
 that way and then he pretended to get incredibly upset and to feel horrible and remorseful

1:34:13.600 --> 1:34:17.840
 about it and it was like all we talked about for the next few hours.

1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:23.000
 And then I kind of thought like, well, okay, you know, I can get over that and then the

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:27.640
 relationship continued and it was a dark and destructive one, whereas, you know, had I

1:34:27.640 --> 1:34:36.080
 seen him behave that way before we were in a relationship, I would have known to back

1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:37.080
 away.

1:34:37.080 --> 1:34:38.080
 Okay.

1:34:38.080 --> 1:34:40.480
 But the lesson, you could still walk away.

1:34:40.480 --> 1:34:42.320
 You could still walk away.

1:34:42.320 --> 1:34:43.840
 No, you can't.

1:34:43.840 --> 1:34:48.560
 Well, I could have walked away at any point with, I call him Mr. Fox because it's sort

1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:56.160
 of depersonalizes him, but I could have walked away from him at any point in time, but that's

1:34:56.160 --> 1:35:02.520
 the whole, that's kind of the whole point of what they do and the whole reason why people

1:35:02.520 --> 1:35:04.760
 don't understand it.

1:35:04.760 --> 1:35:09.120
 I mean, it's like being in a cult of one.

1:35:09.120 --> 1:35:15.360
 So the people who've been in cults and gotten out, we understand each other very well because

1:35:15.360 --> 1:35:23.040
 the same psychology was used, the same psychological tactics were used on us.

1:35:23.040 --> 1:35:26.120
 And then we experienced the same thing on the other side of it, which is it's hard for

1:35:26.120 --> 1:35:29.120
 us to understand and it's hard for other people to understand.

1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:32.640
 And everybody's saying that would never happen to me or they're saying, I don't get it because

1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:33.640
 you're smart.

1:35:33.640 --> 1:35:34.640
 How could you let that happen?

1:35:34.640 --> 1:35:35.640
 Why didn't you leave?

1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:37.040
 Why didn't you walk away?

1:35:37.040 --> 1:35:42.040
 And on the other side of it, we don't have the answers or it takes a really long time

1:35:42.040 --> 1:35:48.520
 of self reflection and reading and investigation to try and figure out how it is that it happened

1:35:48.520 --> 1:35:50.480
 and why didn't we walk away?

1:35:50.480 --> 1:35:54.360
 No, it's definitely hard at every level.

1:35:54.360 --> 1:36:04.560
 And I just think that even for more subtle sort of not outrageously toxic relationships

1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:08.480
 but like normal toxic, not normal, like a little bit toxic relationship.

1:36:08.480 --> 1:36:10.680
 There are some people that kind of thrive on conflict.

1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:13.840
 Yeah, but you could just still just be self aware.

1:36:13.840 --> 1:36:21.120
 Like I think you've talked about, give yourself time to think about the red flags and like

1:36:21.120 --> 1:36:23.120
 I pride myself on being able to walk away.

1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:33.120
 You have to think like, is this the kind of thing I can live with in friendship and business

1:36:33.120 --> 1:36:40.000
 partners and because the little things that bother you turn out to be big things down

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000
 the line.

1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:49.080
 Yeah, so it could be less romantic, but I feel like getting to know somebody slowly

1:36:49.080 --> 1:36:50.080
 over time is...

1:36:50.080 --> 1:36:51.280
 Yeah, it's the smarter thing.

1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:52.280
 It's safer.

1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:53.280
 Fuck it though.

1:36:53.280 --> 1:37:01.680
 But that's again my Russian slash Ukrainian male perspective.

1:37:01.680 --> 1:37:09.680
 Anyway, so meeting Mr. Fox, Anthony.

1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:12.880
 That's a chapter title in my book, meeting Mr. Fox.

1:37:12.880 --> 1:37:13.880
 Meeting Mr. Fox.

1:37:13.880 --> 1:37:17.600
 So you're working on a book about this.

1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:18.600
 I'm almost done.

1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:20.760
 It's taken a really long time.

1:37:20.760 --> 1:37:23.560
 Can you define almost done?

1:37:23.560 --> 1:37:30.360
 Because I've said that it's like when people say like they're leaving, like I'm almost

1:37:30.360 --> 1:37:38.200
 in the car and they're not really, they haven't even started the showering yet or something.

1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:39.200
 So...

1:37:39.200 --> 1:37:44.720
 Yeah, I think I probably need some like therapist to work with me on this.

1:37:44.720 --> 1:37:46.960
 Are you usually late to things?

1:37:46.960 --> 1:37:47.960
 No.

1:37:47.960 --> 1:37:48.960
 Okay.

1:37:48.960 --> 1:37:54.400
 I'm usually, oh, I sent you a text message because I was early when I got here.

1:37:54.400 --> 1:38:04.400
 And I said that because of, I think I said my crippling fear of being late, I'm like

1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:06.520
 always early.

1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:12.640
 So I'm loitering outside like a weirdo, but glad to come in if it's not too early.

1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:16.920
 The crippling fear of being late makes me chronically early and today's no exception.

1:38:16.920 --> 1:38:17.920
 Yeah, it's interesting.

1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:20.920
 So I got here before I rang the bell.

1:38:20.920 --> 1:38:21.920
 Yep.

1:38:21.920 --> 1:38:22.920
 I was outside for a little while.

1:38:22.920 --> 1:38:28.080
 I was just killing time going, I'm way too early, but it's really hot out.

1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:29.600
 Oh, that's true.

1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:34.840
 Yeah, because I always air, like I was very early to the airport and then I had all this

1:38:34.840 --> 1:38:35.840
 time to kill.

1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:42.680
 But that's fine with me because that's actually time I appreciate because I can write things

1:38:42.680 --> 1:38:50.440
 or, you know, I worked on my book draft on the airplane, mostly editing, which it needs

1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:51.920
 a lot because it's really long.

1:38:51.920 --> 1:38:52.920
 It's in word count.

1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:56.000
 So all the things are already completed and you're just editing down?

1:38:56.000 --> 1:39:02.600
 No, I wish it's, it's, it's in five parts and I've written one through four and five,

1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:07.040
 part five is like the chapters are all there, but some of them are messy.

1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:09.440
 Some of them are, or some of them are just like a few paragraphs.

1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:12.000
 Some of them are just notes.

1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.160
 Some of them are done.

1:39:14.160 --> 1:39:19.920
 So I am kind of almost, it's like five parts and part five is not quite finished.

1:39:19.920 --> 1:39:20.920
 What did you?

1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:23.960
 But I've been editing along the way.

1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:27.760
 So this is going to come out in 2023, I think you mentioned.

1:39:27.760 --> 1:39:33.080
 So it won't come out for a bit or we'll figure it out.

1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:37.520
 What have you learned about yourself from putting some of these things down on paper?

1:39:37.520 --> 1:39:41.360
 What's like the darkest thing you've realized about yourself?

1:39:41.360 --> 1:39:42.360
 From writing?

1:39:42.360 --> 1:39:49.640
 The darkest, well, one of the things that was fascinating is reading through all of

1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:53.320
 our, the correspondence between him and me that I was able to find, because he deleted

1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:57.680
 all our emails, but he, he didn't, I think he thought he deleted all of our G chats,

1:39:57.680 --> 1:39:58.680
 but he didn't.

1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.560
 Well, so he had access to your email, he deleted on that side too.

1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:07.920
 And he deleted, yeah, he had access to my email most of the time.

1:40:07.920 --> 1:40:13.200
 And then at the end was also emailing people as me, which was incredibly mortifying to

1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:17.520
 come home and then get back into my old email and find that.

1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:22.600
 And I think he was also texting people as me, and those I'll never know unless somebody

1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:28.560
 brings it to my attention, because after a certain date in 2015, he had my phone and

1:40:28.560 --> 1:40:30.880
 he had exclusive access to my phone and email.

1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:39.040
 So I wasn't looking at it until I got out, until after we were arrested, and I was out

1:40:39.040 --> 1:40:43.000
 on bail on my sisters, and it took me a long time to get back into my Gmail because I had

1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:48.880
 to verify who I am, and I never got my phone back, so I don't know what he texted to other

1:40:48.880 --> 1:40:52.360
 people as me after that time.

1:40:52.360 --> 1:41:02.320
 But anyway, I was able to recover a lot of our G chats, which we use that, I don't know

1:41:02.320 --> 1:41:05.400
 why people don't use it anymore, but it used to be a thing.

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:06.400
 Yeah.

1:41:06.400 --> 1:41:09.520
 It was like, if you work with people and you use Gmail, it's a really easy way to just

1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:10.520
 message back and forth.

1:41:10.520 --> 1:41:15.240
 It's a chat client within Google, but I think Google shut it down already right now.

1:41:15.240 --> 1:41:16.640
 I think it's still there.

1:41:16.640 --> 1:41:17.640
 Okay.

1:41:17.640 --> 1:41:18.640
 I don't know.

1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:23.360
 And nobody, I used to talk to people on there, and nobody talked to me anymore, and so I

1:41:23.360 --> 1:41:24.360
 rather...

1:41:24.360 --> 1:41:25.360
 I watch you.

1:41:25.360 --> 1:41:26.360
 Thank you.

1:41:26.360 --> 1:41:29.600
 I just, I don't, yeah.

1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:33.240
 People don't love Google social products for some reason.

1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:38.240
 The social network they tried several times, Google Plus, it just dies out.

1:41:38.240 --> 1:41:39.240
 Something about it.

1:41:39.240 --> 1:41:42.720
 Like when Microsoft tries to do stuff, it just doesn't feel right.

1:41:42.720 --> 1:41:48.160
 Anyway, it is very lonely, and that Google chat window makes total sense though.

1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:50.920
 Anyway, so that was still there, so you're reading through them.

1:41:50.920 --> 1:41:56.160
 So finding, being able to go back and read, and then I kept finding like more layers of

1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:04.400
 stuff, and including a journal that I didn't find the DA, the prosecutor found.

1:42:04.400 --> 1:42:05.400
 Written by...

1:42:05.400 --> 1:42:07.760
 Me, my journal that I thought he'd thrown away.

1:42:07.760 --> 1:42:08.920
 I didn't know it existed.

1:42:08.920 --> 1:42:19.320
 So somehow we still had it, and they found my journal, which was for the year 2014,

1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:21.000
 in the very beginning of 2015.

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.000
 This is after you got, this is in the middle of it.

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:26.000
 It was in the middle of it, yeah.

1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.360
 So reading that was fascinating.

1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:33.040
 Yeah, what's some interesting things there?

1:42:33.040 --> 1:42:38.200
 Was it, was your mind completely detached?

1:42:38.200 --> 1:42:41.120
 It was weird because, no.

1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:43.120
 Were you concerned?

1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:44.120
 Were you in love?

1:42:44.120 --> 1:42:45.120
 Were you afraid?

1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:46.120
 I was not in love.

1:42:46.120 --> 1:42:47.120
 I was afraid.

1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:50.880
 I definitely write repeatedly in there that I'm afraid of him.

1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:55.600
 I also write repeatedly things like, I don't know what's going on, like please let this

1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:58.760
 be over, please let this be over, please let this be over.

1:42:58.760 --> 1:43:04.080
 And then in a sort of, if I try to remove myself and look at it as if I was a different

1:43:04.080 --> 1:43:12.600
 person, it's sort of heartbreaking because I was trying so hard to be positive.

1:43:12.600 --> 1:43:16.200
 And that didn't work out, you know, I was trying to be positive.

1:43:16.200 --> 1:43:27.280
 So when I, it turned up later in the process and my lawyer at the time called or something

1:43:27.280 --> 1:43:34.600
 and said, you know, the DA has your, or the prosecutor, they have your journal, I haven't

1:43:34.600 --> 1:43:38.400
 read it yet, but as soon as I get a PDF copy, I'll send it to you.

1:43:38.400 --> 1:43:42.600
 So that was sort of weird to think that everybody's reading my journal, which, you know, you

1:43:42.600 --> 1:43:45.720
 don't write it thinking people are going to read, unless you're like a historical person

1:43:45.720 --> 1:43:50.080
 and then later on you think people are going to print from it.

1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:52.200
 But you know, nobody's writing a journal.

1:43:52.200 --> 1:43:57.480
 I can just imagine like a, like a 14 year old thinking they're going to be a historical

1:43:57.480 --> 1:43:58.480
 person.

1:43:58.480 --> 1:43:59.480
 Right.

1:43:59.480 --> 1:44:01.480
 Well, no, I mean, like, you know, presidents who keep journals and then they're later

1:44:01.480 --> 1:44:02.480
 on.

1:44:02.480 --> 1:44:03.480
 Sure.

1:44:03.480 --> 1:44:04.480
 Sure.

1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:05.480
 Sure.

1:44:05.480 --> 1:44:06.480
 Yeah.

1:44:06.480 --> 1:44:07.480
 So you write it, you don't think anybody's going to read it.

1:44:07.480 --> 1:44:08.480
 And so that was a weird feeling.

1:44:08.480 --> 1:44:14.640
 And then also just not knowing, having, you know, not remembering what I wrote.

1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:20.520
 So I think it was the next day I got, she sent me a PDF copy of it and I read it really

1:44:20.520 --> 1:44:21.760
 quickly because I could read my own.

1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:26.560
 It was a PDF, so it was like Xeroxes of the pages, so it was in my own handwriting, which

1:44:26.560 --> 1:44:30.160
 I could read really fast because even though it's messy, I wrote it so I could read it

1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:31.160
 really fast.

1:44:31.160 --> 1:44:37.240
 And I read the whole thing and was crying because I thought, okay, finally, like, surely

1:44:37.240 --> 1:44:41.120
 nobody could read this and think that I intended to commit crimes.

1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:46.320
 And so I thought, like, I thought that journal was just going to fully exonerate me and they

1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:51.920
 would like, you know, if not drop the charges, like it would just be like, okay, well, you

1:44:51.920 --> 1:44:58.200
 know, some bad things happened, you're responsible, you know, here's probation.

1:44:58.200 --> 1:45:02.480
 But it didn't seem to make any difference, which was strange.

1:45:02.480 --> 1:45:09.040
 But anyway, so the journal and then also finding all of the correspondence between,

1:45:09.040 --> 1:45:12.360
 not all of the correspondence between him and me, but the G chat correspondence between

1:45:12.360 --> 1:45:19.680
 him and me, to me, so, you know, all of that in its entire, like, I wish that everything

1:45:19.680 --> 1:45:24.400
 could have been kind of put out there as evidence, like the more they turned up the

1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:28.640
 better for me because I wanted them to see everything.

1:45:28.640 --> 1:45:32.640
 And there are just so many examples in the correspondence between him and me where he's,

1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:39.360
 you know, threatening me and, you know, lying to me and telling me that if I don't do what

1:45:39.360 --> 1:45:42.680
 he says, my whole life will be destroyed and I'll lose everything I ever cared about, all

1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:43.800
 kinds of things like that.

1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:50.960
 But what was, what I still don't quite understand and what one of my lawyers said why all of

1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:57.640
 that wasn't as useful as I thought it might be is because so much of that correspondence,

1:45:57.640 --> 1:46:04.200
 I'm like, sarcastically, angrily, I'm yelling at him, I'm mad at him, I'm like, fuck you,

1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:07.760
 I'm making fun of him, I call him names.

1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:10.720
 I'll say to him, like, you're lying, why should I believe you?

1:46:10.720 --> 1:46:13.920
 You told me you'd pay me back before, but you didn't.

1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:19.720
 So it seems like it doesn't, it seems like it doesn't make sense, like, how is it that

1:46:19.720 --> 1:46:25.800
 if I say to him, you're a lying, you're a liar, that I still, but so then what would

1:46:25.800 --> 1:46:30.760
 happen is I'm reading those, that correspondence and then it stops for a while, maybe because

1:46:30.760 --> 1:46:33.600
 I was with him in person.

1:46:33.600 --> 1:46:37.800
 And then I'll look at my timeline of things and I'll see, like, oh, I sent him a wire

1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:38.800
 for $80,000.

1:46:38.800 --> 1:46:39.800
 Yeah.

1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:49.800
 How do you explain your ability to still joke around and also to be mean to him in a joking

1:46:49.800 --> 1:46:50.800
 way?

1:46:50.800 --> 1:46:57.320
 You know, couples can do that, I guess, like, I mean, there's like cruel ways of doing that

1:46:57.320 --> 1:47:01.840
 and then there's like humorous ways, just like you're talking shit, whatever.

1:47:01.840 --> 1:47:07.840
 You were able to do that still and yet you're sending over the money and are afraid.

1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:12.520
 Like, how can you be those two things?

1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:15.000
 Like, as opposed to completely shutting down.

1:47:15.000 --> 1:47:16.000
 Yeah.

1:47:16.000 --> 1:47:17.000
 Well, I don't know.

1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:20.240
 I mean, these are all interesting questions that I have as well, like, how is it that

1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:25.880
 I was functional and yet also doing these things.

1:47:25.880 --> 1:47:31.760
 And so the year that we were gone is like a different level because I no longer was running

1:47:31.760 --> 1:47:32.760
 the business.

1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:38.600
 But the thing about dissociation is that you're functioning, but like your feelings and your

1:47:38.600 --> 1:47:41.760
 thinking are detached in some way.

1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:46.200
 So that like your functioning and people wouldn't look at you and go, oh, that person's dissociating

1:47:46.200 --> 1:47:51.640
 because you're functioning, you seem normal, but somehow in your head, you're like disconnecting

1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:54.440
 your feelings and your thinking.

1:47:54.440 --> 1:48:00.560
 So you're still able to be like the game of social interaction, like being witty and

1:48:00.560 --> 1:48:02.760
 so on, all that kind of stuff, you're still...

1:48:02.760 --> 1:48:07.400
 For me, I think it's like a coping mechanism too because if I went, I haven't been to a

1:48:07.400 --> 1:48:15.760
 funeral a long time, but if I went, I'd probably like find absurd thing or I'll tend to like

1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:20.880
 either make jokes or want to make jokes at really inappropriate times, even in tragic

1:48:20.880 --> 1:48:25.320
 times, because it's almost like a defense mechanism, I think.

1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:30.720
 Like you said, you told me you like dark humor, yeah.

1:48:30.720 --> 1:48:34.120
 My next door neighbor is Michael Malis, he's an anarchist.

1:48:34.120 --> 1:48:36.800
 I have one of his books.

1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:37.800
 The Hero.

1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:38.800
 Dear Reader.

1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:39.800
 Dear Reader, yeah.

1:48:39.800 --> 1:48:45.640
 And he loves, he embodies dark humor, trolling in dark humor and is underneath of the sweetest

1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:46.640
 human being.

1:48:46.640 --> 1:48:54.040
 Because he's writing a book now, The White Pill, that's really focused on Stalin and

1:48:54.040 --> 1:48:55.040
 Hollermore.

1:48:55.040 --> 1:49:00.280
 There's basically atrocities throughout the 20th century and I think he needs the dark

1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:02.520
 humor to release the valve.

1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:06.520
 I think there's something about incredibly good...

1:49:06.520 --> 1:49:12.880
 The most offensive comedians tend to have the kindest hearts, I think.

1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:14.320
 This is my theory.

1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:21.360
 People like Ricky Gervais, who goes out and insults people and makes jokes that people

1:49:21.360 --> 1:49:30.440
 find horribly offensive and crude and yet is a huge animal rights guy and appears to

1:49:30.440 --> 1:49:35.080
 be an incredibly sweet and kind person and sensitive.

1:49:35.080 --> 1:49:43.120
 And Howard Stern, people who are incredibly crude very often are, in my experience, to

1:49:43.120 --> 1:49:49.120
 the extent that I've gotten either to know people personally, observe them, learn about

1:49:49.120 --> 1:49:57.880
 them in other ways, but almost like the more crude and offensive the comedian or the person,

1:49:57.880 --> 1:49:59.120
 they tend to have the kindest...

1:49:59.120 --> 1:50:02.480
 Yeah, I don't know if it's a universal rule, but yeah, I see what you mean.

1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:04.720
 And you lost me with Howard Stern.

1:50:04.720 --> 1:50:06.360
 He seems like not a good person.

1:50:06.360 --> 1:50:07.760
 Oh, no, he's such a good person.

1:50:07.760 --> 1:50:08.760
 Underneath it.

1:50:08.760 --> 1:50:09.760
 Oh, yeah.

1:50:09.760 --> 1:50:10.760
 Such a good person.

1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:15.560
 So I'm friends with Rogan, he said so many ignorant things about Rogan, but I suppose

1:50:15.560 --> 1:50:17.080
 that's...

1:50:17.080 --> 1:50:18.080
 So I haven't heard...

1:50:18.080 --> 1:50:20.880
 I haven't listened to Howard Stern in a long time.

1:50:20.880 --> 1:50:27.720
 And I also think that people who say bad things about Rogan don't listen to his podcast.

1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:31.520
 Because if I've listened to his podcast and people think that...

1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:35.280
 I think people would assume that I don't like him because...

1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:40.200
 Or the whole like vegan thing and he's all about meat and they would think that I would

1:50:40.200 --> 1:50:41.200
 think...

1:50:41.200 --> 1:50:42.200
 No.

1:50:42.200 --> 1:50:45.960
 I mean, because I've listened to enough of his podcast, I've heard the one where he

1:50:45.960 --> 1:50:48.880
 talked about why he hunts.

1:50:48.880 --> 1:50:57.400
 And whereas if I only knew him via his Instagram, I might think he's an asshole.

1:50:57.400 --> 1:50:59.280
 But having listened to all of his...

1:50:59.280 --> 1:51:00.280
 Not all of...

1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:01.280
 I don't listen to all of them.

1:51:01.280 --> 1:51:02.280
 There's a ton of them.

1:51:02.280 --> 1:51:08.520
 But having listened to a lot of his podcasts enough to know that he's an extremely kind

1:51:08.520 --> 1:51:11.320
 of person with all the best intentions.

1:51:11.320 --> 1:51:15.760
 And I think that all out of that judgment comes from people who are just seeing little

1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:16.760
 clips.

1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:19.840
 Because it's probably easy to take little clips from him that sound.

1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:20.840
 Yeah.

1:51:20.840 --> 1:51:25.040
 The lesson there is just not make judgments on people without getting to know them, especially

1:51:25.040 --> 1:51:28.240
 and you have no excuse when the content is out there, like don't be lazy.

1:51:28.240 --> 1:51:29.240
 Yeah.

1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:30.240
 I try.

1:51:30.240 --> 1:51:31.240
 That's...

1:51:31.240 --> 1:51:32.240
 Yeah.

1:51:32.240 --> 1:51:33.240
 I'm very careful when...

1:51:33.240 --> 1:51:41.320
 You know, a lot of these cases, you know, like the depth hurried thing or Johnny Depp

1:51:41.320 --> 1:51:45.920
 and Elizabeth Holmes and anything like controversial.

1:51:45.920 --> 1:51:52.760
 And sometimes that makes me, I can't think of an example, but very often, like when somebody

1:51:52.760 --> 1:51:56.280
 criticizes something or something becomes controversial, that's what gets me to want

1:51:56.280 --> 1:51:57.680
 to understand it better.

1:51:57.680 --> 1:52:00.200
 So then I'll go like read the book that everybody's mad about.

1:52:00.200 --> 1:52:01.200
 Yeah.

1:52:01.200 --> 1:52:02.200
 It's hard to know what's true though.

1:52:02.200 --> 1:52:07.520
 I tried to have humility and always assume I don't really know the full story and keep

1:52:07.520 --> 1:52:09.880
 pulling at the strength, keep learning more and more.

1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:14.680
 But even then, like, the more you learn, the more you realize the things that complex.

1:52:14.680 --> 1:52:22.440
 What do you think about as a small tangent, Johnny Depp, Amber Heard, trials going on?

1:52:22.440 --> 1:52:26.160
 The quick pause, it's going to resume next week.

1:52:26.160 --> 1:52:30.680
 So again, this is one of those situations where, you know, I have very limited information

1:52:30.680 --> 1:52:32.880
 because I'm also not sitting there watching the trial.

1:52:32.880 --> 1:52:33.880
 Yeah.

1:52:33.880 --> 1:52:34.880
 Have you watched any of it?

1:52:34.880 --> 1:52:35.880
 Little bits of it.

1:52:35.880 --> 1:52:39.960
 And it's like, I know that if I go there, then I'm going to want to watch it all.

1:52:39.960 --> 1:52:40.960
 Yeah.

1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:41.960
 It's good.

1:52:41.960 --> 1:52:42.960
 I know.

1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:49.280
 Because it's raw human relationships that is most toxic and it's most deep also because

1:52:49.280 --> 1:52:52.920
 there's, you can tell there's love, probably still there's love, which is the interesting

1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:53.920
 thing.

1:52:53.920 --> 1:52:57.880
 They probably still love each other even though they hate each other.

1:52:57.880 --> 1:53:00.560
 And like, there's a lot of lying going on.

1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:05.160
 It looks like it's Amber Heard lying to my foolish eyes.

1:53:05.160 --> 1:53:07.760
 It seems like she's lying nonstop.

1:53:07.760 --> 1:53:13.200
 But you know, I want to know the full story and we'll never get to know it, but you see

1:53:13.200 --> 1:53:19.600
 this raw like postmortem on a relationship on a love affair that was clearly passionate.

1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:25.080
 There was clearly something deep of a connection there and it just, that's the sad thing about

1:53:25.080 --> 1:53:26.080
 love.

1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:28.480
 It can destroy you as much as it can uplift you.

1:53:28.480 --> 1:53:31.440
 It can be also used to destroy people.

1:53:31.440 --> 1:53:32.440
 Yeah.

1:53:32.440 --> 1:53:33.840
 To manipulate and all that kind of stuff.

1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:34.840
 Yeah.

1:53:34.840 --> 1:53:35.840
 Right.

1:53:35.840 --> 1:53:44.080
 So people who feel that strongly are, I think, particularly vulnerable, yeah, it's hard

1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:52.000
 to talk about because I've dipped into like a podcast or something where other people

1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:57.480
 are discussing bad vegan in like a pop culture way and they're analyzing it and it's so

1:53:57.480 --> 1:54:00.480
 annoying to listen to because I'm like, oh my God, that's totally wrong.

1:54:00.480 --> 1:54:01.480
 That's totally wrong.

1:54:01.480 --> 1:54:04.160
 Well, if they only knew this, well, I have, nope, that's wrong.

1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:12.240
 So listening to other people analyzing my situation or my psychology when they don't

1:54:12.240 --> 1:54:14.160
 have all the information has been really frustrating.

1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:15.560
 There's a difference.

1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:16.560
 I did.

1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:21.120
 There's a difference because the world doesn't know much about you except for the Netflix

1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:22.120
 documentary.

1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:23.120
 Right.

1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:26.560
 There's a lot more information about both Johnny Depp and Amber Heard and the trial

1:54:26.560 --> 1:54:28.480
 is revealing the real people.

1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:29.480
 This one is so interesting.

1:54:29.480 --> 1:54:30.880
 But I haven't watched it all.

1:54:30.880 --> 1:54:31.880
 Okay.

1:54:31.880 --> 1:54:37.400
 But there's a difference in a documentary and like a raw human being sitting there.

1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:43.000
 You can see the body language and it's so interesting that I think you could tell the

1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:50.280
 difference between a person who is full of shit and not, I mean, I'm not sure.

1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:51.280
 Yeah.

1:54:51.280 --> 1:54:52.800
 It's another, I'm going to, I can't remember.

1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:58.280
 Sorry, I keep interrupting you, but on top of this, they're actors too, which is very

1:54:58.280 --> 1:54:59.280
 annoying.

1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:00.280
 Right.

1:55:00.280 --> 1:55:01.280
 Exactly.

1:55:01.280 --> 1:55:03.480
 Because like, I don't know if they're putting it, be sure as hell it looks like Amber Heard

1:55:03.480 --> 1:55:11.520
 is putting on like a soap opera act, soap opera meaning like really bad acting and lies.

1:55:11.520 --> 1:55:15.560
 But I would say all of these things are really hard.

1:55:15.560 --> 1:55:19.960
 People would say about me, I don't look like a victim and I don't mind you interrupting

1:55:19.960 --> 1:55:23.400
 me because Andrew Huberman said that means you're interested in the conversation.

1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:26.520
 He said it was a good thing.

1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:32.000
 So you don't have to apologize for interrupting me, he keeps coming up, but I keep thinking

1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:33.000
 of these.

1:55:33.000 --> 1:55:36.960
 That's one of the things that Andrew told me that I'm like, are you sure?

1:55:36.960 --> 1:55:39.200
 Cause it just doesn't seem like an asshole thing to do.

1:55:39.200 --> 1:55:40.200
 I don't.

1:55:40.200 --> 1:55:41.200
 I guess it depends on the context.

1:55:41.200 --> 1:55:45.840
 If we were in a business meeting and somebody talks over you to kind of make their point

1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:52.280
 and heard, but if it's a one on one situation, then it's not anyway, but so a long time

1:55:52.280 --> 1:55:58.160
 ago I listened to, there was a audio call, an audio that was released of a taped argument

1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:01.600
 between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.

1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:05.400
 And I don't remember why, like which one of them had taped it and if they knew it was

1:56:05.400 --> 1:56:07.960
 being taped, but it was like an hour and a half.

1:56:07.960 --> 1:56:10.760
 And I listened to it almost like you would listen to a podcast where I was doing other

1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:14.360
 things was like cleaning my apartment and I was fascinated listening to it.

1:56:14.360 --> 1:56:15.360
 To a fight.

1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:19.760
 And it's interesting too, cause it was just the audio not, so you're not looking at their

1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:23.640
 body language, which can be completely misleading.

1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:29.080
 And there was another podcast where they talked about how judges make worse decisions on whether

1:56:29.080 --> 1:56:33.640
 or not somebody deserves, you know, parole or to be released on bail when they see the

1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:39.520
 person in person versus if they're just looking at the information on paper.

1:56:39.520 --> 1:56:45.480
 So I think body language and those kinds of things can be, can actually be misleading.

1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:49.320
 Or we think that like by looking somebody in the eye will know if they're lying or not,

1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:57.600
 but the skilled liars are able to bypass that or they, because I'm jumping all over the

1:56:57.600 --> 1:57:01.920
 place, but one of the things about sociopaths is they're not going to have the same tell.

1:57:01.920 --> 1:57:07.040
 So like if I was lying, somebody would know because I'm like stressed out, mortified.

1:57:07.040 --> 1:57:11.320
 I'm probably doing all the things that we do when we lie cause it's stressful for me.

1:57:11.320 --> 1:57:14.320
 Whereas they don't have those things.

1:57:14.320 --> 1:57:18.120
 So I think that, you know, they could, for example, I think that they could pass a lie

1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:19.760
 detector test.

1:57:19.760 --> 1:57:22.560
 They also don't have like a startle response.

1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:28.880
 So the activity in their brain, like if you and I watched something graphic and tragic

1:57:28.880 --> 1:57:33.360
 on TV or watched something happen, like things would happen in our brains that don't happen

1:57:33.360 --> 1:57:34.640
 in the brains of sociopaths.

1:57:34.640 --> 1:57:39.440
 So they don't react to things in the same way that, that we do, but that makes them

1:57:39.440 --> 1:57:40.800
 assuming I'm not associated.

1:57:40.800 --> 1:57:45.080
 I didn't say I'm not associated about this assumption you keep making is very interesting.

1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:46.920
 Then why did I murder all those people?

1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:50.120
 Let's get back to the, what were we talking about?

1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:51.120
 Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.

1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:57.880
 So the audio that I heard made me, without knowing anything else, made me very inclined

1:57:57.880 --> 1:58:03.760
 to be team Johnny Depp based on that, based just based on that audio.

1:58:03.760 --> 1:58:04.760
 Yeah.

1:58:04.760 --> 1:58:07.640
 Well, that's how the people are feeling about this whole interaction.

1:58:07.640 --> 1:58:11.000
 By the way, I do think it's a very healthy thing to do in a relationship is to record

1:58:11.000 --> 1:58:13.680
 each other for months at a time.

1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:17.200
 Every time you fight, that just seems like a very, that's sarcasm.

1:58:17.200 --> 1:58:21.240
 I don't, I don't understand how that, because they both recorded each other.

1:58:21.240 --> 1:58:26.360
 It, it's just, I mean, I suppose you could look back at all human relations and be like,

1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:27.360
 this was ridiculous.

1:58:27.360 --> 1:58:29.720
 What was I doing?

1:58:29.720 --> 1:58:31.640
 But when you're in it, you don't.

1:58:31.640 --> 1:58:32.640
 Right.

1:58:32.640 --> 1:58:39.040
 I wondered that too, like who made the recording and why and, and did they both know about

1:58:39.040 --> 1:58:41.720
 it, that it was being recorded?

1:58:41.720 --> 1:58:44.280
 Sometimes they did, sometimes they didn't.

1:58:44.280 --> 1:58:53.960
 All I know is just the poetry of Johnny Depp's speaking and sort of movement about the whole

1:58:53.960 --> 1:58:54.960
 thing.

1:58:54.960 --> 1:58:55.960
 It's interesting.

1:58:55.960 --> 1:58:58.120
 It's, it makes you wonder what's real.

1:58:58.120 --> 1:59:03.560
 Maybe this is whole, maybe, maybe they're both in love and this is like a troll that

1:59:03.560 --> 1:59:04.560
 they played on the world.

1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:05.560
 I don't know.

1:59:05.560 --> 1:59:09.200
 It's, it makes me wonder what's real at all.

1:59:09.200 --> 1:59:13.920
 Like, I, because there, you have to remember their actors too.

1:59:13.920 --> 1:59:14.920
 Yeah.

1:59:14.920 --> 1:59:17.760
 I don't think he would have filed the lawsuit if he was.

1:59:17.760 --> 1:59:18.760
 No, I mean, I'm joking.

1:59:18.760 --> 1:59:24.960
 No, I know, but, but, no, I mean, my point is, um, yes, yeah, if somebody was trying to

1:59:24.960 --> 1:59:31.120
 make the argument that like he's the abuser and that he's lying and he's full of shit,

1:59:31.120 --> 1:59:36.240
 it sort of doesn't make sense that he would have filed the lawsuit unless he's trying to

1:59:36.240 --> 1:59:43.240
 have this all come out in the open because he believes he's in the right.

1:59:43.240 --> 1:59:44.840
 You know, again, I don't, I have no idea.

1:59:44.840 --> 1:59:45.840
 I agree with you.

1:59:45.840 --> 1:59:46.840
 I agree with you.

1:59:46.840 --> 1:59:51.320
 As a fan of love and human nature, I appreciate the fact that they went through this.

1:59:51.320 --> 1:59:58.480
 I know it's probably extremely painful, but it's, it's fascinating to watch human relationships

1:59:58.480 --> 2:00:03.240
 be presented in such a raw way and so it made me realize how rare it is to get a glimpse

2:00:03.240 --> 2:00:04.240
 like that.

2:00:04.240 --> 2:00:05.240
 Yeah.

2:00:05.240 --> 2:00:08.680
 And I think one of the reasons I like that book, Confessions of a Sociopath, also is

2:00:08.680 --> 2:00:12.560
 it's, you know, female who's writing it.

2:00:12.560 --> 2:00:18.720
 And I think statistically men are more likely to be sociopaths, maybe not.

2:00:18.720 --> 2:00:27.160
 I mean, these are all things where a lot of times there exist statistics that would be

2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:29.320
 inherently hard to get.

2:00:29.320 --> 2:00:31.000
 So who knows.

2:00:31.000 --> 2:00:38.240
 But I think that people tend to think of sociopaths more as men and then, which probably gives

2:00:38.240 --> 2:00:46.480
 female sociopaths the advantage in that people are less likely to, like the Elizabeth Holmes,

2:00:46.480 --> 2:00:52.040
 like people who are really manipulative and really good at it.

2:00:52.040 --> 2:00:56.920
 And part of how they're able to succeed is that people don't understand their motives

2:00:56.920 --> 2:01:00.840
 or people will assume that people behave rationally.

2:01:00.840 --> 2:01:06.960
 Even if rationally means, it's like Anthony Stranges, you know, it would have made more

2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:11.680
 sense if he had gotten all this money out of me and, you know, put it in an overseas

2:01:11.680 --> 2:01:14.960
 account and then ditched me and got on a plane to Mexico.

2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:22.200
 Like everybody would understand that more, whereas, you know, the way things happened

2:01:22.200 --> 2:01:25.400
 and he dragged me around the country and like, what were we doing in Tennessee?

2:01:25.400 --> 2:01:30.480
 And then why didn't like, nothing really makes any sense.

2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:39.440
 But and also all of the things that he did to me and had me do, it was as if all of those

2:01:39.440 --> 2:01:47.000
 things together only make sense if his primary goal was to maximally destroy me and also

2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:51.920
 make it like have me burn all my bridges and make it so I'll never recover.

2:01:51.920 --> 2:01:56.960
 And when you read a book like that, you understand that that's, that's what he wanted.

2:01:56.960 --> 2:01:58.960
 Like that's his life.

2:01:58.960 --> 2:02:00.680
 So can you explain that further?

2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:02.080
 Like what, what do you think?

2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:03.840
 It's about power and it's a game.

2:02:03.840 --> 2:02:08.720
 Do you think he understood the long term goals he has or was it the short term game of it

2:02:08.720 --> 2:02:11.000
 that he enjoyed, the ability to destroy you?

2:02:11.000 --> 2:02:13.680
 Well, yeah, it was the short term game of it.

2:02:13.680 --> 2:02:15.200
 Because control another human?

2:02:15.200 --> 2:02:16.200
 Yeah.

2:02:16.200 --> 2:02:23.320
 And also I think for him, like, their motivations are just different.

2:02:23.320 --> 2:02:28.760
 So, you know, he spent a year incarcerated because he never got out on bail, but then

2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:30.040
 he got out.

2:02:30.040 --> 2:02:32.720
 He's out of prison though.

2:02:32.720 --> 2:02:43.240
 He got out before I went in to serve my time, which was particularly, you know, like psychologically

2:02:43.240 --> 2:02:52.840
 I had to try really hard not to be infuriated and, but anyway, so I think for him, you know,

2:02:52.840 --> 2:02:57.280
 the consequence of spending time in jail, sort of like an inconvenience, you know, it's

2:02:57.280 --> 2:02:59.400
 like life is a game.

2:02:59.400 --> 2:03:08.000
 And so he wouldn't feel, if you're not capable of being emotionally hurt, then you're, you

2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:13.680
 know, you have immense power because you can go around and do things and people can't hurt

2:03:13.680 --> 2:03:14.680
 you.

2:03:14.680 --> 2:03:15.680
 It's like a superpower.

2:03:15.680 --> 2:03:17.480
 And he did this for people who are not familiar.

2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:19.960
 I guess he did this to other women.

2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:20.960
 Yes.

2:03:20.960 --> 2:03:21.960
 Yes.

2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:31.960
 I think it goes in the documentary that his, I guess, ex wife from somewhere else was Florida.

2:03:31.960 --> 2:03:32.960
 Florida.

2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:33.960
 Of course.

2:03:33.960 --> 2:03:34.960
 Florida.

2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:35.960
 Sorry.

2:03:35.960 --> 2:03:36.960
 Strong words.

2:03:36.960 --> 2:03:44.080
 Well, it's just like when there's the weirdest story about, you know, people eating tied pods

2:03:44.080 --> 2:03:47.880
 and then doing crazy, it's like, it's always in, it's always in Florida.

2:03:47.880 --> 2:03:51.160
 So I feel like whenever crazy things, so to me, it makes sense that he would have spent

2:03:51.160 --> 2:03:52.560
 time in Florida before.

2:03:52.560 --> 2:03:53.560
 And that's where...

2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:54.560
 Crazy in a good way.

2:03:54.560 --> 2:03:56.720
 And I mean that on an insult on him.

2:03:56.720 --> 2:03:59.520
 I also like, she's an amazing person.

2:03:59.520 --> 2:04:05.720
 So it's, it's like, it's him that I'm making the like, Florida is a bit weird.

2:04:05.720 --> 2:04:06.720
 Yes.

2:04:06.720 --> 2:04:10.960
 He manipulated her as well, lied to her, that kind of things.

2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:15.880
 Well, jumping around, but one of the things he said that was disturbing and misleading

2:04:15.880 --> 2:04:18.000
 is the ending of the documentary.

2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:24.680
 And the ending has a phone call, I think, of you and Anthony talking.

2:04:24.680 --> 2:04:27.840
 So what high level, let me ask.

2:04:27.840 --> 2:04:34.400
 How many times have you talked with Anthony since you got out of prison and what did you

2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:35.400
 talk about?

2:04:35.400 --> 2:04:41.880
 And why is that quote misleading, that segment of audio misleading?

2:04:41.880 --> 2:04:49.040
 My issue with it also was that it was deliberately misleading, which was what was particularly

2:04:49.040 --> 2:04:52.800
 infuriating about it.

2:04:52.800 --> 2:04:58.760
 And then also there was, it was like there were things, one major thing that was incorrect

2:04:58.760 --> 2:05:05.400
 that I think helped allow people to make an incorrect conclusion at the end was in the

2:05:05.400 --> 2:05:10.680
 film it talks about, I say something about how my accountant made a joke about if I married

2:05:10.680 --> 2:05:14.320
 him, he could easily transfer me money without tax consequences.

2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:19.880
 And then the film has me saying something like, you know, and then within 24 hours we

2:05:19.880 --> 2:05:24.600
 were married, but that's like audio from here and audio from here spliced together.

2:05:24.600 --> 2:05:28.600
 So they made it seem like there's like, I married him because it was like he could give

2:05:28.600 --> 2:05:30.760
 me money and that wasn't the case.

2:05:30.760 --> 2:05:37.200
 So your part mastermind of some kind of scheme that involve money transfer and you got married

2:05:37.200 --> 2:05:38.200
 and that kind of thing.

2:05:38.200 --> 2:05:39.200
 Right.

2:05:39.200 --> 2:05:42.120
 So like I was trying to get money, that's why I married him.

2:05:42.120 --> 2:05:47.120
 So which is absurd because again, you know, New York is full of legitimate people with

2:05:47.120 --> 2:05:48.120
 loads of money.

2:05:48.120 --> 2:05:52.680
 If I really wanted to marry somebody for money in New York, it wouldn't be that hard to do.

2:05:52.680 --> 2:05:59.160
 But anyway, it was like, it was just a deliberate making it seem like my intention was, you

2:05:59.160 --> 2:06:02.720
 know, to marry him for his fictitious money.

2:06:02.720 --> 2:06:03.720
 Right.

2:06:03.720 --> 2:06:04.720
 Okay.

2:06:04.720 --> 2:06:05.720
 So that's one.

2:06:05.720 --> 2:06:06.720
 And either way.

2:06:06.720 --> 2:06:14.400
 The ending thing, because we're on that sort of topic, because when you got out of prison,

2:06:14.400 --> 2:06:22.240
 you know, what the film implies is that whatever, there's a small aspect of your mind that still

2:06:22.240 --> 2:06:25.440
 wants to continue a relationship with Anthony.

2:06:25.440 --> 2:06:26.440
 Yeah.

2:06:26.440 --> 2:06:27.440
 That's not the case.

2:06:27.440 --> 2:06:36.440
 And not just that, but there's still flirtation and that kind of body implied, like we got

2:06:36.440 --> 2:06:41.840
 the world like at our fingertips, we're playing.

2:06:41.840 --> 2:06:48.280
 So I mean, one of the exciting things about being like a couple that's fucking with the

2:06:48.280 --> 2:06:54.040
 world that's getting away with something is that there's all these powerful forces that

2:06:54.040 --> 2:07:00.320
 want to catch you in a crime and you keep getting away with it.

2:07:00.320 --> 2:07:01.320
 That's exciting.

2:07:01.320 --> 2:07:05.000
 In some romantic world, it could be.

2:07:05.000 --> 2:07:07.240
 Yeah, not in this case.

2:07:07.240 --> 2:07:08.240
 Right.

2:07:08.240 --> 2:07:13.040
 And also, I always have to keep reminding people, like, get away with what, because I lost everything

2:07:13.040 --> 2:07:19.280
 and all these people lost other, you know, people I cared about lost a lot.

2:07:19.280 --> 2:07:22.880
 My mother lost a lot, but I lost everything too.

2:07:22.880 --> 2:07:26.720
 Yeah, your restaurant and all my dream.

2:07:26.720 --> 2:07:27.720
 Yeah.

2:07:27.720 --> 2:07:34.760
 My reputation, my stuff, my home, you know, ending up with millions of dollars of debt,

2:07:34.760 --> 2:07:37.840
 like it's not even like I lost it all and then it's a clean slate.

2:07:37.840 --> 2:07:38.840
 It's like I lost it all.

2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:48.640
 And now I have this like giant boulder of, or like this wobbly, unclear how to, like,

2:07:48.640 --> 2:07:49.640
 yeah.

2:07:49.640 --> 2:07:54.840
 So when people say, well, Sisyphus got away with something, I'm always like, got away

2:07:54.840 --> 2:07:55.840
 with what?

2:07:55.840 --> 2:07:56.840
 I know.

2:07:56.840 --> 2:08:00.800
 Destroying my life and ending up in debt, because that's, it's not even like, you can't

2:08:00.800 --> 2:08:06.360
 even sort of point to like, as if I was trying to do something and then oops, that happened.

2:08:06.360 --> 2:08:14.280
 It's like, there's no, nothing that logically makes sense if somebody was trying to decipher

2:08:14.280 --> 2:08:19.000
 my, you know, whatever motives I might have had.

2:08:19.000 --> 2:08:20.000
 Yeah.

2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:21.000
 You didn't walk away from the explosion.

2:08:21.000 --> 2:08:23.880
 You were inside the explosion.

2:08:23.880 --> 2:08:25.440
 Okay.

2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:27.840
 But that said, the movie implied.

2:08:27.840 --> 2:08:36.680
 And so, I mean, it's interesting to ask, not just in, in clarifying the movie, but just

2:08:36.680 --> 2:08:42.280
 as a human being, you're out of prison, he's out of prison.

2:08:42.280 --> 2:08:50.120
 There was, you know, there was that toxic connection, but it was there and there was

2:08:50.120 --> 2:08:51.120
 a depth to it.

2:08:51.120 --> 2:08:53.640
 So toxic connections can be pretty deep.

2:08:53.640 --> 2:08:59.520
 So how, what, what was the conversation like and how often have you talked with him?

2:08:59.520 --> 2:09:02.240
 Well, we don't speak anymore.

2:09:02.240 --> 2:09:09.640
 And that call at the end was, I even on G chat, recorded, was recorded on, like I recorded

2:09:09.640 --> 2:09:14.800
 the call and gave it to them, you know, so I was like, deliberately recording him.

2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:16.600
 It's not like I was caught on a hot mic.

2:09:16.600 --> 2:09:20.880
 Like I made that call as part of the documentary, I recorded him intentionally, I was trying

2:09:20.880 --> 2:09:26.320
 to get him to repeat some of like the kookier things he would say about like his meat suit

2:09:26.320 --> 2:09:32.720
 or some of the weird, like the things about something not being real.

2:09:32.720 --> 2:09:36.040
 The more like fantastical things, I was trying to get him to repeat those things.

2:09:36.040 --> 2:09:40.200
 And it was probably like a 40 minute call, which I mean, it's actually on my phone.

2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:41.200
 I still have it.

2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:42.600
 I haven't gone back to listen to it, but.

2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:44.360
 You ever think of publishing that whole thing?

2:09:44.360 --> 2:09:45.360
 Oh yeah.

2:09:45.360 --> 2:09:46.360
 Oh, I think about publishing everything.

2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:47.360
 My entire journal.

2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:52.080
 You should publish that call unedited, just publish it, that'd be fun.

2:09:52.080 --> 2:09:55.800
 No, I want to publish like a lot of stuff.

2:09:55.800 --> 2:10:01.120
 He took all these videos of me also that they used a couple of clips of and I would, I mean,

2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:02.120
 they're also on my phone.

2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:03.120
 I would publish them all.

2:10:03.120 --> 2:10:05.360
 I would publish everything.

2:10:05.360 --> 2:10:06.360
 In particular.

2:10:06.360 --> 2:10:09.000
 Did you release that with your book?

2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:10.000
 It's good.

2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:11.000
 Yeah.

2:10:11.000 --> 2:10:15.480
 I probably, I mean, I've planned to do that eventually if all of that material would

2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:20.200
 be really useful to psychologists or people studying it.

2:10:20.200 --> 2:10:26.280
 So to the extent that it would help other people understand what happened, which I think

2:10:26.280 --> 2:10:27.280
 would be.

2:10:27.280 --> 2:10:28.280
 Well, he's still out there.

2:10:28.280 --> 2:10:29.280
 It's fascinating.

2:10:29.280 --> 2:10:30.280
 Yeah.

2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:33.000
 He's still out there doing weird, weird shit with his clean slate.

2:10:33.000 --> 2:10:35.880
 I get a little annoyed about that.

2:10:35.880 --> 2:10:36.880
 He's got the clean slate.

2:10:36.880 --> 2:10:39.400
 Well, he didn't have a restaurant.

2:10:39.400 --> 2:10:41.400
 He didn't have a persona.

2:10:41.400 --> 2:10:45.160
 Does he have any public persona or no, or we don't know?

2:10:45.160 --> 2:10:46.440
 He got booted off of Twitter.

2:10:46.440 --> 2:10:48.160
 He had to get it to you.

2:10:48.160 --> 2:10:49.680
 Maybe Elon will put him back on.

2:10:49.680 --> 2:10:52.240
 Is that a passive aggressive state?

2:10:52.240 --> 2:10:53.480
 No, not at all.

2:10:53.480 --> 2:10:57.240
 I find that whole conversation really, really interesting.

2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:00.480
 Whether to put somebody like Anthony on back on Twitter.

2:11:00.480 --> 2:11:05.000
 Well, no, I think, because I used to always think like if only everybody had to identify

2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:10.520
 as themselves on Twitter and you could have like a parody account or like, like Leon has

2:11:10.520 --> 2:11:12.920
 an account, but it's very clear that it's me behind it.

2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:18.480
 Sometimes there's like, you know, Devin Nunez's cow, like so people have parody accounts,

2:11:18.480 --> 2:11:24.080
 but if we could identify who it is, then a lot of...

2:11:24.080 --> 2:11:26.400
 Why did he get booted off of Twitter?

2:11:26.400 --> 2:11:27.400
 I don't know.

2:11:27.400 --> 2:11:28.400
 But I used to...

2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:33.760
 So in the last few years, I would periodically, probably like once a month, maybe more, I

2:11:33.760 --> 2:11:40.240
 would like look at his Twitter just to kind of see like, well, where is he and, you know,

2:11:40.240 --> 2:11:43.080
 just to see like, what is he up to?

2:11:43.080 --> 2:11:48.000
 And I figured out, I could tell from the photographs that he'd moved to California.

2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:53.360
 And I think he might have told me one of the last times I spoke to him that he was going

2:11:53.360 --> 2:11:56.880
 to move to California, but...

2:11:56.880 --> 2:12:01.400
 And then I also screen grabbed a lot of stuff that he put on Twitter and he put these creepy

2:12:01.400 --> 2:12:07.520
 videos of himself on Twitter at the beginning of COVID, I screen grabbed those.

2:12:07.520 --> 2:12:12.120
 And then one day I went and like, he was, you know, account was suspended.

2:12:12.120 --> 2:12:14.800
 And then I kept going back and it's like been suspended ever since.

2:12:14.800 --> 2:12:20.080
 So he might have started a new account and I don't know what it is, probably...

2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:22.600
 He's probably in California, you're saying.

2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:25.960
 He is in California that's been verified.

2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:30.240
 Somebody who was going to have to interact with him in an official capacity was going

2:12:30.240 --> 2:12:31.240
 to go meet him.

2:12:31.240 --> 2:12:38.960
 And I said, and was nervous about it and I said, he's going to be really likable.

2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:40.120
 Like you're going to like him.

2:12:40.120 --> 2:12:45.320
 He's probably going to like figure out what you're interested in, talk sports, talk whatever

2:12:45.320 --> 2:12:48.280
 it is that he figures out quickly that you're interested in.

2:12:48.280 --> 2:12:49.280
 He's going to be really nice.

2:12:49.280 --> 2:12:51.440
 He's going to seem like a nice guy.

2:12:51.440 --> 2:12:56.240
 And that person later got back to me and was like, you're exactly right.

2:12:56.240 --> 2:12:59.040
 So yeah, that's the sociopath thing, right?

2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:00.040
 Yeah.

2:13:00.040 --> 2:13:04.000
 You're going to be extremely careful, but inside a relationship, that's even more dangerous.

2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:10.960
 So I think that part of the reason I spoke to him was entirely self serving and strategic

2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:13.440
 after the fact.

2:13:13.440 --> 2:13:18.720
 Well, even before I knew there was ever going to be a documentary, I spoke to him and I

2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:25.160
 knew how dangerous it was because I knew that in a situation like this, you're supposed

2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:27.520
 to have no contact, which makes sense.

2:13:27.520 --> 2:13:31.560
 And I understand why, which makes it extra tragic when people have kids with a sociopath

2:13:31.560 --> 2:13:36.640
 or in a narcissistic abuse of relationship, if you have kids, then you're tethered, which

2:13:36.640 --> 2:13:38.640
 is tragic.

2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:42.760
 But why are you supposed to avoid conversations because you can get pulled right back in?

2:13:42.760 --> 2:13:49.280
 So they have no contact, yeah, because they'll continue abuse or they'll, you'll be vulnerable

2:13:49.280 --> 2:13:51.720
 to them being able to pull you back in.

2:13:51.720 --> 2:13:56.280
 So I knew that to be the case.

2:13:56.280 --> 2:13:57.760
 So why was it self serving?

2:13:57.760 --> 2:14:01.040
 Why did you talk to him anyway?

2:14:01.040 --> 2:14:07.640
 Because he was getting out, he was going to be out free out in the open while I was going

2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:11.120
 to be locked up at Rikers for three and a half months.

2:14:11.120 --> 2:14:19.400
 And the one thing that, if his motivation was to destroy me, then what else could he

2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:25.520
 do to really like hammer that last nail in the coffin?

2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:27.440
 That would be Leon.

2:14:27.440 --> 2:14:32.040
 And so he would have known that Leon would be staying with my mother, you know, he knows

2:14:32.040 --> 2:14:35.640
 where he spent a lot of time at her house, he knows where she lives, it would be super

2:14:35.640 --> 2:14:41.920
 easy for him to just drive up there, you know, wait for her to let him out.

2:14:41.920 --> 2:14:47.120
 And then, you know, he, because out in the country, he can be off leash.

2:14:47.120 --> 2:14:51.440
 And all he'd have to do is kind of whistle, call him over and he could take him away and

2:14:51.440 --> 2:14:52.440
 do whatever.

2:14:52.440 --> 2:14:57.280
 So I was completely like gripped with that fear.

2:14:57.280 --> 2:15:01.120
 It's not fear for yourself, but fear for Leon.

2:15:01.120 --> 2:15:06.720
 Well I was going to be at least safe from him, but I was going to be locked away.

2:15:06.720 --> 2:15:07.720
 So.

2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:10.040
 Oh yeah, yeah, Rikers, yeah, yeah, sure.

2:15:10.040 --> 2:15:11.040
 So.

2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:13.240
 I got it, got it, got it, got it.

2:15:13.240 --> 2:15:19.680
 I would be powerless to do anything and he would have free reign to go destroy me further

2:15:19.680 --> 2:15:26.120
 by, you know, taking or hurting Leon.

2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:33.920
 And then when he got out, I still, I had unfollowed him from my own account, but Leon had never

2:15:33.920 --> 2:15:34.920
 unfollowed him.

2:15:34.920 --> 2:15:40.680
 So I, I was looking at, I know, I was looking at his, at his account.

2:15:40.680 --> 2:15:47.520
 Can I just say, because Joe has a, he hasn't come for his dog too, I just love when people

2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:48.520
 do that.

2:15:48.520 --> 2:15:49.520
 It's so great.

2:15:49.520 --> 2:15:53.720
 I actually pretend, in my mind for some reason I do think Leon has an account.

2:15:53.720 --> 2:15:56.680
 Like I don't, you forget that there's a human behind it.

2:15:56.680 --> 2:15:58.200
 You're like, oh, okay, cool.

2:15:58.200 --> 2:15:59.200
 Yeah.

2:15:59.200 --> 2:16:00.200
 I know.

2:16:00.200 --> 2:16:01.200
 I love it when people do that.

2:16:01.200 --> 2:16:02.200
 I just, anyway, so he continues.

2:16:02.200 --> 2:16:05.560
 So Leon didn't unfollow him and what, what.

2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:13.520
 So I was able to go back and look at his Twitter and he, he, somehow he quickly got a phone,

2:16:13.520 --> 2:16:17.680
 but he very quickly started tweeting right after he got out.

2:16:17.680 --> 2:16:23.480
 And, and I was kind of like fascinated because I didn't know what to expect or what he was

2:16:23.480 --> 2:16:29.400
 going to be saying and, and, and then he started saying things that I could tell were directed

2:16:29.400 --> 2:16:34.720
 at me, you know, like little things that only I would know, you know, like random things

2:16:34.720 --> 2:16:39.240
 like things that were like the equivalent of like an inside joke that you have just.

2:16:39.240 --> 2:16:46.920
 So he was posting things like that and there's so many things going on at once.

2:16:46.920 --> 2:16:55.400
 So another thing that would have in a twisted, but I think understandable way in sort of

2:16:55.400 --> 2:17:02.920
 a sick way that I was fully aware of is that here I am having gone through this completely

2:17:02.920 --> 2:17:08.280
 like messed up thing that now I'm in trouble for everybody's looking at and nobody understands.

2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:09.440
 Right.

2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:16.320
 And so there was this unfortunate situation of the only person who understands what I

2:17:16.320 --> 2:17:19.760
 went through is the person who put me through it.

2:17:19.760 --> 2:17:20.760
 Yeah.

2:17:20.760 --> 2:17:21.760
 Right.

2:17:21.760 --> 2:17:26.920
 So is that, were you also just a little bit seeking closure of some kind?

2:17:26.920 --> 2:17:30.800
 Probably a lot, but also with the awareness that I probably wasn't going to get it, you

2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:31.800
 know.

2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:39.760
 And I mean, I, I know for a fact I would never get it in the same way that, which is why,

2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:45.800
 which is why I was able to later on, like in the context of recording those calls, I

2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:53.640
 was able to talk to him in this detached way because I know he doesn't give a shit that

2:17:53.640 --> 2:17:59.440
 like he doesn't give any shits about what he did to my mother or me or anybody or anything

2:17:59.440 --> 2:18:01.200
 just doesn't care.

2:18:01.200 --> 2:18:06.040
 So he's certainly not going to care if I, you know, he's never going to say like, I'm

2:18:06.040 --> 2:18:12.600
 sorry or I did a bad thing or, or like he's not going to be affected.

2:18:12.600 --> 2:18:16.320
 Like if I yelled and screamed at him, that would just be frustrating for me.

2:18:16.320 --> 2:18:19.760
 And he would actually probably be gratified by that.

2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:26.880
 So that, that gave you, that empowered you in being cold and sort of distant.

2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:27.880
 Yes.

2:18:27.880 --> 2:18:32.560
 And I had a prior experience where I had to do the same thing where like, if you're,

2:18:32.560 --> 2:18:41.200
 if you're able to be very cold and not allow somebody to push your buttons, then you're

2:18:41.200 --> 2:18:45.160
 taking away their power and then that feels empowering or it feels like we're claiming

2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:46.880
 a little bit of your power.

2:18:46.880 --> 2:18:52.880
 So in my talking to him, I always had a reason, you know, like there was always like I didn't

2:18:52.880 --> 2:18:57.400
 want him to hurt Leon or I wanted information or I wanted to know where he was.

2:18:57.400 --> 2:19:02.960
 I'd rather let him think that, you know, maybe he could still manipulate me one day

2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:03.960
 or whatever.

2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:08.400
 It was like safer to keep that there than to not know where he was.

2:19:08.400 --> 2:19:12.840
 And if I was going to like be walking Leon and turn the corner and he's standing there

2:19:12.840 --> 2:19:18.560
 and, you know, like it, like if there's a crazy murderer out on the loose, you'd rather

2:19:18.560 --> 2:19:21.840
 know where they are than have no idea.

2:19:21.840 --> 2:19:24.760
 So there are a lot of different reasons.

2:19:24.760 --> 2:19:26.600
 Why is it upset you?

2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:30.160
 Why was it wrong to have that audio clip at the end of the documentary?

2:19:30.160 --> 2:19:31.160
 Like what did it?

2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:35.280
 Well, because it implied all kinds of things that were completely not true and it also

2:19:35.280 --> 2:19:40.040
 just didn't make sense and it confused people and so.

2:19:40.040 --> 2:19:46.520
 So for people who haven't watched it, spoiler alert is they play the clip of, so I don't

2:19:46.520 --> 2:19:50.320
 even remember what was said, but it was kind of.

2:19:50.320 --> 2:19:52.160
 That last, what we spoke about?

2:19:52.160 --> 2:19:53.160
 Yeah.

2:19:53.160 --> 2:19:54.160
 What was the, what was the picture?

2:19:54.160 --> 2:19:55.160
 I know.

2:19:55.160 --> 2:19:56.440
 I only watched, like I still haven't watched it.

2:19:56.440 --> 2:20:03.600
 I only watched the film once while, you know, people were looking at me for my reaction

2:20:03.600 --> 2:20:08.080
 and I was crying and it was really weird and strange and surreal and I haven't gone back

2:20:08.080 --> 2:20:09.080
 to watch it again.

2:20:09.080 --> 2:20:15.960
 I feel like I'm just going to get more annoyed, but I will eventually, but, and when I, when

2:20:15.960 --> 2:20:21.840
 the ending happened, I immediately blurted out like, I hate that, I hate that ending,

2:20:21.840 --> 2:20:26.320
 but I sort of assumed a lot of people saw it for what it was.

2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:31.000
 They saw that it was like the director doing a weird thing and that it was kind of just

2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:33.000
 weird and off and like, that doesn't make sense.

2:20:33.000 --> 2:20:37.440
 It seemed out of the blue, but so it was basically you joking around, like flirting

2:20:37.440 --> 2:20:38.440
 almost.

2:20:38.440 --> 2:20:41.040
 It made it seem like, as if we're still friendly.

2:20:41.040 --> 2:20:42.040
 Yeah.

2:20:42.040 --> 2:20:43.440
 And there's more to come.

2:20:43.440 --> 2:20:48.720
 It's almost like there's going to be a bad vegan too.

2:20:48.720 --> 2:20:49.720
 Right.

2:20:49.720 --> 2:20:50.720
 Or yeah.

2:20:50.720 --> 2:20:57.160
 And then also, I mean, it made it seem like, you know, if I was laughing with him that I

2:20:57.160 --> 2:21:01.320
 don't take anything seriously, you know, that I don't take what happens seriously or.

2:21:01.320 --> 2:21:02.320
 Yeah.

2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:03.320
 I don't feel any remorse.

2:21:03.320 --> 2:21:04.320
 Exactly.

2:21:04.320 --> 2:21:05.320
 Yeah.

2:21:05.320 --> 2:21:12.320
 And they, after that, he goes to the credits with the Wild World, which is a great song.

2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:13.320
 Yes.

2:21:13.320 --> 2:21:14.320
 Oh, baby.

2:21:14.320 --> 2:21:15.320
 It's a wild world.

2:21:15.320 --> 2:21:19.720
 I never got to hear that because the version I watched didn't have the end credits, but

2:21:19.720 --> 2:21:26.320
 I knew that they used that song at the end and paid a lot for it.

2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:27.320
 Yeah.

2:21:27.320 --> 2:21:28.320
 Yeah.

2:21:28.320 --> 2:21:29.320
 I was like, oh, well, you got this song.

2:21:29.320 --> 2:21:35.480
 Did you ever say what was the darkest thing about yourself that you'd discovered from

2:21:35.480 --> 2:21:36.480
 the book?

2:21:36.480 --> 2:21:37.480
 Oh.

2:21:37.480 --> 2:21:39.480
 We, we, we, we, we, we took a tangent up.

2:21:39.480 --> 2:21:40.480
 Right.

2:21:40.480 --> 2:21:41.480
 We started talking about, exactly.

2:21:41.480 --> 2:21:42.480
 Yeah.

2:21:42.480 --> 2:21:43.480
 About the G chats.

2:21:43.480 --> 2:21:50.840
 And I think, um, it was, I guess it was trying to understand how I was able to be sarcastic

2:21:50.840 --> 2:21:59.640
 and make jokes at his expense, dirt, while all that stuff was going on.

2:21:59.640 --> 2:22:06.160
 Ah, so what does that, does that, have you figured out what that means about you?

2:22:06.160 --> 2:22:07.160
 No.

2:22:07.160 --> 2:22:11.120
 No, it just was interesting to look at.

2:22:11.120 --> 2:22:18.240
 And also I think, um, you know, I've, I have a tendency, I have a tendency sometimes to

2:22:18.240 --> 2:22:29.440
 be sort of like jokingly hyperbolic or sarcastic and it's gotten me into trouble one, one time

2:22:29.440 --> 2:22:38.520
 it, I got locked up in the Harlem psych ward for a day because of my hyperbole and sarcasm.

2:22:38.520 --> 2:22:39.520
 And like,

2:22:39.520 --> 2:22:41.520
 How did that, do you want to the story of that?

2:22:41.520 --> 2:22:43.280
 Lost in translation errors.

2:22:43.280 --> 2:22:47.200
 That's, that's a heck of a loss in translation error.

2:22:47.200 --> 2:22:48.480
 Yeah.

2:22:48.480 --> 2:22:51.760
 Did you, did you say something funny to a therapist?

2:22:51.760 --> 2:22:52.760
 It was, um, yeah.

2:22:52.760 --> 2:22:58.360
 I mean, it was sort of making jokes about how bad I was feeling, but in a hyperbolic way.

2:22:58.360 --> 2:23:03.520
 And so then suddenly somebody told somebody, and then the lost in translation, and then

2:23:03.520 --> 2:23:07.680
 they were worried that I might kill myself and then did a wellness check and then tried

2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:10.960
 to call me and I was in the shower, so I didn't answer the phone.

2:23:10.960 --> 2:23:15.520
 So then somebody called the police to do a wellness check on me.

2:23:15.520 --> 2:23:17.000
 Things just escalated.

2:23:17.000 --> 2:23:24.600
 And then, uh, not knowing that, um, if I had handled it the right, if I had immediately,

2:23:24.600 --> 2:23:29.280
 um, if I'd sort of understood what was going on and handled it the right way immediately,

2:23:29.280 --> 2:23:33.200
 I probably could have gotten out of it, but they air on the side of taking you to the

2:23:33.200 --> 2:23:34.200
 hospital no matter what.

2:23:34.200 --> 2:23:35.200
 Makes a lot of sense.

2:23:35.200 --> 2:23:36.200
 And I didn't know that.

2:23:36.200 --> 2:23:37.200
 And it also, um.

2:23:37.200 --> 2:23:41.120
 So you really leaned into the joke by going to the hospital.

2:23:41.120 --> 2:23:42.120
 I didn't.

2:23:42.120 --> 2:23:46.480
 It's sort of one of those situations that was both comical and tragic because

2:23:46.480 --> 2:23:47.640
 Yeah.

2:23:47.640 --> 2:23:53.000
 And would actually make a really good, um, it's weird how I do this sometimes.

2:23:53.000 --> 2:23:56.840
 Like it would make a really good scene in a, in a filmed version.

2:23:56.840 --> 2:23:59.000
 Who would play you in the film?

2:23:59.000 --> 2:24:00.800
 Uh, I don't know.

2:24:00.800 --> 2:24:07.200
 There is a thing being made that's in everything because, um, because, have you cast the scene

2:24:07.200 --> 2:24:08.200
 yet?

2:24:08.200 --> 2:24:13.200
 No, but there's a thing being made that I'm not going to do with, which is frustrating

2:24:13.200 --> 2:24:14.200
 and weird.

2:24:14.200 --> 2:24:15.880
 A film about you?

2:24:15.880 --> 2:24:16.880
 No.

2:24:16.880 --> 2:24:21.720
 It's like somebody's making a fictionalized drama and it's frustrating because for all

2:24:21.720 --> 2:24:26.720
 kinds of obvious reasons, it's like annoying and it can go any way.

2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:27.720
 It could go any way.

2:24:27.720 --> 2:24:29.040
 It could be like the bad guy.

2:24:29.040 --> 2:24:33.880
 Unneverally, they'll get a bajillion things wrong and there are also a bunch of people

2:24:33.880 --> 2:24:37.600
 like profiting off of it and like, thanks guys.

2:24:37.600 --> 2:24:41.360
 You know, so it's infuriating for all kinds of reasons.

2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:43.560
 Do you know who's playing for the actors?

2:24:43.560 --> 2:24:44.560
 No.

2:24:44.560 --> 2:24:48.440
 I don't even like, I just don't like, I'll, I'll inevitably know, but I don't really

2:24:48.440 --> 2:24:49.440
 want to know.

2:24:49.440 --> 2:24:50.440
 The whole thing is just annoying.

2:24:50.440 --> 2:24:56.600
 And also I've always, people ask me this all the time and I always thought, um, because

2:24:56.600 --> 2:25:01.760
 of the way everything that happened was such a kind of a slow build and there was so much

2:25:01.760 --> 2:25:06.560
 nuance and it's, it's kind of really hard to understand that it could only really be

2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:14.200
 done well in like a breaking bad type of series long, like a long series where like you would

2:25:14.200 --> 2:25:22.080
 be taken through these kind of gut wrenching, icky, slow build things and then that would

2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:23.080
 make it all make sense.

2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:26.880
 Like that, if it was done that way, it could be done accurately.

2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:33.920
 But the reason why I think, um, so I made these stupid jokes and then somebody did a

2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:39.440
 wellness check and, um, or asked the police to do a while.

2:25:39.440 --> 2:25:43.240
 When they knocked on my door and came in, it was like a repeat of getting arrested.

2:25:43.240 --> 2:25:48.040
 So I sort of weirdly flashed back to that and then burst into tears, which isn't the

2:25:48.040 --> 2:25:49.240
 appropriate response.

2:25:49.240 --> 2:25:58.520
 If you're trying to, um, diffuse a, if you're trying to discourage the people coming to

2:25:58.520 --> 2:26:03.800
 do the wellness check from taking you to the hospital, starting to cry is not the good,

2:26:03.800 --> 2:26:04.800
 the right reaction.

2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:13.600
 Well, the thing is, I mean, there is, it's funny, but it could be also through the joke,

2:26:13.600 --> 2:26:20.720
 that the joke, the best jokes are grounded in truth and pain, in this case, pain.

2:26:20.720 --> 2:26:21.720
 Yeah.

2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:22.720
 All right.

2:26:22.720 --> 2:26:29.800
 So there, you know, um, have you ever, if I may ask, considered suicide?

2:26:29.800 --> 2:26:30.800
 Yes.

2:26:30.800 --> 2:26:39.000
 One, well, I'm kind of a wimp.

2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:45.720
 So I, you know, I'm afraid of all of the gruesome ways, but, um, one of the things I remember

2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:57.440
 doing is sort of hoarding medications, which I had when, um, around the time and before

2:26:57.440 --> 2:27:03.320
 he took me away, because I wanted, like, I wanted to, I wanted the safety of a, like

2:27:03.320 --> 2:27:08.400
 an out, um, and put around that time.

2:27:08.400 --> 2:27:12.840
 So when, when I think that that's the road trip right before the road trip from hell,

2:27:12.840 --> 2:27:18.560
 you're hoarding medication and like, I, yeah, like if I could get my hands on any sort of

2:27:18.560 --> 2:27:26.400
 weird medication, I would, I would kind of hold on to it, um, and to all the chaos that

2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:27.400
 you got.

2:27:27.400 --> 2:27:29.680
 But I think I knew that it would be hard to do it that way.

2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:36.120
 So I didn't really thought about it, but I never, um.

2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:43.000
 In that really tough time, you know, you're thinking about, you're thinking about taking

2:27:43.000 --> 2:27:44.960
 your own life.

2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:47.760
 What gave you hope?

2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:53.800
 What gave you sort of, because the business, the, the restaurant that you give so much

2:27:53.800 --> 2:27:59.760
 of yourself to is lost, you're lying to everybody.

2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:02.920
 You're in the hole financially.

2:28:02.920 --> 2:28:07.120
 You're being psychologically trapped, manipulated.

2:28:07.120 --> 2:28:09.960
 I might just go get myself now.

2:28:09.960 --> 2:28:12.320
 Well, you're still there.

2:28:12.320 --> 2:28:14.320
 Um, please don't.

2:28:14.320 --> 2:28:15.960
 See, I made a joke about it.

2:28:15.960 --> 2:28:16.960
 Like that's.

2:28:16.960 --> 2:28:17.960
 There you go.

2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:20.000
 Um, but it's always there.

2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:29.520
 Uh, it's the, uh, Albert Camus, you know, says he basically always have to be, uh, aggressively

2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:32.160
 looking for a reason to live.

2:28:32.160 --> 2:28:33.160
 Otherwise.

2:28:33.160 --> 2:28:35.160
 What's the point?

2:28:35.160 --> 2:28:36.160
 Yeah.

2:28:36.160 --> 2:28:40.960
 Otherwise it's easy to, to go the other way because why live is a very good question.

2:28:40.960 --> 2:28:47.480
 Um, but anyways, uh, by way of hope, by way, you know, it's, it's a dark time.

2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:48.800
 It's a dark time.

2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:55.880
 If you could sort of look back what, um, we'll give you just strength through this.

2:28:55.880 --> 2:29:03.960
 I think that just, you know, just having like a sort of relentless optimism.

2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:12.280
 Um, and I think too that sometimes people assume that suicide is the result of circumstances,

2:29:12.280 --> 2:29:16.240
 which may be in, maybe in some cases it is, but I think one of the things that that book

2:29:16.240 --> 2:29:20.120
 explains well is that very often it doesn't have anything to do with circumstances.

2:29:20.120 --> 2:29:22.920
 It's just the, the pain.

2:29:22.920 --> 2:29:23.920
 Which book?

2:29:23.920 --> 2:29:24.920
 The, the darkness visible.

2:29:24.920 --> 2:29:30.600
 Um, you know, cause people like to, so when somebody commits suicide, people will very

2:29:30.600 --> 2:29:33.320
 often criticize them like it was a selfish act.

2:29:33.320 --> 2:29:37.280
 If they have a family, which most people do, but especially if they have kids.

2:29:37.280 --> 2:29:43.480
 And I think that, um, yeah, everybody's quick to sort of call the person who killed themselves

2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:51.560
 selfish and, um, it's, I think that the type of pain that one is experiencing that leads

2:29:51.560 --> 2:29:56.560
 to that is something that most people, and I don't, like people don't understand, but

2:29:56.560 --> 2:29:57.920
 it's not a selfish thing.

2:29:57.920 --> 2:30:02.160
 It's just like quite literally becomes intolerable from what I understand.

2:30:02.160 --> 2:30:06.320
 And it can hit you, it could be slow, it could be fast.

2:30:06.320 --> 2:30:07.320
 Yes.

2:30:07.320 --> 2:30:08.320
 That pain.

2:30:08.320 --> 2:30:09.320
 Yes.

2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:17.520
 So I think because for me, it was more just my circumstances were so crappy, but also I

2:30:17.520 --> 2:30:25.920
 had an awareness that, you know, even in Rikers, I knew how wildly lucky I was to have, you

2:30:25.920 --> 2:30:33.560
 know, family, a support system, you know, opportunities and like I'll always be okay

2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:36.400
 one way or another.

2:30:36.400 --> 2:30:48.360
 So, I felt lucky that I have that, but, you know, also I want, you know, the shame of

2:30:48.360 --> 2:30:54.360
 everything that happened and, you know, will I ever be able to crawl out from under it

2:30:54.360 --> 2:30:57.800
 and rebuild something, I don't know.

2:30:57.800 --> 2:31:02.400
 So there were certainly times where, especially when I would learn something new, like reading

2:31:02.400 --> 2:31:10.440
 the emails between Mr. Fox, my mother, I just wanted a, I wanted like a meteor to hit my

2:31:10.440 --> 2:31:15.600
 particular spot on the earth right then and there, just because it was.

2:31:15.600 --> 2:31:20.200
 He was manipulating your mom too, because your mom loved you and was willing to give

2:31:20.200 --> 2:31:21.200
 money.

2:31:21.200 --> 2:31:22.200
 Yeah.

2:31:22.200 --> 2:31:23.200
 Yeah.

2:31:23.200 --> 2:31:24.200
 And it was really grotesque.

2:31:24.200 --> 2:31:26.960
 And so, and I feel like it's my fault.

2:31:26.960 --> 2:31:32.040
 What's your mom say about this whole situation now looking back?

2:31:32.040 --> 2:31:39.280
 We don't talk about it as much as one would think that we would, because I feel sickening,

2:31:39.280 --> 2:31:44.280
 because I feel like it's my fault and I think she also feels sick over it.

2:31:44.280 --> 2:31:47.760
 And so, we don't talk about it as much as one might think.

2:31:47.760 --> 2:31:51.640
 Sometimes I've had to ask questions in the process of writing the book.

2:31:51.640 --> 2:31:54.760
 And then there are other things where like, I could ask the questions, but I just don't

2:31:54.760 --> 2:32:00.600
 want to because I don't want to put her through that or, you know, it's not really necessary

2:32:00.600 --> 2:32:09.160
 to ask the questions, but there are things that I'm sort of curious about, but.

2:32:09.160 --> 2:32:15.840
 When you went on that road trip from hell, what was that like?

2:32:15.840 --> 2:32:17.280
 Would you guys go first?

2:32:17.280 --> 2:32:18.280
 Vegas?

2:32:18.280 --> 2:32:22.280
 So, you drove from New York where?

2:32:22.280 --> 2:32:26.840
 It was a series of stops at like hotel and motel type places.

2:32:26.840 --> 2:32:32.440
 Because I did a similar road trip, but from Boston, I drove across the United States with

2:32:32.440 --> 2:32:33.680
 no destination.

2:32:33.680 --> 2:32:35.160
 I had always wanted to do that.

2:32:35.160 --> 2:32:38.960
 And now, again, I feel like it's one of those things that's sort of like ruined for me because

2:32:38.960 --> 2:32:39.960
 a lot of.

2:32:39.960 --> 2:32:40.960
 You can always reclaim it.

2:32:40.960 --> 2:32:47.960
 Yeah, I could, but now, yeah, I did think about like how one day if I did some sort

2:32:47.960 --> 2:32:54.440
 of a book tour or something that I imagine this Leon and I in a car.

2:32:54.440 --> 2:33:04.880
 It has to be different than, man, book tours, they, if you're not careful, can suck the

2:33:04.880 --> 2:33:08.600
 soul out of a human being.

2:33:08.600 --> 2:33:14.320
 I think you have to do like a Hunter S. Thompson style book tour where you miss a bunch of

2:33:14.320 --> 2:33:16.640
 the dates because you got too drunk the night before.

2:33:16.640 --> 2:33:17.640
 But anyway.

2:33:17.640 --> 2:33:26.880
 Yeah, I just, what I worry about is that I just would be feeling terrible in some way and not be up for it.

2:33:26.880 --> 2:33:29.200
 Up for the trip or for speaking?

2:33:29.200 --> 2:33:31.160
 For like a certain type of appearance.

2:33:31.160 --> 2:33:40.840
 I think I'm always afraid of that in committing to things like if it involved going to a big

2:33:40.840 --> 2:33:41.840
 public event.

2:33:41.840 --> 2:33:42.840
 Yeah.

2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:43.840
 I think you have to be very careful.

2:33:43.840 --> 2:33:48.840
 I think a big podcast is an interesting one.

2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:51.840
 I'm always surprised that people just jump on podcasts.

2:33:51.840 --> 2:33:54.920
 They haven't really listened to and just do a lot of podcasts, a kind of book tour.

2:33:54.920 --> 2:33:57.200
 First of all, financially, it doesn't make any sense.

2:33:57.200 --> 2:34:00.040
 Like especially going on small podcasts, like what's the benefit?

2:34:00.040 --> 2:34:03.640
 Like really you want to go on just a couple of big podcasts that you're actually a fan

2:34:03.640 --> 2:34:04.640
 of.

2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:05.640
 Right.

2:34:05.640 --> 2:34:06.640
 I guess it's really, really, really important.

2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:10.600
 People don't, like they don't understand the power.

2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:12.640
 I mean, maybe you just don't understand podcast.

2:34:12.640 --> 2:34:19.360
 For me as a fan of podcasts, it's like the biggest thing I love listening to is when

2:34:19.360 --> 2:34:26.160
 a guest is a fan, they understand the culture, the style, the sound, the feel of the podcast.

2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:28.040
 They understand the other person.

2:34:28.040 --> 2:34:33.720
 They feel the pain, the hopes of the other person, the weird like quarks of the other

2:34:33.720 --> 2:34:34.720
 person.

2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:39.400
 It makes for a much better listening and ultimately the appearance itself is not just enough to

2:34:39.400 --> 2:34:40.400
 sell the book.

2:34:40.400 --> 2:34:44.800
 You're selling yourself as a human being and that requires having chemistry and all those

2:34:44.800 --> 2:34:45.800
 kinds of things.

2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:48.080
 Yeah, I agree.

2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:51.040
 And podcast appearance is exhausting.

2:34:51.040 --> 2:34:52.600
 Like you're giving a lot of yourself.

2:34:52.600 --> 2:34:53.600
 It's intimate.

2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:54.600
 It's deep.

2:34:54.600 --> 2:34:55.600
 I don't know.

2:34:55.600 --> 2:34:58.000
 Anyway, road trip.

2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:01.120
 You don't remember the motels and the hotels along the way.

2:35:01.120 --> 2:35:04.560
 Well, there are a lot of things where like, I'll remember things that happened, but I

2:35:04.560 --> 2:35:06.080
 don't remember where it was.

2:35:06.080 --> 2:35:10.680
 They just drove without a destination, really.

2:35:10.680 --> 2:35:16.600
 I assume he must have known ahead of time, but he made it seem like, like, oh, funny,

2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:19.080
 we ended up in Vegas.

2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:24.080
 Funny how that happened, but now when I see all the places that we stopped, they were

2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:28.200
 all places with where there were casinos.

2:35:28.200 --> 2:35:33.480
 So there's a lot more casinos around the country than I knew.

2:35:33.480 --> 2:35:38.840
 So he had a gambling addiction?

2:35:38.840 --> 2:35:42.480
 Yes, but I think that it's not it.

2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:47.640
 So I think that regular people have gambling addictions and it's a horrible, tragic thing

2:35:47.640 --> 2:35:49.360
 and can destroy their lives.

2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:56.280
 And I know people who have, like regular people can have a gambling addiction, which is explained

2:35:56.280 --> 2:35:59.400
 in the way that addictions are explained.

2:35:59.400 --> 2:36:07.640
 For him, I don't think it was so much an addiction as like a thrill seeking, because he could

2:36:07.640 --> 2:36:13.120
 win money, lose money, and he didn't really care, whereas somebody who has an actual addiction

2:36:13.120 --> 2:36:21.480
 and then all normal people with normal human emotions would either be elated and relieved

2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:26.080
 or devastated to lose a lot of money.

2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:28.400
 And for him, it didn't really care.

2:36:28.400 --> 2:36:30.840
 It was more, again, I think it was more just like a game.

2:36:30.840 --> 2:36:33.440
 Like what were you, what was going through your mind here?

2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:34.920
 Like would you be on the run?

2:36:34.920 --> 2:36:36.520
 Did you feel like you were on the run?

2:36:36.520 --> 2:36:37.520
 No.

2:36:37.520 --> 2:36:39.640
 Did you know you were on the run?

2:36:39.640 --> 2:36:40.640
 No.

2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:47.480
 So I didn't know that, I mean, the other thing is the restaurant was operating and he took

2:36:47.480 --> 2:36:53.040
 me away and then like people weren't paid and it all sort of fell apart.

2:36:53.040 --> 2:36:56.280
 And you weren't checking your texts or any of that?

2:36:56.280 --> 2:36:57.280
 No.

2:36:57.280 --> 2:37:01.840
 And then he had my phone and my email.

2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:08.840
 I did later on get, later on I got a brand new phone with like a, an empty phone with

2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:12.560
 no existing numbers in it or whatnot.

2:37:12.560 --> 2:37:18.800
 And so that he and I could communicate when I, you know, I was, went to the grocery store

2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:19.800
 or something like that.

2:37:19.800 --> 2:37:22.520
 What was the, what, what was the reason he had the phone?

2:37:22.520 --> 2:37:29.240
 Like what was the narrative, the story that he was taking over your phone?

2:37:29.240 --> 2:37:34.160
 Was it, I mean, like how, how did you allow that to happen?

2:37:34.160 --> 2:37:41.120
 Or maybe a better way to ask is how did he make that happen?

2:37:41.120 --> 2:37:48.120
 Well I was conditioned to it before, because before he was always checking my phone, which

2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:53.920
 was wildly infuriating and I feel like, like.

2:37:53.920 --> 2:37:56.120
 You fixed it by giving him the phone.

2:37:56.120 --> 2:38:00.840
 Well, I mean, the conditions were different later on, but in some sense I didn't want

2:38:00.840 --> 2:38:05.640
 my phone because everything, like I was in a state of shock and it was just like, take

2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:06.640
 it fine.

2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:07.640
 Like I give up.

2:38:07.640 --> 2:38:12.600
 Like I guess I'd given up and, and so yeah, I'd given up.

2:38:12.600 --> 2:38:17.680
 So there was no, like I wasn't going to fight back on anything before when he would take

2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:23.080
 my phone and look through it, it was, it was infuriating and he sort of forced me to get

2:38:23.080 --> 2:38:26.120
 used to it.

2:38:26.120 --> 2:38:29.040
 And this is again, something that like people have been in cults would understand because

2:38:29.040 --> 2:38:33.800
 it's like they conditioned you to not react negatively to things that you would normally

2:38:33.800 --> 2:38:37.160
 react negatively to.

2:38:37.160 --> 2:38:44.120
 And like if I was in a relationship, like if somebody, I would never, ever look in somebody's

2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:51.440
 phone and it, and if somebody did that to me, I would be like, goodbye.

2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:54.960
 So I'm pretty sensitive about that.

2:38:54.960 --> 2:39:00.480
 And so it was very infuriating when he would take my phone and look at it and it, it got

2:39:00.480 --> 2:39:08.960
 to the point where not only did I feel like everything I, you know, said or wrote or email

2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:14.800
 digitally or whatnot would be read, but he, he got me to the point of feeling like I was

2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:20.960
 being watched all the time in a non explainable way.

2:39:20.960 --> 2:39:21.960
 Yeah.

2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:25.880
 What were some of the, you didn't mention them, some of the documentary touches on some

2:39:25.880 --> 2:39:27.280
 of them.

2:39:27.280 --> 2:39:29.160
 What are some of the fantastical stories?

2:39:29.160 --> 2:39:35.280
 So he mentioned that he might help make Leon immortal.

2:39:35.280 --> 2:39:36.440
 What?

2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:42.400
 All of that was always really vague, intentionally, like a lot of what he talked about was always

2:39:42.400 --> 2:39:50.040
 very vague, but a lot of that stuff was very vague and, and again, like, slowly over time.

2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:56.560
 And a lot of those things too are things that, you know, conveniently you kind of can't

2:39:56.560 --> 2:39:58.920
 disprove.

2:39:58.920 --> 2:40:02.880
 So it's almost like, you know, people believe in God or religious people believe certain

2:40:02.880 --> 2:40:11.520
 things, and so one could argue why is it that much crazier for me to have been open to the

2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:19.040
 idea that, you know, maybe Leon, maybe we do live forever in some way when a lot of religious

2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:21.120
 people have similar beliefs.

2:40:21.120 --> 2:40:27.640
 So one of the, the other thing is he was, what, maybe you can correct me, but reincarnated

2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:29.360
 or something like that.

2:40:29.360 --> 2:40:39.600
 Or like, he acted like he had lived many lifetimes and had all kinds of wisdom from having lived

2:40:39.600 --> 2:40:44.240
 all these prior lifetimes and being aware of it.

2:40:44.240 --> 2:40:50.600
 So was that, and it was vague, but it was somehow believable, or is it just like part

2:40:50.600 --> 2:40:53.240
 of the charm?

2:40:53.240 --> 2:40:58.600
 Like what, how do you, how do you not call bullshit?

2:40:58.600 --> 2:40:59.600
 I know.

2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:02.200
 We're not necessarily bullshit.

2:41:02.200 --> 2:41:10.440
 I understand when you're smitten in whatever way, but like a little more details, proof.

2:41:10.440 --> 2:41:20.360
 I suppose it's easy to just, you know, like put it off for later, assume that more details

2:41:20.360 --> 2:41:21.360
 will come later.

2:41:21.360 --> 2:41:22.360
 Right.

2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:29.320
 I think he's a mentalist or an illusionist named Darren Brown, and it was on a Joe Rogan

2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:30.320
 podcast.

2:41:30.320 --> 2:41:32.800
 I think Joe interviewed Darren Brown.

2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:35.640
 I think Sam Harris interviewed him.

2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:37.280
 I got really intrigued.

2:41:37.280 --> 2:41:43.440
 And then I was looking for other podcasts, or maybe Joe interviewed him like right after,

2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:44.640
 I may have gone looking for it.

2:41:44.640 --> 2:41:49.840
 But anyway, it was in the, it was in the conversation with Joe where Darren explains, he's somebody

2:41:49.840 --> 2:41:54.840
 I would love to, to meet a mentalist and an illusionist, because they understand a lot

2:41:54.840 --> 2:41:56.800
 of the ways in which the mind can be manipulated.

2:41:56.800 --> 2:42:00.880
 So I feel like they would, if they looked at everything about my situation, they would

2:42:00.880 --> 2:42:07.320
 be able to understand better how he was able to get me to believe things or go along with

2:42:07.320 --> 2:42:13.920
 things, because Darren Brown is pretty fascinating what he does, and he's really seems like a

2:42:13.920 --> 2:42:16.840
 very kind person, and he's very open about it.

2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:25.680
 And when he was talking to Joe, he said this thing that, and I use this quote in my book,

2:42:25.680 --> 2:42:28.640
 and again, I'm paraphrasing because I don't have it in front of me, but it's like, he

2:42:28.640 --> 2:42:37.080
 says something about how we want to believe the lie, because we'd rather believe that

2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:42.560
 it's something amazing than just that ugly and pathetic a lie.

2:42:42.560 --> 2:42:45.440
 And I, whatever he said was said in a much better way.

2:42:45.440 --> 2:42:50.600
 But the point is like, that's, and so he was explaining it in the context of the way that

2:42:50.600 --> 2:42:56.840
 an illusionist or whatever they're called is able to, to pull off certain things, which

2:42:56.840 --> 2:43:01.800
 is that they're sort of, you know, somebody, it was about somebody who was watching and

2:43:01.800 --> 2:43:09.000
 watch them, watch that person sort of leverage people's tendency to want to believe that

2:43:09.000 --> 2:43:13.760
 something amazing and cool is about to happen versus like this is just a really ugly, pathetic

2:43:13.760 --> 2:43:14.760
 lie.

2:43:14.760 --> 2:43:24.200
 And I think that a lot of the things that Mr. Fox, that he put forward, I couldn't understand

2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:28.840
 it from the perspective of it being a lie because it just seemed too weird and crazy.

2:43:28.840 --> 2:43:36.840
 So I think that this happens sometimes where you believe somebody because it seems so weird

2:43:36.840 --> 2:43:39.200
 that they would lie about it.

2:43:39.200 --> 2:43:44.160
 I think there's somebody has, or it's been said sometimes that like the more fantastical

2:43:44.160 --> 2:43:48.560
 the lie, the more believable it is because you don't, you don't believe that somebody

2:43:48.560 --> 2:43:50.880
 would tell that lie.

2:43:50.880 --> 2:43:57.080
 And I think something also that Mr. Fox, people like him are capable of doing is going out

2:43:57.080 --> 2:44:02.400
 and lying in very brazen ways that normal people would be terrified to do.

2:44:02.400 --> 2:44:04.760
 That kind of also makes it more believable.

2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:12.640
 So if somebody could go out on a world stage and lie and not kind of feel weird about that

2:44:12.640 --> 2:44:20.000
 or even knowing that it's a lie that can be pointed out as being a lie.

2:44:20.000 --> 2:44:26.320
 And then there's also the layer of to what extent is this person in some way also delusional

2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:29.720
 themselves and sort of believing their lies because people have asked me that and I've

2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:30.720
 wondered the same thing.

2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:34.320
 To what extent did he believe some of the stuff he was saying?

2:44:34.320 --> 2:44:40.840
 And I think probably there was some sort of delusional aspect, almost like he was sort

2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:49.440
 of halfway aware of playing his own sort of virtual reality game, like he was in some

2:44:49.440 --> 2:44:51.440
 kind of metaverse in his brain.

2:44:51.440 --> 2:44:55.000
 So you think he believed some of the things he was saying?

2:44:55.000 --> 2:44:56.240
 In some way, yeah.

2:44:56.240 --> 2:44:57.240
 What?

2:44:57.240 --> 2:45:02.200
 Or he wanted to, because he wanted to be his own, like he wanted to be a superhero.

2:45:02.200 --> 2:45:09.400
 He never built anything or created anything or accomplished anything in his life yet,

2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:13.200
 so in his own brain, if he could turn himself into like a movie superhero.

2:45:13.200 --> 2:45:14.200
 That's a nice shortcut.

2:45:14.200 --> 2:45:15.200
 Yeah.

2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:16.520
 What about the Navy Seal thing?

2:45:16.520 --> 2:45:20.600
 Did that ever get resolved?

2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:26.280
 You know, the lie that he, you know, he said that he's a Navy Seal.

2:45:26.280 --> 2:45:27.280
 I don't remember.

2:45:27.280 --> 2:45:32.280
 I don't know if he said he was a Navy Seal or that he implied that he like worked with

2:45:32.280 --> 2:45:37.400
 the CIA or then it was like he worked with black ops that, you know, is by definition

2:45:37.400 --> 2:45:39.560
 under the radar, right?

2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:45.800
 So I mean, that's obviously a huge red flag now going forward is like if somebody, first

2:45:45.800 --> 2:45:50.120
 of all, if somebody tells you that information pretty quickly, that's itself a red flag.

2:45:50.120 --> 2:45:52.120
 But I mean.

2:45:52.120 --> 2:45:53.120
 All right.

2:45:53.120 --> 2:45:59.160
 Cross, cross that off my list of pickup lines.

2:45:59.160 --> 2:46:05.720
 But you know, conveniently, if he say in some world, he actually did work for like Black

2:46:05.720 --> 2:46:12.520
 Water, one of those places are, yeah, there, I wouldn't be able to just call some place

2:46:12.520 --> 2:46:14.520
 and verify it.

2:46:14.520 --> 2:46:22.720
 Anyway, so I think that in some psychological way that I don't understand, he probably did

2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:31.240
 in some way, halfway exists in this world where he was this, you know, like fighter and

2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:35.640
 he would say things like it's because of people like me that people like you can sleep

2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:39.120
 at night, which is probably a line out of a movie that I've never seen.

2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:40.120
 I feel like a lot of things.

2:46:40.120 --> 2:46:41.120
 Oh, that's great.

2:46:41.120 --> 2:46:42.120
 That's funny.

2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:45.120
 Who said that?

2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:46.120
 That's a really.

2:46:46.120 --> 2:46:48.000
 Is that really a line out of a movie?

2:46:48.000 --> 2:46:50.600
 It's not a movie.

2:46:50.600 --> 2:46:55.320
 You know what would happen at Rikers is when these things would happen where one of us

2:46:55.320 --> 2:46:58.560
 couldn't think of something and you're like, oh, who was that actor in that movie and that

2:46:58.560 --> 2:46:59.560
 thing?

2:46:59.560 --> 2:47:00.560
 No.

2:47:00.560 --> 2:47:04.720
 And so what we do is like somebody would be on the phone and you'd be like, hey, who

2:47:04.720 --> 2:47:05.840
 are you talking to?

2:47:05.840 --> 2:47:08.400
 Can you ask them to look up on their phone?

2:47:08.400 --> 2:47:12.920
 Like so we'd ask people on the phone or somebody would go make a call and, you know, you'd

2:47:12.920 --> 2:47:17.520
 have to call somebody and ask them to Google the cast of a movie or something like that.

2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:18.760
 I think you would find jail.

2:47:18.760 --> 2:47:22.600
 Don't ever get arrested or try not to, but I think you would find jail fascinating.

2:47:22.600 --> 2:47:28.840
 Oh, I always wanted to go to jail prison because there's a lot of almost it and I'll ask you

2:47:28.840 --> 2:47:32.400
 questions about it, but I feel like I can get a lot of reading done.

2:47:32.400 --> 2:47:33.960
 I got a ton of reading done.

2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:34.960
 Yeah.

2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:35.960
 Yeah.

2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:36.960
 Yes.

2:47:36.960 --> 2:47:37.960
 I don't remember now.

2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:40.280
 People attribute this to George Orwell, but they're not sure if George Orwell ever said

2:47:40.280 --> 2:47:45.920
 it, but it's something like there's a lot of different variations, but we sleep safely

2:47:45.920 --> 2:47:51.480
 at night because rough men stand ready to visit violence on those who would harm us.

2:47:51.480 --> 2:47:56.920
 And there's a lot of variations of this, but basically we depend, our entire society depends

2:47:56.920 --> 2:48:03.920
 on bad motherfuckers who are willing to fight to protect our freedoms, to protect our well

2:48:03.920 --> 2:48:05.240
 being.

2:48:05.240 --> 2:48:10.080
 And one of the things about the United States is because we're surrounded by water, we don't

2:48:10.080 --> 2:48:21.360
 get to see the violence that's required in part to protect the sovereignty of nations.

2:48:21.360 --> 2:48:29.360
 You mentioned that I would not to go to prison, but that I may enjoy my time there.

2:48:29.360 --> 2:48:33.280
 Let me ask you, by the way, I love prison movies.

2:48:33.280 --> 2:48:34.320
 You would find it fascinating.

2:48:34.320 --> 2:48:38.840
 I don't because it's like still kind of too soon, but...

2:48:38.840 --> 2:48:40.000
 Well, how was your time?

2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:44.400
 You spent three and a half months at Rikers.

2:48:44.400 --> 2:48:45.400
 How was that?

2:48:45.400 --> 2:48:49.680
 How was your experience in prison?

2:48:49.680 --> 2:48:52.280
 How's the food from a chef perspective?

2:48:52.280 --> 2:48:58.240
 Not good, but Rikers was when I got to Rikers.

2:48:58.240 --> 2:49:06.400
 So I was arrested, I spent, I think about 10 days in a small town, Tennessee, Joe, Pigeon

2:49:06.400 --> 2:49:09.400
 Forge is also the weirdest place on earth.

2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:10.400
 Is it a town?

2:49:10.400 --> 2:49:12.560
 Yes, it's the town where I was arrested.

2:49:12.560 --> 2:49:14.720
 Why is it so weird?

2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:19.200
 In the film, I told them, I told them, you have to go to Pigeon Forge, you have to go

2:49:19.200 --> 2:49:20.560
 there, you have to go there.

2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:26.640
 And I think I was pushing them because it was gonna potentially be the end of the season.

2:49:26.640 --> 2:49:38.600
 It's like a summertime or it's a tourist destination and it's so bizarre and weird and trippy that

2:49:38.600 --> 2:49:39.600
 it doesn't even seem real.

2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:42.920
 It seems like a carnival is happening there nonstop.

2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:43.920
 Exactly.

2:49:43.920 --> 2:49:49.320
 I think I say that in my intro, that it's carnivalesque and trippy and weird.

2:49:49.320 --> 2:49:53.600
 Is there a lot of clowns walking around?

2:49:53.600 --> 2:49:59.320
 Not necessarily clowns, but there is a video on YouTube that I, because I got to the chapter

2:49:59.320 --> 2:50:05.320
 where we arrive in Pigeon Forge and I'll never forget, although I have forgotten, but I remember

2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:13.440
 being like weirdly, like felt like we had entered a different universe driving down

2:50:13.440 --> 2:50:18.040
 this strip and just looking at everything on either side and I'm wishing that I could

2:50:18.040 --> 2:50:22.120
 remember in more detail like the names of the places or what was there because I wanted

2:50:22.120 --> 2:50:27.520
 to describe it in this chapter and I was like, I wish somebody, I wish there was like a video

2:50:27.520 --> 2:50:31.200
 of somebody going down the street kind of showing what's on one side and then the other

2:50:31.200 --> 2:50:36.200
 side and I was like, there probably is and there is on YouTube, like I found it and I

2:50:36.200 --> 2:50:37.200
 watched the whole thing.

2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:39.360
 How does this come up from prison exactly?

2:50:39.360 --> 2:50:40.360
 Pigeon.

2:50:40.360 --> 2:50:41.360
 Oh, okay.

2:50:41.360 --> 2:50:42.360
 Why did that spark?

2:50:42.360 --> 2:50:44.600
 So that's the town that I went to jail in.

2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:45.600
 Oh, right.

2:50:45.600 --> 2:50:46.600
 That's right.

2:50:46.600 --> 2:50:47.600
 In Tennessee.

2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:48.600
 All right.

2:50:48.600 --> 2:50:49.600
 What was that like?

2:50:49.600 --> 2:50:57.840
 The food there and some of the conditions, the food made, when I got to, then I was extradited

2:50:57.840 --> 2:51:02.280
 and transferred to Rikers and when I got to Rikers, I felt like it was like the four seasons

2:51:02.280 --> 2:51:03.280
 in comparison.

2:51:03.280 --> 2:51:04.280
 Wow.

2:51:04.280 --> 2:51:12.600
 So, and I really kind of appreciated a lot of things about New York when I got to Rikers,

2:51:12.600 --> 2:51:15.720
 even though there are a lot of things that are very scary about it.

2:51:15.720 --> 2:51:16.720
 Where's Rikers located?

2:51:16.720 --> 2:51:19.120
 Is it close to New York City?

2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:20.120
 Yes.

2:51:20.120 --> 2:51:28.320
 And in a very kind of almost poetically interesting way, the dorm room where I was when I was

2:51:28.320 --> 2:51:31.560
 there for the three and a half months was one of the ones that faced Manhattan.

2:51:31.560 --> 2:51:36.760
 So I could go across the room and look out the window and see the whole Manhattan skyline.

2:51:36.760 --> 2:51:38.080
 To the view.

2:51:38.080 --> 2:51:39.080
 Which was...

2:51:39.080 --> 2:51:47.080
 I remember being shocked by the cost per prisoner per year.

2:51:47.080 --> 2:51:48.080
 Yes.

2:51:48.080 --> 2:51:53.520
 That New York pays is like $400,000, $500,000 or something.

2:51:53.520 --> 2:51:54.680
 I didn't think it was that much.

2:51:54.680 --> 2:51:56.680
 I thought I wrote it down, but either way it is...

2:51:56.680 --> 2:52:02.160
 No, I mean, it elevated during COVID, which is fascinating.

2:52:02.160 --> 2:52:04.520
 To that, the number I just said.

2:52:04.520 --> 2:52:05.520
 Yeah.

2:52:05.520 --> 2:52:09.640
 During COVID, I felt sick to my stomach thinking about people stuck there.

2:52:09.640 --> 2:52:12.480
 And again, so Rikers isn't like a long term prison.

2:52:12.480 --> 2:52:17.240
 It's most of the people at Rikers are awaiting trial.

2:52:17.240 --> 2:52:19.560
 And they've been arrested, but not convicted.

2:52:19.560 --> 2:52:23.680
 And then if you're convicted in your sentence to less than a year, then you put on a different

2:52:23.680 --> 2:52:27.320
 color uniform and you go upstairs to different dorms.

2:52:27.320 --> 2:52:31.120
 If you're convicted and sentenced to more than a year, you're sent to one of the upstate

2:52:31.120 --> 2:52:33.280
 prisons.

2:52:33.280 --> 2:52:35.720
 So most of the people at Rikers are there in transition.

2:52:35.720 --> 2:52:39.240
 They've been arrested, but not...

2:52:39.240 --> 2:52:43.040
 They've been arrested, but not convicted or awaiting trial.

2:52:43.040 --> 2:52:49.320
 So you could be perfectly innocent and you're stuck there and that happens to a lot of people.

2:52:49.320 --> 2:52:57.840
 Or you could be arrested over some kind of comparatively petty thing or nonviolent thing

2:52:57.840 --> 2:53:05.080
 and stuck there because you don't have as little as $500 to pay bail, which is completely

2:53:05.080 --> 2:53:08.040
 messed up and unjust.

2:53:08.040 --> 2:53:13.800
 And I think most reasonable people agree that it's unjust, but it's different when you're

2:53:13.800 --> 2:53:20.280
 there and you see those people and you see kind of the anguish.

2:53:20.280 --> 2:53:21.280
 And whether...

2:53:21.280 --> 2:53:22.880
 I mean, I have no idea if they're guilty of what...

2:53:22.880 --> 2:53:27.160
 I mean, I usually don't know what people are there for, what the situation is, but you

2:53:27.160 --> 2:53:35.760
 watch the sort of helplessness set in because you're kind of powerless there.

2:53:35.760 --> 2:53:37.720
 You have very little contact with the outside world.

2:53:37.720 --> 2:53:39.880
 You have these limited phone calls.

2:53:39.880 --> 2:53:44.520
 And so for people who had kids and a job and an apartment, it's like one by one, those

2:53:44.520 --> 2:53:50.080
 things are lost or their kids are now being looked after by their abusive ex husband or

2:53:50.080 --> 2:53:51.080
 something like that.

2:53:51.080 --> 2:53:57.760
 And so watching that is just gut wrenching and then also knowing that the only reason

2:53:57.760 --> 2:54:04.280
 they're unable to get out is because of $1,000, $2,000, in some cases $500.

2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:07.960
 They were people...

2:54:07.960 --> 2:54:13.240
 So there's all of these tragic cases, but then there was also while I was there, I mean,

2:54:13.240 --> 2:54:16.520
 if I'd had any money, I would have been wanting to bail people out left and right.

2:54:16.520 --> 2:54:21.160
 And then in some cases, I think there was a woman there snored really loud and her bail

2:54:21.160 --> 2:54:22.160
 was $500.

2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:27.080
 And I was like, I wish I had him, I want to bail her out.

2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:32.080
 She just wanted to bail her out, because I'm pretty sensitive to sounds and being in a

2:54:32.080 --> 2:54:34.440
 room with 50 people inevitably.

2:54:34.440 --> 2:54:38.040
 So you're in a room with a large number of people?

2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:48.000
 Yeah, there are areas there with cells, but a lot of the areas there are rooms with 50

2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:49.000
 beds.

2:54:49.000 --> 2:54:50.880
 And they're about three feet apart from each other.

2:54:50.880 --> 2:54:56.360
 So during COVID, there was certainly no social distancing.

2:54:56.360 --> 2:55:01.800
 And that just felt kind of sickening, especially because so many of the people are there for

2:55:01.800 --> 2:55:08.760
 nonviolent things or drug addiction related or mental health issues.

2:55:08.760 --> 2:55:16.600
 How did that, you personally just having spent that time there for three and a half months,

2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:18.920
 how did that change you?

2:55:18.920 --> 2:55:26.960
 Like what did that have an effect on your mind?

2:55:26.960 --> 2:55:38.720
 My mind personally, I think I was surprised at how well I adapted and then how I was able

2:55:38.720 --> 2:55:43.360
 to, and then I think I sort of took it at the next level when one of the books somebody

2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:49.600
 sent me was The Untethered Soul by Michael Singer, and it's very much about like observing

2:55:49.600 --> 2:55:55.920
 your mind and that kind of helped take it to the next level.

2:55:55.920 --> 2:55:59.240
 So was this like a meditation retreat for you?

2:55:59.240 --> 2:56:06.920
 Well, it's like, it'd be like trying to meditate in the middle of a circus or in crazy circumstances

2:56:06.920 --> 2:56:08.640
 because you're never alone.

2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:09.840
 There's nowhere to be alone.

2:56:09.840 --> 2:56:14.840
 And there's always talking, there's noises, there's fighting, noises, chaos.

2:56:14.840 --> 2:56:18.920
 Did you feel in danger?

2:56:18.920 --> 2:56:31.040
 Yes, but I never felt terrified there, you know, one of my friends, the bathroom is the

2:56:31.040 --> 2:56:36.240
 scary place because they don't have cameras in the bathroom.

2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:39.680
 So that's sort of one has to watch out there.

2:56:39.680 --> 2:56:44.400
 And I did one of my friends who I, one of the people I was friends with there, she did

2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:49.760
 get beat up a bit in the bathroom one day.

2:56:49.760 --> 2:56:56.880
 A lot of weird shit happened in the bathroom, but it was for my, if you're interested in

2:56:56.880 --> 2:57:02.400
 human behavior and psychology, and it's, it can be fascinating to kind of sit there and

2:57:02.400 --> 2:57:03.400
 watch things.

2:57:03.400 --> 2:57:06.720
 You're saying like you might enjoy prison for that perspective, like just you get to

2:57:06.720 --> 2:57:13.680
 watch human nature, it's like, I don't want to say that it's worse, but like the full

2:57:13.680 --> 2:57:16.960
 variety that it can take.

2:57:16.960 --> 2:57:17.960
 Right.

2:57:17.960 --> 2:57:19.680
 And there was a lot of beauty there as well.

2:57:19.680 --> 2:57:20.680
 I mean,

2:57:20.680 --> 2:57:21.680
 Was there love?

2:57:21.680 --> 2:57:28.400
 People being, well, again, depends on the definition of love, but people being, you know, incredibly

2:57:28.400 --> 2:57:39.120
 generous and kind to each other, sometimes people singing at night, there was just a

2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:44.800
 lot of, and then there was a lot of, you know, hilarious stuff.

2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:45.800
 It's just, it's all there.

2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:52.400
 There's like, there's tragic things, you know, interesting things.

2:57:52.400 --> 2:57:58.640
 A lot of people with mental health issues, which is, can be difficult to witness.

2:57:58.640 --> 2:58:05.560
 So a very different experience that I should ask you this, but somebody that's currently

2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:15.960
 in prison, Galene Maxwell, I believe she spent approximately 500 days in isolation.

2:58:15.960 --> 2:58:20.760
 So it's a very different prison experience.

2:58:20.760 --> 2:58:22.160
 But what do you think about her case?

2:58:22.160 --> 2:58:25.320
 What do you think about her and Jeffrey Epstein?

2:58:25.320 --> 2:58:35.360
 She, so her brother, her family, she says that she's a victim.

2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:36.880
 What about the monster?

2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:44.400
 I think this is an especially fascinating case because, and I have listened to podcasts

2:58:44.400 --> 2:58:49.120
 about the, you know, the Epstein situation.

2:58:49.120 --> 2:58:54.080
 And there was one that was more focused on her by Vicki Ward that I would definitely

2:58:54.080 --> 2:58:56.280
 listen to.

2:58:56.280 --> 2:58:58.920
 Vicki Ward is a journalist.

2:58:58.920 --> 2:59:02.600
 I think she'd written an article about Jeffrey Epstein for Vanity Fair, so she got to know

2:59:02.600 --> 2:59:09.400
 Jeffrey Epstein, and then she knew Galene Maxwell from being sort of part of the social

2:59:09.400 --> 2:59:12.200
 circle in which they would have overlapped.

2:59:12.200 --> 2:59:15.400
 Have you, by the way, ever met them since this New York?

2:59:15.400 --> 2:59:21.640
 Do you remember meeting this, you know, Jeffrey or Galene?

2:59:21.640 --> 2:59:23.400
 No, I never met them.

2:59:23.400 --> 2:59:26.720
 They're also very much like this sort of upper east side crowd.

2:59:26.720 --> 2:59:31.920
 I did meet Harvey Weinstein once that made me have all kinds of interesting thoughts later.

2:59:31.920 --> 2:59:32.920
 At the restaurant?

2:59:32.920 --> 2:59:33.920
 Or elsewhere?

2:59:33.920 --> 2:59:34.920
 No, it was weird.

2:59:34.920 --> 2:59:39.880
 It was out on the street, and we had this really strange interaction.

2:59:39.880 --> 2:59:44.640
 And knowing what I know now, it was eerie.

2:59:44.640 --> 2:59:50.040
 And also, like, Hedy contacted me after that and made it seem like he could have done something

2:59:50.040 --> 2:59:51.040
 for me.

2:59:51.040 --> 2:59:58.120
 Like, would I have been, you know, say he said, oh, I'm gonna finance your whole expansion

2:59:58.120 --> 3:00:02.440
 or something, and like, come to my, you know, come meet me at this hotel, and then I go

3:00:02.440 --> 3:00:05.400
 to that hotel, and then he's like, come up to the room, and then I would have been like,

3:00:05.400 --> 3:00:06.400
 ugh.

3:00:06.400 --> 3:00:09.480
 And you were wondering whether you would have done it?

3:00:09.480 --> 3:00:20.920
 Yes, and sadly, I think I would have, and so I felt a lot of compassion for those who,

3:00:20.920 --> 3:00:25.560
 you know, didn't yell at him and leave or didn't storm out.

3:00:25.560 --> 3:00:34.760
 And because I think what happens in those situations is, you know, there's all kinds

3:00:34.760 --> 3:00:37.480
 of uncertainty in the moment, and you sort of freeze.

3:00:37.480 --> 3:00:42.680
 And then you'll, if I'm probably one of those people that would sit there and somehow in

3:00:42.680 --> 3:00:49.520
 the moment without clarity, just instinctively feel like somehow I must have done something

3:00:49.520 --> 3:00:55.640
 wrong and it's my fault, and like, I led him on and are just being afraid.

3:00:55.640 --> 3:01:01.200
 And then you don't know how to deal with it, and so you freeze.

3:01:01.200 --> 3:01:08.640
 So I think that, you know, if you're somebody that maybe was raised differently or you have

3:01:08.640 --> 3:01:15.840
 a lot of self confidence or you might have reacted differently and kind of pushed him

3:01:15.840 --> 3:01:19.480
 away and stormed out.

3:01:19.480 --> 3:01:22.760
 But I am probably not one of those people.

3:01:22.760 --> 3:01:25.440
 But I did not ever meet Jeffrey Epstein.

3:01:25.440 --> 3:01:29.480
 But he seems very straightforwardly, you know, just a classic.

3:01:29.480 --> 3:01:36.880
 The way he was able to charm people, the way he could step into these roles, you know,

3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:41.200
 I think he was teaching at Dalton and then just kind of the way he would get himself

3:01:41.200 --> 3:01:47.200
 into the academic crowd within Harvard and I think also MIT, right?

3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:54.360
 So he's playing a role, but he's doing it so well that he fools all these people.

3:01:54.360 --> 3:02:00.760
 And the things that people would in hindsight say about him are just the same things that

3:02:00.760 --> 3:02:04.480
 people say about, it's like you hear the same things over and over again, you hear the same

3:02:04.480 --> 3:02:10.440
 things said about those people who were taken in by Elizabeth Holmes is that they were,

3:02:10.440 --> 3:02:14.760
 it was as if he was under a spell, it was as if I was under a spell is something you

3:02:14.760 --> 3:02:16.160
 hear a lot.

3:02:16.160 --> 3:02:22.880
 And so it's like they have this powerful charm that's almost overwhelming in that they overwhelm

3:02:22.880 --> 3:02:31.480
 your better judgment or they overwhelm your like normal, otherwise normally functioning

3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:36.480
 capacity for rational thought and they sort of overwhelm that with their charm.

3:02:36.480 --> 3:02:40.080
 So you know, when you look at, I think it was like James Mattis invested a bunch of

3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:46.400
 money with Elizabeth Holmes and all these people were involved with her and nobody really

3:02:46.400 --> 3:02:49.840
 did their due diligence or they just sort of trusted her.

3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:57.560
 And Jeffrey Epstein, I think it's still unclear where he got all this money, but the guy Wexner,

3:02:57.560 --> 3:03:04.080
 Les Wexner, who had any normal amount of money and somehow very quickly turned over management

3:03:04.080 --> 3:03:06.440
 of it to Jeffrey Epstein.

3:03:06.440 --> 3:03:08.280
 And so people wonder like, why would he do that?

3:03:08.280 --> 3:03:09.780
 That's insane.

3:03:09.780 --> 3:03:14.840
 And then other people have commented about that relationship, like it was as if he was

3:03:14.840 --> 3:03:18.800
 under Jeffrey's spell, you know, observers would say, I couldn't understand it, it was

3:03:18.800 --> 3:03:20.720
 as if he was under his spell.

3:03:20.720 --> 3:03:26.720
 And so somebody observing me and Mr. Fox could have possibly said the same thing about me,

3:03:26.720 --> 3:03:28.280
 but it's a bit different because it wasn't all charm.

3:03:28.280 --> 3:03:34.640
 I think Epstein used his charm and then was probably very, very, very crafty and getting

3:03:34.640 --> 3:03:41.920
 another thing that people like him do and cults do also is to get is to get you somehow

3:03:41.920 --> 3:03:45.200
 compromised because then they've got you.

3:03:45.200 --> 3:03:49.240
 So I think some kind of usually sex related.

3:03:49.240 --> 3:03:50.240
 Yeah.

3:03:50.240 --> 3:03:54.720
 And with Epstein, certainly, you know, he was known to have cameras everywhere.

3:03:54.720 --> 3:03:59.760
 And so if he got any of these people on camera doing something compromising and all very powerful

3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:06.160
 people, then he's got them. And I think he was also very smart to do that, to target

3:04:06.160 --> 3:04:12.680
 people of both parties so that politically that he was able to maintain his power like

3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:20.720
 no matter like nobody wanted him to be totally exposed because then people, a lot of people

3:04:20.720 --> 3:04:22.720
 would be exposed.

3:04:22.720 --> 3:04:28.400
 By the way, that part, you know, that's all kind of conspiracy, right?

3:04:28.400 --> 3:04:32.560
 Right. We don't know that.

3:04:32.560 --> 3:04:37.240
 So a lot of people believe that and, you know, I tend to kind of naturally believe that because

3:04:37.240 --> 3:04:41.560
 that makes sense, but it's also possible that straight up with charisma.

3:04:41.560 --> 3:04:47.600
 I mean, he did record people and there were recordings. So I listened to an interview

3:04:47.600 --> 3:04:56.200
 with a woman who, I mean, was a girl back then. Maybe she was 15 or 16 back then. And

3:04:56.200 --> 3:05:03.520
 subsequently, years later, was able to see some of the video of, I mean, I think that's

3:05:03.520 --> 3:05:06.480
 a verifiable thing that there were video cameras all over his house.

3:05:06.480 --> 3:05:09.360
 Yeah, but the degree to which it was used.

3:05:09.360 --> 3:05:11.920
 Right. We don't know that.

3:05:11.920 --> 3:05:17.600
 And to the degree of how many people were involved and so on, there's all kinds of

3:05:17.600 --> 3:05:23.640
 conspiracies around the man. But the question about her, her, Ghislaine.

3:05:23.640 --> 3:05:31.040
 So I only know what I know from the inputs, which are the Vicki Ward. It's one of the

3:05:31.040 --> 3:05:38.680
 podcasts. It's a narrative podcast. So it's like an audio kind of a documentary or journalistic

3:05:38.680 --> 3:05:43.120
 piece that she did and put out. I thought it was really, really well done. I think it's

3:05:43.120 --> 3:05:49.600
 called Chasing Ghislaine. And I listened to that whole thing. I didn't intend to listen

3:05:49.600 --> 3:05:51.320
 to it all in one stretch.

3:05:51.320 --> 3:05:52.320
 That's how you know it's good.

3:05:52.320 --> 3:05:57.440
 I mean, it was like a weekend and I basically was cleaning and doing other things and walking

3:05:57.440 --> 3:06:02.040
 Leon and listening to it. And I got through it pretty quickly. But I got really fascinated

3:06:02.040 --> 3:06:12.800
 by it because I don't know, but I think I feel like I find the whole situation gut wrenching

3:06:12.800 --> 3:06:25.000
 because I think Jeffrey Epstein is a straight up sociopath like no question with her. Everybody's

3:06:25.000 --> 3:06:34.960
 calling her evil and for her to have enabled and done a lot of the things that she did

3:06:34.960 --> 3:06:41.400
 could potentially require. One might say that it could require a lack of empathy to be able

3:06:41.400 --> 3:06:53.800
 to do those things knowingly. But at the same time, I think the information that was conveyed

3:06:53.800 --> 3:07:00.160
 in the Vicki Ward piece was fascinating to me because it's clear that at the very least

3:07:00.160 --> 3:07:05.360
 it's like all of these things could be true. She could maybe be not enough of a good person

3:07:05.360 --> 3:07:12.520
 to have horribly victimized these young girls and destroy their lives. But she could have,

3:07:12.520 --> 3:07:17.280
 I feel like I'm going to get bashed for saying this, but she could have in some way of not

3:07:17.280 --> 3:07:24.520
 quite known what she was doing or been a bit out of her mind, maybe not. I'm just saying

3:07:24.520 --> 3:07:31.400
 people, I would hope that people would be open to that's to exploring that as a possibility.

3:07:31.400 --> 3:07:40.080
 While her family and friends are making that case, they're painting a broad picture of

3:07:40.080 --> 3:07:46.240
 who she is as a human being and showing that she couldn't have done any of those things

3:07:46.240 --> 3:07:52.800
 without being systematically manipulated. That's their case.

3:07:52.800 --> 3:08:00.560
 What I listened to in that podcast about her relationship with her father, how her father

3:08:00.560 --> 3:08:09.280
 died, her things about her childhood, and then Epstein coming into her life and basically

3:08:09.280 --> 3:08:14.400
 pushing all those buttons and becoming the father figure. She would be in a position

3:08:14.400 --> 3:08:23.000
 of always wanting his approval and just the way that things that are described about the

3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:34.960
 way that she was so subservient to him in this astonishing way that seems really weird

3:08:34.960 --> 3:08:41.000
 and abnormal. Yet I think she had a lot of money and connections. I think she lost the

3:08:41.000 --> 3:08:48.240
 money but had all the connections. Either way, there was a lot that Epstein gained via

3:08:48.240 --> 3:08:55.360
 his relationship with her like a ton. It makes sense that he would have manipulated her.

3:08:55.360 --> 3:09:01.600
 He manipulates everybody. Without question, I think one could argue he definitely manipulated

3:09:01.600 --> 3:09:09.840
 her. Again, I want to be careful not to be saying that's an excuse for what she did.

3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:17.080
 I just think that it's important to explore these things and be open to them as opposed

3:09:17.080 --> 3:09:24.200
 to just broad brush painting her as a horrible person. People could say that based on things

3:09:24.200 --> 3:09:30.800
 they've read or things that I did that I'm a horrible person. It's very different because

3:09:30.800 --> 3:09:44.200
 what she did involved young girls whose lives were destroyed. I think that people could

3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:51.240
 be a bit open to understanding how somebody could be manipulated. There's a psychologist

3:09:51.240 --> 3:09:59.200
 that I'm friends with that I got to know after I watched him on Leah Remini's show. Leah

3:09:59.200 --> 3:10:04.800
 Remini is the actress who was in Scientology, got out and has really been speaking out about

3:10:04.800 --> 3:10:11.140
 it and trying to expose what they're all about and how diabolical that organization is. A

3:10:11.140 --> 3:10:18.840
 lot of people are exposing them and doing this type of work. She had this guy on her

3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:27.960
 show who was in the Mooneys. His name is Steve Hassan. He was in a cult and then he got out

3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:32.600
 again by extreme circumstances. He got in a car accident and almost died. That's what

3:10:32.600 --> 3:10:39.080
 ended up getting him out of the cult that he was in. Really smart guy was targeted when

3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:46.080
 he was young, got pulled into the Mooneys. Watching this interview of him on her show,

3:10:46.080 --> 3:10:50.480
 he's talking about his experience and he said, if they had told me to kill somebody, I would

3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:59.680
 have. That in that moment made me cry, but I also felt like I understand that and not

3:10:59.680 --> 3:11:04.440
 that if Mr. Fox had told me to kill somebody, I don't think I would have, but again, I understand

3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:13.680
 how it could get to that point. That makes me feel like with her, I'd be curious what

3:11:13.680 --> 3:11:18.920
 Steve Hassan would think, analyzing the entire situation because it's hard to understand

3:11:18.920 --> 3:11:23.800
 that unless you've been in it. I understand with him how he could have said that. If they

3:11:23.800 --> 3:11:30.200
 had told me to kill somebody, I would have. That's pretty intense. That's pretty extreme.

3:11:30.200 --> 3:11:35.880
 It's interesting how you can get into it, how far you can go just one day at a time,

3:11:35.880 --> 3:11:43.000
 like gradually, just like the frog in the boiling water. It's so fascinating.

3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:46.200
 All of these cases are fascinating, like Patty Hearst, that whole story.

3:11:46.200 --> 3:11:53.280
 Well, I'm just also, I just, it's already a while ago, reread the Rise and Fall of

3:11:53.280 --> 3:12:01.880
 the Third Reich. I've been reading a lot, a lot about Hitler and Govind for a long time

3:12:01.880 --> 3:12:11.640
 working on a series about Hitler and the Third Reich, because for me, it's like returning.

3:12:11.640 --> 3:12:18.600
 So much of my family was destroyed or impacted by this time in history, that it's somehow

3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:24.600
 a way to find out more about myself, is going back to that time.

3:12:24.600 --> 3:12:29.440
 Have you ever thought about inherited trauma?

3:12:29.440 --> 3:12:39.000
 This sounds not to mock people, but this sounds like a thing that...

3:12:39.000 --> 3:12:41.720
 Like a woke thing?

3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:43.240
 Like a woke thing, yeah.

3:12:43.240 --> 3:12:47.880
 I don't mean it that way at all, but I get it, because sometimes now when I say, now

3:12:47.880 --> 3:12:51.520
 I almost have to put air quotes when I say something's triggering, because I feel like

3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:57.600
 I'm using a word that's now overused or used in less...

3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:02.000
 So now when I say something's triggering, it's like, I use air quotes.

3:13:02.000 --> 3:13:06.080
 Yeah, it's funny, because good words get taken up and then they get destroyed.

3:13:06.080 --> 3:13:10.880
 People are overusing gaslighting, and I worry that that would happen with sociopathy.

3:13:10.880 --> 3:13:16.080
 I think people need to understand sociopathy. I think it's critical for humanity that people

3:13:16.080 --> 3:13:17.080
 understand it.

3:13:17.080 --> 3:13:20.840
 Yeah, so just because you're being an asshole doesn't mean you're sociopath, exactly.

3:13:20.840 --> 3:13:23.600
 And I feel like it's going to be this thing where now everybody's going to start calling

3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:27.760
 everybody else a sociopath, and it's like, oh, you know, and right now everybody calls

3:13:27.760 --> 3:13:30.840
 everything gaslighting. If somebody's lying, it's like gaslighting.

3:13:30.840 --> 3:13:35.600
 I have to talk... We started talking about, I already forgot, fluff. Is it fluff? It's

3:13:35.600 --> 3:13:36.600
 fluff, right?

3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:37.600
 Fluff, yeah.

3:13:37.600 --> 3:13:42.960
 Yeah. Okay, so that was great. That's a new discovery for me. Let's talk about food

3:13:42.960 --> 3:13:49.680
 a little bit if we can. You know what? Let's talk about restaurants first. That's a fascinating

3:13:49.680 --> 3:13:57.800
 part of the story before anything else, which is opening an exceptionally successful restaurant

3:13:57.800 --> 3:14:05.480
 in NYC, New York City. What's that take? What does it take to open up from the very beginning,

3:14:05.480 --> 3:14:11.400
 from the idea stage to the launching it, both the finances and the skill of actually getting

3:14:11.400 --> 3:14:17.200
 people super excited by it and then running it, all that chaos? I mean, to me, am I over

3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:23.400
 romanticizing it, but it seems like New York City is a really tough place to launch a restaurant

3:14:23.400 --> 3:14:24.400
 in.

3:14:24.400 --> 3:14:29.320
 Yes, very... Well, I think because it's extremely competitive and the standards are so high.

3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:36.280
 So I think that's why there are so many good restaurants in New York, because if they're

3:14:36.280 --> 3:14:41.600
 not good, they're not going to survive. So even like you could walk into what looks like

3:14:41.600 --> 3:14:47.280
 a hole in the wall and it's going to have amazing food, that happens a lot.

3:14:47.280 --> 3:14:52.880
 So what was the menu? So was it a raw? Was it vegan and raw from the beginning?

3:14:52.880 --> 3:14:53.880
 Yeah, it was.

3:14:53.880 --> 3:14:55.400
 And raw means what?

3:14:55.400 --> 3:14:59.000
 Now, I'm getting thrown back to all the interviews I did when people asked me these questions.

3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:01.720
 It was so long ago. At the time...

3:15:01.720 --> 3:15:04.400
 What's it like being vegan?

3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:13.280
 It... So nothing was cooked over roughly 118 degrees. It was this very like the world of...

3:15:13.280 --> 3:15:19.200
 There were people who are hardcore raw foodists and there's also people who are hardcore vegans

3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:23.560
 and I was never any of those things. So I think what we did...

3:15:23.560 --> 3:15:30.320
 You weren't the hardcore part or you weren't... But you... Like what parts of your life were

3:15:30.320 --> 3:15:37.800
 you a vegan? Are you still a vegan? Do you eat meat? Are you a vegetarian? Are you raw?

3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:43.760
 Good question. I don't apply labels. So none of those labels would apply because it's...

3:15:43.760 --> 3:15:54.520
 Male and female. That's... I'm beyond those labels myself as well. But I'm a carnivore

3:15:54.520 --> 3:15:59.600
 most of the time. There you go. It's the opposite of vegan unfortunately. But no judgment.

3:15:59.600 --> 3:16:02.000
 I think that's a beautiful thing to be as vegan.

3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:07.680
 Likewise. I think that it's people who are very adamantly one way or the other. I think

3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:17.000
 that after all my years in this world and in this world in general and also consuming

3:16:17.000 --> 3:16:23.320
 an enormous amount of inputs and podcasts about health, like I love listening to different

3:16:23.320 --> 3:16:26.960
 points of view. So I love when like somebody's arguing vegan and then somebody's arguing

3:16:26.960 --> 3:16:32.760
 carnivore and like... Or even with other issues, I like listening to what other people... Opposing

3:16:32.760 --> 3:16:36.640
 sides assuming they're both intelligent, interesting sources.

3:16:36.640 --> 3:16:42.080
 Especially when they're... I love it when they're sort of really testing that diet, meaning

3:16:42.080 --> 3:16:48.480
 they're athletes or in some way really testing it. Not just like vaguely saying what's healthy

3:16:48.480 --> 3:16:53.160
 and not for you, but like really what is life like under this particular diet?

3:16:53.160 --> 3:16:59.200
 Yeah. And I think that probably everybody's different. And so in the same way that some

3:16:59.200 --> 3:17:03.880
 people tolerate... Like some people can't tolerate nightshades or some people can't

3:17:03.880 --> 3:17:09.480
 tolerate certain spices or some people can't tolerate gluten or some people thrive off

3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:17.680
 of this or that. And I've heard it said and discussed that there's a great deal to sort

3:17:17.680 --> 3:17:23.760
 of what your body's used to, what your ancestors ate, where... Because it seems like the human

3:17:23.760 --> 3:17:32.520
 body's pretty adaptable. So you can adapt to eating a certain type of a food and so

3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:37.480
 that if your family comes from a certain part of the world where certain things aren't grown

3:17:37.480 --> 3:17:43.240
 or more meat is eaten or... Because there's people who are vegan their entire lives and

3:17:43.240 --> 3:17:46.720
 they're incredibly healthy and they thrive and there's athletes and there's people like

3:17:46.720 --> 3:17:54.220
 Rich Roll who I like who's vegan and an athlete. But it might be something where that's working

3:17:54.220 --> 3:17:57.760
 really well for him, but it wouldn't work well for somebody else. And I think there's

3:17:57.760 --> 3:18:04.080
 also an element of people who try these things and then feel really good or feel really bad

3:18:04.080 --> 3:18:09.440
 and they make a conclusion based on that initial period of time when it might be something

3:18:09.440 --> 3:18:14.560
 where it makes you feel really good temporarily, but then over time you're going to be depleted

3:18:14.560 --> 3:18:20.000
 of certain things. And then we also live in a world where our soil is depleted and there's

3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:27.240
 a lot of processing that takes out of foods, a lot of things that we need. So I just think

3:18:27.240 --> 3:18:32.440
 that there's no kind of one right answer. You can look at it from just a health perspective

3:18:32.440 --> 3:18:36.640
 and then you can also look at it from a morality and ethics perspective and then also what's

3:18:36.640 --> 3:18:40.640
 the impact on the environment and all those things are important. And I think that I've

3:18:40.640 --> 3:18:46.800
 watched a lot of films and things and for a while right after that I might think, oh

3:18:46.800 --> 3:18:50.360
 my God, I can't believe I ate this thing last week and now I'm going to go back to being

3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:55.160
 100% vegan because I just watched this thing and it's fresh in my mind and now I'm thinking

3:18:55.160 --> 3:19:00.480
 about it in a certain way. But then over time that sort of fades and then you start to get

3:19:00.480 --> 3:19:12.280
 a bit more loose. And for me, I will end up eating a lot of things that aren't vegan

3:19:12.280 --> 3:19:22.040
 usually in the context where I'm not adding to the consumption of it. So like at Rikers

3:19:22.040 --> 3:19:26.680
 there was most of the meat there was kind of weird and fake, but there was like a chicken

3:19:26.680 --> 3:19:32.600
 every Thursday and Sunday. There was actual chicken like the leg.

3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:36.600
 What was that the most exciting thing for people? Oh yeah. Oh and then the most fights

3:19:36.600 --> 3:19:38.680
 broke out on chicken day because there was like heightened.

3:19:38.680 --> 3:19:44.600
 Thursday and Sunday you said? Yeah. Chicken day. So that was the most real meat you're

3:19:44.600 --> 3:19:51.800
 getting is the chicken. Yeah. Chicken breast or dark, white or dark meat? Dark is the leg

3:19:51.800 --> 3:20:00.720
 in the thigh. And it was cooked surprisingly well. And so I would always eat it. I mean,

3:20:00.720 --> 3:20:06.560
 it's there and it's not from a health perspective, one could say, well, that's probably the shittiest

3:20:06.560 --> 3:20:11.520
 of the shitty chickens that are full of antibiotics and hormones and terrible things. And so it's

3:20:11.520 --> 3:20:17.320
 not optimal from that point of view. But it's like if it's otherwise going to be thrown

3:20:17.320 --> 3:20:22.960
 in the trash then. Yeah. You're not adding to it. Right. Or like I've been drunk at

3:20:22.960 --> 3:20:28.840
 a party and eaten a bunch of stuff that one would think I would never eat. Yeah. But it's

3:20:28.840 --> 3:20:32.320
 not like I ran to the store and bought it or went to a restaurant and ordered it.

3:20:32.320 --> 3:20:38.880
 The same liquor makes me eat things I shouldn't be eating. Oh yeah. Or maybe should. Well,

3:20:38.880 --> 3:20:45.240
 life is, as you wrote me in the email, life is complicated and fascinating and so was

3:20:45.240 --> 3:20:52.400
 our decisions when we're drunk. I actually am a big fan of 711. I go there sometimes

3:20:52.400 --> 3:20:58.160
 late at night to think about life and I'll eat, I'll eat whatever the stuff they have.

3:20:58.160 --> 3:21:03.480
 I also think it's fascinating how our bodies intuitively know what, if you're like quiet

3:21:03.480 --> 3:21:08.600
 enough and you think about like what you're craving. Yeah. And as long as it's not like,

3:21:08.600 --> 3:21:12.720
 if you're craving like some processed junkie food, that's probably something that's not

3:21:12.720 --> 3:21:19.480
 quite functional. But if you're craving, like sometimes I'll be like, I must have avocado

3:21:19.480 --> 3:21:23.400
 or like I'll want to eat an entire parsley salad. And then it's happened, I went through

3:21:23.400 --> 3:21:29.480
 a phase where, and here I'm like, do I say this out loud? I went through a phase of.

3:21:29.480 --> 3:21:35.680
 Are you going to say it? Where I was crying out, now I have to say it. Where I couldn't

3:21:35.680 --> 3:21:41.560
 get enough, I don't know where it started, like whose house I was at or whatever, but

3:21:41.560 --> 3:21:47.360
 grass fed butter, I just, I was like, I could tell that my body wanted whatever was there.

3:21:47.360 --> 3:21:51.640
 And so I suppose I could have investigated it and thought like, well, what's in there?

3:21:51.640 --> 3:21:55.800
 Is it like vitamin K, vitamin D? What is it in the grass fed butter? Cause it wasn't regular,

3:21:55.800 --> 3:21:59.800
 like regular butter. Ew, no, but like this grass fed butter, like I felt like I just

3:21:59.800 --> 3:22:03.840
 wanted, I needed it. So there's probably something in there and maybe I could have gone and just

3:22:03.840 --> 3:22:09.120
 taken a lot of vitamin K and then not eaten the butter. But there is something in there.

3:22:09.120 --> 3:22:14.160
 That's fascinating. I had that last night actually with, I went to a grocery store and

3:22:14.160 --> 3:22:20.440
 I had, I had a craving for tomatoes. I was like, what the hell is this? Like what? I

3:22:20.440 --> 3:22:21.440
 don't.

3:22:21.440 --> 3:22:22.440
 Right.

3:22:22.440 --> 3:22:23.440
 It was weird.

3:22:23.440 --> 3:22:24.920
 You should listen to that and then just get a bunch of tomatoes cause there's probably

3:22:24.920 --> 3:22:26.400
 something in there.

3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:28.640
 It was like, it felt right.

3:22:28.640 --> 3:22:33.200
 When I was little, my mother, no, but that's exactly what I was saying. Is that somehow

3:22:33.200 --> 3:22:35.880
 your body knows without you knowing?

3:22:35.880 --> 3:22:38.600
 And today I have zero interest in tomatoes.

3:22:38.600 --> 3:22:39.600
 Yeah.

3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:40.600
 Did you eat the tomatoes then?

3:22:40.600 --> 3:22:41.600
 Yeah.

3:22:41.600 --> 3:22:42.600
 Okay. Well then you probably

3:22:42.600 --> 3:22:48.920
 I ate way too many, but that's all right. Or maybe not enough. There you go. So yeah,

3:22:48.920 --> 3:22:49.920
 what you were saying?

3:22:49.920 --> 3:22:54.240
 Anyway, I think these things like shift and change and there's not like a right answer.

3:22:54.240 --> 3:22:57.600
 And then there's something where it's like one person might do well on something, another

3:22:57.600 --> 3:23:03.760
 person doesn't, or you might do well on something for like, I might, you know, maybe if I ate

3:23:03.760 --> 3:23:09.120
 a bunch of liver, I'd feel better because I'm getting vitamins that I don't, that I'm

3:23:09.120 --> 3:23:14.440
 lacking. But then once I get them, I'm fine and I don't need that anymore. And I could

3:23:14.440 --> 3:23:21.680
 potentially get those from other sources or, but yeah, when I was little, I used to crave.

3:23:21.680 --> 3:23:27.280
 My mother said I craved, not craved, but she said I would always eat sardines, but I wouldn't

3:23:27.280 --> 3:23:32.200
 eat the pieces. I would only eat the whole ones, which have the bones in them. And I

3:23:32.200 --> 3:23:37.680
 used to chew on chicken bones and try to eat eggshells when I was like a top like little.

3:23:37.680 --> 3:23:43.840
 So I think all of those things have calcium and other minerals and commons. There's probably

3:23:43.840 --> 3:23:47.120
 something there that I needed because you'd think as a little kid, I wouldn't be drawn

3:23:47.120 --> 3:23:51.280
 to oily fish and bones and eggshells.

3:23:51.280 --> 3:23:55.560
 Yeah. It's interesting because like you're saying the explanation for the craving is

3:23:55.560 --> 3:23:59.800
 probably the nutrients you're getting. But when you're imagining the craving, you're

3:23:59.800 --> 3:24:05.000
 not obviously imagining the nutrients, you're imagining the texture, the taste, the feel,

3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:09.400
 the, I mean, a lot of the things that we actually experienced as we're eating, that's our brain

3:24:09.400 --> 3:24:11.000
 probably tricking us.

3:24:11.000 --> 3:24:13.800
 Right. But do you love tomatoes?

3:24:13.800 --> 3:24:20.680
 Well, I think we determined that love is possible to define. So the moment...

3:24:20.680 --> 3:24:25.280
 Are you extremely fond of, do you think tomatoes are like one of the most delicious foods?

3:24:25.280 --> 3:24:26.280
 No, no.

3:24:26.280 --> 3:24:27.280
 But maybe...

3:24:27.280 --> 3:24:28.280
 But yet you crave them.

3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:33.600
 Generational because it's a big Russian thing with potatoes and tomatoes and because it's

3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:37.520
 good with vodka, salted.

3:24:37.520 --> 3:24:43.560
 We were talking about the menu and the early days of the restaurant in New York. So what

3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:50.240
 was on the menu? What was, what kind of foods were you playing with? Do you remember, was

3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:55.600
 that one of the challenging things is putting together? Because you're like crafting a new

3:24:55.600 --> 3:24:58.880
 thing in New York where it's extremely competitive.

3:24:58.880 --> 3:25:04.080
 Right. Well, over time it got easier and easier and then also I had, you know, it was, I wasn't

3:25:04.080 --> 3:25:08.360
 coming up with new dishes. It was the people that worked there. So I feel like if I could

3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:15.560
 take credit for something, it would be recognizing talent and, you know, and when dishes were

3:25:15.560 --> 3:25:21.320
 developed, this is when I was on my own. So it was opened with Matthew and Jeffrey and

3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:28.240
 then within a year Matthew was out and Jeffrey was still involved as like the, you know,

3:25:28.240 --> 3:25:34.440
 the corporate sort of side of it. But then over time I separated from that infrastructure

3:25:34.440 --> 3:25:39.960
 as well and then was completely on my own. And in part I did that because I was growing

3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:44.360
 one lucky duck on the side and that was growing and growing and growing and I knew there was

3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:51.320
 something there. And yet the two businesses were completely intertwined. And so potential

3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:56.160
 investors would come at me and they would see this very messy situation where I owned

3:25:56.160 --> 3:26:00.160
 one lucky duck and Jeffrey Chatterow owned the restaurant. And how do we move forward

3:26:00.160 --> 3:26:04.760
 from there? And then people would say, I should shut down the restaurant and just focus on

3:26:04.760 --> 3:26:09.000
 one lucky duck. And I wanted them all to be together under one umbrella and to move forward

3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:11.400
 where everybody's incentives were aligned.

3:26:11.400 --> 3:26:16.160
 What was the magic? Why was it so successful so quickly, would you say?

3:26:16.160 --> 3:26:21.840
 I want to, half jokingly, but not joking, but sort of say that it was about the love

3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:23.840
 and the food and the space.

3:26:23.840 --> 3:26:26.800
 Can you define love?

3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:31.960
 But it's, it's, there was something special. So I, we, when people ask me about opening

3:26:31.960 --> 3:26:34.480
 a restaurant, I say, I don't want to get back into the restaurant business unless it's

3:26:34.480 --> 3:26:39.480
 the same restaurant in the same space. Because there was something about that space that

3:26:39.480 --> 3:26:48.080
 felt, I guess, felt magical for lack of a better word and the energy of a lot of the

3:26:48.080 --> 3:26:56.000
 people there. And I think that people really cared about it. And so for whatever reason,

3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:58.440
 it just, there was an energy about the place.

3:26:58.440 --> 3:26:59.440
 Would you ever do it again?

3:26:59.440 --> 3:27:00.440
 Yes.

3:27:00.440 --> 3:27:01.440
 Do you ever consider it real?

3:27:01.440 --> 3:27:02.440
 In the same space.

3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:10.760
 That's a tough thing in New York, but you're thinking in, okay, well,

3:27:10.760 --> 3:27:11.760
 It's there.

3:27:11.760 --> 3:27:12.760
 It's there.

3:27:12.760 --> 3:27:18.480
 Let me ask you this question. I've been searching for that myself, like asking myself this question.

3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:24.480
 If I, you know, the last meal question, like what's the best meal you've ever eaten in

3:27:24.480 --> 3:27:30.080
 your life? Like if you had, if I had to murder you at the end of this and you get one meal,

3:27:30.080 --> 3:27:35.520
 but you can travel anywhere in the world, what would you, what would you eat?

3:27:35.520 --> 3:27:40.600
 It's one of those questions where I feel like I should have an answer prepared.

3:27:40.600 --> 3:27:47.520
 No, it's too, it's too difficult to sort of pick favorites. But if somebody would, you

3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:49.480
 know, force you to choose, you have to.

3:27:49.480 --> 3:27:55.080
 I had, I was eating something once and I had the thought that if I was going to die, this

3:27:55.080 --> 3:27:58.360
 was, I would come here and order plate after plate of this and eat this.

3:27:58.360 --> 3:27:59.360
 Do you remember what it was?

3:27:59.360 --> 3:28:00.360
 Yes.

3:28:00.360 --> 3:28:01.720
 Some diner in the middle of nowhere?

3:28:01.720 --> 3:28:08.000
 No, it was, pure food and wine was on Irving Place. And then, and then the, the kitchen

3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:12.400
 connected to the one like a duck juice bar, which had an entrance on 17th Street. So it's

3:28:12.400 --> 3:28:16.960
 kind of like this L shape. And then there was a huge garden in the back on the corner

3:28:16.960 --> 3:28:24.680
 was Casamono and Barhamon, which was Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich were behind that.

3:28:24.680 --> 3:28:30.120
 And it was very focused on meat, but also like organ meats and strange, unusual.

3:28:30.120 --> 3:28:32.600
 Spanish restaurant. Wow, lots of good reviews.

3:28:32.600 --> 3:28:40.000
 Yeah, it was really good. This is just a funny that we surrounded it, but Barhamon was, was

3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:47.640
 this tiny little bar. And I went in there once with Tobin late and I don't know why

3:28:47.640 --> 3:28:53.280
 we ended up going there, but it was right before they closed and drank red wine and

3:28:53.280 --> 3:28:59.960
 they had tomato bread. And it's just like a baguette, although it's a Spanish, whatever,

3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:04.160
 it's like a bread like a baguette, like a thin that they toast. And I think they rub

3:29:04.160 --> 3:29:10.240
 it with garlic and they don't even put tomato slices on it. It's like they rub it and the

3:29:10.240 --> 3:29:16.320
 tomato juice is all over it. It was just bread and tomato juice and probably some garlic

3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:18.720
 flavor and really good salt.

3:29:18.720 --> 3:29:19.960
 It was some wine.

3:29:19.960 --> 3:29:25.160
 Then red wine and we sat there and ordered a plate, ate it, ordered another one, ate

3:29:25.160 --> 3:29:29.800
 it, ordered another one. I think we had like six plates. And I remember sitting there thinking,

3:29:29.800 --> 3:29:34.400
 I could just eat this until my stomach bursts. And then, and so if this is like, if somebody

3:29:34.400 --> 3:29:39.680
 was like, what's the last, I would just want to sit there and eat plate after plate after

3:29:39.680 --> 3:29:40.680
 plate.

3:29:40.680 --> 3:29:43.040
 I think if you went back there and ate the same thing, it wouldn't taste nearly as good.

3:29:43.040 --> 3:29:49.880
 And like, was there something magical about that night about the way that bread was made

3:29:49.880 --> 3:29:58.680
 on that night, the way you felt at that night, the wine, the something? Or do you think like,

3:29:58.680 --> 3:30:04.880
 where's the power from that food come from? Is it the food itself or is it the environment?

3:30:04.880 --> 3:30:09.840
 I'm sure it's both. But like, if somebody brought a plate of it here right now, it would

3:30:09.840 --> 3:30:17.360
 be completely delicious, but it might not feel as kind of not that it felt magical,

3:30:17.360 --> 3:30:23.560
 but it was the whole warmth of the experience and, and the red wine and the afternoon in

3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:25.640
 Texas right now. So it's different.

3:30:25.640 --> 3:30:31.160
 And if I keep forgetting and thinking it's late at night, yeah, we're surrounded by this

3:30:31.160 --> 3:30:34.760
 is this whole place is anti Huberman. There's no light.

3:30:34.760 --> 3:30:40.560
 Well, it's, it's pro Huberman. If it's in the afternoon or the evening, except for these

3:30:40.560 --> 3:30:46.200
 bright lights, if they were lower down, if they were like down below, then they're hitting

3:30:46.200 --> 3:30:51.360
 the tops of our eyes, but it's the light coming from above that's destructive at night because

3:30:51.360 --> 3:30:55.560
 it's hitting the bottom of your eyes. So it's like mimicking the sun, which is signaling

3:30:55.560 --> 3:31:00.600
 your body that it's time to be awake. So as much as possible. So I do this in the evenings.

3:31:00.600 --> 3:31:05.120
 I shut off all the overhead lights. I try to dim the lights as much as I can. And, and

3:31:05.120 --> 3:31:08.600
 I turn on like a lamp versus an overhead light.

3:31:08.600 --> 3:31:13.640
 Are you also doing the caffeine thing like not, not consuming much caffeine way before

3:31:13.640 --> 3:31:14.640
 bed?

3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:22.720
 Oh, I can't. Yeah. I usually don't have caffeine late. I try not to have it. So ideally,

3:31:22.720 --> 3:31:23.720
 I drink into the night.

3:31:23.720 --> 3:31:28.720
 2pm would be my last, I wouldn't, ideally I wouldn't drink coffee after two, but plenty

3:31:28.720 --> 3:31:33.760
 of times I do, especially if I haven't had midday coffee, then I worry I'm going to get

3:31:33.760 --> 3:31:34.760
 a headache.

3:31:34.760 --> 3:31:41.680
 That makes you way more responsible than me. Let me return to love. What do you think makes

3:31:41.680 --> 3:31:53.480
 for a good romantic relationship? Given your experience, I mean this question.

3:31:53.480 --> 3:31:57.360
 I think a mutual respect is a big part of it.

3:31:57.360 --> 3:32:00.120
 Mutual respect. That's interesting.

3:32:00.120 --> 3:32:06.160
 Well, and understanding it in a way that you want what's best for the other person, not

3:32:06.160 --> 3:32:12.440
 in a way that you would sacrifice yourself for them necessarily, but in a very healthy

3:32:12.440 --> 3:32:17.000
 way. So I think a healthy relationship is where, you know, you want what's best for

3:32:17.000 --> 3:32:18.000
 the other person.

3:32:18.000 --> 3:32:27.360
 So I always find it tragic. Like say you started dating somebody who then would get jealous

3:32:27.360 --> 3:32:32.840
 or upset if you were spent too much time working on something, right? But it, but that's like

3:32:32.840 --> 3:32:37.680
 your life. So if you're working on some robotics thing and you're having some breakthrough

3:32:37.680 --> 3:32:42.240
 and so you just want to spend a lot of time wherever you spend a lot of time doing those

3:32:42.240 --> 3:32:47.440
 things. And then that other person got all bent out of shape and it became like a competition.

3:32:47.440 --> 3:32:55.600
 That to me seems very unhealthy because if somebody, if it was like a genuine healthy

3:32:55.600 --> 3:33:01.800
 love, she would want you to be doing those things.

3:33:01.800 --> 3:33:12.400
 Yeah, that's a good observation. But to me, I think the way to achieve that is actually

3:33:12.400 --> 3:33:16.760
 or the easiest way to achieve that, at least for me, is actually legitimately be excited

3:33:16.760 --> 3:33:23.200
 by the things the other person is excited by. So like not in some generic sense, it's

3:33:23.200 --> 3:33:29.920
 good for them to be doing the robotics thing. Like it's more like you become a fan of all

3:33:29.920 --> 3:33:34.680
 the cool things that they're doing in their life. So like, I definitely have this. Somebody

3:33:34.680 --> 3:33:45.880
 told me recently, there's a term for this, but I love like watching other people succeed,

3:33:45.880 --> 3:33:52.240
 be excited about shit. I like celebrating other people. It's fun for me to watch people

3:33:52.240 --> 3:33:58.880
 do the thing they love doing. So like, in some sense, that's reinvigorating to me and

3:33:58.880 --> 3:34:05.000
 exciting to me. And so one of the things for me in a relationship is like, you get excited

3:34:05.000 --> 3:34:09.280
 by watching another person do the thing they're excited about. It's not like I intellectually

3:34:09.280 --> 3:34:14.000
 know it's good for them to have their own thing. And they, you know, it's like I legit

3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:20.080
 get excited by their own thing. Because otherwise, that's what I mean. It's like that person

3:34:20.080 --> 3:34:25.320
 would be excited because you're excited. But they would, I think the easiest way to achieve

3:34:25.320 --> 3:34:30.760
 that is actually be like, one of my trends, it's like, it's not like saying that you should

3:34:30.760 --> 3:34:35.240
 be excited. It's like you can't help yourself but be excited.

3:34:35.240 --> 3:34:43.000
 Right. But I think that's possible. But it's possible for that to be the case for somebody

3:34:43.000 --> 3:34:50.040
 that like might have an appreciation for what you're doing, but isn't like that's not what

3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:52.600
 that person's going to go spend their time on.

3:34:52.600 --> 3:34:57.840
 Yeah, they will buy themselves. Right. So the other person might, you know, be really

3:34:57.840 --> 3:35:01.400
 good at a musical instrument that requires a lot of practice. And you're not interested

3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:05.640
 in playing that musical instrument, but you appreciate the beauty of the music and understand

3:35:05.640 --> 3:35:09.360
 that that person is getting something out of it. So you would be excited when they get

3:35:09.360 --> 3:35:13.840
 a chance to practice or whatnot. So it's that kind of a...

3:35:13.840 --> 3:35:19.280
 Do you think loves should be simple or complicated in a relationship?

3:35:19.280 --> 3:35:24.520
 Well, it might be inherently complicated. I think I may have asked Hubertman the exact

3:35:24.520 --> 3:35:29.760
 same question. Forget what he said. I thought it was interesting when you asked

3:35:29.760 --> 3:35:36.600
 Elon about love. Oh boy, yeah. That's going to be conversation

3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:43.320
 number like seven that he actually answers it. Well, what was interesting that I found

3:35:43.320 --> 3:35:49.800
 admirable was this sort of like a duty to humanity. I think you asked about it not in

3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:57.080
 a about person, but about the work. And so it was like, it was like a to do, to put all

3:35:57.080 --> 3:36:03.480
 this energy to try to kind of like move things forward, knowing that he will probably die

3:36:03.480 --> 3:36:07.920
 before it gets there. You're talking about like a something related to the science of

3:36:07.920 --> 3:36:14.400
 rocketry. Yeah. He's kind of a rocket scientist.

3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:18.800
 But whatever you were asking him about whether something could be accomplished and he said,

3:36:18.800 --> 3:36:22.120
 yes, but not in his lifetime, but he's going to keep pushing it forward anyway. So I felt

3:36:22.120 --> 3:36:29.440
 like that was a really, you know, to put so much of yourself into something just to kind

3:36:29.440 --> 3:36:36.440
 of move the baton forward for humanity was a struck me as an admirable thing. You know,

3:36:36.440 --> 3:36:41.800
 there's no great reward in terms of you're going to, you know, you're going to see that

3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:48.120
 invention happen or you're going to see Mars colonized or whatever it is. But you'll, you're

3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:52.480
 willing to put in all the work and brainpower to try to push it along.

3:36:52.480 --> 3:36:57.560
 Like thinking about the biggest possible impact on the world, just thinking about humanity.

3:36:57.560 --> 3:37:03.440
 I think all of us when we do cool things are contributing to humanity. And it's good to

3:37:03.440 --> 3:37:07.840
 think of it that way. When you run a restaurant and you make all the people happy. I don't

3:37:07.840 --> 3:37:14.320
 know. That's part of that. It's good to think big like that. And Elon does definitely, but

3:37:14.320 --> 3:37:21.240
 when I asked him about love, I'm, you know, just knowing him personally, you know, I'm

3:37:21.240 --> 3:37:27.240
 asking about the personal question about love, but I'm giving him the freedom to escape it,

3:37:27.240 --> 3:37:30.440
 which he always does. That's very generous.

3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:37.160
 Because I don't want to trap him. I understand it's difficult. So, you know, he's better

3:37:37.160 --> 3:37:41.200
 at solving engineering problems than talking about love. The other thing he's really good

3:37:41.200 --> 3:37:53.320
 at is going to the joke. So for him, you know, for him, love and all those kinds of things,

3:37:53.320 --> 3:38:00.520
 especially those kind of cliche sounding things are, are the stuff of memes. It's the stuff,

3:38:00.520 --> 3:38:04.680
 the easiest way you can talk about it is humor. The same with trauma, like personal trauma,

3:38:04.680 --> 3:38:10.280
 the easiest stuff for him to talk about is the, is take a, is laugh about it. He's been

3:38:10.280 --> 3:38:18.440
 very tough privately or on podcasts to talk about personal like difficult stuff. And for

3:38:18.440 --> 3:38:24.600
 me, obviously, that's often the most interesting stuff as humans. Like, where's your darkness?

3:38:24.600 --> 3:38:30.080
 You know, but for him, it's tough. For a lot of people, it's tough, but it's important

3:38:30.080 --> 3:38:34.640
 to go there. Maybe, maybe first in the privacy of your mind.

3:38:34.640 --> 3:38:42.000
 And I think, you know, bringing it back to the relationship thing is wanting to like

3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:47.320
 understand and accept those things about somebody else. I mean, it's sort of cliche to say that

3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:55.920
 you can't change somebody. And you don't want to also like try to change yourself for somebody,

3:38:55.920 --> 3:39:02.120
 but you can sort of figure things out and be willing to make adjustments and navigate

3:39:02.120 --> 3:39:09.840
 for the sake of something working. And sometimes that comes from understanding, which might

3:39:09.840 --> 3:39:15.880
 require a lot of effort and open mindedness if somebody's kind of very different from

3:39:15.880 --> 3:39:20.960
 you. Yeah. And being, being fragile yourself, revealing

3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:26.760
 your flaws and getting to learn about theirs and getting to see the beauty in them because

3:39:26.760 --> 3:39:33.720
 that's the good stuff. Or if, if, if the flaws are too much of a red flag, then you walk away.

3:39:33.720 --> 3:39:38.400
 That's the hard stuff. Either the red flags might be the thing that you actually get to

3:39:38.400 --> 3:39:44.320
 love deeply because they're flawed human, or it might be the reason to walk away quickly.

3:39:44.320 --> 3:39:51.440
 And you don't know. Although if it's a red flag, then it by definition is something that's

3:39:51.440 --> 3:39:57.320
 telling you to walk away. If it was just like something about their character that's challenging,

3:39:57.320 --> 3:40:04.960
 you could appreciate that or understand it. But it's not something that like they're intentionally

3:40:04.960 --> 3:40:12.160
 trying to use to deceive you. I think red flags, it's like, I guess it's more about like manipulation

3:40:12.160 --> 3:40:17.440
 and or like somebody's kind of extreme dysfunction or something would be red flags. But I think

3:40:17.440 --> 3:40:26.040
 there could be things that are quirky or weird or even dark about somebody that are acceptable.

3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:33.080
 Yeah, but they might look like red flags. If there's a, if there's someone crying on

3:40:33.080 --> 3:40:37.280
 the subway, that's a red flag for me. That she might be like an emotional basket game.

3:40:37.280 --> 3:40:39.520
 Yeah, this is it. My maintenance crazy person.

3:40:39.520 --> 3:40:40.520
 Yeah. Yeah.

3:40:40.520 --> 3:40:42.240
 That's true.

3:40:42.240 --> 3:40:46.440
 But you know, it could also be, there could be a deeper story to it. So that's what I'm

3:40:46.440 --> 3:40:47.440
 trying to tell you.

3:40:47.440 --> 3:40:48.440
 That's true.

3:40:48.440 --> 3:40:55.040
 All right. What advice would you give to young folks today? If they want to launch a restaurant

3:40:55.040 --> 3:40:58.960
 in New York City and then message somebody on Twitter?

3:40:58.960 --> 3:41:04.160
 I was before you finished the sentence, I was about to say, read a lot of books. But then

3:41:04.160 --> 3:41:08.000
 you then, because you said, what advice would you give to young people today? And I was

3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:12.280
 like, read a lot of books. And then you got to the restaurant part.

3:41:12.280 --> 3:41:16.480
 Yeah. No, I mean, that's, I was joking about the restaurants. Yeah, about life, I would

3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:25.400
 say. Not just about career as a restaurant tour, but just in life, how to be successful,

3:41:25.400 --> 3:41:30.040
 how to be, how to live a life that can be fulfilling and how to live a life that can

3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:33.480
 be proud of. To read a lot of books.

3:41:33.480 --> 3:41:34.480
 It's complicated because.

3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:36.480
 Have you figured it out yet?

3:41:36.480 --> 3:41:43.480
 But I think self awareness is key. But I also think there's some of those things where like

3:41:43.480 --> 3:41:50.920
 people kind of have to learn their own lessons. But I think in part because I never had kids

3:41:50.920 --> 3:41:56.120
 and I never wanted kids. I feel like through my book, I keep thinking that I want a lot

3:41:56.120 --> 3:42:03.680
 of the lessons that I learned to be useful to other people, particularly younger people.

3:42:03.680 --> 3:42:11.840
 And in many cases, younger females to maybe understand themselves a little better along

3:42:11.840 --> 3:42:15.760
 the way. Because I think that, you know, a lot of mistakes that I made and things that

3:42:15.760 --> 3:42:23.480
 happened or things that I did that I'm embarrassed about or things that I stepped into that I

3:42:23.480 --> 3:42:30.960
 wouldn't have otherwise stepped into or allowed to happen were a result of in many cases,

3:42:30.960 --> 3:42:42.440
 like insecurity, like a lack of confidence. And I think in the context of moving forward

3:42:42.440 --> 3:42:47.680
 with relationships, being really careful to understand why you're there or if you're

3:42:47.680 --> 3:42:53.040
 repeating a pattern, that's something that is sort of cliche. But I feel like it's very,

3:42:53.040 --> 3:43:00.400
 I mean, cliche is things that are true. They're just repeated a lot.

3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:06.720
 But anyway, the idea that people repeat patterns, right? So I think that's very true.

3:43:06.720 --> 3:43:08.040
 Right.

3:43:08.040 --> 3:43:12.560
 And so to be aware of that and to figure it out sooner rather than later, so you don't

3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:17.200
 keep stepping into the same thing over and over again.

3:43:17.200 --> 3:43:21.720
 You mentioned sort of giving yourself time and space to think.

3:43:21.720 --> 3:43:27.240
 Yeah, which sometimes isn't possible. But don't let momentum of life sort of carry

3:43:27.240 --> 3:43:28.240
 you away.

3:43:28.240 --> 3:43:33.640
 Right. And I think for me, one of the things that would have scared me about having kids

3:43:33.640 --> 3:43:41.960
 is the chaos of it or not being able to handle it. But I think that's just me, not most people.

3:43:41.960 --> 3:43:43.960
 You ran a restaurant.

3:43:43.960 --> 3:43:49.280
 I know. But just probably why I would go home at night and lie on the floor and cry.

3:43:49.280 --> 3:43:50.280
 Or...

3:43:50.280 --> 3:43:55.880
 Cough and do you do that? Do you like a good cry?

3:43:55.880 --> 3:44:02.200
 I do. Music usually? Or can you paint a scene?

3:44:02.200 --> 3:44:03.200
 In just in general?

3:44:03.200 --> 3:44:04.400
 Yeah. Is there candles?

3:44:04.400 --> 3:44:06.800
 I cried this morning. Okay.

3:44:06.800 --> 3:44:08.080
 Not intentionally and not for long.

3:44:08.080 --> 3:44:10.360
 Happiness or just overwhelmed?

3:44:10.360 --> 3:44:19.640
 It was like a... I looked a little bit at Instagram and saw... What was it?

3:44:19.640 --> 3:44:24.640
 Very often they're like these little animal rescue stories or whatever. But this guy Matt,

3:44:24.640 --> 3:44:30.760
 who used to be my trainer years ago, and put this little montage video to music. That was

3:44:30.760 --> 3:44:34.440
 interesting. If there hadn't been music, I probably wouldn't have cried. But it was showing

3:44:34.440 --> 3:44:41.760
 his wife having their second child. Not showing it, but like the sort of before and then the

3:44:41.760 --> 3:44:45.760
 baby in her arms right afterwards and then bringing the baby home. It was this very short

3:44:45.760 --> 3:44:52.680
 little clip, but set to music. And I watched that and started to cry. But it's not... I

3:44:52.680 --> 3:45:03.520
 didn't sob or anything. So, I think I cry easily. Interestingly, though, in actual

3:45:03.520 --> 3:45:08.800
 horrifically tragic things, or when they apply to me, I might not cry and then people find

3:45:08.800 --> 3:45:12.920
 that unusual. And that was in the film that... I don't know if it was my sister or my father

3:45:12.920 --> 3:45:18.080
 described that when my parents got divorced, I didn't cry. And I just... Whereas my sister

3:45:18.080 --> 3:45:23.160
 bawled her eyes out and I didn't cry at all ever. And I just didn't say anything. I want

3:45:23.160 --> 3:45:33.880
 to talk about it. And when I was sentenced to jail, I didn't cry. So, a lot of times

3:45:33.880 --> 3:45:42.400
 when something really big happens, I get a little bit weirdly... I don't know. But I

3:45:42.400 --> 3:45:50.040
 cry very often. Too much to feel it all directly. So, you kind of cry it out later slowly.

3:45:50.040 --> 3:45:55.080
 Right. Maybe years later. Maybe years later. Yeah. And maybe that's what I'm really crying

3:45:55.080 --> 3:45:59.320
 about when I cry at these little videos or something. I don't know. But I'm glad for

3:45:59.320 --> 3:46:03.120
 it because I feel like... It always feels like kind of a relief.

3:46:03.120 --> 3:46:12.360
 Well, let me ask this because it's interesting what you would say. Do you have regrets about

3:46:12.360 --> 3:46:19.840
 things in your life? Like, what do you regret? If there's a one day you could live again,

3:46:19.840 --> 3:46:25.800
 which day would you pick? Like, relive and make different choices.

3:46:25.800 --> 3:46:33.800
 Well, like one obvious thing could be the day that I let Anthony Strange in the door. If

3:46:33.800 --> 3:46:40.040
 I had instead, you know... If at any time early on, I'd instead just pushed him out. You know,

3:46:40.040 --> 3:46:44.520
 that my life would be wildly different. It's hard to...

3:46:44.520 --> 3:46:52.600
 So, that's the biggest mistake of your life. You would say just letting Anthony to your

3:46:52.600 --> 3:46:56.920
 life? I think, yes. I think one could argue that's the biggest mistake. But then at the

3:46:56.920 --> 3:47:05.160
 same time, you never know because like when I was in a sort of a dark relationship that

3:47:05.160 --> 3:47:12.160
 then led to the restaurant. Am I having the one Lucky Duck brand? So, I felt like that

3:47:12.160 --> 3:47:17.440
 darkness... It's like if you married a horribly abusive person but you had a beautiful child

3:47:17.440 --> 3:47:20.400
 and then you go on and you have this beautiful child and you think, well, if I hadn't been

3:47:20.400 --> 3:47:23.920
 with that horribly abusive person, I wouldn't have this beautiful child. So, I wouldn't go

3:47:23.920 --> 3:47:29.200
 undo it. So, I feel like a lot of things are like that. And I guess I could optimistically

3:47:29.200 --> 3:47:36.400
 hope that there are good things down the road where I'll think, well, I'm here and I'm

3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:40.120
 grateful for it. And therefore, I'm grateful for the things that got me here, which include

3:47:40.120 --> 3:47:45.040
 a lot of dark things. It's hard to say because a lot of people were hurt in my case. But

3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:51.960
 I am optimistic that I can make those things up. And there are also hurts that were...

3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:57.160
 I mean, in some cases emotionally, but also very much financial. And I feel like those

3:47:57.160 --> 3:48:05.240
 are numbers and the employees were all paid back. So, anybody else that is out money because

3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:13.560
 of everything that happened isn't somebody that's not able to feed themselves. Everybody...

3:48:13.560 --> 3:48:17.240
 Most of those people have plenty of money and it's not a big deal, but I still want

3:48:17.240 --> 3:48:26.600
 to repay all of it. And it's numbers. It's not... Like nobody died. And sometimes when

3:48:26.600 --> 3:48:33.680
 I think about my own challenges, they feel sort of inconsequential in comparison to other

3:48:33.680 --> 3:48:43.240
 things going on in the world. So, yes, it's hard being humiliated or it's hard to have

3:48:43.240 --> 3:48:49.080
 people say nasty things about you on Twitter, Instagram, but really, who cares? Because

3:48:49.080 --> 3:48:56.120
 that's just words and things. And I'm not fleeing my home and watching people get shot.

3:48:56.120 --> 3:49:02.960
 And they're still out of this darkness, out of this you can still... You still have a

3:49:02.960 --> 3:49:08.480
 lot of time to create something beautiful in the world. Maybe something even more beautiful

3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:14.880
 than you've ever done before. I am optimistic. And I also feel like... Part of the reason

3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:21.600
 I like having these conversations is because I feel like people will learn stuff from my

3:49:21.600 --> 3:49:26.920
 shitty experiences to avoid going through their own shitty experience. And I've heard a ton

3:49:26.920 --> 3:49:33.760
 of that from a lot of women and some men writing to me saying that they went through something

3:49:33.760 --> 3:49:41.960
 similar and nobody understood. And my story helped them or might help them get somebody

3:49:41.960 --> 3:49:46.240
 else out of a situation. So making it useful feels good.

3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:55.240
 So through all of this, Leon was with you. He recently had a birthday, March, I guess?

3:49:55.240 --> 3:50:05.720
 Yes, 12. I made him a phenomenal meat cake or a layered cake that involved a variety

3:50:05.720 --> 3:50:06.720
 of animal foods.

3:50:06.720 --> 3:50:07.720
 He's not a vegetarian?

3:50:07.720 --> 3:50:14.040
 No, he's not. But I also give him really high quality stuff. But yeah, he's not a vegan

3:50:14.040 --> 3:50:15.040
 or vegetarian.

3:50:15.040 --> 3:50:19.680
 Let me ask you a hard question. Do you think about the tragic fact that dogs live much

3:50:19.680 --> 3:50:27.320
 shorter lives than us humans? Do you think about his mortality?

3:50:27.320 --> 3:50:30.440
 All the time. I kind of try not to, but all the time.

3:50:30.440 --> 3:50:37.160
 Because you told me in traveling here to Austin, Texas, you're not in the habit of

3:50:37.160 --> 3:50:40.440
 leaving Leon by himself.

3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:49.080
 Well, he's not by himself, but I know I haven't been away from him in certainly since before

3:50:49.080 --> 3:50:50.080
 COVID.

3:50:50.080 --> 3:51:02.000
 So I'm not used to it. And so I, people always say that dogs have, like that dogs have attachment

3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:07.720
 issues or get separation anxiety. But in my case, at least it's like, I think he's fine.

3:51:07.720 --> 3:51:14.280
 I'm the one that is, you know, he's like fine. I'm the one that gets anxious about it, being

3:51:14.280 --> 3:51:15.960
 away from him.

3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:19.600
 You're the one who acts like a dog when you come back and you're super excited to see

3:51:19.600 --> 3:51:20.600
 him.

3:51:20.600 --> 3:51:21.600
 Yeah.

3:51:21.600 --> 3:51:25.720
 Be on the floor and wiggle your tail and drool and all that kind of stuff. But do you think

3:51:25.720 --> 3:51:30.640
 about the fact, you know, that you might lose Leon soon?

3:51:30.640 --> 3:51:33.880
 I do. I think about it all. I mean, I try not to think about it, but I do.

3:51:33.880 --> 3:51:34.880
 Are you scared of it?

3:51:34.880 --> 3:51:40.560
 Yeah, it's scary, but then I also just try to understand that it's inevitable. And I

3:51:40.560 --> 3:51:51.320
 mean, yeah, assuming I'm still around, then that's, I think one of the things about having

3:51:51.320 --> 3:51:57.000
 adopting a dog or caring for an animal, unless it's one of those animals that lives a really

3:51:57.000 --> 3:52:02.560
 long time. I just found out that parrots live an extraordinarily long time.

3:52:02.560 --> 3:52:03.560
 Yeah.

3:52:03.560 --> 3:52:09.360
 But they're annoying. So you get, it's a trade off. The ones we love live a short time.

3:52:09.360 --> 3:52:12.560
 The ones that avoid them live a long time.

3:52:12.560 --> 3:52:17.520
 So I just think it's one of those things that you just know what's going to happen and it's

3:52:17.520 --> 3:52:24.360
 just part of life. And I think it's one of those pains that's, it's painful, but you

3:52:24.360 --> 3:52:29.800
 just kind of have to go through it. And what's the alternative? You're not going to, it's

3:52:29.800 --> 3:52:33.240
 like saying you would never want to fall in love because of the heartbreak that's going

3:52:33.240 --> 3:52:38.280
 to inevitably come. So some people do that. They just avoid ever.

3:52:38.280 --> 3:52:40.600
 You're saying screw it. I'm diving right in.

3:52:40.600 --> 3:52:41.600
 Yes.

3:52:41.600 --> 3:52:45.960
 It was all worth it. What about your own mortality? You think about yourself dying?

3:52:45.960 --> 3:52:53.160
 Less so than I was before. I think I wrote about that and I put this letter, Dear Mr.

3:52:53.160 --> 3:52:58.800
 Fox, online, which I never intended to do, but I did because of all the misconceptions

3:52:58.800 --> 3:53:03.680
 about the film and our, and our relationship. And so I put this thing up online that I'd

3:53:03.680 --> 3:53:09.200
 written on my phone on multiple subway rides. And at the end of it, I talk about, because

3:53:09.200 --> 3:53:14.680
 especially then when like it was the height of everything was gone and, you know, what

3:53:14.680 --> 3:53:20.480
 do I have to live for? I sort of noticed and wrote about how differently I felt about things.

3:53:20.480 --> 3:53:25.280
 Whereas I used to be afraid. I used to have like a healthy fear of, you know, being pushed

3:53:25.280 --> 3:53:30.960
 in front of a train because that happens, you know, in New York or anywhere. Or, you

3:53:30.960 --> 3:53:36.360
 know, I had a healthy fear of like, I don't know, walking down a dark street at night.

3:53:36.360 --> 3:53:42.360
 But I noticed that at the time I didn't really have those fears because I was like, yeah,

3:53:42.360 --> 3:53:46.480
 what do I, like, what do I have to lose? Like who cares? You know, I don't have anything

3:53:46.480 --> 3:53:53.800
 anymore. What do I have to lose? So I certainly feel much less that way. But something about

3:53:53.800 --> 3:54:02.920
 those feelings lingered where I'm less afraid of it or more, just less afraid of it, but

3:54:02.920 --> 3:54:07.280
 hoping it's not some sort of a gruesome way. I mean, some people are really afraid of

3:54:07.280 --> 3:54:11.760
 flying and I feel like, well, statistically, it's extremely safe. And if it's going to

3:54:11.760 --> 3:54:16.360
 happen, it's going to happen. There's nothing you can do. Like there's really nothing you

3:54:16.360 --> 3:54:21.240
 can do unless you're going to like do with that guy and that small plane did the other

3:54:21.240 --> 3:54:25.160
 day and like leap over and was able to take control of the plane. But I mean like a commercial

3:54:25.160 --> 3:54:28.720
 flight. So it's like, if you're going to die, you're going to die and it's just your time

3:54:28.720 --> 3:54:35.000
 and all you can do is hope that I would, I would probably prefer to have as little awareness

3:54:35.000 --> 3:54:40.560
 about it as possible. You know, it's like if you'd rather have somebody, if you're going

3:54:40.560 --> 3:54:43.840
 to get shot, you'd rather have somebody shoot you in the back of the head and you didn't

3:54:43.840 --> 3:54:49.280
 see it coming and just boom lights out versus somebody holding a gun to your head. And then

3:54:49.280 --> 3:54:55.760
 you're going to feel all this fear and have to like feel all of that, which also made

3:54:55.760 --> 3:55:02.840
 me think of, you know, animals and animals suffering in the way that some people argue

3:55:02.840 --> 3:55:11.000
 that because of the conditions and the fear that that's like, that's like in their bodies

3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:18.000
 when they're killed, which is an interesting thing to think about. Yeah, I clearly struck

3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:31.400
 that with the ethics of, I just, I think about it a lot about, you know, like our current

3:55:31.400 --> 3:55:39.760
 food system, which involves a system that everybody has sort of accepted and normalized

3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:50.720
 where like say aliens did come down and looked at us and realized that we're a particularly

3:55:50.720 --> 3:55:58.400
 good source of whatever fuel they need. So then they imprisoned us all in cages that

3:55:58.400 --> 3:56:06.480
 were like the equivalent of like sardines jammed in an elevator. And then we were bred

3:56:06.480 --> 3:56:12.120
 and we would get sick and we'd go crazy and we'd do the equivalent of like pecking and

3:56:12.120 --> 3:56:18.640
 then we'd get abused and then like grotesquely and brutally killed. And that was like our

3:56:18.640 --> 3:56:26.160
 entire lives. And so if like aliens came down and started and did all of that, we would

3:56:26.160 --> 3:56:34.440
 have to be okay with that, which is something that my was said to me after watching this

3:56:34.440 --> 3:56:39.840
 movie called Our Daily Bread many years ago. But it's an interesting way to think about

3:56:39.840 --> 3:56:45.560
 it because I mean, we would have to be okay with it because that's kind of what we're

3:56:45.560 --> 3:56:52.280
 doing now, right? Yeah, we've normalized certain kinds of cruelty. And I don't people think,

3:56:52.280 --> 3:57:00.280
 yeah, people think that like I would object to hunting hunting for sport, I think is grotesque.

3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:06.240
 But if you're hunting, and then you're going to eat the entire animal, and you're hunting

3:57:06.240 --> 3:57:11.920
 in a way where it's kind of like, you know, that that animal like lived a free and happy

3:57:11.920 --> 3:57:17.160
 life until that moment in the same way that the animal lived a free and happy moment, lived

3:57:17.160 --> 3:57:22.560
 a free and happy life, or we don't know, maybe they were depressed, but they lived a free

3:57:22.560 --> 3:57:31.240
 life until like the lion came and took it down. So is a human shooting an animal for

3:57:31.240 --> 3:57:37.440
 food somehow more tragic or horrible than a lion attacking an elk?

3:57:37.440 --> 3:57:43.440
 Yeah, there's a lot of complexities to it on top of all of that. So one, you said sort

3:57:43.440 --> 3:57:48.760
 of hunting for sport is bad, but there's this like complex ethical equation of the fact

3:57:48.760 --> 3:57:54.200
 that hunting for sport is the thing that often funds the preservation of a species.

3:57:54.200 --> 3:57:59.080
 That's well, no, that's another complicated layer. There's like the Maui venison, all

3:57:59.080 --> 3:58:09.600
 the deer in Hawaii. And I might have gotten Maui venison treats for Leon. But they're

3:58:09.600 --> 3:58:17.080
 hunting those deer is a way of preserving the Yeah. So I mean, these things are complicated,

3:58:17.080 --> 3:58:22.800
 but that's why I don't have a problem with somebody shooting an elk or bringing it home

3:58:22.800 --> 3:58:28.960
 and eating it like my, you know, like I've eaten elk jerky and things like that from

3:58:28.960 --> 3:58:34.040
 that's one of those situations where like, I wouldn't morally have a problem with it.

3:58:34.040 --> 3:58:38.400
 And for me, it's also I'm not one of those people where I think like, ew, I wouldn't

3:58:38.400 --> 3:58:43.680
 eat meat. It's more like, I don't want to add to the consumption of it. And I wouldn't

3:58:43.680 --> 3:58:50.520
 want to eat sort of like the factory farmed meat necessarily, unless I'm in prison and

3:58:50.520 --> 3:58:51.840
 it's otherwise going to get thrown away. But

3:58:51.840 --> 3:59:01.600
 A hashtag, a lot of a lot of things, you know, you know, you make do things differently there.

3:59:01.600 --> 3:59:07.360
 But yeah. So, you know, it's just these things are complicated. But so it's not about like,

3:59:07.360 --> 3:59:11.680
 you know, I don't want that in my body. It's sort of like, what, where did it come from

3:59:11.680 --> 3:59:21.600
 and what's going on here? And I think that like, if you just followed Joe Rogan's Instagram,

3:59:21.600 --> 3:59:29.760
 there's sort of a bit of a glorification of meat that because I listened to enough that

3:59:29.760 --> 3:59:34.120
 I heard the one where he talked, there was a recent one where he's talking about Anthony

3:59:34.120 --> 3:59:40.120
 Bourdain. And in that conversation, I think it was that one, he explained that he sort

3:59:40.120 --> 3:59:44.960
 of did it in summary. So I feel like he talked about it in the past, but did all this research

3:59:44.960 --> 3:59:49.320
 and came to the conclusion, based on all his research came to the conclusion that he was

3:59:49.320 --> 3:59:57.400
 either going to be vegetarian or shoot his own meat and hunt. And so that, that's totally

3:59:57.400 --> 4:00:02.600
 different. That's something, I mean, that's very like admirable, I think, and he has the

4:00:02.600 --> 4:00:04.800
 means to do it. But, but if you

4:00:04.800 --> 4:00:06.960
 Not only that, he does it with a bow.

4:00:06.960 --> 4:00:08.640
 Right. Even more so.

4:00:08.640 --> 4:00:15.320
 It is a good question. It's, it's a good question how we get out of this factory.

4:00:15.320 --> 4:00:22.480
 Right. Because I do, like I, I like, I like meat. I think it's delicious. I, I,

4:00:22.480 --> 4:00:28.680
 We're dependent on the, not just on the, the nutrients and the taste. We're also dependent

4:00:28.680 --> 4:00:32.920
 on the cost. A lot of people have gotten used to a particular kind of cost that they pay

4:00:32.920 --> 4:00:39.480
 for meat. Right. But I think if you wiped out all the government subsidies, it would

4:00:39.480 --> 4:00:45.120
 be a completely different story because why, why are vegetables so expensive and all the

4:00:45.120 --> 4:00:46.120
 subsidies.

4:00:46.120 --> 4:00:51.120
 Some tomatoes yesterday. I'm, I'm, I'm protesting. Why is salad so expensive?

4:00:51.120 --> 4:00:59.080
 Right. But none of the, the, if you, if you look at the subsidies that are given to the,

4:00:59.080 --> 4:01:05.680
 all the inputs to the meat industry, like the grain and soy and whatnot. And then to

4:01:05.680 --> 4:01:09.360
 the meat and dairy industries and all the subsidies that prop up those industries and

4:01:09.360 --> 4:01:15.880
 allow those products to be cheap and, and sustainable from a business perspective, not

4:01:15.880 --> 4:01:22.200
 environmental. It's government subsidies. So what if we took all that away? And then

4:01:22.200 --> 4:01:30.960
 also what if we gave that to, you know, the, the kale and hemp and fresh greens farmers

4:01:30.960 --> 4:01:37.960
 then, and made those foods more affordable and then had meat reflect its actual true

4:01:37.960 --> 4:01:44.240
 cost, then, you know, then people would just eat more vegetables and less meat because

4:01:44.240 --> 4:01:45.760
 of the cost.

4:01:45.760 --> 4:01:50.280
 You mentioned that you crossed off one item from your list. I forget what the item was,

4:01:50.280 --> 4:01:51.280
 but

4:01:51.280 --> 4:01:56.000
 Oh, it was, I had previously thought that I would want to go to Vegas one day just to

4:01:56.000 --> 4:02:00.640
 cross that off my list. And it's not like I was like, Oh, one day I want to go to Vegas.

4:02:00.640 --> 4:02:05.880
 It was just like, I imagined I would only go there once just to see it and then be done

4:02:05.880 --> 4:02:06.880
 with it.

4:02:06.880 --> 4:02:13.080
 Yeah. Yeah. That's a good one. That's a good one. And I still think you can do it because

4:02:13.080 --> 4:02:18.040
 there's a particular Vegas experience that's worth having. And there's maybe a couple of

4:02:18.040 --> 4:02:19.680
 Vegas experiences that are worth having.

4:02:19.680 --> 4:02:25.200
 I find casinos horribly depressing because I think they're just predatory. Everything

4:02:25.200 --> 4:02:26.200
 about them is predatory.

4:02:26.200 --> 4:02:29.400
 It's not, it's not, it's not the casinos that are important. It's the people.

4:02:29.400 --> 4:02:31.920
 The culture and the whole crazy atmosphere.

4:02:31.920 --> 4:02:38.520
 The people you meet, the people you meet in the chaos that is Las Vegas can create a memorable

4:02:38.520 --> 4:02:46.400
 experience. You lose track of what is, what is day, what is night. You can get drunk and

4:02:46.400 --> 4:02:52.200
 make all the mistakes that somehow create a beautiful masterpiece at the end of it. That's

4:02:52.200 --> 4:02:53.200
 for another time.

4:02:53.200 --> 4:02:57.360
 What else is on the bucket list? What items on the bucket list you haven't done yet? You

4:02:57.360 --> 4:03:04.280
 really, really would like. We talked about mortality, that, that there's a finite deadline.

4:03:04.280 --> 4:03:07.520
 What pops in your head is something that you want to still do.

4:03:07.520 --> 4:03:11.480
 What I want is to not die and owe people money. So.

4:03:11.480 --> 4:03:13.480
 So whatever mistakes you make.

4:03:13.480 --> 4:03:22.200
 I want to, I want to live to write those things. And I also felt really strongly about my,

4:03:22.200 --> 4:03:35.200
 what I, what I and everybody in the business had built. And so a big part of me wants to

4:03:35.200 --> 4:03:40.680
 resurrect the brand. Because when I, I felt really strongly about it, like I had that

4:03:40.680 --> 4:03:46.960
 feeling that this was, this was going to be a thing that I, I wanted to build and grow

4:03:46.960 --> 4:03:51.040
 and could have a really positive impact and now it lasts me. And.

4:03:51.040 --> 4:03:54.440
 Would you bring it back as the same name?

4:03:54.440 --> 4:03:59.800
 Yeah. Well, I, I put the logo on my arm. That's kind of how strongly I felt about it. And

4:03:59.800 --> 4:04:06.280
 so when I did that, and, and around that time and all of that time, I felt really, really

4:04:06.280 --> 4:04:20.200
 strongly that quietly, because it feels like a little bit bold, but quietly felt really

4:04:20.200 --> 4:04:23.800
 almost with a certainty that it was going to be something really big and it was growing

4:04:23.800 --> 4:04:29.200
 and growing and all signs were pointing towards there. I was just sort of stalled and couldn't

4:04:29.200 --> 4:04:33.480
 figure out the logistics and then enter Mr. Fox.

4:04:33.480 --> 4:04:45.400
 So the universe can be quite absurdly cruel at times, but yeah, but that, that is something

4:04:45.400 --> 4:04:50.600
 that's something worth reaching for is repay the debts of the past.

4:04:50.600 --> 4:04:57.080
 And then people have said to me that Leon achieved some kind of immortality via being

4:04:57.080 --> 4:05:02.480
 in the documentary. And then I might, I don't understand this world at all, but I might

4:05:02.480 --> 4:05:10.600
 do like an NFT thing related to Leon's image, which would be another way of kind of immortalizing

4:05:10.600 --> 4:05:13.720
 his image at least.

4:05:13.720 --> 4:05:21.640
 But that's a, I mean, it's a potentially in progress, kind of a crazy leap.

4:05:21.640 --> 4:05:27.160
 And potentially relaunching the restaurant.

4:05:27.160 --> 4:05:31.720
 Possibly yes. There's the restaurant and there's one lucky duck in that brand and they're

4:05:31.720 --> 4:05:40.040
 sort of separate, but related. And they could each exist independently. I liked it better

4:05:40.040 --> 4:05:44.560
 when they existed together because I felt like they were very complimentary in a lot

4:05:44.560 --> 4:05:49.440
 of ways and they made sense together, but either one could be done separately without

4:05:49.440 --> 4:05:50.440
 the other.

4:05:50.440 --> 4:05:59.640
 Do you think you will find love again, given the chaos you had to go through?

4:05:59.640 --> 4:06:04.240
 I have, and I never talk about it. I've never talked about it.

4:06:04.240 --> 4:06:06.240
 You have found love again?

4:06:06.240 --> 4:06:15.280
 Yes, but also in a kind of possibly doomed temporary way, which...

4:06:15.280 --> 4:06:17.600
 You don't like it simple, do you?

4:06:17.600 --> 4:06:22.240
 It's not that it's not simple. It's actually quite simple. It's just that, again, there's

4:06:22.240 --> 4:06:29.160
 a large age gap. I am the older one, which in itself isn't a problem. Because again,

4:06:29.160 --> 4:06:36.640
 I wouldn't want to... If somebody wanted kids in a family, I wouldn't want to hold them

4:06:36.640 --> 4:06:45.880
 back from that. So if I wanted to be with somebody who wanted those things, even if

4:06:45.880 --> 4:06:54.160
 I was completely in love with somebody, I would have to kind of hurt, endure the pain

4:06:54.160 --> 4:06:59.000
 to be like, no, I'm going to keep you from those things, so you should go do those things.

4:06:59.000 --> 4:07:03.720
 So that's the source of the temporariness?

4:07:03.720 --> 4:07:15.880
 No. It's a bit related to logistics and living one place and having extremely different lifestyles.

4:07:15.880 --> 4:07:17.520
 Is this a prince of some sort?

4:07:17.520 --> 4:07:18.520
 No.

4:07:18.520 --> 4:07:21.160
 Does he have a castle?

4:07:21.160 --> 4:07:22.160
 No.

4:07:22.160 --> 4:07:24.360
 Okay. All right.

4:07:24.360 --> 4:07:25.360
 No, no.

4:07:25.360 --> 4:07:29.840
 Are you going to say who it is or we're going to keep that a mystery?

4:07:29.840 --> 4:07:37.480
 On the one hand, I feel like it's protective for me to talk about it in some ways. But

4:07:37.480 --> 4:07:46.000
 I also worry because very often I avoid saying anything because for a lot of reasons, but

4:07:46.000 --> 4:07:49.840
 one being that people freak out and just assume that I'm going to step into something horrible

4:07:49.840 --> 4:07:58.120
 again because I did step into something horribly destructive again after Mr. Fox. And what happened

4:07:58.120 --> 4:08:03.080
 was I allowed something to happen. And so going back to that, what advice would you

4:08:03.080 --> 4:08:09.160
 give to people? I would tell people to be very careful to be deliberate about who they're

4:08:09.160 --> 4:08:14.600
 getting involved with and thoughtful about it and making sure that they're not just allowing

4:08:14.600 --> 4:08:25.680
 something to happen. And I suppose women can be as well, but people can be very persistent.

4:08:25.680 --> 4:08:29.080
 Sometimes that's a good thing, but it could also be a dangerous thing because sometimes

4:08:29.080 --> 4:08:32.000
 somebody might just, and this has happened to me a lot, where somebody just wears you

4:08:32.000 --> 4:08:37.720
 down and you're like, oh, fine, you know.

4:08:37.720 --> 4:08:38.720
 That's funny.

4:08:38.720 --> 4:08:39.720
 Yeah.

4:08:39.720 --> 4:08:45.400
 I mean, it's shockingly like the things that I have done in the spirit of like, or not

4:08:45.400 --> 4:08:47.720
 wanting to hurt somebody's feelings. That's another dangerous thing.

4:08:47.720 --> 4:08:50.440
 It's just to be nice. Let's get married just to be nice.

4:08:50.440 --> 4:08:55.060
 That's another dangerous thing. And also, I feel like I'm circling back to all these

4:08:55.060 --> 4:09:03.320
 unanswered questions from before, but I didn't marry. I married him. He convinced me to marry

4:09:03.320 --> 4:09:08.440
 him in this very quick, annoying way. And as if it was like something I had to do and

4:09:08.440 --> 4:09:15.400
 I'd be protected and all kinds of weird reasons. And it was just like my response to my agreeing

4:09:15.400 --> 4:09:23.360
 to marry him was like, oh, fine. And then I remember being embarrassed at City Hall going

4:09:23.360 --> 4:09:30.680
 to get the license. You know, people who are in love and wanting to get married aren't sitting

4:09:30.680 --> 4:09:37.280
 in City Hall mortified and embarrassed. So I sort of cringe when people call him my ex

4:09:37.280 --> 4:09:42.080
 husband because I don't think of him that way. It's sort of, even though technically

4:09:42.080 --> 4:09:43.080
 that's correct.

4:09:43.080 --> 4:09:48.080
 Yeah, but there's a powerful romantic notion to the thing and do those words and that had

4:09:48.080 --> 4:09:52.040
 nothing to do with you getting married. It was more...

4:09:52.040 --> 4:09:54.200
 It was just like another thing that he made me do.

4:09:54.200 --> 4:09:55.200
 It's like a chore.

4:09:55.200 --> 4:10:00.520
 That's just had, you know, unfortunate consequences of like, then having to get divorced and the

4:10:00.520 --> 4:10:01.520
 whole...

4:10:01.520 --> 4:10:07.600
 Yeah, I think even weddings are romantic, like the whole, the cheesy thing. There's, you

4:10:07.600 --> 4:10:08.600
 know...

4:10:08.600 --> 4:10:09.600
 Yeah, they are.

4:10:09.600 --> 4:10:10.600
 Those are cool.

4:10:10.600 --> 4:10:11.600
 I agree.

4:10:11.600 --> 4:10:17.640
 We don't get many of those in life. Well, you know what? Let's keep it a mystery. Let's

4:10:17.640 --> 4:10:26.800
 keep the person a mystery. To be continued on season two on Conversations with someone.

4:10:26.800 --> 4:10:33.040
 I'm not like a known person or anything, but I feel like people always worry that I'm

4:10:33.040 --> 4:10:37.120
 stepping back into something and I don't have the energy to be sort of defensive and...

4:10:37.120 --> 4:10:38.120
 Should they be worried?

4:10:38.120 --> 4:10:39.120
 No.

4:10:39.120 --> 4:10:40.120
 There you go.

4:10:40.120 --> 4:10:41.120
 Don't worry, friends.

4:10:41.120 --> 4:10:45.440
 No. And also, just remember that thing I was saying about how like it's good if you

4:10:45.440 --> 4:10:48.120
 get to know somebody really slowly over a long period of time.

4:10:48.120 --> 4:10:49.120
 Yeah.

4:10:49.120 --> 4:10:53.320
 It's kind of one of those situations. So I feel very confident that I'm like certain

4:10:53.320 --> 4:10:57.360
 that I'm not stepping into something where I'm going to be surprised and somebody turns

4:10:57.360 --> 4:10:59.560
 out to be not who they presented themselves to be.

4:10:59.560 --> 4:11:02.880
 That's the wise way to do it.

4:11:02.880 --> 4:11:11.120
 Especially for me, yeah. And also, again, it's like I would caution people to be careful

4:11:11.120 --> 4:11:18.120
 about wanting to go into something deliberately versus kind of getting caught up in something

4:11:18.120 --> 4:11:20.320
 or rushed or...

4:11:20.320 --> 4:11:27.760
 Like I said, I would suggest people take that cautionary advice, but sometimes you just fall

4:11:27.760 --> 4:11:28.760
 in love.

4:11:28.760 --> 4:11:29.760
 Yeah.

4:11:29.760 --> 4:11:31.240
 Love at first sight is the thing.

4:11:31.240 --> 4:11:36.960
 There are those stories of sweet stories of older people that I don't have to be sweet.

4:11:36.960 --> 4:11:44.280
 You can get hurt for it too, but don't listen to your heart.

4:11:44.280 --> 4:11:49.440
 This was an incredible conversation. We talked for way over four hours.

4:11:49.440 --> 4:11:50.440
 We did?

4:11:50.440 --> 4:11:56.160
 Yeah. And I feel like I can keep talking to you. This was amazing. Salman, thank you

4:11:56.160 --> 4:12:04.040
 so much for being honest, for being fearless in answering all the questions, all the difficult

4:12:04.040 --> 4:12:14.240
 questions. And thank you for trying to create something special with your restaurant and

4:12:14.240 --> 4:12:16.880
 maybe create something special still in your future.

4:12:16.880 --> 4:12:17.880
 Yeah.

4:12:17.880 --> 4:12:25.000
 Yeah. So thank you for having me. I kept thinking that I was going to get a message that was

4:12:25.000 --> 4:12:31.200
 like, just kidding. I've listened to your podcast a lot. And so I've certainly felt

4:12:31.200 --> 4:12:37.160
 very intimidated knowing who's sat, if not in this actual chair, in this chair in another

4:12:37.160 --> 4:12:39.280
 location or maybe here.

4:12:39.280 --> 4:12:41.600
 Are you nervous?

4:12:41.600 --> 4:12:42.600
 Yes.

4:12:42.600 --> 4:12:45.600
 Yeah, I was nervous too.

4:12:45.600 --> 4:12:51.080
 Yeah. But at the same, but also because I've, because I know the way that you speak and

4:12:51.080 --> 4:12:55.720
 your style, I felt like it was going to feel like a good natural conversation as opposed

4:12:55.720 --> 4:12:59.840
 to sometimes you have conversations where it's like, anyway.

4:12:59.840 --> 4:13:00.840
 It felt good.

4:13:00.840 --> 4:13:05.640
 I didn't feel nervous because of what I was walking into. I felt nervous that I was going

4:13:05.640 --> 4:13:11.160
 to sound stupid and boring and everybody would be like, why did he interview her?

4:13:11.160 --> 4:13:12.160
 It was not.

4:13:12.160 --> 4:13:15.480
 It was exciting. You happy with it? How do we do?

4:13:15.480 --> 4:13:19.400
 Yeah, I think so. Very often after...

4:13:19.400 --> 4:13:21.640
 Are you self critical after stuff?

4:13:21.640 --> 4:13:22.640
 Yes.

4:13:22.640 --> 4:13:28.040
 When you go home tonight, are you going to be like happy with yourself or not?

4:13:28.040 --> 4:13:32.440
 I mean, I feel good. I don't feel like I can't think of anything that I said that I regret.

4:13:32.440 --> 4:13:36.040
 Maybe there's things that, you know, somebody's going to yell at me because I said something

4:13:36.040 --> 4:13:40.760
 that I said, like, meat tastes good or something. Or I don't, you know, like this, like vegan

4:13:40.760 --> 4:13:41.760
 judgment.

4:13:41.760 --> 4:13:42.760
 Yes.

4:13:42.760 --> 4:13:43.760
 Yes.

4:13:43.760 --> 4:13:49.600
 But I think it's more useful to be honest about the contradictions and conflicting feelings

4:13:49.600 --> 4:13:54.880
 because I feel like that's what most people have. And so if you want to help people shift

4:13:54.880 --> 4:13:55.880
 a certain way.

4:13:55.880 --> 4:14:02.320
 Yeah, you were raw, honest. It was beautiful. It was beautiful to watch. Thank you for the

4:14:02.320 --> 4:14:05.160
 books.

4:14:05.160 --> 4:14:13.320
 Your darkness today was visible, but the beauty too. It was an amazing conversation. I'm really,

4:14:13.320 --> 4:14:16.400
 really happy with it. I'm honored that you sit down with me. That was awesome.

4:14:16.400 --> 4:14:22.360
 I'm floored that you're honored and I'm honored that you asked me to be here. So...

4:14:22.360 --> 4:14:25.360
 Thank you, Sarma.

4:14:25.360 --> 4:14:29.640
 Thanks for listening to this conversation with Sarma Melancholis. To support this podcast,

4:14:29.640 --> 4:14:34.560
 please check out our sponsors in the description. And now let me leave you with some words from

4:14:34.560 --> 4:14:40.920
 playwright August Wilson, confront the dark parts of yourself and work to banish them

4:14:40.920 --> 4:14:46.560
 with illumination and forgiveness. Your willingness to wrestle with your demons will cause your

4:14:46.560 --> 4:14:49.160
 angels to sing.

4:14:49.160 --> 4:15:13.160
 Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
